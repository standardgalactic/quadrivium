P R E FAC E
Graphic Design Solutions remains the most comprehensive how-to 
reference on graphic design and advertising for print and interactive 
media, intended to serve as a foundation for a graphic design and 
advertising design education. Theory and applications are stressed 
with an instructive approach. Known for its thorough treatment 
of theory and major graphic design applications, this text provides 
hundreds of signiﬁ cant design solutions, which are models of excel-
lence. The more ﬁ ne examples students see, the better students can 
understand what constitutes effective, creative solutions; outstand-
ing work should imprint on students.
A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR 
Every semester, I want to hand over—all at once—everything I 
know about graphic design and advertising to my students so they 
can immediately start creating effective solutions. That desire has 
propelled me to present the information in this book as clearly, 
fully, and succinctly as possible—to offer a complete graphic design 
foundation.
I have written Graphic Design Solutions to serve as a guide for 
my students, to support my own teaching, and hopefully you will 
ﬁ nd it helpful, as well. Teaching graphic design and advertising is 
very challenging. Much is taught simultaneously—critical and cre-
ative thinking, principles, theory, strategy, conceptual design, design 
development, technique, visualization, composition, social responsi-
bility, and applications. In order to design, students must be critical 
and creative thinkers, learning to express and represent their cre-
ative ideas; that is why this book addresses conceptual and creative 
thinking as fully as it addresses visualization, composition, and the 
requirements of speciﬁ c applications, such as posters or websites. 
(For competencies expected from designers, see the AIGA survey 
entitled “Designer of 2015 Competencies,” http://www.aiga.org/
content.cfm/designer-of-2015-competencies.)
ORGANIZATION
We begin this study with an historical perspective, in order to view 
contemporary thinking in perspective; an instructor can start there, 
or use the history as a reference throughout the course of study. 
Part I: Fundamentals of Graphic Design provides a very substantial 
foundation for discussion of speciﬁ c applications. For some readers, 
these chapters may be the only introduction to visual communication 
they receive; therefore, I tried to make it as full of vital information 
as possible including: an introduction examining the visual com-
munication profession; comprehensive coverage of two-dimensional 
design concepts; typography; creativity and concept development; 
the design process; visualization; and composition. Part II: Applica-
tions is an in-depth examination of major graphic design and adver-
tising applications. The chapters are easily used in any order that is 
appropriate for the reader or best suits the educator. Each chapter 
provides substantial background information about how the appli-
cation is used and how to create an application, including exercises 
and projects. Also included are sidebars with suggestions, tips, and 
important design considerations. Some chapters are much longer 
than others due to the role they play in most curricula.
As some educators have mentioned to me, this book covers an 
enormous amount of information. What I have done is allow for at 
least three scenarios:
› Instructors may pick and choose what to teach, whether it is con-
tent areas, applications, or the number of projects.
› Instructors may choose to use this book in several courses (there is 
plenty of information to carry over for several courses or semesters).
› This book is a keeper—most students and designers use this book 
as a reference and resource owing to the abundance of information, 
historic time line, great examples by venerated designers, and brain-
storming techniques.
The last chapter (now available online with links to resources 
including video advice from many top designers) describes putting 
together a portfolio and the job search. At the end of the book are 
the glossary to help with terminology, a selected bibliography to 
encourage further reading, and two extensive indexes—one regard-
ing all subject matter and another referencing all the agencies, cli-
ents, creative professionals, and studios mentioned in this book.
Additional material and resources (including many exercises 
and projects) appear online at no extra cost. This material is noted 
throughout the book by an icon 
.
LOOKING AT THE ILLUSTR ATIONS
Unlike a design periodical that showcases the most recent work, the 
illustrations in this book were chosen as classic examples that would 
Preface

/. xii
Graphic Design  SOLUTIONS
endure. The illustrations also were chosen to represent different 
approaches and schools of thought. Every illustration in this book is 
excellent and was selected with great thought to providing the best 
possible examples of effective and creative work.
Anyone can learn an enormous amount by analyzing graphic 
design solutions. Whether you dissect the work of peers, examine the 
examples of work in this text, closely observe an instructor’s demon-
strations, or analyze professional work, you will enhance your learn-
ing by asking how and why others did what they did. The examples 
provided in this text are just that—examples. There are innumerable 
solutions to any exercise or project. Any visual communication is 
measured in terms of the degree of success demonstrated in problem 
solving, communicating, applying visual skills, and creativity within 
those constraints.
NEW TO THIS EDITION
The majority of the illustrative examples in Graphic Design Solutions
are new to this edition, providing numerous and varied examples 
for study. The Fourth Edition contains a new chapter, Creativity 
and the Graphic Design Process (Chapter 4), providing the tools to 
stimulate creative thinking and for brainstorming, as well as creativ-
ity exercises to prompt and support conceptualization. The Fourth 
Edition also provides increased coverage in a new chapter on visu-
alization (Chapter 5) including: understanding images, approaches, 
methods, and media for visualizing design concepts. Discussions 
have been expanded on composition (Chapter 6) to offer a wide 
range of theories and points of view, publication design (Chapter 
8), corporate communication: brochures, annual reports, and more 
(Chapter 12), and web design, motion and screened-based media 
(Chapter 14). This edition also has a more in-depth coverage of 
the ﬁ ve steps of the design process, a thorough guide to key graphic 
design and advertising applications for print and interactive media, 
pointers on information gathering, methods for concept generation, 
an overview of the visual communication profession, and new exer-
cises and projects at the end of each chapter and on the web.
Also in this new edition:
› More on creative thinking
› Numerous brainstorming techniques
› Conceptual thinking and concept development
› Many new diagrams
› Brochure design coverage
› Publication design: covers and interiors
› New essays, showcases, and case studies
› Preliminary sketches of designers’ works
› Alternative solutions to the printed piece
› Integrated ad campaigns
› Storytelling
› More on interactive design
› Expanded coverage of time and motion
› More information on the grid, including diagrams
› New contemporary and additional historical illustrations
FROM THE FIELD
The most highly regarded design professionals today provide insights 
and examples in high-interest boxes, including Essays and Before & 
After (showing before and after images such as Ocean Spray Juices/
Wallace Church, Chapter 11). An essay “From Start to Finish” by 
Dave Mason, SamataMason, walks the reader through the step-by-
step process of a project (Chapter 4). Case Studies throughout the 
book examine the design process including Seed Media Group/Sag-
meister Inc. (Chapter 4), Nickelodeon/AdamsMorioka (Chapter 9), 
Saks Fifth Avenue/Michael Bierut/Pentagram (Chapter 10), and 
Nokia Urbanista Diaries/R/GA (Chapter 14).

A B O U T  T H E  AU T H O R
Robin Landa holds the title of Distinguished Professor in the Rob-
ert Busch School of Design at Kean University of New Jersey. She 
is included among the teachers that the Carnegie Foundation for 
the Advancement of Teaching calls the “great teachers of our time.” 
Most recently, Landa was a ﬁ nalist in the Wall Street Journal’s Cre-
ative Leaders competition.
Landa has won many awards for design, writing, teaching, and 
creative leadership, including: National Society of Arts and Letters, 
The National League of Pen Women, New Jersey Authors Award, 
Creativity, Graphic Design USA, Art Directors Club of New Jer-
sey, The Presidential Excellence Award in Scholarship from Kean 
University, and the Rowan University Award for Contribution to 
Design Education.
Landa is the author of twelve published books about graphic design, 
branding, advertising, and creativity including Advertising by Design
(John Wiley & Sons) and Designing Brand Experiences (Cengage 
Learning). Her books have been translated into Chinese and Spanish.
Co-authoring with her colleague Professor Rose Gonnella, she 
wrote Visual Workout Creativity Workbook (Cengage Learning); and 
co-authored 2D: Visual Basics for Designers with Gonnella and award-
winning designer Steven Brower. Known for her expertise in creativ-
ity, Landa penned Thinking Creatively (HOW), and co-authored 
Creative Jolt and Creative Jolt Inspirations (North Light Books) with 
Rose Gonnella and Denise M. Anderson. Landa’s article on ethics 
in design, “No Exit for Designers,” was featured in Print magazine’s 
European Design Annual/Cold Eye column; other articles have 
been featured in HOW magazine, Step Inside Design, Critique, and 
Icograda. Landa’s Amazon Shorts—“Advertising: 11 Insights from 
Creative Directors” and “Branding: 10 Truths Behind Successful 
Brands”—both reached the #1 spot on the Shorts best-seller list.
Landa has lectured across the country at the HOW International 
Design Conferences, Graphic Artists Guild conference, College Art 
Association, Thinking Creatively conference, Art Directors Club of 
New Jersey, and the One Club Education Summit. She has been 
interviewed on radio, television, in print, and the World Wide Web 
on the subjects of design, creativity, and art.
In addition, working with Mike Sickinger at Lava Dome Cre-
ative (http://www.lavadomecreative.com) in New Jersey, Landa is a 
brand strategist, designer, copywriter, and storyteller; and she is the 
creative director of her own ﬁ rm, robinlanda.com. She has worked 
closely with marketing executives and their companies and orga-
nizations to develop brand strategy, enhance corporate creativity 
through seminars, and develop brand stories. With the keen ability 
to connect the seeming unconnected, Landa uses her research and 
writing to support her professional practice.

The study of graphic design and art history 
helps us better understand how we arrived at the 
present, how we came to be as we are. Peter N. 
Stearns, Professor of History at George Mason 
University, says: “The past causes the present, and 
so the future.”1
A comprehensive study of graphic design his-
tory is a requirement for any aspiring designer 
or anyone interested in understanding images; 
Meggs’ History of Graphic Design by Philip B. 
Meggs and Alston W. Purvis is standard reading; 
Graphic Style: From Victorian to Digital by Steven 
Heller and Seymour Chwast and Graphic Design 
Time Line: A Century of Design Milestones by Ste-
ven Heller and Elinor Pettit offer time line for-
mat support. A full study of ﬁ ne art history and 
modern art is critical, too; Gardner’s Art through 
the Ages is a comprehensive study.
Any serious study also includes design the-
ory, criticism, understanding images, persuasion,
world history, and related topics. As with any-
thing temporal, the history of graphic design 
and advertising is a product of its time—of the 
economy, politics, the arts, philosophy, culture, 
and society. Graphic design is always affected 
by small and large human events and factors, 
such as war, culture, sub-culture, cultural unrest, 
economic turbulence, music, media, and more. 
Graphic design and advertising, in turn, affect 
culture, music, media, and more.

ESSAY
S T E V E N  B R O W E R ,  G R A P H I C  D E S I G N  T I M E  L I N E
The history of design, like any history, is completely 
malleable. With no hard start date, we have to make 
choices. Should we begin with the cave paintings of 
Lascaux, Chinese moveable type, the Trajan col-
umn, or Gutenberg? Our history is the history of 
human communication, so where to begin?
For our purposes, we begin in the modern era, 
in the late nineteenth century. The advent of 
improved travel to Asia brought sailors onto the 
streets of Paris and London, weighted down with 
Japanese prints in their knapsacks. The inﬂ uence 
of these Japanese artists on their European coun-
terparts was profound. An organic sense of form 
based on nature, reﬁ ned ornamental borders, and 
elegant composition became the rage. Combined 
with reﬁ ned printing processes, Art Nouveau was 
indeed the new art.
This style spread quickly. The Arts & Crafts 
movement in England, Jugendstil (Youth Style) 
in Germany, and Glasgow Style with versions in 
Belgium and the United States––the basic ele-
ments were reinvented by each culture, which 
added their own twist. In Austria it was taken a 
step further with the Vienna Succession, a group 
dedicated to creating a new visual language.
In the early 1900s, the shot heard round the 
world would be in Germany. Lucian Bernhard 
was ﬁ fteen years old when he visited the Munich 
Flaspalast Exhibition of Interior Design. So 
moved by the forms and colors he had witnessed, 
he returned to his parents’ house while his father 
was away on a business trip, and painted every 
wall and piece of furniture in these bold new col-
ors. When his father returned, he was so outraged 
that Lucian left home, permanently.
Stranded in Berlin, he entered a contest spon-
sored by Priester Match to create a poster adver-
tising their wares. He painted a composition that 
included matches on a tablecloth, along with an 
ashtray containing a lit cigar, and dancing girls in 
the background. Dissatisﬁ ed, he painted out the 
dancing girls. Feeling it was still not working, he 
deleted the ashtray. The tablecloth was next to go. 
There remained the singular word “Priester” and 
two matches, on a brown background, along with 
a discrete signature. The birth of the object poster 
was born, preﬁ guring the Ludwig Mies van der 
Rohe “less is more” philosophy.
Soon the Russian Revolution was under way, 
resulting in an extraordinary (albeit short-lived) 
amount of creative freedom for artists such as El 
Lissitzky, Rodchenko, and Malevich. The Futur-
ists’ typographic experimentation with typography 
in Italy resulted in an inﬂ uence that would outlast 
their movement, halted by World War I. After the 
war, De Stijl in the Netherlands and The Bauhaus 
in Germany would further reﬁ ne the clean mod-
ernist esthetic. Artists such as A. M. Cassandre 
in France would synthesize entire art movements 
such as Cubism, Surrealism, and Art Deco.
With the advent of War World II, many of 
these artists would be forced to emigrate to the 
United States. Their inﬂ uence was profound. 
Just as Japan had inﬂ uenced the Europeans ﬁ fty 
years earlier, thus America was impacted by 
Europe. Lester Beall was one of the ﬁ rst Ameri-
can designers whose work showed strong evi-
dence of this inspiration. Paul Rand and Alvin 
Lustig’s designs, in part, explored the amor-
phous forms of European painters Paul Klee and 
Joan Miró.
In 1954, a group of Cooper Union graduates 
banded together to form Push Pin Studios. Well-
versed in design and illustration history, they drew 
upon existing forms, such as Art Nouveau and Art 
Deco, to create new ones. By combining illustra-
tion and design seamlessly, they ushered in a new 
era, in contrast to the stark Modernist movement 
that had gone before. Their reexamination of the 
Art Nouveau style moved west in the late 1960s, 
combined with the cultural and musical changes 
at the time, and reappeared in the form of Psy-
chedelic posters by the likes of Rick Grifﬁ n and 
Victor Moscoso.
In the mid 1970s and early 1980s, the retro 
approach reached its zenith. The European type 
styling of Louis Fili, Jennifer Morla, and Carin 
Goldberg, and Constructivist type design of Nev-
ille Brody revisited and reinvigorated existing 
forms.
In 1984, Apple Computers released the 
ﬁ rst Macintosh, and the relationship between

technology and design moved forward yet another 
step. Designers such as April Greiman and later 
David Carson took up the call. A myriad of 
new typefaces were displayed in Emigre maga-
zine. Design, type setting, and production were 
fused for the ﬁ rst time. In reaction, hand-lettered 
typography was suddenly manifest.

Today, we are still reeling from the effects of

than ever before, can be the complete masters of

winds up on the page or digital display. The time

THE PROPONENTS of the Arts & Crafts movement continued to 
disseminate information about design. Moving toward the twenti-
eth century, European art was deeply affected by an infl ux of Japa-
nese prints. In turn, European trends and movements infl uenced 
American artists and designers. The Art Nouveau movement, with 
its fl owing organic-like forms, was felt in all the visual arts, from 
Historical Image Time Line (1893–Present)
THIS BRIEF HISTORICAL OVERVIEW of visual communication in the twentieth century is in no way meant to be a substitute for a full study; 
my offering does not include, as any full history would, the infl uences of current events, social climate and issues, inventions, politics, music, 
and art on the topic of visual communication; for example, the social and political climate of World War II had a profound infl uence on 
European and American artists’ and designers’ lives and work.
The goal of this brief time line is to put the information in this book into a broader context. As Brower asks: Should we begin with the 
human and animal representations and signs in the Cave of Lascaux some 16,000 years ago? Does the history of visual communication 
begin in the eleventh century with the invention of moveable type by a man named Bi Sheng in China? Or does graphic design begin with 
its roots in Johannes Gutenberg’s method of printing from movable type in the mid-fi fteenth century? Did graphic design begin with graph-
ics that identifi ed? Instructed? Promoted? Did graphic design begin with the combination of words and images in the fi rst poster? For our 
purposes, we begin in the modern era, in late nineteenth century Europe.
design through architecture. In both Europe and America, there 
were advances in printing technology by the late nineteenth cen-
tury; in France, color lithography signifi cantly advanced by Jules 
Chéret allowed for great color and nuance in poster reproduction. 
Advances in lithography helped give rise to the poster as a visual 
communication vehicle. Toulouse-Lautrec embraced the poster. 
Companies hired Art Nouveau artists, such as Alphonse Mucha, 
to create posters to advertise their products. In England, contro-
versy erupted over the use of Sir John Millais’s painting Bubbles 
in a poster advertising Pears Soap by Thomas Barratt, who built 
Pears Soap into one of the world’s great brands in the nineteenth

art—for his Pears Soap brand.
In 1898, an American advertising agency, N. W. Ayer & Son, opened a 
design department to design their own ads. An American woman, Ethel 
Reed, became a noted graphic designer and illustrator. William H. Brad-
ley, an important American designer infl uenced by the British Arts & Crafts 
movement and Art Nouveau, designed a series of covers for The Chap Book, 
which became an important disseminator of style.

a leading member. Kandinsky is credited with the fi rst nonobjec-
tive painting and was a great infl uence on modern art. In France, 
major artists Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso (born in Spain) cre-
ated rippling, everlasting effects in all the visual arts.
A very noteworthy infl uence (still to this day) on typography was 
the Italian Futurists’ challenge to grammatical and typographic 
conventions; they saw typography as a way to “redouble the force 
of expressive words.” Similarly, Dadaists used type and image as 
AT THE BEGINNING of the twentieth century, milestones in graphic 
design history occurred. Principles of grid composition were taught 
in Germany, and we saw the birth of pictorial modernism.
In graphic design, the watershed work of architect/designer Peter 
Behrens exemplifi es the relationship between design and industry. 
Behrens sought a “modern” visual language to express the age of 
mass production. In 1907, Peter Behrens designed what might 
be thought of as the fi rst corporate identity for A.E.G., a German 
electrical manufacturing corporation.
Milestone: in 1919, Walter Gropius founded the Weimar Bauhaus 
in Germany. This highly infl uential design school, whose philosophy 
laid the foundation for much of modern thinking about architecture 
and design, attempted to bridge art and industry—the machine 
age—with an emphasis on rationality. Students at the Bauhaus 
school studied with luminaries including Wassily Kandinsky, Paul 
Klee, and Lyonel Feininger. In 1919, Johannes Itten started teach-
ing the vorkurs—the preparatory course, which would become an 
integral part of the curriculum, developed and expanded by other 
luminaries such as László Moholy-Nagy and Josef Albers.
In fi ne art, this time period was enormously creative. Two groups of 
German painters formed art philosophies: Die Brücke (The Bridge) 
with Ernst Ludwig Kirchner as a leading proponent, and Der Blaue 
Reiter (The Blue Rider) with Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky as

FINE ART MOVEMENTS—Cubism, Futurism, De Stijl, Constructiv-
ism, Dadaism, Surrealism—greatly affected design and advertis-
ing. Picasso’s work continued to have a powerful effect on the 
visual arts. Art Deco, the popular geometric style of the 1920s, 
was signifi cantly manifested in all the visual arts.
Many graphic designers absorbed these artistic movements, cre-
ating a popular visual aesthetic. For example, A. M. Cassandre, a 
renowned poster designer, created a visual language clearly infl u-
enced by Cubism and brought it to the greater public via poster 
design. His success in both typeface design and poster design 
established him as a purveyor of style.
In 1921, a group of Russian artists led by Constructivists Vladimir 
Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko rejected “art for art’s sake,” to 
pursue the duty of artist as citizen. They viewed visual commu-
nication, industrial design, and the applied arts as mediums that 
could best serve their ideals and ideas for society.
In 1924, Surrealism, with the publication of the Manifesto of Surreal-
ism by critic and poet André Breton, becomes an intellectual force.
Also greatly infl uenced by the Cubism, Futurism, and Art Deco 
movements, American graphic designer E. McKnight Kauffer cre-
ated a body of work, including 141 posters for the London Under-
ground as well as others for major corporations, that would carry 
fi ne art forms to the general viewing public. American advertising 
refl ected designers’ great interest in Modernism and European art 
ideas, as well; for example, the work of Charles Coiner for the
N. W. Ayer agency refl ected an avant-garde infl uence. In an 
attempt to visually express their dynamic modern age, both artists 
and designers are highly concerned with the relationship between 
form and function.

the 1930s, designers such as Lester Beall, William Golden, Alvin 
Lustig, Paul Rand, Bradbury Thompson, and émigrés Mehemed 
Fehmy Agha (born in the Ukraine, immigrated to the United States 
in 1929), Alexey Brodovitch (Russian-born, immigrated in 1930), 
Will Burtin (German-born, immigrated in 1938), Leo Lionni (Dutch-
born, immigrated in 1939), Herbert Matter (Swiss-born, moved to 
New York in 1936), Ladislav Sutnar (Czech-born, traveled to United 
States in 1939 and stayed), and one woman—Cipe Pineles (born 
in Austria)—were pioneering visual ideas in the United States. 
Boldly testing the limits of contemporary editorial design, experi-
mental page layout, shape relationships, color, and photographic 
reproduction, these designers created visual masterpieces.
The 1930s was a tragic and turbulent time for artists and designers 
in Europe. Many fl ed the Nazis and immigrated to America, includ-
ing esteemed Bauhaus members Mies van der Rohe, Josef Albers, 
László Moholy-Nagy, and Walter Gropius. Their subsequent presence 
in America would have a profound infl uence on design, architecture, 
and art. Many American-born designers also became important 
design pioneers, including Lester Beall. Beall’s convincing posters 
for America’s Rural Electrifi cation Administration have his distinc-
tive imprint, and yet are infl uenced by European modernism.
A seminal American designer, Paul Rand, started his distinguished 
career in 1935 as the art director of Esquire and Apparel Arts mag-
azines; he also designed covers for Direction, a cultural journal,

IN 1939, World War II began. Many artists and designers were 
called into active duty; others, including Ben Shahn, E. McKnight 
Kauffer, Joseph Binder, and Abram Games, used their great tal-
ents to create posters to disseminate public information, support 
the war effort, pump up morale, and create anti-Nazi vehicles. In 
England, The British Ministry of Information recruited available pre-
eminent designers to this cause.
At this time, many designers were embracing Surrealism and mak-
ing it their own visual language, using photomontage and bold 
typography to create stirring war posters. One such designer was 
German graphic artist John Heartfi eld, whose strong antiwar work 
satirized the Nazi party.
What would eventually become The Advertising Council, a public 
service advertising organization, began in 1942 as the War Adver-
tising Council; it was organized to help prepare voluntary advertis-
ing campaigns for wartime efforts.
In Italy, the Olivetti Corporation hired Giovanni Pintori, who con-
tributed enormously to Italian design. Pintori’s vision, drawing on 
Futurist visual forms, manifested itself in corporate identity design 
and advertising.
In the United States during the 1940s and 1950s, Abstract Expres-
sionism was the primary artistic movement (overshadowing any rep-
resentational artists), with leading artists such as Jackson Pollack, 
Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Mark Rothko. In the post–World 
War II years, New York City became the art capital of the world.

The most successful advertising recruitment campaign in American 
history, this powerful symbol recruited two million women into the 
workforce to support the war economy. The underlying theme was 
that the social change required to bring women into the workforce 
was a patriotic responsibility for women and employers. Those ads 
made a tremendous change in the relationship between women and 
the workplace. Employment outside of the home became socially 
acceptable and even desirable.

Visual identity became gospel at corporations with in-house design-
ers such as William Golden and Lou Dorfsman at CBS, and Giovanni 
Pintori at Olivetti. Corporations began to rely on designers to create 
visual identities that would differentiate them within a competitive 
marketplace. Designers such as Paul Rand created visual identities 
for IBM, Westinghouse, and ABC.

THE INTERNATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC STYLE, or Swiss design, played 
a pivotal role in design with an emphasis on clear communication 
and grid construction, with Max Bill and Ernst Keller as major pro-
ponents. In 1959, the movement became a unifi ed international 
one, disseminating ideas in a journal, New Graphic Design; the 
editors included Josef Müller-Brockmann, Richard P. Lohse, Carlo 
L. Vivarelli, and Hans Neuburg.
In America, seminal designers such as Paul Rand, William Golden, 
Lou Dorfsman, Saul Bass, Bradbury Thompson, George Tscherny, 
Ivan Chermayeff, Tom Geismar, Cipe Pineles, Otto Storch, and 
Henry Wolf created watershed work. Saul Bass’s movie titles and 
fi lm promotions set new standards for motion graphics and pro-
motional design.
Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) rocked the advertising world with 
their Volkswagen campaign and began a creative revolution in 
advertising, with art directors such as Bob Gage, Bill Taupin, and 
Helmut Krone. Bill Bernbach teamed art directors and copywriters 
to generate creative ideas to drive their advertising. DDB didn’t 
use a hard sell—it set a new creative standard that winked at the 
consumer with greater respect.

CORPORATE IDENTITY DESIGN grows in importance with work by 
Lester Beall for International Paper Company, and design fi rms 
such as Chermayeff & Geismar creating programs for Mobil and 
the Chase Manhattan Bank; Saul Bass for AT&T, Continental Air-
lines, and the Girl Scouts; and Massimo Vignelli and the Unimark 
offi ce for Knoll.
In advertising, Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) continued to be the 
force behind creative advertising. Employed at DDB were some of 
the most brilliantly creative art directors and writers of the twen-
tieth century, such as Bob Gage, Helmut Krone, George Lois, Mary 
Wells Lawrence, Phyllis K. Robinson, and Julian Koenig. Some of 
these creatives, such as Lois, Koenig, and Wells Lawrence, left 
DDB to open their own creative agencies.
American graphic designers, including the Push Pin Studios, Saul 
Bass, and Herb Lubalin, redefi ned American graphic design—
especially typography and the relationship of type with image—
thereby infl uencing generations.
The poster was an extremely popular application in the 1960s, 
with great work from Gunter Rambow in Germany, Wes Wilson in 
California, and Victor Moscoso in California. George Lois’s covers 
for Esquire magazine raised the bar of cover design, provoking and 
jarring readers to stop and think.
Representational art made a comeback with the Pop Art move-
ment—a movement drawing upon imagery from popular culture—
with leading artists Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Robert 
Indiana. The Pop movement (infl uenced by commercial art), ironi-
cally, was clearly felt in graphic design and challenged the conven-
tions of Modernist thinking. Push Pin Studios in New York and the 
Haight-Ashbury music scene designers in San Francisco rocked 
Modernism’s structural boat. Wolfgang Weingart was at the fore-
front of those slowly challenging Modernism’s core.

SOME CRITICS SEE THE 1970S as the end of Modernism and the 
beginning of Postmodernist thinking, especially with the typo-
graphic directions taken by designers such as Wolfgang Weingart, 
April Greiman, Willi Kunz, and Dan Friedman leading the way.
In the 1970s, it became perfectly clear to clients and corporations 
that it was design and advertising that was going to distinguish 
their goods and services in a highly competitive international 
marketplace.

IN 1984, APPLE COMPUTER introduced the Macintosh computer, 
which provided graphic designers with the most signifi cant tool 
since the pencil.
The digital revolution enabled designers to have more creative 
control. Visual communicators could design and generate and lay 
out their own type (thus becoming their own typesetters), more 
easily manipulate imagery (as opposed to using handcrafted pho-
tomontage), imitate visual effects such as airbrushing, very easily 
make changes to layout and color, and substitute hand-lettered 
comps with digitally produced “fi nished-looking” comps, among 
other things.
Termed the Postmodern (or Late Modernist) period, the 1980s 
and 1990s was an eclectic and diverse time as designers experi-
mented with new technology, trying to capture an ever-growing 
audience with breakthrough concepts and graphics. The political 
and social climate of the 1980s provided a fertile environment for 
provocatively creative designers and thinkers such as Tibor Kal-
man, founder of M&Co.
In California, Rudy VanderLans (trained in the Netherlands) and 
Zuzana Licko (born in Czechoslovakia) collaborated to create 
experimental typography in Emigre, a progressive periodical that 
contributed to disrupting typographic conventions. David Carson 
designed Beach Culture magazine, and his typographic methodol-
ogy would eventually divide designers into “camp” divisions about 
typographic design philosophy. Similarly, in England, Neville Brody 
was challenging both editorial design and conventional typo-
graphic design with his own typeface designs and in his capacity 
as art director of Face magazine.
Also in England, advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH) 
created sexy campaigns for Levi’s and Häagen-Dazs using erotic 
imagery. In New York, George Lois’s ad campaign concept “I want 
my MTV” transformed entertainment. Chiat/Day created one of 
the great moments in TV advertising with its “1984” spot for 
Apple’s Macintosh. Advertising agencies outside of the usual ad 
hubs made indelible marks, making cities such as Minneapolis 
and Dallas the homes of creative advertising.

Ever since I started conducting my own interviews, I have been

generic-looking, typewritten transcript, written by someone else, that 
you lay out and give shape to. Before I start the layout of an interview, 
I have spent hours transcribing the tape, listening to the nuances of 
the conversation, the excitement in someone’s voice, etc. Much of 
the expressive/illustrative type solutions that I use in Emigre are a 
direct result of trying to somehow visualize the experience of having 
a conversation with someone. Although this approach is not always 
successful (some readers are put off by the often “complex-looking” 
texts), when it does work, and the reader gets engaged in deciphering 
and decoding the typographic nuances, the interview inevitably 
becomes more memorable.
—Rudy VanderLans, Emigre
VanderLans and Zuzana Licko launched their graphic magazine Emigre 
in 1982. In Emigre, they established an experimental approach to 
combining new technology with typographic design that rocked the 
design world.

AS THE CENTURY CAME TO A CLOSE, the technological boom 
continued to deeply affect all the visual arts. In 1990, Adobe 
released its Photoshop digital imaging software, providing a tool 
that enabled individual designers to manipulate imagery effec-
tively, inexpensively, and rapidly. The Web became a home to every 
brand worldwide, as well as set new design challenges. Designers 
worked closely with IT professionals to launch their online visual 
solutions. Design and technology were at aesthetic crossroads 
that were reconciled in various ways with interesting effects on 
popular visual culture.
Not only did technology become a star, design itself now received 
new respect in museums and in media coverage. Hot debates on 
consumerism, typographic design form/function questions, and 
green design were arguments that became known even outside the 
design community. Besides creating design to earn a living, some 
designers were tackling social and political issues with their inde-
pendently conceived, created, and produced posters.
Irony became king in advertising and in much of graphic design—a 
truly pervasive postmodern approach to all visual communication. 
Unusual combinations of form and color juxtapositions marked the 
work of many. Historical stylistic references allowed visual commu-
nicators to hold fast to the end of the century.
Corporations continued to count on branding and visual communi-
cation to distinguish their brands across borders. No longer belong-
ing to the marginalized artist, Postmodernism was co-opted by 
major brands seeking to align themselves with hipsters and to be 
perceived as trendsetters.

Art Chantry, a seminal designer in the 
American Postmodernist movement, 
continues to create work that disarms 
and provokes. The power of Chantry’s 
early punk fl yers and work for The Rocket 
music magazine emanated from his 
immersion in the Seattle culture scene, 
his low-tech method of creating design, 
and his attitude about the nature of 
design. Working on low budgets, and 
utilizing and integrating found imagery 
and type, Chantry’s two-dimensional 
graphic designs conjure the feeling of 
real time and full-sensory experiences.

NEW AND EMERGING MEDIA in the visual communication profes-
sion has helped reshape graphic design. We continue to design 
for print as well as fi xed, dynamic, and interactive solutions for 
small, medium and large screens. Visual communication is an 
ever-evolving discipline that can solve innumerable communica-
tion problems.
In a post-9/11 world, visual communicators are fi nding more and

information to the public, enhance understanding of editorial 
content through editorial design, design better election ballots or

to raise awareness, there are creative professionals who are con-
stantly challenging us to think and reevaluate.

COMMISSIONED BY MICHAEL BIERUT, PENTAGRAM
The mission of the L!brary Initiative is to enlist the talent of leading designers, 
architects, illustrators, and photographers in transforming every school library 
within New York City’s vast public school system into inspiring places for 
learning. It is part of a larger effort to improve student literacy rates, especially 
in some of the poorest neighborhoods.
Esquer was invited by the L!brary Initiative to design a 7-foot-high, multi-
panel mural running along 3 quarters of the library interior at Public School 
195–197 in the Bronx. Esquer hoped to achieve twin goals with his mural: 
to represent the library as a sanctuary for language and the entire world of 
ideas; and to give the students a sense of ownership in their library. 
To meet both goals, Esquer began by gathering 30 students from Grades 1 
through 6 for a morning workshop designed to generate content for the mural. 
Armed with reams of paper, poster paint, and artist’s brushes, Esquer asked 
the students to have fun painting their answers to dozens of questions about 
words. For example, Esquer’s questionnaire asked, “Imagine that you could 
eat words. Which one do you think would taste really good?” At the end of the 
workshop, Esquer collected nearly 1,000 painted words. 
Esquer incorporated the students’ words prominently into his mural of a 
child’s universe. Superimposed on silhouettes arranged in thematic groups, 
the children’s words give voice and attitude to this visual universe, bouncing 
playfully from homelife to nature, from foods to media and books, and from 
animals to people and professions.

This trio of CD and DVD designs for the single “Cocoon,” from Björk’s Vespertine 
album was inspired by the sensuality of the music video, directed by Eiko 
Ishioka. In the video, Björk gradually becomes wrapped in a cocoon of red 
threads. We digitally manipulated video stills and enhanced them with custom 
typography. Originally, Björk and her record company intended to select one 
cover, but in the end, they thought using all three proposed designs would 
be more effective. The collection works as a series and individually, and is an 
intriguing example of Björk’s image as a groundbreaking, avant-garde artist.

OBJECTIVES
Deﬁ ne graphic design
Become familiar with the major 
areas of specialization
WE
DON’T HAVE TO GO TO A MUSEUM OR 
GALLERY TO SEE GRAPHIC DESIGN—IT SURROUNDS US. EVERYTHING FROM 
A WEBSITE TO A POSTER TO THE COVER OF A BOOK IS VISUAL COMMUNICA-
TION—IDEAS, MESSAGES, AND INFORMATION CONVEYED THROUGH VISUAL 
FORM AIMED AT A MASS AUDIENCE. GRAPHIC DESIGN AND ADVERTISING ARE 
BOTH DISCIPLINES UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND 
ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF CONTEMPORARY POPULAR VISUAL CULTURE.
Since visual communication plays a key role in the appearance of almost all print, ﬁ lm, 
and screen-based media, graphic designers and advertising art directors are the primary
makers of the visual artifacts of our environment and popular culture. Imagine a world
with no provocative posters or no thought-provoking CD covers. Imagine no choking poster 
or cities without wayﬁ nding or signage systems. And imagine the chaos of a newspaper or
website that wasn’t designed by a professional graphic designer. That would be a world
without graphic design.
WHAT IS GR APHIC DESIGN?
Graphic design is a form of visual communication used to convey a message or informa-
tion to an audience; it is a visual representation of an idea relying on the creation, selection, 
and organization of visual elements. Powerful graphic design imbues a message with greater 
meaning. “Graphic design is therefore one of the ways in which creativity takes on a visual 
reality,” according to Professor Alan Robbins.
A graphic design solution can persuade, inform, identify, motivate, enhance, organize, 
brand, rouse, locate, engage, and carry or convey many levels of meaning. A design solution 
can be so effective that it inﬂ uences behavior: you may choose a particular brand because you 
are attracted to the design of its package, or you may donate blood after viewing a public 
service advertisement.
THE GR APHIC DESIGN PROFESSION
Designers solve a wide range of communication problems, collaborating with a variety 
of clients—from a not-for-proﬁ t organization attempting to reach families in need, to a 
brand promoting a new product, to a corporation that wants to go green, to a revitalized 
city’s transportation secretary who needs a wayﬁ nding system. To best explain the goals of 
any visual communication, we categorize communication intention and problem solving 
with speciﬁ c applications falling under one or more categories. Within these categories 
are speciﬁ c applications. The following list is an attempt to be as encompassing as possible 
in keeping with standard thinking. However, it should be noted that some formats—
including but not limited to brochures, books, posters, environments, or websites—are

branded entertainment, ambient, and social 
media.
Branding is a comprehensive and strategic 
pro gram for a brand or group (“group” refers to 
both commercial industries and not-for-proﬁ t 
organizations) and may include creating a brand, 
brand name, brand identity, package design, 
environmental design, website and other on-
screen applications, promotional design, and 
advertising. Some primary branding applications
include brand naming, brand conception, brand 
strategy, brand identity, brand revitalization (see 
Figure 1-01), rebranding, brand launch, brand 
environments, digital branding, global branding, 
corporate branding, social cause branding, brand-
ing for nonproﬁ ts, and political branding. Brand-
ing and identity design are similar, but branding 
is a broader category.
Identity design or brand identity involves the 
creation of a systematic visual and verbal program 
intended to establish a consistent visual appear-
ance and personality—a coordinated overarching 
identity—for a brand or group. Identity design 
applications include logos, visual identity, corpo-
rate identity, and branding across media.

utilized for a variety of communication goals. 
For example, a poster can promote an event; it 
can explain how to save someone who is chok-
ing; or it can communicate the voice of dissent. 
In addition, some people categorize visual com-
munication according to media—for instance, 
interactive design, which certainly can be uti-
lized for a variety of goals, including promo-
tion, information, editorial, entertainment, or 
presentation. If you keep communi ca tion goals 
in mind, it will aid your understanding of how 
applications are utilized.
Advertising involves generating and creating 
speciﬁ c visual and verbal messages constructed to 
inform, persuade, promote, provoke, or motivate 
people on behalf of a brand or group. More than 
ever, advertising is conceived and executed in the 
form of integrated campaigns across a variety 
of media. Advertising applications include print, 
television commercials, radio, outdoor advertis-
ing (also called out-of-home or OOH), banner 
ads, guerrilla/unconventional formats, mobile 
advertising, videos, branded utilities, websites, 
webisodes (web commercials), web ﬁ lms, online 
episodic pro gramming, e-marketing, direct mail,

Environmental design can be promotion, 
information, or identity design in constructed or 
natural environments and deﬁ ning and marking 
interior and exterior commercial, educational, 
cultural, residential, and natural environments; 
for Figure 1-02, an exhibition, Carbone Smolan 
Agency (CSA) says: “W. L. Gore & Associates, 
Inc. has the technical superiority to make ingre-
dient products for a wide range of industries from 
medical, to military to leisure. To help trans-
late the science within the products into a vis-
ible and understandable expression of the brand, 
Gore assembled a creative and visionary team 
of designers, fabricators and architects. CSA 
led the design and development of Gore’s new 
showroom to be known as the Gore Capabilities 
Center. The Center successfully presents complex 
scientiﬁ c information in a way that is compelling 
and accessible to a wide audience.”
Environmental design applications include 
branded environments, corporate headquarters, 
civic developments, architectural interiors, envi-
ron mental graphics, exhibits (trade show, museum, 
and educational, among others), and environmen-
tal wayﬁ nding (system of integrated signs).
Information design is a “highly specialized 
area of design that involves making large amounts 
of complex information clear and accessible to 
audiences of one to several hundred thousand” 
(deﬁ nition by the American Institute of Graphic 
Arts [AIGA]). Whether the application is an 
exhibition, chart, website, pictogram, subway 
map, instruction booklet, or choking poster, the 
graphic designer’s task is to clearly communicate, 
make information easily accessible, and clarify 
and enhance any type of information (from data 
to listings) for the user’s understanding. Informa-
tion design applications include charts, graphs, 
signs, pictograms, symbol signs, icons, websites, 
sign systems, and widgets.
Interactive or experience design is graphic 
design and advertising for screen-based media, 
including web, mobile, widget, kiosks, digital 
out-of-home, CDs, or DVDs, in which the user 
interacts with the application. Whether for com-
merce (Figure 1-03) or a nonproﬁ t organization 
(Figure 1-04), most have a home on the Internet, 
making websites primary interactive experiences 
Corporate communication design involves 
any visual communication applications that com-
municate internally with employees, create mate-
rials for a sales force or other employees, as well 
as applications used by a corporation or orga-
nization to communicate externally with other 
businesses, the public and stockholders, and cus-
tomers. The emphasis is on maintaining a con-
sistent corporate voice throughout any and all 
applications. Corporate communication applica-
tions include annual reports (see Figure 1-12), 
brochures, sales kits, marketing collateral, corpo-
rate publications, business-to-business applica-
tions, corporate websites and intranet, and new 
product offer ings applications.

What happens when two global heavyweights team up in a joint promotion

engaged in a collaborative cobranding project with Amazon, the world’s largest 
online consumer retail destination, and PepsiCo, the world’s number-two 
carbonated soft-drink maker, to develop a website supporting their cobranded 
Pepsi Stuff campaign.
We created a website that offers visitors a multi-dimensional, sensory 
experience and captivates users without inundating them with information. 
The experience gives consumers a clear, simple way to shop for digital and 
physical goods. Branded cues direct user behavior that is supported by key 
messages and succinct content, which allows for a truly immersive experience 
relying heavily on key visual elements to communicate the brand and inventive 
navigation for keeping the user engaged at every level.

looking to make their way in New York City. HUSH’s concept revolves 
around several main characters and their distinct personalities at the 
most critical moments in the fi lm. The highly stylized animated collages 
seamlessly transition one character to the next. Each character’s 
representational journey parallels that of the fi lm—both physically 
and emotionally.

banners, motion graphics, multimedia promotions, 
giveaways, merchandise catalogs, direct mail, invi-
tations, announcements, point-of-purchase dis-
plays, social networking applications, and blogs.
Publication design involves the design of edi-
torial content for print or screen; it is also called 
editorial design and book design. The publication 
designer makes content accessible, interprets con-
tent to enhance communication, enhances the 
reader’s experience, creates visual interest, and 
establishes a voice, character, and structure for a 
publication (Figure 1-09). Publication design
applications include book design, magazine design, 
newspaper design, newsletters, booklets, online 
publications, vlogs, mologs, and blogs.
Typographic design is a highly specialized area 
of graphic design focusing on the creation and 
design of letterforms, typefaces, and type treat-
ments (Figure 1-10). Many type designers own 
digital type foundries, which are ﬁ rms that design, 
license, publish, and dispense fonts. Other typog-
raphers specialize in handmade type and typefaces. 
Lettering is the drawing of letterforms by hand (as 
opposed to type generated on a computer). Typo-
graphic design includes custom and proprietary 
font design for digital type foundries, hand letter-
ing, handmade type, and custom typography.
Mass Media
For many of these categories, different media 
can be employed, such as print, screen-based, 
unconventional, or ﬁ lm. For example, one sees 
advertising in various media: television commer-
cials, commercial trailers run in movie theaters, 
mobile ads, print advertisements in magazines 
and newspapers, unconventional formats such 
as chalk writing on a sidewalk, motion-activated 
graphics projected on pavement, and online ads 
in the form of websites, marketing that goes viral, 
web ﬁ lms, banners, social networking applica-
tions, and webisodes. One can read a magazine 
in the conventional print format or online; one 
can hold a business card in hand or view it as an 
e-mail attachment.
THE NATURE AND IMPACT OF 
VISUAL COMMUNICATION
Graphic design is created for a speciﬁ c audience; a 
message is intentionally designed, transmitted, and 
then received by viewers. Whenever you read an 
advertisement or see a logo, you are on the receiv-
ing end of communication through design. Is the 
viewer’s interpretation of graphic design and adver-
tising paramount? Is graphic design an art that 
allows self-expression? Is it a discipline that can be 
tested, quantiﬁ ed, and scientiﬁ cally evaluated?1

Go big or go home. This mantra 
guided our design of one of 
T-Mobile’s biggest and boldest 
promotions yet for the 2007 
NBA All-Star Weekend in Las 
Vegas. As the Offi cial Wireless 
Telecommunications partner of 
the NBA, T-Mobile approached 
us to help them create a splash 
at the All-Star weekend and launch 
their latest T-Mobile Sidekick, a 
Dwyane Wade Limited Edition—
on which we consulted with him.
The overall focus of the weekend 
was to position T-Mobile in the 
hearts and minds of the NBA 
fans as their preferred mobile 
communications provider. In 
support of this strategy, we 
designed opportunities for fans 
to connect with the spirit of the 
game on multiple levels.
At Jam Session, the focus of 
the fan experience was a total 
Sidekick brand immersion. Based 
on the concept of stepping inside 
the mind of Dwyane Wade, our 
booth gave fans an interactive 
three-dimensional experience, 
allowing a peek inside his world, 
both on and off the court. Elements 
of the Limited Edition Sidekick 
design, such as crisp white and 
tan leather, transformed the space 
into a representation of Wade’s 
personal style.

A catalog produced in conjunction 
with the exhibition “RADAR: 
Selections from the Collection of 
Vicki and Kent Logan,” organized 
by the Denver Art Museum.
The curators were able to articulate 
their reasoning for calling the 
exhibition RADAR, leading to many 
of the ideas used in the design of 
the project from the macro choice 
of cover image (is that the Mona 
Lisa or not?) to the micro choice of 
typefaces. We often build a project 
out from the typeface selections, 
and in this case it was especially 
interesting to try to use type to 
subtly reinforce the ideas behind 
the exhibition.
—Bob Aufuldish
Certainly, it is reasonable that all of these 
viewpoints should be considered and incorpo-
rated into one’s view of the nature of graphic 
design. We can look at the works of many 
designers and see personal expression. The read-
ability and legibility of typography can be scien-
tiﬁ cally studied and measured. An advertisement 
is targeted at speciﬁ c groups in consideration 
of the audience’s demographic, tested in focus 
groups, or protested because of its possible effect
on society.
Most graphic design and advertising is ephem-
eral by nature—people don’t keep it. However, 
there are some applications, such as posters, book 
covers, CD covers, advertisements, and (beer, 
wine) labels that some people do keep, savor, and 
contemplate.

COLLABORATION
Whether the client is a local business owner, a 
large corporation, or a nonproﬁ t organization, 
the graphic designer’s role is to provide solu-
tions to visual communication problems. How-
ever, from determining the needed applications to 
developing strategy through design implementa-
tion, graphic designers often work in partnership 
with their clients. More than ever before, graphic 
design is collaborative. From working closely with 
their clients to collaborating with programmers or 
writers, graphic designers team up with a variety 
of other experts, such as creative directors, design 
directors, associate creative directors, production 
experts, photographers, illustrators, copywriters, 
art directors and specialists (interactive experts, 
type and hand-lettering specialists, architects, 
ﬁ lm directors, producers, casting directors, actors, 
musicians, models, music houses, IT profes-
sionals, psychologists, social anthropologists, and 
market researchers), and with printers and their 
sales representatives. When working on television 
commercials, advertising art directors and creative 
directors work with directors, location scouts, and 
postproduction experts and may also be involved 
in casting talent (actors, models, spokespeople, 
celebrities) and suggesting locations, as well as 
choosing music. When working on products, 
exhibition design, interior graphics, or branded 
environments, graphic designers might collabo-
rate with industrial designers, architects (as in 
Figure 1-11), or interior designers.

The Objective: Gilda’s Club is a 
special place where the focus is on 
living with cancer. But to keep itself 
fi nancially healthy, the not-for-profi t 
Gilda’s Club must consistently 
reach out to its many benefactors 
for funding and tell its story to the 
community at large.
The Solution: For two years, 
Brainforest has created unique, 
deeply personal Annual Reports 
for Gilda’s Club donors. One, 
entitled “The Thread that Joins 
a Community,” was inspired by 
a hallmark of Gilda’s Club—the 
Living Quilt. These stories of various 
individuals touched by cancer were 
sewn together graphically with 
humanity and a life-affi rming voice.

Many designers are self-employed. However, 
for a novice, it is advisable to work for someone 
else to gain design experience and learn all the 
aspects of running a small business and working 
with printers and other vendors before going out 
on one's own. It is highly beneﬁ cial to secure an 
internship, a cooperative educational experience, 
or part-time work in the design ﬁ eld while still in 
school. Attend the meetings of local art directors’ 
clubs and professional design organizations, such 
as the American Institute of Graphic Arts, The

At times, collaboration begins at the ground 
level when different ﬁ rms work together to solve 
a visual communication problem. For example, 
from the start of a large project, a branding ﬁ rm 
and an advertising agency might work together. 
Or a design studio might collaborate with an 
interactive studio. At other times, the lead design 
ﬁ rm or agency may hire freelancers. When a 
design concept is selected, graphic designers and 
advertising art directors might select and hire 
illustrators and photographers.
WHY DESIGN MATTERS
As 
designer 
Paula 
Scher 
wisely 
said—
“Design matters.”
Most people know that graphic designers 
have commercial clients—creating solutions for 
brands and corporations. The visual commu-
nication profession helps to drive the economy, 
provide information to the public, and promote 
competition (which can result in the research 
and development of goods and services). There 
is another side of graphic design that is less well 
known and vital to society: designers use their 
expertise to inform people about important social 
and political issues and promote good causes. For 
example, Brainforest created “The Thread that 
Joins a Community,” inspired by a hallmark of 
Gilda’s Club—the Living Quilt (Figure 1-12).
ETHICS IN VISUAL 
COMMUNICATION
Each designer is responsible for discovering ethi-
cal ways to practice. Any design problem can be 
solved in a great number of ways, and each solu-
tion has different economic and social beneﬁ ts 
and consequences.
Graphic designers respond to social need with 
projects; for example, Brainforest had a great 
idea—Creative Pitch—a not-for-proﬁ t program. 
(See Figure 1-13.) Many ﬁ nd funding from vari-
ous sources, including the Sappi Ideas That Mat-
ter initiative (www.sappi.com).
Many in the global design community are 
actively voicing the need for entirely ethical prac-
tice and for limiting consumer work. The impor-
tant manifesto “First Things First,” originally

CREATIVE PITCH/A SAPPI IDEAS THAT MATTER GRANT RECIPIENT
• BRAINFOREST, INC., CHICAGO
• DESIGNERS: DREW LARSON, JONATHAN AMEN
• PHOTOGRAPHY: JONATHAN AMEN
• PRINTING: DONATED BY DENNIS BOOTHE, LAKE COUNTY PRESS
The Objective: Brainforest had a great idea. Why not collect unused art materials from 
the design community and give them to art teachers and students at some of our poorest 
schools? Thus, Creative Pitch was born, and we needed to get the word out.
The Solution: Once we had the idea nailed down, Brainforest began the fun task of 
translating our excitement about this program to printed and electronic materials. To 
date our program logo, brochure, poster, t-shirts and website have won 8 industry design 
awards. Not only is this a great idea for the community, but our commitment shows in the 
great design work it generated.
Our Sappi Ideas That Matter Grant idea was to create a kit that would contain all the 
information needed to start a Creative Pitch program in other communities. Using a 
combination of printed and digital materials (on CD) we provide everything needed to 
inform and implement the program. The brochures are printed on “make ready” printer 
sheets and the binders and boxes are fabricated from recycled post-consumer stock. 
Because we will be sending the kits mostly to the design and advertising communities, the 
visuals need to be compelling, and the message engaging. If you want to ask an ad agency 
to hang up a poster in their space, it needs to be great! Our challenge was to create as 
little “stuff” as possible, and still provide the needed materials and information.

Chapter  01
written in 1964 and updated in 2000, is the sub-
ject of an ongoing debate. The First Things First 
manifesto is a call for designers to use problem-
solving skills in pursuit of projects that would 
improve society. There are urgent concerns world-
wide that would greatly beneﬁ t from the expert 
skills of designers, what the twenty-two original 
undersigned members of the manifesto would 
consider “cultural interventions,” such as edu-
cational tools, health tools, information design, 
public service advertising campaigns—any design 
project that moves away from consumerism and 
toward a socially useful beneﬁ t. 
Advertising matters, too. It drives the economy 
in a free market system and provides information 
and choices to the public. Ethical advertising is 
critical to competitive enterprise and to bringing 
better products and services to people. Globally, 
public service advertising campaigns have helped 
an enormous number of people. For example, the 
Ad Council has endeavored to improve the lives 
of Americans since ﬁ rst creating the category of 
public service advertising in 1942. In 1983, the 
Ad Council launched one of its most successful 
campaigns, featuring the tagline “Friends Don’t 
Let Friends Drive Drunk.” The campaign has 
evolved, continuing to motivate Americans to 
intervene to stop a friend from driving drunk. “A 
recent poll revealed that 68 percent of Americans 
have acted to stop someone from driving drunk 
after being exposed to the advertising. I think 
that shows the impact of the strategy and the cre-
ative ability to motivate change in attitudes and 
behavior,” says Peggy Conlon, Ad Council presi-
dent, about this campaign.2
It seems that though the “Friends Don’t Let 
Friends Drive Drunk” campaign was very success-
ful, “it did not change the behavior of many poten-
tial impaired drivers. Many thought the messages 
to be targeted at overtly drunk drivers, and not 
them. When decision time came, they would con-
sider themselves merely ‘buzzed’ and get behind 
the wheel,” according to the Ad Council. New 
PSAs were created to address this, to motivate 
people to stop driving buzzed (Fig ure 1-14).
In the early days of advertising, there were 
no government regulations or watchdog groups. 
Concerned citizens united and government agen-
cies formed to protect consumers from unethical 
manufacturers and fraudulent advertising claims. 
With or without watchdog groups or government 
regulations, every art director, copywriter, creative 
director, and creative professional involved in the 
creation of advertising must assume responsibility 
for ethical practices.
Visual communication professionals are among 
the leading architects of mass communication and 
its artifacts, creating images that reﬂ ect, help delin-
eate, and describe contemporary society. With that 
function comes responsibility. Professional orga-
nizations such as the International Association of 
Business Communicators (IABC) and the Ameri-
can Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) are very 
helpful in creating a foundation for ethical prac-
tices. For more information, visit their respective 
websites. For links, go to our website.

The visual communication profession demands 
critical thinking, creative thinking, and creative 
and technical skills. A broad liberal arts education 
(literature, anthropology, psychology, sociology, 
economics, music, philosophy, ﬁ ne art, art history, 
design history, theater, and dance) would best 
equip a graphic designer to understand the context 
of design assignments and propose meaningful 
solutions, as well as to best understand the mean-
ing of images. Both theory and skills are neces-
sary for practice; one must have the ability to solve 
visual communication problems, with a thorough 
knowledge of design principles, typography, visu-
alization, composition, theories, and the ability to 
construct meaningful images and forms.

design
Examine visual hierarchy
Learn about scale
Comprehend mathematical ratios 
and proportional systems
Grasp illusion and the manipulation

AS A RULE,
FROM CHILDHOOD ON, ASPIRING DESIGNERS ARE PEOPLE WHO 
ENJOY THE IMAGE-MAKING PROCESS AND SO, AT A MINIMUM, POSSESS A 
CASUAL KNOWLEDGE OF FORMAL ELEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES—THE VOCABU-
LARY AND TOOLS FOR BUILDING VISUALS. THE GOAL OF THIS CHAPTER IS 
TO EXPLORE THE FORMAL ELEMENTS AND BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES ON A 
MORE SOPHISTICATED LEVEL TO KNOW EACH ELEMENT’S POTENTIAL AND 
HOW IT CAN BEST BE UTILIZED FOR COMMUNICATION AND EXPRESSION.
FOR MAL ELEMENTS
The formal elements of two-dimensional design are line, shape, color, and texture.
LINE
A point or dot is the smallest unit of a line and one that is usually recognized as being cir-
cular. In a screen-based image, a point is a visible, single pixel of light (with or without hue) 
that is square rather than circular. In the digital realm of paint software, all elements are 
composed of pixels.
A line is an elongated point, considered the path of a moving point; it also is a mark made 
by a visualizing tool as it is drawn across a surface. A variety of tools can draw a line—a 
pencil, a pointed brush, a software tool, or any object that can make a mark (a cotton swab 
dipped in ink, a twig dipped in coffee; see Diagram 2-01). A line is primarily recognized by 
length rather than width; it is longer than it is wide.
Line is included among the formal elements of design because it has many roles to play in 
composition and communication.
Pick up a pencil and draw a line. That line will have direction and quality.
Lines can be straight, curving, or angular; they can guide 
the viewer’s eyes in a direction. A line can have a speciﬁ c 
quality—it can be delicate or bold, smooth or broken, thick 
or thin, regular or changing, and so on.
When you look at an exquisite linear illustration—for 
example, the illustration by James Grashow on the package 
design by Louise Fili (Figure 2-01)—you realize the poten-
tial of line as a visual element.

Various categories of line include:
› Solid line: a mark as it is drawn across a surface
› Implied line: noncontinuous line that the 
viewer perceives as continuous
› Edges: meeting point or boundary line between 
shapes and tones
› Line of vision: the movement of a viewer’s eye 
as it scans a composition; also called a line of 
movement or a directional line
The basic functions of lines include:
› Deﬁ ne shapes, edges, forms; create images, let-
ters, and patterns
› Delineate boundaries and deﬁ ne areas within a 
composition
› Assist in visually organizing a composition
› Assist in creating a line of vision
› Aid in creative expression
› Can establish a linear mode of expression, a 
linear style
When line is the predominant element used 
to unify a composition or to describe shapes or 
forms in a design (or painting), the style is termed 
linear. This can be seen in the poster in the mov-
ing announcement (Figure 2-02), where lines are 
used to describe the objects and map and to unify 
the illustration.
SHAPE
The general outline of something is a shape;
it is a conﬁ gured or delineated area on a two-
dimensional surface created either partially or 
entirely by lines (outlines, contours) or by color 
(Figure 2-03), tone, or texture. It is also deﬁ ned 
as a closed form or closed path.
A shape is essentially ﬂ at—meaning it is actu-
ally two-dimensional and measurable by height 
and width. How a shape is drawn gives it a quality. 
All shapes may essentially be derived from three 
basic delineations: the square, the triangle, and 
the circle. Each of these basic shapes has a cor-
responding volumetric form or solid: the cube, the 
pyramid, and the sphere (Diagram 2-02).
› A geometric shape is created with straight 
edges, precise curves, and measurable angles; it is 
also called rigid.
› An organic, biomorphic, or curvilinear shape 
seems to have a naturalistic feel; it may be drawn 
precisely or loosely.

BASIC SHAPES AND FORMS
› A rectilinear shape is composed of straight 
lines or angles.
› A curvilinear shape is formed by curves or 
dominating marked ﬂ owing edges.
› An irregular shape is a combination of straight 
and curved lines.
› An accidental shape is the result of a material 
and/or speciﬁ c process (a blot or rubbing) or acci-
dent (for example, by a spill of ink on paper).
› A nonobjective or nonrepresentational shape is 
purely invented and is not derived from anything

Chapter  02
FIGURE/GROUND 
Figure/ground, also called positive and nega-
tive space, is a basic principle of visual perception 
and refers to the relationship of shapes, of ﬁ gure 
to ground, on a two-dimensional surface. To best 
understand what is being depicted, the mind seeks 
to separate graphic elements that it perceives as 
the ﬁ gures from the ground (or background) ele-
ments. In ﬁ gure/ground relationships, the observer 
seeks visual cues to distinguish the shapes repre-
senting the ﬁ gures from those that are the ground. 
The ﬁ gure or positive shape is a deﬁ nite shape; it 
is immediately discernible as a shape. The shapes 
or areas created between and among ﬁ gures are 
known as the ground or negative shapes. Since 
the observer hunts for the ﬁ gure to make sense of 
the visual, the ground may appear to be unoccu-
pied and without shape to the untrained observer; 
however, a designer must always consider the ground 
as an integral part of the composition. Theoretically 
and even literally, the (back) ground actually takes 
shape—negative shape. Considering all space as 
active forces you to consider the whole space.

great consideration in the poster Stop the Plant 
(Figure 2-05). Also see Charles Nix’s ﬁ gure/
ground handling of the images in Figure 3-03,

Figure/Ground Reversal
At times, ﬁ gure/ground relationships can be 
arranged to equally represent either the positive 
or negative shapes. The traditional example is the 
ancient Chinese symbol yin and yang (two prin-
ciples that oppose one another in their actions); 
another example of an equal and interchange-
able distribution of ﬁ gure and ground is a simple 
checkerboard pattern. When shapes are inter-
changeable, an equivocal space or ambiguous ﬁ g-
ure/ground relationship is created, and you have 
ﬁ gure/ground reversal (Diagram 2-04).
In Figure 2-06 and Figure 2-07, the respective 
designers create ﬁ gure/ground reversal, where the 
negative shapes are also identiﬁ able as positive 
images. Lanny Sommese positions a heart and 
dagger between Romeo and Juliet. Ronald J. Cala 
II creates a dove between the two girls.
Typographic Shapes
In graphic design, characters/letterforms, numer-
als, and punctuation marks are also shapes—albeit 
highly specialized ones that symbolize the sounds 
of language. And like basic shapes, type can be 
rectilinear, curvilinear, geometric, or organic. A 
letterform, numeral, or punctuation mark is the 
ﬁ gure, and the counters or open spaces of type 
are the ground or negative spaces (see Chapter 3 
on typography).
COLOR
The study of color deserves your attention 
because it is a powerful and highly provocative 
design element. Color is a property or descrip-
tion of light energy, and only with light do we see 
color. The colors we see on the surfaces of objects 
in our environment are perceived and known as 
reﬂ ected light or reﬂ ected color. When light 
strikes an object, some of the light is absorbed, 
whereas the remaining or unabsorbed light is 
reﬂ ected. The reﬂ ected light is what we see as 
color. For instance, a tomato absorbs all but red 
light; therefore, the red is reﬂ ected light. For this 
reason, reﬂ ected color is also known as subtrac-
tive color.
Pigments are the natural chemical substances 
within an object that interact with light to deter-
mine the characteristic color that is perceived, as in 
the bright yellow of bananas, the reds of ﬂ owers, 
and the browns of fur. Naturally occurring or arti-
ﬁ cially made pigments are added to agents to color 
such things as paper, ink, and plastic.
Naturally or commercially produced pigmented 
surfaces are seen as reﬂ ected light, but the col-
ors on a computer screen are light energy—a 
wavelength—that we can refer to as digital color.

Chapter  02
dull red, bright blue or dull blue. Chroma and 
intensity are synonyms for saturation. A hue also 
can be perceived as warm or cool in temperature.
The temperature refers to whether the color looks
hot or cold. Color temperature cannot actually be 
felt; it is perceived in the mind through association 
and memory. The warm colors are said to be reds, 
oranges, and yellows, and the cool colors are blues, 
greens, and violets.
PRIMARY COLORS
To further deﬁ ne color, it helps to understand the 
role of basic colors called primary colors. When 
working with light in screen-based media, the 
three primaries are red, green, and blue (RGB). 
These primaries are also called the additive pri-
maries because when added together in equal 
amounts, red, green, and blue create white light 
(Diagram 2-05).
Using the RGB model:
Red + green = yellow
Red + blue = magenta
Green + blue = cyan
When working with a computer’s color palette, 
you can mix millions of colors. However, it is very 
difﬁ cult, if not impossible, for the human eye to 
distinguish the millions of tones and values cre-
ated by the additive primaries on a computer.
As mentioned earlier, subtractive color is seen 
as a reﬂ ection from a surface, such as ink on 
paper. We call this system the subtractive color 
system because a surface subtracts all light waves 
except those containing the color that the viewer 
sees (Diagram 2-06). In paint or pigment such 
as watercolors, oils, or colored pencils, the sub-
tractive primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. 
They are called primary colors because they can-
not be mixed from other colors, yet other colors 
can be mixed from them:
Red + yellow = orange
Yellow + blue = green
Red + blue = violet
Orange, green, and violet are the secondary 
colors. You can mix these colors and get numer-
ous variations.
As seen in Diagram 2-07, in offset printing, the 
subtractive primary colors are cyan (C), magenta 
(M), and yellow (Y), plus black (K), or CMYK. 
Most often, black is added to increase contrast.

For example, when selecting a pure blue color 
in Adobe Photoshop™ (deﬁ ned as Blue 255, 
Red 0, Green 0), the color seen is actually a blue 
wavelength of light itself. The digital colors seen 
in screen-based media are also known as additive 
colors—mixtures of light. Mixing light—adding 
light waves together—creates a variety of colors.
COLOR NOMENCLATURE
We can discuss color more speciﬁ cally if we divide 
the element of color into three categories: hue, 
value, and saturation. Hue is the name of a color—
that is, red or green, blue or orange. Value refers to 
the level of luminosity—lightness or darkness—
of a color—for instance, light blue or dark red. 
Shade, tone, and tint are different aspects of value. 
In graphic design applications that require blocks 
of text, the value of the mass of the type block, 
paragraph, or column takes on a tonal quality, cre-
ating a block of gray tone. Saturation is the bright-
ness or dullness of a color—that is, bright red or 

G R A P H I C  D E S I G N :  T H E  B A S I C S

for instance, nontoxic, nonﬂ ammable, and non-
polluting inks are available.
In addition, students of design should be aware 
that colors on the web can be unstable; therefore a 
palette of 16 “web-safe” colors was standardized. 
The web-safe colors are listed in the Adobe Pho-
toshop™ and Illustrator™ and other web soft-
ware color selection directories.
Web-safe colors are those that are somewhat 
consistent and most reliable when viewed on 
computer monitors across platforms (Windows 
or Apple) and across browser software (Explorer, 
Netscape, Safari, Google Chrome, etc.). Some 
designers believe it is no longer necessary to stick 
to web safe colors, except when designing for 
mobile devices.
The myriad of technical aspects regarding color 
is too expansive to be discussed at this point; how-
ever, technical basics should be part of a design 
education. These basics can be found in special-
ized courses such as preparing design for print-
ing and website production and other courses for 
screen-based media.
There have been many scientiﬁ c studies of color, 
with modern theories by Albert Henry Munsell, 
Johannes Itten, Josef Albers, and Faber Birren. 
Understanding color symbolism relative to culture, 
country, region, and demography is crucial. Much 
of what you need to know about color will come 
from experimentation, experience, asking print-
ers questions, getting color advice before going 
to print, and observation. Visit a printer. Attend 
paper shows. Talk to printers, paper sales repre-
sentatives, and professional designers about color 
and paper stock (recycled, tree-free), special tech-
niques, the ink/paper relationship, and varnishes. 
For an informative essay on color design basics by 
Rose Gonnella, go to our website. 
Using all four process colors—cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black—to print a document is called 
four-color process, which is used to reproduce 
full-color photographs, art, and illustrations. The 
viewer perceives full color that is created by dot 
patterns of cyan, magenta, yellow, and/or black. 
There are books available that illustrate the vari-
ous mixtures resulting from mixing two, three, or 
four process colors. Please see the bibliography 
for a book list.
TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The dual responsibility of wanting to select and 
compose colors for a particular design solution 
and needing to understand the technical aspects 
of color production is, in short, exceptionally 
difﬁ cult. Metallic bronze ink may possibly be a 
good choice for a museum exhibition brochure, 
but in regard to printing, a metallic ink cannot be 
reduced in saturation or value; it is more expen-
sive than black ink and physically difﬁ cult to work 
with. Metallic ink doesn’t always dry quickly (or 
dry at all on certain papers). Printers (printing 
company experts) are very helpful in educating 
designers about the pitfalls of color printing and 
the nature of ink on paper. As a designer, you 
must constantly interact with printers on getting 
colors to physically function well.
Having a knowledgeable and conscientious 
technician, printer, or computer programmer guide 
a designer through technical color production in 
print or on screen-based media is essential. How-
ever, the student and professional designer should 
also have a basic awareness of color print produc-
tion, ink mixtures, and screen “safe” colors—and 
their problems.
Basic color knowledge should include aware-
ness of the printer primaries of CMYK, the 
process of layering dots of ink to produce color, 
and the Pantone™ color system of ink selection. 
The Pantone color system is a standardized color 
matching set of inks used in printing processes 
(see Diagram 2-08). Using a color matching sys-
tem ensures that the color printed from the digi-
tal ﬁ le is the color intended, though it may look 
different when viewed on a color monitor. It is 
always advisable to work closely with a printer 
to ensure color correctness. It’s also advisable to 
investigate the different printing inks available;

and “U” indicates uncoated paper.

black and white make gray. Grays are the inter-
val neutral colors between black and white. Black 
and white are separately mixed into paint and ink 
colors to make them darker (shades) or lighter 
(tints). A black and white mixture will also dilute 
the intensity of the hue, as noted in the next sec-
tion on saturation.
Even if black and white seem to be pure, some 
level of hue may still be discernible. A neutral 
black or white can appear “warm” (containing 
red, orange, or yellow) or “cool” (containing blue 
or green). A neutral color will also react to and 
be affected by its placement in a composition. 
Placed next to a hue or among particular hues, 
the pure neutral color will seem to take on the 
hue itself.
In composition, value contrast is most useful for 
purposes of differentiating shapes. Note the value 
contrast of the type (black) and substrate (white 
paper) of the page of words you are now reading. 
The value contrast most clearly differentiates the 
ﬁ gure from the ground. Hue contrasts alone have 
less impact and therefore may not be as effective 
for differentiating between the ﬁ gure and ground 
images or between elements of a single composi-
tion (Diagram 2-09).
Different value relationships produce different 
effects, both visual and emotional. When a nar-
row range of values, which is called low contrast,
is used in a design, it evokes a different emotional 
response from the viewer than a design with a 
wide range of values, or high contrast. The high 
contrast in the poster for Amnesty International 
by Woody Pirtle easily captures one’s attention 
(Figure 2-08). (Other types of contrast will be 
discussed in detail in Chapters 5 and 6.)
Saturation
Saturation refers to the brightness or dullness of a 
color or hue; a hue at its highest level of intensity 
is said to be purely saturated. A saturated color 
has reached its maximum chroma and does not 
contain a neutralizing color (pure black and white 
are without hue) or the mixtures of the neutral 
colors (gray). Mixed with black, white, and espe-
cially gray, the fully saturated hue becomes dull in 
various degrees. The neutral colors dull the inten-
sity or saturation because they dilute the hue. A 
Value
Value refers to the level of luminosity—lightness 
or darkness—of a color, such as light blue or dark 
red. To adjust the value of a hue, two neutral col-
ors are employed: pure black and white.
Black and white are colors (pigment), but they 
are not considered hues. The two are not found 
on the visible spectrum and therefore are consid-
ered achromatic or neutral (without hue).
Black and white have relative value and play an 
important role in mixing color. Black is the dark-
est value and white is the lightest. Mixed together,

Value contrast obviously creates the 
greatest differentiation between the 
ﬁ gure and ground, as seen in the grid

grid of similar values.

color mixed with gray is called a tone or a reduc-
tion of the fully saturated hue.
Color saturation may be selected and adjusted 
for practical function within a composition. A 
saturated color will call attention to itself when 
placed alongside duller tones. A single saturated 
hue on a black-and-white page or computer 
screen will grab one’s attention because it is most 
vivid. In a composition, a saturated hue has an 
advantage of being noticed ﬁ rst when surrounded 
by hues of lower saturation.
TEXTURE
The actual tactile quality of a surface or the simu-
lation or representation of such a surface quality is 
a texture. In the visual arts, there are two catego-
ries of texture: tactile and visual. Tactile textures 
have actual tactile quality and can be physically 
touched and felt; they are also called actual tex-
tures (see Diagram 2-10). There are several print-
ing techniques that can produce tactile textures 
on a printed design, including embossing and 
debossing, stamping, engraving, and letterpress.
Visual textures are those created by hand, 
scanned from actual textures (such as lace), or 
photographed; they are illusions of real textures 
(see Diagram 2-11). Using skills learned in draw-
ing, painting, photography, and various other 
image-making media, a designer can create a 
great variety of textures.
Pattern 
Pattern is a consistent repetition of a single visual 
unit or element within a given area. In all cases, 
there must be systematic repetition with obvious 
directional movement. (An interesting aspect of 
pattern is that the viewer anticipates a sequence.) 
If you examine patterns, you will notice that their 
structures rely on the conﬁ guration of three basic 
building blocks: dots, lines, and grids. In a pat-
tern, any individual small unit, whether nonob-
jective (think organic) or representational (think 
leaf) shape, can be based on the dot or point. Any 
moving path is based on lines, also called stripes.
Any two intersecting units yield a pattern grid.
If we refer back to the common checkerboard 
pattern, we see a ﬁ gure/ground reversal created 
by an allover pattern; that balanced design is

COLOR  AND GRAPHIC DESIGN
• Color can create a focal point (low saturation color amid a fi eld of highly satu-
rated colors, and vice versa).
• Color is often used symbolically.
• Color can have cultural and emotional associations.
• Color can be associated with a brand and be chosen to express a brand’s person-
ality—for example, Coca-Cola™ red or Tiffany™ blue.
• Color juxtaposition can create the illusion of space.
• Color selection should enhance the readability of type.
• Ramped color, or a gradation of color, creates the illusion of movement.
• A color should always be selected in relation to the other colors in the piece.
• There are established color schemes, such as monochromatic schemes, analo-
gous colors, complementary colors, split complementary colors, triadic schemes, 
tetradic schemes, cool palettes, and warm palettes, among others. Color palettes 
are also associated with techniques, historical periods, and art and nature, such 
as batik colors, art deco, Victorian, retro palettes, ancient Chinese ceramic colors, 
and earth tones.

librium; viewers ﬁ nd ease in a stable composition. 
Unity is about designing a whole in which ele-
ments relate to one another; proximity (elements 
that are close together are perceived as more 
related), similarity (similar elements are perceived 
as more related), and continuity (aligned ele-
ments are perceived as more related) are keys to 
unity. Within unity, a degree of variety adds visual 
interest and excitement. Emphasis through visual 
hierarchical organization increases the clarity of 
communication. Rhythm is used to help create a 
ﬂ ow from one element to another and to add a 
visual pulsing excitement and ﬂ ow.
Over time, through empirical studies, a work-
ing knowledge of each principle will become 
second nature—a conditioned consciousness—to 
your practice of design. As you begin, it is neces-
sary to be mindful of the principles.
FORMAT
Before we examine the basic principles, let’s 
understand the role of the format. Format is a term 
that means two related things. The format is the 
deﬁ ned perimeter as well as the ﬁ eld it encloses—
the outer edges or boundaries of a design; in actu-
ality, it is the ﬁ eld or substrate (piece of paper, 
called crystallographic balance. Allover patterns 
can serve as graphic design solutions in and
of themselves.
The unique and creative patterns in Cedomir 
Kostovic’s poster series are an integral part of the 
visual message (Figure 2-09). Kostovic explains, 
“The tag line Open Your Heart—Give Blood is 
supported visually by images based on combina-
tions of different symbols, which are juxtaposed 
in unexpected ways. Background images are 
based on patterns inspired by the rich visual her-
itage of diverse ethnic groups unique to Ameri-
can culture.”
PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN
When composing with the formal elements, you 
utilize basic design principles. In combination 
with your knowledge of concept generation, type 
and image integration, and the formal elements as 
the form-building vocabulary, you apply the prin-
ciples of design to every visual communication.
The basic principles are absolutely interdepen-
dent. Balance is about stability and creating equi-

of the project, function and purpose, appropriate-
ness for the solution, and cost.
No matter what shape or type of format, each 
component of the composition must form a sig-
niﬁ cant relationship to the format’s boundaries. 
That page, where you make your ﬁ rst mark, not 
only has all that blank space/white space, but it 
also has edges to which each mark and graphic 
element should relate when applying the prin-
ciples of design. In one of the courses he taught 
at the Bauhaus, Wassily Kandinsky emphasized 
the basics of organization of a composition, the 
function of the center and the edges, and the pro-
gression from point to line to plane.
BALANCE
Balance is one of the principles that may come 
more intuitively to you because you utilize it in 
your own physical movement. If you practice 
yoga, martial arts, gymnastics, dance, or most 
sports, you understand that one action balances 
an opposite and equal action. Balance is stability 
or equilibrium created by an even distribution of 
visual weight on each side of a central axis, as well 
mobile phone screen, outdoor billboard, etc.) for 
the graphic design.
In addition, designers often use the term for-
mat to describe the type of application—that is, a 
poster, a CD cover, and so on. Graphic designers 
have to work with a variety of formats.
Some examples are a CD cover is a square 
shape, a single-page magazine ad is a rectangu-
lar shape, and a two-page spread is a different 
rectangular shape. A brochure can unfold into 
an extended landscape-shaped rectangle; further-
more, there are a variety of brochures in different 
sizes and shapes, and each may open up differ-
ently (see Diagram 2-12).
There are standard sizes for some formats. CD 
covers, for example, are all the same size. Posters 
have standard sizes; however, you can print a poster 
in almost any size, too. Sometimes, a format shape 
and type are predetermined, and the designer has 
to work within those constraints. Any size format 
is available to the designer at varying costs. Shape, 
paper, size, and special printing techniques can 
greatly affect cost. Paper is roughly half the cost of 
any printing job. Size is determined by the needs 
SINGLE FORMATS
SINGLE FORMATS  VERSUS MULTIPLE-PAGE FORMATS
Posters, single-page advertisements, outdoor billboards, 
business cards, letterheads, any front cover, and unanimated 
web banners are single for mats. The composition is on a 
single page. More often, designers must work with multiple-
page applications, such as brochures, the interior design of 
books, magazines, newspapers, websites, reports, corporate 
communications, newsletters, catalogs, and more. A website 
is seen by clicking through to another page. Corporate, 
government, and institutional websites can have hundreds 
of pages; yet, at any given moment, a website can be one 
still image—and look like one still rectangle—viewed on 
a computer screen (unlike motion graphics). Any multiple-
page format must be addressed as a continuous fi eld, keep-
ing unity, visual fl ow, and harmony in mind across the entire 
application (see Diagram 2-12).

as by an even distribution of weight among all 
the elements of the composition. When a design 
is balanced, it tends toward harmony with the 
viewer feeling level. The average viewer is adverse 
to imbalance in a composition and reacts nega-
tively to instability. Balance is only one principle 
of composition and must work in conjunction 
with the other principles.
Interrelated Visual Factors of Balance
Understanding balance involves the study of sev-
eral interrelated visual factors: visual weight, posi-
tion, and arrangement.
In two-dimensional design, weight is not 
deﬁ ned as an actual or physical gravitational force 
but rather as a visual force or as visual weight.
This visual weight refers to the relative amount 
of visual attraction, importance, or emphasis the 
element carries in a composition. Every element 
in a composition carries energy—an impression 
of force, strength, or weight.
The size, shape, value, color, and texture of a 
mark all contribute to an element’s visual weight. 
Where you position the mark on the page also 
affects its visual weight. The same mark posi-
tioned at different points on a page—bottom 
right, bottom left, center, top right, or top left—
will appear to change in visual weight because of 
its position. In visual perception, different areas 
of the page seem to carry more or less visual 
weight. Recommended reading about this sub-
ject includes studies by gestalt theoreticians as 
well as books by Rudolf Arnheim, distinguished 
psychologist, philosopher, and critic, who wrote 
extensively about visual perception in relation to 
art and design. There are also many newer stud-
ies and experiments by psychologists and social 
scientists, among others.
Symmetric versus Asymmetric Balance
Symmetry is a mirroring of equivalent elements, 
an equal distribution of visual weights, on either 
side of a central axis, as in Figure 2-10 where the 
symbol component of the French Leave logo is 
symmetrical; it is also called reﬂ ection symmetry.
Approximate symmetry is very close to symme-
try as in the poster The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife
in Figure 2-11. Imagine a vertical axis dividing 
FACTORS
FACTORS  AFFECTING VISUAL WEIGHT
• Orientation and location of an element within the format 
• Line of vision (directional pull)
• Whether the element is fi gure or ground
• Color: hue, value, saturation, and temperature
• Density or number of elements in a given area
• Isolation and emphasis of an element in the composition (focal point)

one large shape)

Size and shape of an element. For example, a large shape is heavier in compari-

French Leave is an exclusive resort that is being developed on French Leave beach on the Island 
of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The client asked us to create a design approach that was stylish, 
upbeat and clean, while at the same time capturing the island’s calm, quiet grace and unspoiled 
natural beauty.
Logo: We felt that the butterfl y was the perfect metaphor for the unspoiled natural setting that 
is Eleuthera and it became the point of departure for our logo. Adding the silhouetted faces to 
the butterfl y’s wings was our way to visualize the relationship between French Leave Resort and 
its pristine surroundings. In order to enhance the stylish, clean, and exclusivity of the resort, the 
logo was silver foil stamped and embossed in most of its applications.

Asymmetry is an equal distribution of visual 
weights achieved through weight and counter-
weight by balancing one element with the weight 
of a counterpointing element without mirroring
elements on either side of a central axis (Figure 
2-12). To achieve asymmetrical balance, the posi-
tion, visual weight, size, value, color, shape, and 
texture of a mark on the page must be considered

The designer must determine what to emphasize 
and what to de-emphasize.
It is important to remember that if you give 
emphasis to all elements in a design, you have given 
it to none of them; you will just end up with visual 
chaos. Regardless of the expressive quality or style 
of the work, visual hierarchy aids communication.
Emphasis is directly related to establishing a 
point of focus. We call this point of emphasis 
the focal point—the part of a design that is most 
emphasized or accentuated, as in Figure 2-12, 
where the green chair is the focal point. Position, 
size, shape, direction, hue, value, saturation, and 
texture of a graphic element all contribute to mak-
ing it a focal point. Once past the establishment 
of a focal point, a designer must further guide the 
viewer, as in Figure 2-13. As you will recall from 
the ABCs of emphasis, this rule can be extended 
to every component part within a composition.
Superdrug Stores asked Turner Duckworth 
to redesign their range of natural herbal supple-
ments to appeal to health conscious consumers of 
and weighed against every other mark; every ele-
ment and its position contribute to the overall 
balancing effect in a design solution. (See more in 
Chapter 6 on contrast and balance.)
Radial (allover) balance is symmetry achieved 
through a combination of horizontally and ver-
tically oriented symmetry. Elements radiate out 
from a point in the center of the composition, or 
there is extensive repetition of an element or ele-
ments (Diagram 2-14).
VISUAL HIERARCHY
One of the primary purposes of graphic design 
is to communicate information, and the prin-
ciple of visual hierarchy is the primary force for 
organizing information and clarifying commu-
nication. To guide the viewer, the designer uses 
visual hierarchy, the arrangement of all graphic
elements according to emphasis. Emphasis is
the arrangement of visual elements according to 
importance, stressing some elements over others, 
making some superordinate (dominant) elements 
and subordinating other elements. Basically, the 
designer determines which graphic elements the 
viewer will see ﬁ rst, second, third, and so on. This 
is what creative director John Rea calls the ABCs 
of emphasis:

Emphasis through Scale
The size and scale of shapes or objects play an 
important role in emphasis and creating the illu-
sion of spatial depth. Used effectively, the size of 
one shape or object in relation to another—what 
we call scale—can make elements appear to move 
forward or backward on the page. Large shapes 
and forms tend to attract more attention; however, 
a very small object can also attract attention if it is 
seen in contrast to many larger ones.
Emphasis through Contrast
Through contrast—light versus dark, smooth
versus rough, bright versus dull—you can empha-
size some graphic elements over others. For exam-
ple, a dark shape amid a ﬁ eld of lighter shapes 
might become a focal point. Of course, contrast 
also depends on and is aided by size, scale, loca-
tion, shape, and position.
Emphasis through Direction and Pointers
Elements such as arrows and diagonals use direc-
tion to point viewers’ eyes to where they should go. 
Emphasis through Diagrammatic Structures
Tree Structures. By positioning the main or super-
ordinate element at the top with subordinated 
elements below it in descending order, hierar-
chical relationships are created (Diagram 2-15). 
Another tree structure looks similar to a tree 
trunk with branches; subordinate elements stem 
out from the main element carried by lines.
either gender (Figure 2-14). The visual hierarchy 
is very clear. First we see the dominant visual or 
the herb, then the name of the supplement, next 
the retail brand logo, and then the number of tab-
lets. The smaller cropped image of the herb along 
with the name counterbalances the dominant 
visual against a pure white ﬁ eld.
EMPHASIS
To establish a visual hierarchy, decide on the 
importance of the graphic elements that are 
the component parts (visuals and type) of your 
design. Create a ﬂ ow of information from the 
most important element to the least.
There are several means to achieve emphasis:
Emphasis by Isolation
Isolating a shape focuses attention on it (focused 
attention = more visual weight). Please note that a 
focal point usually carries a great amount of visual 
weight and must be counterbalanced accordingly 
with other elements in a composition.
Emphasis by Placement
How the viewer moves visually through a spatial 
composition has been an ongoing topic of study. 
It has been shown that viewers have preferences 
for speciﬁ c regions of a page. Placing a graphic 
element at speciﬁ c positions in a composition, 
such as the foreground, the top-left corner, or the 
center/middle of a page attracts most viewers’ 
gaze most easily. Read more about eye direction 
and placement in Chapter 6.

RHYTHM
In music and poetry, most people think of rhythm 
as the beat—created by a pattern of stress (and 
unstress). In graphic design, a strong and consis-
tent repetition, a pattern of elements can set up a 
rhythm, similar to a beat in music, which causes 
the viewer’s eyes to move around the page. Timing 
can be set by the intervals between and among the 
position of elements on the page. Just as in music, 
a pattern can be established and then interrupted, 
slowed, or sped up. If you’ve ever danced to music, 
you know how important a steady recognizable 
beat is to the success of moving to the rhythm. 
Similarly in design, a strong visual rhythm aids in 
creating stability. Rhythm—a sequence of visual 
elements at prescribed intervals—across multi-
ple-page applications and motion graphics, such 
as book design, website design, and magazine 
design, is critical to developing a coherent visual 
ﬂ ow from one page to another (think strong 
dance beat). Equally important is incorporating 
an element of variance to punctuate, accent, and 
create visual interest.
Many factors can contribute to establishing 
rhythm—color, texture, ﬁ gure and ground rela-
tionships, emphasis, and balance.
Repetition and Variation
The key to establishing rhythm in design is to 
understand the difference between repetition 
and variation. In graphic design, the repetition of 
rhythm is interposed by variation to create visual 
interest. In 2D: Basics for Designers, Steven Brower 
writes: “As in music, patterns are established and 
then broken through. By building expectations, 
accents can be created that enhance and inform. 
Once this visual rhythm is achieved through the 
repetition of pattern, any variation within will 
break the rhythm, producing the visual equiva-
lent of a pulse or a beat. These can either create 
a slight pause or bring the entire piece to a halt, 
depending on the intent of the designer.”
Repetition occurs when you repeat one or a 
few visual elements a number of times or with 
great or total consistency, as in Figure 2-15. The 
Baby Wayne Ram DJ CD cover creates rhythm 
through the intervals as our eyes move from head 
to head and with the variation in sizes of the heads 
Nest Structures. This can be done either through 
layering (main element is the ﬁ rst layer and other 
layers move behind it) or through containment 
(the main element contains the lesser elements) 
(Diagram 2-15). Layering for the purpose of 
hierarchy is critical to understand in relation to 
websites and information design.
Stair Structures. To illustrate hierarchy, this 
structure stacks elements, with the main element 
at the top and subordinate elements descending 
like stair steps (Diagram 2-15).
To create emphasis, a designer must present 
content in a logical order as well as control how 
the information is conveyed. For more about 
emphasis, see Chapter 6 on arrangement: visual 
hierarchy, ﬂ ow, and eye direction.

profoundly affecting how you construct unity in a 
composition. The mind attempts to create order, 
make connections, and seek a whole by grouping—
perceiving visual units by location, orientation, 
likeness, shape, and color. A fundamental princi-
ple is the law of prägnanz (German for “precision” 
or “conciseness”)—which means we seek to order 
our experience as a whole as well as possible in a 
regular, simple, coherent manner.
LAWS OF PERCEPTUAL 
ORGANIZATION
The laws (illustrated in Diagram 2-16) are:
› Similarity: like elements, those that share char-
acteristics, are perceived as belonging together. 
complemented by the background colors and ver-
tical arrangement of the typography. Variation is
established by a break or modiﬁ cation in the pat-
tern or by changing elements, such as the color, 
size, shape, spacing, position, and visual weight. 
Variation creates visual interest to engage a viewer 
and adds an element of surprise; however, too 
much variation will do away with a visual beat.
UNITY
When you look at a book jacket, do you ever won-
der how the graphic designer was able to get all 
the type and visuals to work together as a cohesive 
unit? There are many ways to achieve unity where 
all the graphic elements in a design are so interre-
lated that they form a greater whole; all the graph-
ic elements look as though they belong together.
An ideal layout might be viewed as a compo-
sition of graphic elements so uniﬁ ed as a whole 
that it cannot be described merely as a sum of 
its parts. Most designers would agree viewers are 
able to best take in (understand and remember) a 
composition that is a uniﬁ ed whole. This belief 
relies on gestalt, from the German for “form,” 
which places an emphasis on the perception of 
forms as organized wholes, primarily concerned 
with how the mind attempts to impose order on 
the world, to unify and order perceptions.1
From gestalt, we derive certain laws of per-
ceptual organization that govern visual thinking,

Problem: Rounder Records is an independent label specializing in music

Solution: Visual Dialogue looks at these CD covers as basically 43⁄4” square 
ads. Using just a few elements—photo, artist’s name, and title—we create 
covers, which engage the desired audience while also giving a sense of the 
music. The end result is a visually distinctive and memorable identity that 
lasts for years.

› Common fate: elements are likely to be 
per ceived as a unit if they move in the same 
direction.
› Continuing line: lines are always perceived as 
following the simplest path. If two lines break, 
the viewer sees the overall movement rather than 
the break; also called implied line.
One or more principles (or devices) may be 
employed to get the desired results for unity. Here 
are some of them.
Correspondence
When you repeat an element such as color, value, 
shape, texture, or parallel directions or establish a 
style, like a linear style, you establish a visual con-
nection or correspondence among the elements.
Continuity is related to correspondence. It is 
the handling of design elements—like line, shape, 
texture, and color—to create similarities of form. 
In other words, continuity is used to create a fam-
ily resemblance. For example, if you were design-
ing stationery, you would want to handle the type, 
shapes, colors, and any graphic elements on the 
letterhead, envelope, and business card in a simi-
lar way to establish a family resemblance among 
the three pieces.
Unity is one of the primary goals of composi-
tion—composing an integrated whole, not unrelated 
component parts. In Figure 2-16, Luba Lukova 
creates unity through similarity (letterforms and 
illustrations share common characteristics) and 
corresponding use of red and yellow throughout, 
as well as through echoing the stepped staircase 
in the red polygon shape containing the title. In 
a series (related independent pieces), such as Fig-
ure 2-17, the package design system created by 
Louise Fili, each package design is uniﬁ ed on its 
own (through compositional move ments—circular 
move ments in the typography and graphic ele-
ments—echoing one another and sympathetic 
visualization). Each design is also uniﬁ ed as a series 
through corresponding (shared) characteristics and 
through a consistent layout (consistent positioning 
of elements).

Flaming Lips, although there is a variety of differ-
ent elements—small silhouetted ﬁ gures atop the 
spaceship, the spaceship’s legs and ground made 
Elements can share likeness in shape, texture, 
color, and direction. Dissimilar elements tend to 
separate from like elements.
› Proximity: elements near each other, in spatial 
proximity, are perceived as belonging together.
› Continuity: perceived visual paths or connec-
tions (actual or implied) among parts; elements 
that appear as a continuation of previous elements 
are perceived as linked, creating an impression of 
movement.
› Closure: the mind’s tendency to connect indi -
vidual elements to produce a completed form, 
unit, or pattern.

• CLIENT: TESCO
The U.K.’s leading supermarket retailer, Tesco, recently launched a new sub-brand of prepared 
and ready-made meals—Finest—with packaging and identity designed by Pentagram. The range 
was devised to target a new market for the more discerning customers who require food of 
exceptional quality and want a restaurant experience in the comfort of their own home.
It was important for Pentagram to design packaging that refl ected an air of freshness and 
quality, personifi ed professional cooking, and positioned the new line above Tesco’s current 
range of Luxury products.
A two- and three-dimensional visual language was designed using simple geometric shapes for 
the structure of the packs, to which clear, elegant graphics were applied.
The packs, predominately silver and black, have an understated quality which was created by 
reducing the size of the pictures rather than using full-bleed images often seen on own brand 
products. Each pack was divided geometrically, the pictures placed in the top left corner taking 
up either an eighth, sixth, or quarter of the whole. The photography has an editorial style that 
adds to the refi ned appearance of the packaging.

from photographic collage elements, black and 
white type versus colored/patterned type—there 
is continuity through the structure of the compo-
sition, where the curve of the spaceship strongly 
echoes the curve of “Lips.” A certain level of vari-
ety can exist and still allow for continuity.
Structure and Unity
Various structural devices can aid in unifying a 
static page or multiple-page applications. Modu-
lar systems, grids, and mathematical devices and 
alignment can aid in establishing unity; these will 
be examined in depth in Chapter 6.
Viewers will perceive a greater sense of unity 
in a composition when they see or sense visual 
connections through the alignment of elements, 
objects, or edges. Because viewers seek order, 
their eyes easily pick up these relationships and 
make connections among the forms. Alignment
is the positioning of visual elements relative to 
one another so that their edges or axes line up. A 
graphic structure, such as the grid, used to orga-
nize the placement of visual elements incorporates 
guides that naturally lend themselves to align-
ment. All the type on the packaging system for 
Tesco is aligned ﬂ ush left (Figure 2-19). Besides 
the type alignment, other design decisions con-
tribute to unity in this design solution—color,

In this historic work by Bayer, 
monumentality is established by 
contrasting the size of the egg in 
the foreground with the burning 
buildings in the background. The 
contrast in scale, enhanced by the 
extreme light and dark lighting, 
results in dramatic communication.
way a designer uses scale can relate to our under-
standing of the relative size of real objects, such 
as the relative size of an apple compared to a tree. 
Through our experience of the natural world, we 
expect an apple to be much smaller than a tree. 
If a designer plays with our expectations, distort-
ing scale as we normally see it in nature, then the 
result is surreal or fantastic as in Figure 2-20.
Along with utilizing fundamental principles, 
one must control scale for the following reasons:
› Manipulating scale can lend visual variety to
a composition.
› Scale adds contrast, dynamism, and positive ten-
sion to relationships between and among shapes 
and forms.
› Manipulation of scale can create the illusion of 
three-dimensional space.
PROPORTION 
Proportion is the comparative size relationships 
of parts to one another and to the whole. Ele-
ments or parts are compared to the whole in 
typefaces, and position of photographs in relation 
to the ﬂ ush-left alignment of type.
Elements should be arranged so that the audi-
ence is led from one element to another through 
the design. Flow is also called movement and is 
connected to the principle of rhythm. Rhythm, 
in part, is about a sense of movement from one 
element to another.
SCALE
In a design, scale is the size of an element or form 
seen in relation to other elements or forms within 
the format. Scale is based on proportional rela-
tionships between and among forms. Tradition-
ally, architects show a person standing next to or 
in front of a model or illustration of a building to 
best give an idea about the size of the building; 
the person is understood in scale to the building. 
In general, we best understand the size of visual 
elements in relation to other visual elements. The 

G R A P H I C  D E S I G N :  T H E  B A S I C S

terms of magnitude, measure, and/or quantity. 
For example, the size relationship of an average-
height person’s head to his or her body is a pro-
portional relationship; the viewer expects there 
to be one head and expects the head to be in a 
particular proportion to the (average) body. Also, 
if the head is not in a logical proportion to the 
body, then the viewer would expect that other 
elements or parts might be out of proportion as 
well. That expectation implies a “standard” rela-
tionship among elements, such that if one var-
ies from the “norm” or standard, then another 
element-to-whole relationship should vary in the 
same manner. When the viewer’s expectations 
are intentionally challenged, the designer creates 
a visual surprise, possibly a surreal solution, or a 
disjunctive appearance.
For designers and artists, there is also an addi-
tional implied meaning to proportion. It is an aes-
thetic arrangement—a harmonious or agreeable 
relationship of parts or elements within a whole, 
where reciprocity of balance exists lending to har-
mony. In design, harmony is agreement within 
a composition, where elements are constructed, 
arranged, and function in relation to one another 
to an agreeable effect. Art critic John Ruskin said: 
“In all perfectly beautiful objects there is found 
the opposition of one part to another and a recip-
rocal balance.” Certainly, Ruskin’s view bestows 
value on aesthetics and beauty. Today, a designer 
can deliberately play with expected proportion in 
a composition with the hope of creating a graphic 
impact that is not “conventionally” or “classically” 
beautiful or even remotely about beauty.
MATHEMATICAL R ATIOS 
AND PROPORTIONAL 
SYSTEMS
Since the time of ancient Greece, at various points 
in Western art, artists, architects, and musicians 
were interested in determining ideal proportions. 
They looked to math for a system of creating 
ideal proportions that could be applied to the 
visual arts, music, and architecture. Most design-
ers prefer to rely on their learned and innate sense 
of proportion; however, some employ graphic 
devices that can aid in establishing harmony, such 
as Fibonacci numbers and the golden section, 
among others.
FIBONACCI NUMBERS
Fibonacci numbers are named after the medi-
eval Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also 
known as Fibonacci. The numbers constitute a 
numerical series which begins with 0 and 1. Each 
subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of 
the two numbers preceding it, yielding the series 
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.
Fibonacci squares (Diagram 2-17) have sides 
with lengths that correspond to the numbers in 
the Fibonacci sequence. Placing two squares with 
sides of 1 next to each other constructs a 1 × 2 
(or 2 × 1) rectangle. That is, the short side of the 
rectangle is 1 unit in length and the long side is 
2 units. Placing a square with a side of 2 next to 
the long side of the 1 × 2 rectangle creates a new, 
2 × 3 rectangle. Likewise, adding a square with a 
side of 3 to the long side of that rectangle yields a

value that in turn approximates the golden ratio, 
a mathematical constant, which is approximately 
1.618.
THE GOLDEN RATIO
The golden ratio, commonly denoted by the 
Greek letter phi (φ), refers to a geometric rela-
tionship in which a longer length a is to a shorter 
length b as the sum of the lengths (a + b) is to a.
Mathematically, the golden ratio can be expressed 
as: (a + b)/a = a/b = 1.618.
Conversely, a/(a + b) = b/a = 0.618. The golden 
ratio is also referred to as the golden mean, golden 
number, or divine proportion. A rectangle whose 
ratio of length to width is the golden ratio is a 
golden rectangle. (The rectangles built from Fibo-
nacci squares approximate golden rectangles.)
A golden section is a line segment sectioned 
into two unequal parts, a and b, such that the total 
length (a + b) is to the longer section a as a is to 
the shorter section b:
Again, stated algebraically,
(a + b)/a = a/b
In Western art, shapes or structures deﬁ ned by 
or based on the golden section have been con-
sidered aesthetically pleasing by many artists, 
designers, and architects. For example, architect

new rectangle with sides of 3 and 5. The addition 
of a square with a side of 5 then yields a 5 × 8 
rectangle, a square of 8 yields an 8 × 13 rectangle, 
and so on. (The ratio of the long to the short side 
of each rectangle constructed in this way from 
Fibonacci squares approximates the golden ratio, 
discussed below.)
A Fibonacci spiral (Diagram 2-18) can be cre-
ated by drawing quarter circles through a set of 
Fibonacci squares. Connecting the opposite cor-
ners of the squares yields a spiral like many found 
in plants, seashells, and other forms in nature.
The ratio between adjacent numbers in the 
Fibonacci sequence approximates 1.6. That is, 
5/3, 8/5, 13/8, and 21/13 all approximate 1.6, a

Le Corbusier used the golden ratio as the basis 
of his modular architectural system. The golden 
ratio is still used today in graphic design, ﬁ ne art, 
and architecture. Graphic designers utilize the 
golden section for grid systems and page formats. 
Although the U.S. standard size page (8.5 × 11 
inches) and the European standard size page (210 
× 297 mm) are not golden section proportions, a 
golden section can be inscribed in each (Diagram 
2-19). Likewise, a website’s proportions are not 
golden-section based; however, a golden section 
can be inscribed in it.
People in the visual arts have different views 
on ideal proportions depending on their culture, 
education, and philosophy. Some think pursuing 
ideal proportions is an important pursuit; others 
ﬁ nd different ways of addressing scale, propor-
tion, grids, and page formats without utilizing 
mathematical ratios.
ILLUSION AND THE 
MANIPULATION
OF GR APHIC SPACE
To understand illusion, we need to revisit point 
and line and see that they can build a form, a shape 
that has the illusion of existing in three-dimen-
sional space. A form can give the illusion of hav-
ing weight, mass, or solidity. We start with a point 
(dot), which describes a speciﬁ c place or position 
in space; it has no length, breadth, or volume. That 
point can move and become a line, which is the 
path of a moving dot (see Diagram 2-20).
VOLUME
A line has length but no breadth. A line also 
has position or direction and can form the border 
of a plane. A plane is a two-dimensional surface 
bound by lines that deﬁ nes the outside of a form, 
a volume. A plane has length and breadth but no 
thickness; it has position and direction. (Essen-
tially, it is a conceptual surface.)
Volume is the representation of mass on a two-
dimensional surface; it can be bound by planes 
and has position in space. It also is called mass.
Form as volume creates the illusion of three-
dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface.

PROGRESSION 
FROM POINT
TO VOLUME
Picture Plane
Volume on a two-dimensional surface can be 
deﬁ ned as the illusion of a form with mass or weight 
(a shape with a back as well as a front). When you 
set out to create a design on a two-dimensional 
surface, like a board or a piece of paper, you begin 
with a blank, ﬂ at surface. That surface is called the 
picture plane. It is your point of departure; it is 
where you begin to create your design.
As soon as you make one mark on the surface 
of the page, you begin to play with the picture 
plane and possibly create the illusion of spatial 
depth. The illusion of spatial depth means the 
appearance of three-dimensional space, where 
some things appear closer to the viewer and some 
things appear farther away—just as in actual 
space. The illusion of spatial depth can be shallow 
or deep, recessive or projected.
Foreground, Middle Ground, Background
We tend to see graphic elements in terms of three 
main planes: the foreground (the part of a compo-
sition that appears nearest the viewer), the middle 
ground (an intermediate position between the 
foreground and the background), and the back-
ground (the part of a composition that appears 
in the distance or behind the most important 
part). Once those planes are established, the 
viewer begins to enter the piece by deciphering 
the information presented. The designer needs to 
give visual cues as to where to enter. Most observ-
ers look at foreground elements ﬁ rst.

It is possible to create such impressive illusions 
that the viewer, at ﬁ rst sight, doubts whether the 
thing depicted is real or a representation. This 
effect is called trompe l’oeil. The use of shadows 
and overlapping shapes can create effects fool-
ing the viewer into thinking the elements are 
actually adhered to the surface rather than an 
illusion, as in Figure 2-24, the cover for Design
Quarterly 110. Overlapping shapes or forms can 
also increase the illusion of spatial depth. When 
you overlap shapes, one shape appears to be in 
front of the other. Layering also increases the 
illusion of depth.

PRESENTATION
PRESENTATION OF PRINTED 
DESIGN SOLUTIONS
Designs should be printed on good quality, double-
sided, matte photo paper. Print the image at the 
largest size possible to fi t on the paper (size to 
coordinate with your portfolio binder, if applicable), 
allowing for a 1" to 2" margin. Print each solution 
on its own page.
All images must be at high-resolution. Do not 
include any borders or additional graphics, as these 
would interfere with the composition of the pre-
sented work.
DIGITAL DESIGN SOLUTIONS
For the digital presentations, the suggestions are 
the same as print except that the images should 
be PDFs or 72 dpi resolution for embedded images 
on websites. Display of images on websites should 
load quickly and be easy to navigate through in a 
linear progression: forward and back.

1. In 1890, Austrian philosopher Christian von Ehrenfels introduced

moving toward a point on the horizon, called 
the vanishing point, will imitate the recession of 
space into the distance and create the illusion 
of spatial depth. Perspective is a schematic way
of translating three-dimensional space onto a 
two-dimensional surface (Diagram 2-21). Volu-
metric shapes, such as cubes, cones, and cylinders, 
can also create the illusion of spatial depth.
Remember, as a designer manipulating graphic 
space, you have many choices. You can maintain 
the ﬂ atness of the picture plane or create the illu-
sion of spatial depth. You can create a shallow or 
deep space or create the illusion that forms are 
projecting forward. Understanding the illusion of 
spatial depth will enlarge your design vocabulary 
and enhance your ability to affect an audience.
The foundation of a solid graphic design edu-
cation begins with the study of two-dimensional 
design—the formal elements, the principles of 
design, and the manipulation of graphic space. 
This study provides the basic perceptual and con-
ceptual skills necessary to study typography, lay-
out, and graphic design applications.

PEOPLE WHO BECOME DESIGNERS HAVE AN 
AFFINITY FOR IMAGERY. CREATING IMAGERY OR UNDERSTANDING IMAGERY 
COMES FAIRLY EASILY TO THEM. PEOPLE WITH AN AFFINITY FOR TYPE—WHO 
CONSIDER TYPE AN INTEGRAL ELEMENT OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION—TEND 
TO HAVE MORE FACILITY DESIGNING WITH TYPE. IF YOU VIEW TYPE MERELY 
AS LITERAL CONTENT, TYPOGRAPHY BECOMES A CHALLENGE. ONCE YOU 
EMBRACE TYPE’S CRITICAL ROLE IN GRAPHIC DESIGN, YOU CAN BEST THINK 
ABOUT TYPE AND DESIGN WITH TYPE.
If you are designing with type for a branded environment, that context is different from 
designing type for a business card. However, there are basic guiding principles. Type is form 
and should be evaluated based on aesthetic criteria of shape, proportion, and balance. Type commu-
nicates on a denotative and connotative level. Type has to be thoughtfully integrated with visuals. 
Type should be readable. Margins present text type and need to be respected. Transitions between 
letters, words, and paragraphs are critical—spacing can make or break communication.
Typography is the design of letterforms and the arrangement of them in two-dimensional 
space (for print and screen-based media) and in space and time (for motion and interactive 
media). Type is used as display or as text. Display type functions as a dominant typographic 
component and is usually large or bold. It functions as titles and subtitles, headlines and sub-
headlines, headings and subheadings. Text type is the main body of written content, usually 
in the form of paragraphs, columns, or captions.
NOMENCLATURE AND ANATOMY 
Today, almost all type is produced digitally or is handmade; however, most type terminology 
is based on the earlier process, when type was cast in relief on a three-dimensional piece of 
metal (Diagram 3-01), which was then inked and printed. Some key terms follow; for more 
on nomenclature, including charts and terms, go to our website. 
› Letterform: the particular style and form of each individual letter of our alphabet. Each 
letter of an alphabet has unique characteristics that must be preserved to retain the legibility 
of the symbols as representing sounds of speech.
› Typeface: the design of a single set of letterforms, numerals, and signs uniﬁ ed by consis-
tent visual properties created by a type designer. These properties create the essential charac-
ter, which remains recognizable even if the face is modiﬁ ed by design.
› Type font: a complete set of letterforms, numerals, and signs, in a particular face, size, and 
style, that is required for written communication (to see The Typographic Font Chart, go to 
our website). 
› Type family: several font designs contributing a range of style variations based upon a 
single typeface design. Most type families include at least a light, medium, and bold weight, 
each with its own italic (to see The Typographic Family Chart, go to our website).

variations in weight (light, medium, bold), width 
(condensed, regular, extended), and angle (Roman 
or upright, and italic), as well as elaborations on 
the basic form (outline, shaded, decorated).
› Stroke: a straight or curved line forming a letter.
› Serif: a small element added to the upper or 
lower end of the main stroke of a letterform.
› Italics: letterforms that slope to the right, a 
style variant of a typeface within a type family. 
Italics also refer to typefaces that suggest a cursive 
origin, inspired by written forms.
› Type style: modiﬁ cations in a typeface that 
create design variety while retaining the essen-
tial visual character of the face. These include

Chapter  03
Spatial Measurement
A designer measures type as well as the spatial 
intervals between typographic elements. These 
intervals occur between letters, between words, 
and between two lines of type. The spatial inter-
val between letters is called letterspacing. Adjust-
ing the letterspacing is called kerning. The spatial 
interval between words is word spacing. The 
spatial interval between two lines of type is line
spacing, traditionally called leading in metal type, 
where strips of lead of varying thickness (mea-
sured in points) were used to increase the space 
between lines of type. Many people still use the 
term leading to mean line spacing: the distance 
between two lines of type, measured vertically 
from baseline to baseline.
In metal type, letterspacing and word spacing 
are produced by the insertion of quads—metal 
blocks shorter than the type height—between 
pieces of metal type. Both traditionally and today, 
an “em” is used as a unit of measure. An em is 
the square of the point size of any type—a unit 
of type measurement based on the “M” charac-
ter. One half of an em is called an “en.” In digi-
tal typography, spacing is controlled using a unit 
system. A unit is a subdivision of the em, used 
in measuring and counting characters in photo-
graphic and digital typesetting systems.1 The unit 
is a relative measurement determined by dividing 
the em into thin, equal, vertical measurements. 
When characters are digitally generated, each has 
a unit value including space on either side of the 
letter for the purpose of letterspacing, which can 
be adjusted by the designer.
BASIC TYPE SPECIFICATIONS
When a designer wants to indicate the type size 
and the leading, the following form is used: 10/11 
indicates a type size of 10 with 1 point leading; 
8/11 indicates a type size of 8 with 3 points lead-
ing. The amount of leading you choose depends on 
several factors, such as the type size, the x-height, 
the line length, and the length of the ascenders 
and descenders. When a designer does not want 
additional space between lines, type is set solid;
that is, with no additional points between lines, 
such as 10/10 (Diagram 3-02).
› Sans serif: a typeface with no serifs.
› Weight: the thickness of the strokes of a letter-
form, determined by comparing the thickness of 
the strokes in relation to the height—for example, 
light, medium, and bold.
TYPOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENT
The traditional system of typographic measure-
ment utilizes two basic units: the point and the 
pica. The height of type is measured in points, and 
the width of a letter or a line of type is measured in 
picas. Point size is the height of the body of a let-
ter in a typeface; originating in metal type, it was a 
slug of lead the typeface was set upon. The width 
of a typeface is measured in characters per pica.
Most type is available in sizes ranging from 5 
points to 72 points. Type that is 14 points and 
less is used for setting text and is called text type 
or body copy. Sizes above 14 points are used for 
display type.
Line length, which is the horizontal length of a 
line of type, is measured in picas. Approximately 
6 picas = 1 inch; 12 points = 1 pica; approximately 
72 points = 1 inch. Determining a suitable line 
length for readability depends on the design of 
the speciﬁ c typeface, type size, line spacing, and 
length of the content.

CLASSIFICATIONS 
OF TYPE
Although numerous typefaces are available today, 
there are some major classiﬁ cation categories, by 
style and history, into which most fall (see Dia-
grams 3-03 and 3-04). It should be noted that 
these classiﬁ cations are not hard and fast but vary 
among type historians.2 Some classiﬁ cations of 
type are:
› Old Style: Roman typeface, introduced in the 
late ﬁ fteenth century, most directly descended in 
form from letters drawn with a broad-edged pen. 
Characterized by angled and bracketed serifs and 
biased stress, some examples are Caslon, Gara-
mond, Hoeﬂ er Text, and Times New Roman.
› Transitional: serif typeface, originating in the 
eighteenth century, represents a transition from 
Old Style to Modern, exhibiting design charac-
teristics of both; for example, Baskerville, Cen-
tury, and ITC Zapf International.
› Modern: serif typeface, developed in the late 
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, whose 
form is more geometric in construction, as opposed 
to the Old Style typefaces, which stayed close to 
forms created by the chisel-edged pen. Character-
ized by greatest thick–thin stroke contrast, vertical 
stress, and most symmetrical of all Roman type-
faces; for example, Didot, Bodoni, and Walbaum.

ALIGNMENT
The style or arrangement of setting text type is 
called type alignment (Diagram 3-05). (The term 
alignment here is used more speciﬁ cally than its 
broader deﬁ nition in Chapter 2.) The primary 
options are as follows:
› Left-aligned: text aligned to the left margin 
and ragged or uneven on the right side; also called 
left-justiﬁ cation or ﬂ ush left/ragged right.
› Right-aligned: text aligned to the right margin 
and ragged or uneven on the left margin.
› Justiﬁ ed: text aligned on both the left and 
right sides.
› Centered: lines of type centered on an imagi-
nary central vertical axis.
› Asymmetrical: lines composed for asymmetri-
cal balance—not conforming to a set, repetitive 
arrangement.
TYPE AS SHAPES
Each letterform is made up of positive and nega-
tive shapes. The strokes of the letterform are the 
positive shapes (sometimes just called forms), 
and the spatial areas created and shaped by the 
letterform are the negative shapes (or counter-
forms). The term counterform includes counters, 
the shapes deﬁ ned within the forms, as well as 
the negative forms created between adjacent let-
terforms. The negative forms are as important as 
the positive forms, as demonstrated in the design 
of the logos in Figure 3-01 and Figure 3-02, 
where respectively, the “E” and “9” are formed by 
the negative shapes.
Each letterform has distinguishing character-
istics. Some letters are closed shapes, like the “O” 
and “B,” and some letters are open forms, like the 
“V” and “C.” The same letterform can vary in form 
depending on the typeface, such as this lowercase 
g in the Times face and this lowercase g in the 
Helvetic face. Have you ever noticed the varia-
tions of the form of the letter “O” in the different 
typefaces? For example, the “O” in some typefaces 
is circular and in others it is oval (Diagram 3-06). 
You may want to compare letterforms in a few 
classic typefaces such as Bodoni, Garamond, 
Century Old Style, Futura, Times Roman, and 
Univers. (In this case, classic means a typeface 
› Slab Serif: serif typeface characterized by 
heavy, slablike serifs, introduced in the early nine-
teenth century; sub-categories are Egyptian and 
Clarendons. Slab serif typefaces include Ameri-
can Typewriter, Memphis, ITC Lubalin Graph, 
Bookman, and Clarendon.
› Sans Serif: typefaces characterized by the 
absence of serifs, introduced in the early nine-
teenth century; for example, Futura, Helvetica, 
and Univers. Some letterforms without serifs 
have thick and thin strokes, such as Grotesque, 
Franklin Gothic, Universal, and Frutiger. Sans 
serif typeface subcategories include Grotesque, 
Humanist, Geometric, and others.
› Gothic: typefaces based upon the thirteenth- 
to ﬁ fteenth-century medieval manuscript letter-
form; also called blackletter. Gothic characteristics 
include a heavy stroke weight and condensed letters 
with few curves. Gutenberg’s ﬁ rst printing types 
were textura, a Gothic style. Examples include 
Textura, Rotunda, Schwabacher, and Fraktur.
› Script: typeface that most resembles handwrit-
ing. Letters usually slant and often are joined. 
Script types can emulate forms written with a 
chisel-edged pen, ﬂ exible pen, pointed pen, pen-
cil, or brush; for example, Brush Script, Shelley 
Allegro Script, and Snell Roundhand Script.
› Display: typefaces that are used primarily for 
headlines and titles and would be more difﬁ cult 
to read as text type; they often are more elaborate, 
decorated, or handmade, and fall into any of the 
other classiﬁ cations.

“But the visual aspects of type are meant to rein-
force the verbal message. They provide context for the 
voice of the speaker, whether an individual or insti-
tution. As such, type choice is a critical aspect of effec-
tive communication.
“In addition, type treatment provides subtle levels 
of meaning to the reader. Violations of typographic 
norms can communicate in their own right, but they 
usually result from lack of care or skill on the part of 
the designer. Following these norms with respect to let-
terform proportion, letterspacing, wordspacing, lead-
ing, etc., results in messages that effectively convey the 
meaning of the speaker.”

that has become a standard because of its grace, 
readability, and effectiveness.) It is a good idea to 
be so familiar with at least two classic typefaces 
that you know every curve and angle by heart.
TYPOGRAPHIC TEXTURE 
One way to determine the graphic impact of a 
typographic solution is to measure the “typo-
graphic texture” of the solution. Here the term 
typographic texture, also called typographic color,
refers to the overall density or tonal quality of a 
mass of type on a ﬁ eld—page or screen, usually 
referring to the mass of text type. In graphic design 
applications that require blocks of text, the value of 
the mass of the type block, paragraph, or column 
takes on a tonal quality, creating a block of gray 
tone. (See the typography in the spreads in Figure 
4-11 as an example of typographic texture.) Typo-
graphic texture is established through the spacing 
of letters, words, and lines; by the characteristics 
of the typeface; by the pattern created by the let-
terforms; by the contrast of Roman to italic, bold 
to light; and by the variations in typefaces, column 
widths, and alignment.
Variations in typographic texture from para-
graph to paragraph on a single ﬁ eld could
contribute to the illusion of depth or could inter-
rupt reading. For this reason, you must consider 
how you create typographic texture and for
what purpose.
Here is a tip: Stand back and squint at typog-
raphy to get a sense of its “lightness or darkness,” 
its tonal quality, or view it in a mirror.
DESIGNING WITH TYPE
“The most important thing to keep in mind when 
designing with type is that its purpose is to commu-
nicate. It needs to be comprehended, usually quickly 
and easily.
“Type is inherently verbal in nature. That’s not 
to say that it doesn’t have a visual component as 
well. Every typeface has characteristics that convey 
meaning, however subtle or overt. Consider black-
letter, wood type, and script faces. Letterforms from 
these categories contain an abundance of culturally 
informed information.

COMPARISON OF LETTERFORMS

language is of a peculiar 19th-century style—
turning back on itself, using clauses to modify 
clauses to modify clauses, and a vocabulary suited 
to Victorian descriptions. The typography alludes 
to the period: De Vinne and a host of other type-
faces are from that period.”
Choosing a suitable face depends upon several 
factors:
› Visual Interest: Aesthetics and Impact
As with any graphic design, creating visual inter-
est is paramount. Creating or selecting a typeface 
for its aesthetic value and the impact it will have 
on screen or in print is as important as creating a 
visual. The individual characteristics of a typeface 
matter greatly to communication and how well 
any typeface will integrate with the characteristics 
of the visuals. Each typeface should be evaluated 
for its characteristics, aesthetic value based on 
proportion, balance, visual weight, positive and 
negative shapes of each individual letter, as well as 
shape relationships between and among letters.
Realizing how display type will be seen in con-
text—up close, its impact from a distance, where 
it is seen, lighting conditions, and more—should 
be a consideration. How a typeface looks as dis-
play or text must be tested and evaluated. John 
Sayles suggests doing the following exercise:
“If there is a font I use more than others it is prob-
ably_____ because . . .
“—Helvetica: simple, easy to read, portrays a clear 
message”
› Appropriateness: Concept
Jay Miller, Principal, IMAGEHAUS, further 
advises: “Before you choose a typeface, clearly 
deﬁ ne the audience, tone, personality and attitude 
of what you are trying to communicate and how 
you want to say it. This will help you strategi-
cally choose the right font to ensure successful 
communication.”
Very often, beginning students and nondesign-
ers simply choose typefaces for their attractive-
ness and do not consider the concept or have 
little understanding of what a typeface connotes, 
of its history, and of its provenance. For example, 
choosing a face associated with a period, such as 
Developing typographic skills entails designing and
selecting for clarity and visual interest, which means:
› Selecting a typeface or type family suitable for 
concept, audience, context, and application
› Facilitating reading through determining proper 
point sizes, spacing, line length, alignment, col-
umn depth, variation, and contrast
› Orchestrating ﬂ ow of information through vis-
ual hierarchy

When there are thousands of typefaces readily 
available, and more being designed each day, how

and content of the poem. Nix comments, “The

and toward the spine like a legend,

than numbered.

art deco, or associated with an era or industry car-
ries meaning, even if you aren’t aware of it.
This is where knowing type classiﬁ cations
and history comes strongly into play. For exam-
ple, would you use American nineteenth-century 
wood type for a magazine article about the history 
of East Asia? Or would it be sound to use Tobias 
Frere-Jones’s typeface Whitney (for the Whitney 
Museum in New York) for a catalog for the Prado 
Museum in Madrid or for a dog food brand?
For a retrospective of Werner Herzog ﬁ lms 
at San Francisco’s Museum of Modern Art, Jer-
emy Mende, MendeDesign, wanted the poster 
to communicate the essence of selected Herzog 
ﬁ lms, about man’s struggle against the universe, 
while also communicating something about Her-
zog himself. In an interview with Romy Ashby 
in Step Inside Design magazine, Mende said about 
Figure 3-04,
“We chose the horizon to represent this vast, 
unyielding force and selected ﬁ lm stills that suggested 
the smallness of man against this backdrop.” Romy 
Ashby explains, “Over those images, lists of adjectives 
were written—words such as conquistador, soldier, 
baron and mystic—meant to purposefully confuse 
descriptions of Herzog’s main characters with descrip-
tions of Herzog himself. At ﬁ rst glance the typography 
appears to be digitally generated, and most people will 
assume that it is. But up close, idiosyncrasies of hand-
drawn letterforms become apparent, revealing an 
obsessive attempt to recreate ‘the perfect’ that Herzog 
likewise obsessively seeks to capture in his ﬁ lms.” 3
› Clarity: Readability and Legibility
If typography is readable and legible, then content 
should be clearly understood. Essentially, ensur-
ing readability means text is easy to read, thereby 
making reading enjoyable (and frustration-free) 
as well as interesting. How you design with a suit-
able typeface, with considerations of size, spacing, 
margins, color, and paper selection, contributes to 
readability. Legibility has to do with how easily a 
person can recognize the letters in a typeface—
how the characteristics of each individual letter-
form are distinguished. Here are some pointers:
› Typefaces that are too light or too heavy may 
be difﬁ cult to read, especially in smaller sizes.

report, or a government website, that prerequisite 
should narrow your choices to faces that are emi-
nently readable, as well as a face from an extended 
type family, which offers many options while aid-
ing unity. (Most likely, a text-heavy application 
also will call for a column grid.)
Text and Images
If an application has an almost equal volume of 
text and images, then you need to select a highly 
readable face based on your design concept, audi-
ence, context (print or screen and environment), a 
typeface that integrates in a satisfactory, appropri-
ate, and aesthetic manner with the images. Also 
consider how the type will act as text, caption, 
and perhaps display type all in relation to the 
images, as in Figure 3-08. (See “Case Study: Rut-
gers University-Newark: A Century of Reaching 
Higher.”)
Image Heavy
If an application primarily requires display type 
(title or headline), for example, a cover, poster, 
advertisement, splash page, or banner, then your 
selection is primarily governed by concept and 
context. Although some argue that readability of 
display type is not critical because there is little 
content to read, I submit that people become frus-
trated when readability is diminished. For display 
type, some people argue that a well-designed sans 
serif typeface is most legible—easiest to recog-
nize. Others argue that serifs aid in distinguish-
ing one letter from another. For display type, any 
well-designed face would likely be legible, which 
is certainly a concern because people tend to read 
titles and headlines very quickly. Judicious spacing 
and larger point sizes will increase the readability 
of display type. To encourage a reading sequence, 
thoughtful placement and positioning within the 
composition are important as well.
Caption Heavy
If the typography in an application is predomi-
nantly captions or tables—for example, a catalog, 
map, art book, or photo sharing website—then 
your selection should consider how readable the 
face is at a smaller point size and how well it inte-
grates with the images.

that particular decade
Now that we had identiﬁ ed our elements, we 
started to investigate formats. The horizontal for-
mat seemed to make the most sense because we 
were presenting a historical timeline. We considered 
a smaller format since this publication would be a 
gift to donors for the centennial gala celebration. 
The smaller format had a more personal, intimate 
feeling. The grid structure was determined loosely 
on a mathematical equation using the golden sec-
tion, which would help us determine the best pro-
portions of text to page format. Once we started 
playing with the elements on the page, we did make 
the necessary optical adjustments. After all, design 
is not a perfect science.
We felt, with our access to a seemingly end-
less library of rich historical images, it was a great 
opportunity to convey a sense of time through the 
use of images. Each chapter opens with a snap-
shot image of the campus during that particular 
decade. This helps the viewer place content in the 
context of the time period.
In each chapter, we decided to create illustra-
tions/collages to help communicate the social, 
political, and academic pulse of that particular 
time period. We reinforced this notion with the 
suggestion and design of a small timeline high-
lighting the events taking place in Newark. The 
university’s historical facts were then juxtaposed 
with the major events of the world at that par-
ticular time in history. We felt it would help the 
viewer put in context the achievements, actions, 
and demographics of each particular decade.
Academic collateral was used throughout the 
book as a foundation for the design. We gathered 
and scanned various papers, book spines, docu-
ments, yearbook images, student newspapers, 
folders, notebooks, and so on to help reinforce 
the tone of an academic environment. We also 
Description: This is a publication commissioned 
by the university to celebrate the 100-year history 
of higher education in Newark, NJ.
Problem: Design a publication for the university 
highlighting the rich 100-year history of higher 
education in Newark.
Process: We were provided with a rough manu-
script of the history of higher education in New-
ark. After reading it, we discussed revisions with 
the editor. We felt the manuscript lacked a neces-
sary structure. With the editor, we reworked the 
manuscript from less of a narrative to more of a 
time-based, progressive history. At this time, we 
also began sorting through the images we were 
provided and categorizing them into decades. We 
collected the yearbooks throughout the decades, 
as well as student newspapers, miscellaneous doc-
uments, papers, and folders. This collecting and 
gathering of materials, categorizing, and organiz-
ing was a necessary and very important ﬁ rst step 
for us. The research we compiled started to slowly 
reveal the structure and visual tone of the book.
Structure: It is important to understand that a 
designer doesn’t have to be a passive partner 
when it comes to establishing content. We were 
fortunate and took advantage of the opportunity 
to become active participants in establishing the 
content for the publication. From our interaction 
with the editor and our own research, we decided 
to divide the book into decades. We also decided 
we would need a system for the following infor-
mation in each chapter:
1 / Headline treatment
2 / Body copy
3 / Pull quote
4 / A timeline element
5 / An illustration to give the text a visual 
context
6 / A snapshot image of the campus or envi-
ronment of that particular decade

gave a greater presence to the copy and felt more 
balanced and inviting visually. The larger text 
takes on a greater importance and presence, which 
naturally makes the text feel less overwhelming 
and more accessible.
The body copy is designed using a two-column 
grid. Again, our grid was loosely based on the 
golden section; our goal was to balance propor-
tions of text to the page format. We wanted the 
copy to have a nice balance and inform the reader 
without feeling too dense and overwhelming. We 
did several iterations of the two-column page 
using various point sizes and leading. These stud-
ies were very instrumental in helping us achieve 
the proper balance for optimal readability.
introduced a small, silhouetted image of students 
appropriate for each decade to support the notion 
of an academic environment. These images also

Setting a rhythm or pace for any narrative/

sideration when not only establishing the use of 
images but also the typographic ﬂ ow of the book.
Each chapter opens with a large vertical head-
line, followed by a column of text set at a large 
point size. The use of the larger point size is more 
stylistic than functional. The text was originally 
designed using the same point size as the body 
copy, but the balance of the page visually seemed 
off. Increasing the point size for the ﬁ rst column

ORCHESTRATING FLOW 
OF INFORMATION
Just as with designing any visual hierarchy, many 
factors contribute to organizing type according to 
emphasis, from most important message to least 
important content.
The designer must determine what to empha-
size and what to de-emphasize. (Please see Chap-
ter 2 on two-dimensional basics for more general 
information on visual hierarchy.)
There are several ways to achieve emphasis 
within an entire composition using typography:
› Emphasis by isolation
› Emphasis by placement
› Emphasis through scale (size relationships of 
title to subtitle to text as well as to images)
› Emphasis through contrast
› Emphasis through direction and pointers
› Emphasis through diagrammatic structures
There are also ways to achieve emphasis in text 
type/body copy:
› Size
› Color
› Boldface
› Italics
› Typeface change
› Type style change—variations in weight (light, 
medium, bold), width (condensed, regular, ex-
tended), and angle (Roman or upright and italic), 
as well as elaborations on the basic form (outline, 
shaded, decorated)
Fundamental organizational principles also 
apply to typographic design. When arranging
typographic elements, besides visual hierarchy, you 
should consider rhythm and unity. You direct the 
reader from one typographic element to another 
by using visual hierarchy and rhythm (a pattern 
created through position of components, inter-
vals, repetition, and variation), by considering the 
FACILITATING READING
Socrates is attributed with extolling the desir-
able quality of moderation—“take everything in 
moderation; nothing in excess.” Applied to facili-
tating reading, this axiom would mean common 
sense dictates:
› Long line lengths impede readability
› Very small point sizes and extreme column 
depths impede reading
› Very open spacing and very tight spacing im-
pede readability
› Left justiﬁ cation or justiﬁ ed text type align-
ments are most readable (depending on attention 
to spacing)
› When composing text type, headings, and sub-
headings, break text into manageable chunks
› Avoid extreme rags, widows, and orphans
– The irregular side of a left-justiﬁ ed block of 
text type should not be extremely ragged; 
any ragged edge should not impede read-
ing. Major variation in line lengths will 
result in negative shapes that interrupt the 
ﬂ ow of moving from one line to the next.
– Avoid ending a paragraph or column with 
a widow, a very short line length usually 
composed of one or two words. Widows 
do not contribute to balance. The last line 
length should be long enough to act as a 
base or platform; it should have enough 
“visual word weight to carry” the paragraph 
or column, to ensure balance.
– Avoid starting a paragraph on the next 
page with an orphan, a one- or two-word 
line. This doesn’t look balanced.
To ensure readability, for text type especially, 
moderation is the rule. Display type can be more 
extreme, though readability is always an issue for 
all type as literal message.
Variation and contrast complement moderation. 
Without variation and/or contrast in text type, 
any reader would become tired and perhaps bored. 
Variation creates visual interest; break up text type 
with a

shapes between the letters in the second pair are 
quite different and can be moved closer together 
to enhance readability and cohesiveness.
You should always judge the letterspacing opti-
cally. When designing display type, it is feasible 
to adjust the spacing of individual characters 
because the number of words in headlines is lim-
ited. This ﬁ ne-tuning of negative space is a hall-
mark of typographic excellence.
TEXT TYPE: SPACING, PACING, 
CHUNKING, AND MARGINS
Spacing
When designing text, check word spacing, line 
length, widows, orphans, and the raggedness of 
a ragged edge.
Always consider the point size of the typeface 
in relation to the amount of spacing; for example, 
small point sizes set with a lot of leading will 
space between elements, and by establishing a 
sense of move ment from one element to another, 
as in Figure 3-09.
To establish unity, limit type alignments (for a 
novice, employ one alignment), consider employ-
ing a type family rather than mixing faces or mix 
two faces at most, intentionally integrate type and 
visuals using a sympathetic or purposeful contrast, 
use color to unify, and aim for correspondence.
In the logo design by Red Flannel, between the 
type and image Jim Redzinak ﬁ nds what is called 
an intuitive alignment, ﬁ nding edges that seem to 
naturally align well together (Figure 3-10), where 
the word “Spirit” seems to naturally “ﬁ t” in the 
negative shape of the butterﬂ y.
SPACING
The three types of spacing you have to control 
when designing with type are letterspacing, word 
spacing, and line spacing. Spacing should enhance 
reader comprehension or, at the very least, enrich 
the reader’s experience (unless, of course, your 
concept and approach call for purposeful disso-
nance). If people have difﬁ culty reading some-
thing, they probably will lose interest. Spacing
is about transitions—from letter to letter, from 
word to word, from line to line, from paragraph 
to paragraph, from page to page, from screen to 
screen. Seventy percent of how you design with 
type depends on how well you craft transitions!
When a character is produced digitally, the 
software automatically advances in numbers of 
units before generating the next character. It is 
not a good idea to rely on automatic spacing when 
designing with display type. The designer can 
control the letterspacing by adding or subtracting 
units between letters to improve readability.
Since computers calculate spatial intervals—
units—according to type metrics (preset calcu-
lations for each font), designers should consider 
the type as form, adjusting letter, word, and line 
spacing for balance and visual relationships. For 
example, the computer may automatically set the 
same distance between an “H” and an “N” as it 
does between an “L” followed by an “A,” yet the

chunk will become a tonal unit and help or impede 
moving from one unit to another.
Pacing involves creating a visual sense of 
rhythm, syncopation, variation—creating visual 
interest and giving the reader’s eyes a rest some-
where in the text.
Margins
Understanding margins as borders—as present-
ing written content—will undoubtedly aid in 
respectfully “framing” text, giving enough dis-
tance from the boundaries of a page, in print or 
on screen, to allow a reader to focus. Certainly, 
margins can be used creatively, but they can never 
be ignored or violated without purpose.
MIXING TYPEFACES
Most designers mix faces when they want dis-
tinction between display type and text type. Other 
designers mix for conceptual, creative, and/or 
aesthetic reasons. There are general type rules 
for beginners and, perhaps, for any designer. The 
most common rule is to restrict designing to uti-
lizing a type family or to no more than two typefaces.
Before our discussion of mixing faces, it behooves 
us to consider not mixing.
TYPE FAMILY
It’s been said that a type family is like a varia-
tion on a theme. In a family, all the typefaces 
maintain the same basic structure with variations, 
differentiated by slight individual characteristics. 
A well-conceived, well-designed family includes 
variation—variations in weight from ultra light to 
ultra black; variations in width from condensed 
to extended; multiple character sets, such as small 
capitals, titling capitals, swash capitals; and more. 
Employing a type family affords enormous ﬂ exibility 
as well as contributing to unity.
MIXING TWO TYPEFACES
Being creative involves experimentation. Hav-
ing guidelines or grasping standards allows you 
to critique your experiments. The following pro-
vides a point of departure for readable, coherent 
compositions.
seem “lost” and hard to read. Generally, longer 
line lengths should take more leading to offer 
some “breathing” room.
Too much space may detract from readability; 
conversely, too little space may make reading difﬁ -
cult. As stated earlier, you must not trust automatic 
spacing; always make adjustments. Also, in text 
and display type, uneven letterspacing and word 
spacing may cause unwanted pauses or interrup-
tions that make something more difﬁ cult to read. 
John Sayles advises being aware of word breaks 
(widows, orphans) and suggests reading the copy 
as you lay it out, following the same process as the 
reader, to ensure a ﬂ ow.
Similarly, if the line length is too long or too 
short, it will detract from readability. For example, 
some designers say that if you have open letter-
spacing, the word spacing should be open. Con-
versely, if you have tight letterspacing, the word 
spacing should be tight as well. Much depends on 
the typeface or family you are using and the point 
sizes, weights, and widths, since some typefaces 
seem to lend themselves to more open spacing 
because of their shapes; others lend themselves to 
tight spacing. Study specimens of display and text 
type to develop an “eye” for typefaces, weights, 
and widths.
Chunking and Pacing
When we read a novel or short story, we expect 
a full one-column page of text. Paragraphs help 
break up the page of a novel. In most instances—
newspapers, reports, brochures, and even text-
books—written content is most appealing when 
broken into modules, into chunks of written 
content. For any screen-based message, chunks of 
text are the best choice. (For screens, keep line 
lengths a bit shorter than for print.) When you 
modularize content, it is broken into manageable, 
digestible units. Many people scan written con-
tent for speciﬁ c information, which is enabled by 
chunking along with other devices such as rules, 
subheads, color, and other ways to create empha-
sis. Other readers ﬁ nd it easiest to take in infor-
mation and absorb it in module doses.
How you compose modules or chunks will cre-
ate a reading pace. Depending on the background 
color, typeface selection, and typeface color, each 
When setting type, 
whether it’s a big, 
two-word headline or 
a big, two-hundred-
page document, 
one of the most 
overlooked aspects 
is the space between 
the letters, the words, 
the sentences and 
the paragraphs. 
This is as important 
as which typeface 
you choose and at 
what size you use it. 
Everyone can look at 
type and design with 
it but it takes a real 
craftsperson to look 
at the negative space 
and define the true 
relationship within the 
typography. Whether 
it’s loose or tight, it
has to be consistent 
and pleasurable, and 
it’s right there, you 
just have to shift your 
attention.

HANDMADE/HAND-DRAWN TYPE
Although most rely on selecting from digital faces, 
others go for handmade type. Try hand-drawn, col-
laged type (not ransom type) or found type, which 
includes photographed type (for example, see 
www.neonmuseum.org). Some designers focus on 
hand-drawn typography, such as Ed Fella (Figure 
3-11), Martin Holloway (Figure 3-12), and Mike 
Experiment with Type
Experiment by testing how the typefaces work 
in various combinations: heading plus paragraph; 
short and long paragraphs; headings, subhead-
ings, captions; and so forth.
Limit Mixing and Select for Contrast
Most seasoned designers advise limiting mixing 
to two typefaces per solution—one for display and 
one for text—for example, a sans serif for display 
and a serif for readable text. The obvious point 
of mixing faces is differentiation (for example, to 
make captions distinct from text) and to add con-
trast to the visualization of a concept. The equally 
obvious reason to avoid selecting similar faces is 
that the reader would not be able to tell them 
apart. Therefore, select for contrast yet be mind-
ful of similar structure, with suitability to overall 
concept and visualization clearly in mind.
Selecting for contrast might mean mixing type-
faces based on differences in structure—selecting 
from different structural classiﬁ cations—for 
example, mixing a sans serif face with a slab serif 
face. Do consider how one face will transition to 
the other and how well their proportions work to 
create harmony and typographic texture on the 
ﬁ eld (page or screen).
Janet Slowik, Senior Art Director, Pearson Pro-
fessional & Career, advises: “In editorial design 
the type and image should coexist harmoniously, 
and one should never overpower the other. They 
should complement each other. Novice designers 
often select elaborate display typefaces that conﬂ ict 
with the image. A good selection of a serif and sans 
serif typeface that contain a corresponding italic is 
all that is needed . . . a proﬁ cient designer helps.”
Use Decorative Faces with Great Caution
Decorative faces tend to be highly ornamental, 
often faddish. Some have endured, such as those 
based on copperplate engravings or wood type. 
Many decorative faces include outlines, in-lines, 
stencils, or faceted, shaded, and shadowed letters; 
because decorative faces tend to overwhelm a 
design (and designer), they should be left to sea-
soned designers. If you must use a decorative face, 
use it for display type in very small quantities and 
mix with a timeless face for text.

TYPE AS SOLUTION
In addition to understanding the fundamentals of 
design and how they relate speciﬁ cally to design-
ing with type, it is essential to understand how type 
is used creatively and expressively. Type becomes 
the solution for the following design concepts. In 
Figure 3-16, Jeremy Mende expresses a confer-
ence theme in unique typography. The Mesa Grill 
logo is a play on the word mesa, which means 
“ﬂ at-topped mountain” (Figure 3-17).

EXERCISE 3-1
DESIGN YOUR NAME
➊ With the notion that your “handwriting” is you, 
your DNA so to speak, start by writing your name. 
Determine if your signature has any characteris-
tics that might characterize your personality.
➋ Write ten adjectives that describe your 
personality.
➌ Find typefaces that express your personality.
➍ Design your name in three different typefaces 
that you believe are appropriate.
➎ Now, hand make, hand draw, or hand letter the 
letterforms of your name, retaining any quirks or 
imperfections that might just be “you.”
➏ Give careful consideration to the spacing between 
the letters and words.
PROJECT 3-1
DESIGN A TYPE-DRIVEN POSTER 
Choice of subject: Flu prevention or a cable television 
or web channel featuring old fi lms and TV programs
Step 1
a. Choose from among: fl u prevention (cdc.gov/
fl u/), wellness (webmd.com or prevention.com 
or any brand or organization), or a cable televi-
sion or web channel featuring old fi lms and 
TV programs (for example, TCM or hulu.com). 
Research your subject.
b. On an index card, in one sentence, write your 
objective. Defi ne the purpose and function of 
the poster, the audience, and the information 
to be communicated. 
c. For fl u prevention or health and wellness, fi nd 
one interesting fact and write one line of copy 
using this information as your headline. Or if 
you’ve chosen the other subject, choose one 
famous line from a classic fi lm or TV program 
to use as your headline—for example, “Of all 
the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, 
she walks into mine.”
Step 2
a. Find typefaces that express the spirit of the 
subject. Or use handmade or found type or a 
combination of handmade and a typeface.
b. Design a poster that is type driven—that is, 
type is the star of the poster. If you use any 
image, it should play a secondary role to the 
type-driven headline.
c. Produce at least twenty sketches.
Step 3
a. Choose two of your best sketches and refi ne 
them. 
b. Establish emphasis through a visual hierarchy.
c. Carefully examine the spacing between letters, 
among words, and between lines of type.
Step 4
a. Create a fi nished solution.
b. The poster can be designed in a portrait or 
landscape orientation.

CREATIVE THINKING
Creative thinking is the ability to stretch beyond the ordinary, to be original, innovative, and 
ﬂ exible in one’s thinking. For example, creating a mnemonic device (a memory aid) is one 
way to think creatively, connecting unrelated things with a single visual in a design context. 
For TheHive.com, a new online community of musicians and music fans, Visual Dialogue 
determined they needed a strong logo to serve as a mnemonic device for what they were 
about (Figure 4-01).
Other aspects of creative thinking are:
› associative thinking (recognizing commonalities, common attributes)
› metaphorical thinking (identifying similarities between seemingly unrelated things)
› elaboration and modiﬁ cation (working out details and being able to propose alterations)
› imaginative thinking (forming images in one’s mind and imagining the unlikely
CHARACTERISTICS OF CREATIVE THINKERS
Certain characteristics are markers of creative thinking:
› Courage: Fear quashes creative risk taking and supports playing it safe. Courage coupled 
with intellectual curiosity fuels creativity.
› Receptiveness: Being open to different ways of thinking as well as constructive criticism 
allows you to embrace possibilities and new ideas.
› Flexibility: Not only do an agile mind and ﬂ exible personality allow you to keep up with 
the times, they allow you to bend with the path of a blossoming idea or let go of a path that 
is not fruitful.
› Being Sharp-eyed: Paying attention to what you see every day (shadows, juxtapositions, 
color combinations, textures, found compositions, peeling posters, etc.) allows you to see 
inherent creative possibilities in any given environment, to notice what others miss or do not 
think noteworthy.
› Seeking and Recognizing Connections: Creative people are able to bring two related or unre-
lated things together to form a new combination; they arrange associative hierarchies in ways 
that allow them to make connections that might elude others.
Creativity is the 
power to connect 
the seemingly 
unconnected.

TOOLS THAT STIMULATE 
CREATIVE THINKING
Beyond enhancing personal creative characteris-
tics are tools that aid creative thinking. Besides 
using these creativity techniques for concept gen-
eration, some designers and students use them 
as visualization and spontaneous compositional 
tools (see Chapter 5 on visualization and Chapter 
6 on composition).
Brainstorming (Group or Individual Tool)
In Your Creative Power, published in 1945, Alex 
Osborn, an advertising partner at BBDO in New 
York, presented a technique he had been using 
for years at BBDO: brainstorming. The objec-
tive of Osborn’s technique was to generate ideas 
that could be solutions to advertising problems; 
the notion was that an uninhibited atmosphere 
would cultivate the ﬂ ow of creative thinking. 
Traditional brainstorming is conducted with a 
group of people so that one contributor’s thought 
builds on or triggers another’s, although it may 
even work better when modiﬁ ed for individual 
use, since there is no holding back. (See sidebar 
“How to Brainstorm in a Group.”)
Osborn’s Checklist (Individual Tool)
In the mid–1960s, American artist Richard Serra 
began experimenting with nontraditional materi-
als, including ﬁ berglass, neon, vulcanized rubber, 
and lead. He combined his examination of these

HOW TO BRAINSTORM
HOW TO BRAINSTORM  IN A GROUP
• Clearly and succinctly defi ne the problem. Determine criteria.
• Appoint two people: (1) a good note taker and (2) an effective facilitator respon-
sible for running the brainstorming session. (An oversized note pad, a marker 
board, or an interactive whiteboard screen is useful. Or record the session. Notes 
should be evaluated at conclusion.)
• Including participants with a different expertise is optimum.
• Participants should openly contribute.
• Stay focused on the problem under discussion.
• During the brainstorming session, do not judge any contributed ideas. Creativity 
should not be stifl ed, no matter how harebrained the idea offered.
• A second round of brainstorming builds onto ideas suggested in round one.
Average time: 30- to 45-minute session.
At the conclusion of the session, ideas are evaluated. According to creativity 
expert Edward de Bono, ideas should be evaluated for usefulness, for whether they 
merit further exploration, and for originality.
The advantages of brainstorming include:
• It is an effective idea-generation tool
• Encourages creative thinking
• Generates many ideas
• Provides an opportunity for collaboration

diagram used to represent thoughts, words, infor-
mation, tasks, or images in a speciﬁ c diagram-
matic arrangement. There is a central key word or 
thought, and all other words, thoughts, or visuals 
stem from and are linked to the central one in a 
radius around that central focal point. It has been 
said that mapping is an ancient visualizing tech-
nique dating as far back as ancient Greece.
Types of Mind Maps
Mapping is a useful tool for the writing process, 
design process, or brainstorming process, or sim-
ply for thinking something through. You can 
approach mapping in two basic ways.
› Automatic mapping relies heavily on the sur-
realist strategy of spontaneous free association, 
trying to avoid conscious choices and allowing 
associations to ﬂ ow freely.
› Deliberate mapping, although not totally con-
trolled, relies more on natural growth of associa-
tions, revealing the way your mind instinctively 
organizes or makes associations.
You can reorganize or revise what you have 
mapped based on new information, based on a 
deeper understanding derived from the ﬁ rst go-
round, or based on something that occurred to 
you while mapping. You can articulate a range of 
connections or see links among items on the map. 
The resulting mind map is a tangible representa-
tion of associations (that may reveal thinking or 
lead to an idea). You can rearrange items to create 
a new beginning (central word or image), reor-
dering subtopics (secondary items), sub-subtopics 
(tertiary items), and so on.
How to Create a Mind Map 
Mapping software is available that offers tem-
plates, shufﬂ ing, notes, labels, cross-linking, and 
more. However, since the nature of the drawing 
process maximizes spontaneous mapping, doing 
it by hand offers better outcomes. Drawing your 
own map is likely to increase personalization and 
a natural ﬂ ow of thoughts.
› Position an extra-large sheet of paper in land-
scape position.
› At the center of the page, your starting point, 
draw a primary visual or write a key word, topic, 
or theme.
materials and their properties with an interest in 
the physical process of making sculpture. The 
result was a list of action verbs Serra compiled—
”to roll, to crease, to curve”—listed on paper and 
then enacted with the materials he had collected 
in his studio. To Lift by Serra, “made from dis-
carded rubber recovered from a warehouse in 
lower Manhattan, is a result of the rubber’s unique 
response to the artist’s enacting of the action verb 
‘to lift.’” 1 (moma.org).
“It struck me that instead of thinking what a sculp-
ture is going to be and how you’re going to do it composi-
tionally, what if you just enacted those verbs in relation 
to a material, and didn’t worry about the results?”
—Richard Serra
Before Serra’s sculptural experimentations, 
Alex Osborn, BBDO, created an inspired check-
list technique as a tool to transform an existent 
idea or thing. (For example, if you magnify some-
thing, you could add height, length, or strength; 
or you could duplicate, multiply, or exaggerate.) 
Arguably, this could be the only tool you ever 
need to foster creative thinking. In short, Osborn’s 
Checklist is composed of action verbs:
› Adapt
› Modify
› Magnify 
› Minify
› Substitute
› Rearrange
› Reverse
Mapping (Individual Tool)
A mind map is a visual representation, diagram, 
or presentation of the various ways words, terms, 
images, thoughts, or ideas can be related to one 
another. A useful tool in understanding relation-
ships and organizing thoughts, it leads to idea 
generation. Mapping is a brainstorming and vi-
sual diagramming tool that is used to develop 
an idea or lead to an idea; it is also called word 
mapping, idea mapping, mind mapping™, word 
clustering, and spider diagramming. It can be 
used to visualize, structure, and classify ideas and 
as an aid in study, organization, problem solving, 
and decision making. A resulting visual map is a

then free to ask questions—questions to clarify 
points or questions that pop into that person’s 
head based on what you have presented. If the 
person has been attentive, then he or she may 
have some pointed questions that can aid in 
focusing your thinking. Or ask the person to 
take notes, which you could use as jump-starts.
CREATIVITY THROUGH 
PROBLEM FINDING
In The Mystery of Picasso (a 1956 documentary ﬁ lm 
by director Henri-Georges Clouzot and cinema-
tographer Claude Renoir), Picasso is painting. As 
we watch Picasso paint, we realize his process is 
spontaneous—each form he paints brings him to 
another; nothing was preconceived. His free-form 
association continues. Five hours later, Picas so
› Starting with the central word or image, draw 
branches (using lines, arrows, any type of branch) 
out in all directions, making as many associations 
as possible. (Don’t be judgmental; just write or 
draw freely.)
Each subtopic should branch out from the 
major central topic. Then, each sub-subtopic 
or image should branch out from the subtopic, 
branching out on and on. Seek relationships and 
generate branches among as many items as pos-
sible. Feel free to repeat items and/or cross-link.
Spontaneous mapping draws upon the uncon-
scious. Write or draw as quickly as possible with-
out deliberating or editing. This type of mapping 
promotes nonlinear thinking. Interestingly, it 
can be the most unforeseen item or possibility 
that becomes a key to idea generation. (You can 
always go back into the map to make adjust-
ments later.)
Deliberate mapping utilizes long and careful 
thinking. As a complement, you could consider 
note taking—writing down some explanatory 
notes near the items or branches so that later, 
when you reexamine the map, you can more easily 
recall exactly what you were thinking. This piece 
in Robert Skwiat’s senior portfolio was based on 
a mind map (Figure 4-02).
Oral Presentation Tool: 
Present the Problem to Someone Else 
Most people realize that writing or sketching can 
lead to an idea. Talking about the design problem 
can lead to ideas and insights as well.
This tool is based on two premises: (1) talking 
about your problem may reveal insights (analo-
gous to speaking to a therapist who listens, more 
than speaks, so that you can hear yourself ), and 
(2) having to present or explain the design prob-
lem to someone unfamiliar with it will force you 
to organize and articulate your thoughts, which 
might lead to better understanding of the prob-
lem and ultimately to an insight or idea.
Oral Presentation Tool Technique
1/ Solicit a friendly listener. This person 
should not attempt to help you solve the prob-
lem or make any comments. If no one is avail-
able, use a tape recorder. You do not need oratory

Happy Accidents
If we go back to how Picasso painted on one 
canvas for ﬁ ve hours, only to discard the canvas, 
declaring he now found direction, then we can 
understand something about how visual artists 
work. According to an evolutionary model of cre-
ativity,4 we need two processes:
› one process to generate things that we can’t or 
don’t plan and
› another process to assess what we have gener-
ated for merit
As with being successful in most disciplines, 
knowledge, study, and experience enable a prac-
titioner to distinguish between what has merit 
and what does not. However, as Professor Robert 
D. Austin, Technology and Operations Manage-
ment unit at Harvard Business School, stated, the 
key here is “being a bit skeptical of preset inten-
tions and plans that commit you too ﬁ rmly to the 
endpoints you can envision in advance.”5
Professor Austin believes: “Artists think they 
develop a talent for causing good accidents. Equally 
or perhaps even more important, they believe they 
cultivate an ability to notice the value in interest-
ing accidents. This is a non-trivial capability. Pas-
teur called it the ‘prepared mind.’ . . . Knowing too 
clearly where you are going, focusing too hard on 
a predeﬁ ned objective, can cause you to miss value 
that might lie in a different direction.”6
Exquisite Corpse (Group Tool)
“While researching my talk for the Kean Univer-
sity ‘Thinking Creatively’ conference, I began to 
declares that he will have to discard the canvas: 
“Now that I begin to see where I’m going with 
it, I’ll take a new canvas and start again.” Picasso 
used the process of painting to ﬁ nd inspiration 
and direction while painting; he didn’t plan it before
he began painting.2
Like Picasso, designers can employ problem
ﬁ nding or problem seeking, where the process of 
sketching or making marks allows visual think-
ing, allows for discovery, for staying open to pos-
sibilities during the visual-making process.
Brainstorming by Image Making 
(Individual Tool)
The act of creating art—painting, drawing, sculp-
ture, ceramics, collage, photography, any tradi-
tional or nontraditional art—activates several 
parts of the brain, sharpens thinking, provokes 
the mind’s associative network, and increases 
focus to a point where creative thinking can occur. 
When creating art for a solid period of uninter-
rupted time, you enter into a meditative “zone” of 
active experimentation. Creating ﬁ ne art frees the 
subconscious mind from the design problem and 
may lead to ideas.
Spontaneous Art Improvisation: 
Problem Finding (Individual Tool)
One of the premises of spontaneous art is that it 
allows access to your subconscious and liberates 
you from inhibitions; you create images without 
concerns regarding conventions, aesthetics, com-
position, or intention, without concerns about 
content, not governed by the constraints of a 
design assignment. In The Creative Vision: A Lon-
gitudinal Study of Problem Finding in Art, a study 
of art students, Jacob W. Getzels and Mihaly 
Csikszentmihalyi found that the more creative 
students were more adroit at staying open to pos-
sibilities during the art-making process.3
Spontaneous Art Process
Enjoy the process without concern about an end 
product or ﬁ nishing anything. Choose any pre-
ferred art medium—traditional or nontraditional, 
nonrepresentational, abstract or representational.

Attribute Listing (Individual Tool)
By focusing on the attributes of an object, person, 
place, character, topic/theme, product, or service, 
you can ﬁ nd a characteristic that might lead to an 
idea. Attribute listing, a technique developed by 
Robert Platt Crawford in Techniques of Creative 
Thinking, is a method for analyzing and sepa-
rating data through observing and identifying 
various qualities that might have otherwise been 
overlooked; it is a diagrammed list of attributes. 
The process works deconstructively, breaking 
down information into smaller parts that are then 
examined individually.
It can be useful to ﬁ rst break the object down 
into constituent parts and examine the attributes 
of each part. For example, if the item under exam-
ination is a laptop computer, you could break it 
down into the screen, keyboard, and motherboard; 
or if the topic in question is a tax preparation 
service, you could break it down into the online 
operation, the brick-and-mortar storefront, the 
name, the staff, the environment, their proprietary 
preparation process, and so on.
think about what it truly means to be creative in 
what is essentially a collaborative ﬁ eld. I recalled 
a game I used to play with my father, wherein 
one person draws the beginning of a ﬁ gure, folds 
the paper, and the next one continues the draw-
ing without seeing what came before. When I 
invited Milton Glaser to participate, he informed 
me that the ‘game’ was actually an ‘Exquisite 
Corpse,’ invented by the Dadaists and Surreal-
ists. I also asked Mirko Ilic´ and Luba Lukova 
to participate,” comments Steven Brower about 
Figure 4-03.
Believing in artistic collaboration while pursu-
ing the enigma of accidental art and their belief, 
the surrealists played a collective word game called 
Exquisite Corpse (cadavre exquis). (See “Case 
Study: Kobo Abe Book Cover Series” for another 
example using the Exquisite Corpse tool.)
Each player contributes one word to a collective 
sentence, without seeing what the other players 
have written. Adapted to using collective images, 
each player is assigned a different section of the 
human body, though the original players did not 
adhere to any conventional sense of human form. 
Steven Brower talks about his process:
How to Play Exquisite Corpse: 
Collective Images
1/ Fold a piece of paper into four parts. (Fold 
the paper in half from top to bottom. Fold it 
again from top to bottom.)
2/ On the ﬁ rst fold, the ﬁ rst player draws a 
head. That player extends the lines of the neck 
slightly below the fold and then folds the paper 
over so the second player cannot see what has 
been drawn.
3/ The second player creates the neck, shoul-
ders, and top half of the torso with arms, extend-
ing the waist below the fold so that the third 
player cannot see what has been drawn.
4/ The third player creates the bottom half 
of the torso. The upper thighs extend below the 
fold so that the fourth player cannot see what 
has been drawn.
5/ The fourth player continues until the ﬁ g-
ure is drawn.
6/ The group unfolds the paper and discusses 
the resulting ﬁ gure.

Steven Brower designed 
this poster for the inaugural 
creativity conference at Kean 
University. Attendees waited 
patiently in line to have 
Brower and Luba Lukova (one 
of the poster’s illustrators/
participants) autograph their 
posters, which have now, 
undoubtedly, become prized 
objects of contemplation.

If the computer and the Internet allow us to 
connect with distant communities, then creative 
methods that take advantage of this power must 
be created. One such way is the following book 
covers conceived by John Gall and myself.
Taking advantage of my ability to send images 
across the Internet, I re-conceptualized the sur-
realist game Exquisite Corpse. Asking design 
colleagues to respond to images sent to them 
became the basis for these collaborations. A piece 
of art was sent back and forth—with each designer 
adding something to the collage—until they 
reached a mutual agreed-upon ﬁ nishing point.
John Gall, Vice President and Art Director for 
Vintage and Anchor Books, an imprint of Alfred 
A. Knopf, was one of the collaborators that I had 
engaged in this creative process. John realized 
that the eclectic nature of these electronic collages 
might work well with a series of books that were 
going to be reissued for the author Kobo Abe, who 
is known for his surreal narratives. This collabora-
tive method became a natural ﬁ t. The electronic 
collaboration allows for an “open” design process 
in which unexpected and oddly juxtaposed images 
could be created to parallel the often bizarre and 
dreamlike worlds created by Abe’s books.
There is a sophisticated and subtle use of 
common elements that create a visual cohesive-
ness to the series. Muted, golden yellow-toned 
paper textures become a foundation upon which 
the images are built. A distinctive bold frame on 
each cover helps create a unity to the typographic 
system, while retaining its own individual charac-
teristic within the composition. The typographic 
system mimics the juxtaposition of elements in 
their contrasting typographic style. Roman vs. 
Italic, Bold vs. Light, Serif vs. Sans Serif, All 
Caps vs. Lower Case.
Intuition, chance, and play can serve a valu-
able role in the problem-solving process. Collage, 
as a game of chance, embraces this idea and can 
help develop new discoveries. This methodology, 
when established with ample time for experi-
mentation, often leads to innovative solutions. 
Challenging our perceptions about the role of the 
computer in the process can safeguard against our 
solutions becoming predictable and/or formulaic. 
Switching back and forth between the computer 
and drawing board keeps the process balanced 
and fresh. We need to use the tools we have to 
advance and explore creative ways of working, 
collaborating, researching, and discovering.

you simply sketch the ﬁ rst thing that comes to 
mind, when asking yourself, “What might this 
remind me of or be similar to?”
Keep an Idea and a Collage Sourcebook
Keeping a sketchbook is a wonderful way to prac-
tice creative thinking and visualization on a daily 
basis. Carry a sketchbook with you for sketching, 
doodling (automatic drawing), and jotting down 
ideas. Keep another book as a collage sourcebook, 
adhering images and typography you ﬁ nd inspir-
ing to pages of the book. Add inspiring articles or 
phrases. Keep an image ﬁ le, which you can use to 
draw from or upon.
CONCEPTUAL THINKING
Concept generation—the ability to form/think up 
an idea, cogently state the idea, and then evalu-
ate it—demands creativity and critical thinking 
skills. According to Dr. John Chaffee, Professor 
of Philosophy at the City University of New York, 
“Logic and critical thinking seek to establish rules 
of correct reasoning, clear understanding, and valid 
arguments. In addition, they identify fallacies—
chronic ways in which people use illogical reason-
ing to reach conclusions.”8 Critical thinking also 
entails appraising concepts, issues, statements, and 
points of view. Among the many thinking skills of 
a critical thinker, the ones that are most applicable 
to designing are the ability to:
› Analyze
› Ask penetrating questions
› Identify and address key issues
› Identify patterns or connections
› Conceive concepts
› Conceive a conceptual framework
› Communicate effectively
› Evaluate relevance
› Support one’s viewpoint with reasons and 
evidence
Solving graphic design or creative advertising 
assignments involves gathering or generating con-
tent, problem solving, elaboration (adding details 
to a main idea), working within (or possibly set-
ting) parameters of an assignment, and forecast-
ing—which all depend on critical thinking skills.
The Process of Attribute Listing
› Select an object, person, place, character, topic/
theme, product, or service for examination.
› List the physical or functional attributes (parts, 
characteristics, properties, qualities, or design ele-
ments) of the object under examination.
› List as many attributes as you possibly can.
› Separately list unique or unusual attributes.
› List the psychological or emotional attributes, 
if applicable.
› Think about the “value” of each attribute. Ask: 
“What is the purpose? Beneﬁ t?” Consider the pos-
itive versus negative value of each attribute. (For 
example, a heavy glass laptop screen might prevent 
breakage but adds overall weight to the laptop.)
› Examine ways attributes can be modiﬁ ed to 
increase positive values or create new values.
› Examine for potential leads to a design concept.
Using Attribute Listing 
for Creativity Enhancement
› Choose a place or thing.
› List its attributes.
› Then, choose one attribute and focus on it.
› Think of ways (from conventional, to unable to 
be realized, to ridiculous) to change that attribute.
Visual Metaphors (Individual Tool)
Visual metaphors can underpin a design concept 
and be used to create strong images in graphic 
design, suggesting a similarity between two non-
identical things. (See Figure 2-16, Visual Meta-
phors poster by Luba Lukova, and Figure 7-26, 
Help Solve Global Warming by Fang Chen.) Addi-
tionally, a visual metaphor, a nonliteral use of an 
image, results in a “partial mapping of one term, 
image, object, concept or process onto another to 
reveal unsuspected similarities.”7 A visual meta-
phor can make connections between two worlds 
of meaning and reveal an insight.
The Process
1/ At the top of a page, write the subject of 
your design problem.
2/ Sketch or write as many objects as possible 
having similarities to your subject. If you’re having 
difﬁ culty, use attribute listing to help you or treat 
this as a kind of a Rorschach inkblot test, where

entire Aether branding project.) For the most part, 
graphic designers use the term “design concept” 
and advertising professionals use the term “idea” 
or “the big idea” to mean the same thing. Design 
assignments begin with a need and problem.
Effective creative conceptual thinking results in:
› Discoveries
› Ideas and design concepts
› Actions and decisions
› Creative methods that lead to inventive 
solutions
› New questions or needs
PROBLEM SOLVING
In the second part of this chapter, you will learn 
about the steps involved in solving a graphic 
design or advertising problem. Generally, prob-
lem solving is the process of:
› Identifying and deﬁ ning a given problem (part 
or all of a design application)
› Deﬁ ning what is to be accomplished
› Brainstorming for original ideas
› Evaluating ideas
› Interpreting raw ideas into graphic design con-
cepts or advertising ideas
› Visually expressing and communicating the 
concept in creative or unique ways
SIX ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS: 
THE KIPLING QUESTIONS
Becoming a good problem solver involves culti-
vating investigative thinking. Investigative jour-
nalists and law enforcement ofﬁ cers depend on 
these six questions:
› Who?
› What?
› Where?
› When?
› Why?
› How?
Rudyard Kipling immortalized these questions, 
referring to them as “six honest serving men” that 
taught him all he knew, in a short poem embed-
ded in “The Elephant’s Child.” This essential set of 
questions can help problem solve and trigger ideas. 
(Interestingly, these questions are asked in most 
Any good graphic design solution is based on 
a design concept—the designer’s primary reason-
ing. The design concept sets the framework for all 
your design decisions—for how you are creating, 
selecting, and arranging imagery, writing copy for 
the imagery, the colors you select, for cropping an 
image, or choosing a particular typeface. Abso-
lutely, this explanation does not exclude the value 
of any designer’s intuitive choices; however, it does 
emphasize that design is not about decoration. 
Creative thinkers conceptualize, communicat-
ing their ideas visually, as in Figure 4-04. “Aether 
Apparel, a new line of adventure sportswear 
inspired by a life spent outdoors, aims to appeal 
to the outdoor enthusiast who needs the function 
of performance garments, but who desires a more 
sophisticated form. CSA designed the brand’s 
logo, which evokes inﬁ nity and clouds circling 
a mountain peak, to appeal to this demographic 
and to reference the word itself, Aether, mean-
ing ‘the heavens.’” (Please see Figure 9-07 for the

product, service, or group. Usually, junior design-
ers and junior art directors or copywriters are not 
involved in strategic planning or in design brief 
formation; more often, they are challenged by 
a simple design brief that has been distilled for 
them by their design director or art director. It is 
important, however, at this point in your educa-
tion, to understand how the design process works 
at every level and stage.
Who Conducts the Orientation?
During this initial phase, you and your team 
learn about the assignment. Since designers and 
art directors work in a variety of settings, who 
conducts the orientation and how it is conducted 
will depend on the nature of your ﬁ rm. Design-
ers work in design studios (small, medium, and 
large), advertising agencies, publishing houses, 
in-house corporate and nonproﬁ t organizations, 
educational institutions, and any setting where 
a designer’s expertise may be required—an in-
house design department for a retail chain, a 
design briefs, though the six-question method cer-
tainly simpliﬁ es any brief.) You can tailor the six 
questions as in this example:
› Who is the audience?
› What is the problem?
› Where do this problem and potential solution 
exist?
› When does this happen?
› Why is it happening?
› How can you overcome this problem?
FIVE PHASES OF THE 
GRAPHIC DESIGN PROCESS
Five Phases of the Design Process:
Design
Orientation
Analysis
Concepts
Implementation
PHASE 1: ORIENTATION/ 
MATERIAL GATHERING
Phase 1 of the design process involves orienta-
tion: being briefed on the assignment, learning 
about the client’s needs and requirements, prod-
uct, service, organization, audience, competition, 
and more. It also involves active listening, gather-
ing materials and information, and meetings, and 
may include conducting market research.
Although there are legendary stories of 
esteemed designers who, during the ﬁ rst client 
meeting, sketch their logo solutions right there 
and then, most designs are not created that way. 
(Paula Scher, a Pentagram partner, sketched the 
Citibank™ logo during the ﬁ rst client meeting. 
Woody Pirtle, former Pentagram partner, sketched 
his AIGA/Iowa poster on a napkin [see Figure 
4-05]. For Taco Bueno, a regional restaurant chain, 
former Pentagram partner Lowell Williams says 
about the development of the wordmark, “We did 
the original design, the conceptual part, on a nap-
kin. Woody Pirtle was in [our ofﬁ ce] at the time, 
and I asked him to draw out the idea.”) Before put-
ting pencil to paper, you will need to gather and 
absorb a good deal of materials.
Orientation
Phase 1 is orientation—the process of becoming 
familiar with your assignment, the graphic design 
problem, and the client’s business or organization,

› How should it function? What form should
it take?
› What are the audience’s limitations?
› How can we best display this type of 
information?
› What is the context? Where and how will this 
application be seen?
For an editorial design application, here are 
additional questions:
› Is it a new publication or an existing publica-
tion? Is it a supplemental publication?
› What is its function?
› What is the context? Where, when, and how 
will this application be seen and in which media?
› What is the subject of the editorial content? 
Who is the author? When will I have access 
to the content (entire publication/summary/
synopsis/proposal)?
› What are the audience’s limitations (vision, 
language, reading level)?
For an environmental design application, here 
are additional questions:
› What is its function?
› What type of space is it?
› How will the design solution work with the 
interior design and architecture?
› Where will it exist?
› What are the audience’s limitations?
› Will I be collaborating with an interior designer? 
Architect?
› What is the context?
Orientation also involves reviewing and evalu-
ating the current graphic design applications, 
branding, and/or advertising program created for 
this product, service, or group. How well did those 
solutions fare? How does the client consider those 
solutions? How does the public/audience per-
ceive and respond to the existing solutions? What 
is the performance measurement, the return on 
investment (ROI)? This process is referred to as 
a marketing audit, a methodical examination and 
analysis of existing and past marketing for a brand 
or group. A competitive audit is an examination 
and analysis of the competitions’ branding efforts 
with the intention of best understanding how the 
competitors position themselves in the market-
place, their functional and emotional advantages 
and disadvantages, and who their audiences are.
regional design studio, a global ad agency, or the 
design unit of a charitable organization. There-
fore, an orientation might be conducted by a 
variety or combination of individuals: the client, 
the client’s team, an account manager/team from 
your own studio or agency, your design director or 
creative director, an editor, an in-house executive, 
or any individual who is the liaison with a client 
in charge of the assignment.
Getting essential answers to questions happens 
during this phase. For any type of assignment, 
there are standard questions, and some will be 
revisited during the next phase of analysis. Addi-
tional questions are fashioned for speciﬁ c types of 
graphic design applications, as you will see below.
› What is the nature/extent of the assignment? 
Is it an individual application or part of a broader 
assignment/strategy?
› What does your assignment entail? What is its 
role in a broader scheme?
› Who is the audience?
› How is this project relevant to its audience?
› Does a similar application already exist?
› What is the media plan? Budget? Deadline? 
Other parameters?
For a brand or group (nonproﬁ t organization, 
educational institution, company, human services, 
any entity that is not a branded product or ser-
vice), here are additional questions that will help 
obtain information:
› Is the brand or group new, established, merg-
ing, or being rethought? A start-up? Known or 
unknown? Regional, national, or global?
› What makes this brand or group (organiza-
tion, company, any entity) unique?
› What are the functional beneﬁ ts and the emo-
tional beneﬁ ts?
› How does the brand or group compare to the 
competition? Is the brand or group a category or 
industry leader? In second place? A newcomer?
› Is your client’s brand or group relevant to its 
target audience?
› What is your client’s brand or group ﬁ ve-year 
plan? Ten-year plan?
For an information design application, here 
are additional questions that will help obtain 
information:
› What makes this application unique?

Equally important during orientation is learn-
ing about the audience—the targeted, speciﬁ ed 
group of people at whom you are aiming your mes-
sage, design, and solution; the audience is the main 
group who would purchase this brand or utilize this 
information, service, or product, or patronize this 
entity. Knowing about the audience is critical. For 
example, in Figure 4-06, Hope, Help & Healing, a
campaign for the National Council on Alcohol and 
Drug Dependency (NCADD), the audience is “In 
recovery, the average age is 48, and only one ﬁ fth are 
30 and below (Alcoholics Anonymous, 2001 survey).

recipient
Project Background: I attended the 
School of Visual Arts MFA Designer 
as Author Program. My thesis was a 
campaign targeting young addicts 
and alcoholics.
The fi nal campaign was based on 
some of my MFA thesis, but altered 
and fi ne-tuned to fulfi ll the needs 
of NCADD’s affi liate offi ces across 
the country.
NCADD: Founded in 1944, 
NCADD is the oldest advocacy 
organization addressing the disease 
of alcoholism and other drug 
addictions focusing on education, 
awareness, policy and advocacy.
Strategy: The goal was to create 
a set of brochures and posters 
that make the process of recovery 
inviting and easy to understand, 
and to encourage people to call 
the NCADD hopeline or visit their 
website to get more information.
Each of the three poster/brochure 
sets targeted a different audience; 
young people (under 21), the 
general public, and family. Because 
of the anonymity factor associated 
with recovery, I did not want the 
campaign to use images of people 
that showed their identity. For the

the audience. If your assignment were to design 
a visual identity for a farm tractor manufacturer, 
you would need to learn about farm tractors, a 
farm tractor’s purpose and utility, who purchases 
and uses tractors, and the marketplace for such 
equipment, as well as competing farm trac-
tor brands. Unless you were an expert on farm 
tractors, you’d have to collect information. And 
even if you were an expert, you’d still have to 
learn about your client’s farm tractors and that 
company’s goals, objectives and mission, phi-
losophy, points of distinction, and competition. 
If your assignment were to design packaging for 
an energy beverage, even though you might be 
more generally familiar with that product cat-
egory than with farm tractors, you still would 
have to gather materials and orient yourself to 
your client’s product and needs. Every designer 
must be informed about his or her sector under 
assignment, the client’s business, and the prob-
lem under assignment.
Gathering Information 
through Active Listening
During this ﬁ rst phase of the design process, you 
get the lay of the land and obtain as much spe-
ciﬁ c introductory information (what James Webb 
Young refers to as “raw materials”) as you can. In 
most cases, the client or individual (executive, 
editor, creative director, other) in charge of the 
project provides a good deal of information. The 
client (or individual in charge) is the expert about 
his or her brand or group. That certainly does not
qualify the client (or account executive or editor) 
to design, but it does mean that you should listen 
carefully to the information this particular expert can 
offer—to what the client says about the problem, 
audience, and marketplace—and thoughtfully 
examine the information provided by the client. 
Often, an active listener can identify an insight by 
carefully paying attention to what the client (and/
or individual in charge) says about the brand or 
group and about the competition. Active listen-
ing entails concentrating, focusing on the content 
of the speaker’s message, interpreting what the 
client says/means, and actively reﬂ ecting on what 
has been said.
INDUSTRIES
INDUSTRIES  AND SECTORS
Characteristically, designers tend to be curious. Many designers are the type of 
people who are interested in learning about a variety of industries and organizations, 
people who enjoy discovery and gathering raw materials; they become interested in 
their clients’ sectors and spheres. Being a designer also requires a love of lifelong 
learning, of having the mind-set of an explorer.
Industries and sectors include:
• Agriculture
• Airlines 
• Alcoholic Beverages: Beer, Wine, 
and Spirits
• Animal Services
• Arts Organizations
• Automotive and Transportation
• Beverages
• Business Services
• Charity Organizations
• Child Care Organizations
• Churches and Religious 
Organizations
• Communications
• Consumer Products
• Education
• Energy and Utilities
• Entertainment
• Environmental Groups and 
Organizations
• Fashion
• Financial Services
• Food
• Government
• Healthcare
• Hotel and Hospitality
• Human Services
• Industrial Institutions
• Insurance Corporations or 
Organizations
• Music
• Nonprofi ts
• Political Groups or Organizations
• Private Foundations
• Public Foundations
• Real Estate
• Restaurants
• Retail
Material Gathering: Getting All 
the Information
To design, ﬁ rst you must learn about the sector 
(see sidebar on industries and sectors); the prod-
uct, service, company, or organization; the com-
pany’s history, values, and mission; and of course,

From my own design experience, I have found 
“listening for insights” to be key to generating on-
target design concepts. For example, by listening 
carefully to one of my clients, I was able to gen-
erate the name of their consultancy based on a 
few words the partners repeated often. Designer 
Mark Oldach concurs; in an interview with Bryn 
Mooth in HOW magazine, Oldach advised: “Lis-
ten. Listen to how clients speak about their busi-
ness, the language they use, the concepts they 
focus on and the initiatives that deﬁ ne what they 
do. Everything that I’ve learned about business, 
process and strategic communications has been 
through and with my clients. Sure, I read books 
and journals and take courses, but the vast amount 
of learning has been by listening to clients.”9
You may also have to gather materials to sup-
plement those provided to you. (See sidebars:
“Material Gathering” and “Information-Gathering
Tools.”) At times, the provided information, in 
part, comes from an outside market research ﬁ rm; 
other materials might have to be gathered, found, 
or researched by you or your design ﬁ rm or adver-
tising agency. Develop an understanding of con-
ducting research, of where to look for and gather 
information. For Internet research basics, go to 
our website. 
Too many students skip material gathering, 
with the naive belief that it is not important. 
Perhaps many skip or rush this step because they 
ﬁ nd it not as engaging as the great adventure 
of designing. Not only does gathering informa-
tion about the client’s business help you solve 
the assignment, but it also enriches your gen-
eral wealth of knowledge. With each client and 
assignment, you have the potential to become 
more informed about many subjects and industry 
sectors. Taking in more information, processing 
it, assimilating data, and putting it in its proper 
place contribute to original thinking.10
To best solve the visual communication prob-
lem, you need to complete this phase. For students 
working on class assignments without actual cli-
ents, your instructor becomes your client. You 
still need to gather materials, familiarize yourself 
with the brand or group under assignment, and 
actively listen to the instructor’s orientation.
PHASE 2: ANALYSIS/
DISCOVERY/STRATEGY 
In this phase, you are examining, assessing, dis-
covering, and planning; you are not conceptual-
izing or designing.
Analysis
Once you and your team/studio have completed 
phase 1, the next phase is analysis—examining
all you have unearthed to best understand, assess, 
strategize, and move forward with the assignment. 
After reﬂ ective thinking, you develop the direction 
your solution(s) will take. When you analyze, you
› Examine each part of the problem
› Concisely and accurately deﬁ ne constituent 
elements
› Organize the information so that it is broken 
down into parts that are easily analyzable
› Draw conclusions based on your analysis that 
will allow you to move forward to the next step
Discovery and Strategy
Strategy is the core tactical underpinning of 
any visual communication, unifying all planning 
for every visual and verbal application within a 
MATERIAL
MATERIAL  GATHERING
It involves:
• Becoming thoroughly acquainted with the brand or group: background, the entity’s 
orientation/culture, values, information, data, subject matter, history
• Understanding the client’s goals and objectives, current and imminent hurdles, and 
listening carefully to the client about the assignment, product, service, or group
• Identifying how the immediate assignment relates to the entity’s greater/broader 
brand strategy and solutions (past, present, and future)
• Knowing the audience
• Orienting yourself (and your design team) to your client’s general industry/sector 
and particular business/product/service/organization

THE DESIGN BRIEF
A design brief is a strategic plan—a type of map—
that both the client and design ﬁ rm or advertising 
agency agree upon, a written document outlining 
and strategizing a design project; it is also called a 
creative brief, brief, or creative work plan. (Strat-
egy can be determined outside a design brief or 
within a brief.) Most important for designers and 
the creative team, strategy is a springboard for 
conceptual development.
Most design briefs are made up of questions 
and answers—a format used in an attempt to 
fully understand the assignment, the objectives 
of the project, the design context, and the audi-
ence. The answers to questions delineated in a 
design brief are usually based on predesign (pre-
liminary) market research, information gathered 
about the product, service or group, and audience, 
and predicated on the budget. Finally, the design 
brief becomes the strategic plan for implementing 
objectives; it is a written standard against which 
creative solutions can be measured. The client 
and creative professionals can go back to the brief 
for guidance, or designers can use it to support 
their concepts and/or solutions. A thoughtful, clear 
brief can foster focused, critical thinking and lead to 
creative concept formulation.
Who Constructs the Design Brief
Newer models of strategic planning include 
designers and art directors in design brief con-
struction. From the project outset, integrated 
INFORMATION-GATHERING
INFORMATION-GATHERING  TOOLS
Conventional
• Using index cards or sticky notes, write one piece of pertinent information per 
card.
• Categorize them.
• Organize in a box, binder, or some other storage device.
or
• Keep a notebook, three-ring binder, or expanding fi le caddy with categorical 
sections.
• Keep one notebook per assignment and take lots of notes when the client is 
speaking.
Digital
• Collect and then store gathered materials in a widget (interactive virtual tool that 
provides services such as showing the user desktop notes) or in desktop notes 
(notelike windows (short notes) on the screen).
• There is software that aids in organizing information allowing the user to save 
queries, save views, sort topics, select topics for modifi cation, and more.
Online
• You can also take advantage of Web 2.0 capabilities by using online social 
bookmarking websites, such as http://del.icio.us.com, that allow you to store your 
bookmarks online and access the same bookmarks from any computer as well as 
add bookmarks from anywhere.
program of applications. Essentially, the strategy 
is how you are conceiving, creating, and posi-
tioning your brand or group and aiming your 
application (the type of design problem) in the 
marketplace to achieve differentiation, relevance, 
and resonance. The strategy helps deﬁ ne the 
brand’s or group’s personality and promise, dif-
ferentiates it from the competition by deﬁ ning 
positioning, and codiﬁ es the brand essence; it is 
a conceptual plan providing guidelines—for both 
client management and creative professionals—
to drive all visual communication applications.
Strategic questions include:
› What’s the message? What do you need to 
communicate?

brand revitalization for Fresca® with the goal of 
designing a “new visual brand language” to com-
municate the intrinsic characteristics of Fresca. 
After focus group research for Fresca, Duffy 
reports, “Two design directions clearly rose to 
the top and were fused to form one visual brief 
for the brand.”
The advantage of visual briefs is their use as 
a tool with focus groups and clients. Directions 
for color palettes, kinds of imagery, photogra-
phy styles, and other graphic approaches can be 
narrowed down to distill a strategic goal. Client 
involvement at this phase almost guarantees cli-
ent satisfaction because the client becomes part 
of the process early on. For more on visual brief 
collage boards, please read Chapters 9 and 10.
teams (client, account managers, designers, 
copywriters, editors, IT professionals, archi-
tects, interior designers, and industrial designers, 
among others) are more progressive, leading to 
broader strategic thinking, multiple perspectives, 
and fostering greater collaboration. With new and 
emerging media, an integrated team is critical to 
strategic planning.
In small studios and agencies, junior design-
ers might have the opportunity to work on writ-
ing a brief; in medium-sized and larger graphic 
design studios and agencies, junior designers are 
not likely to be part of design brief development. 
Everyone on the team, both marketing and creative 
professionals, should intimately understand the 
assignment, brand or group, and audience.
Each type of creative studio—design studio, 
agency, publisher, in-house design—handles a 
brief differently if a brief is used at all. A brief 
can be written collaboratively between client and 
design ﬁ rm or ad agency or given to the design 
ﬁ rm or ad agency by the client. The design brief 
can be initiated by the client’s marketing team or 
by the design ﬁ rm or ad agency’s account team 
or creative director (CD) or design director. The 
brief may include input from the creative team, 
strategic planners, research or media depart-
ment in the design ﬁ rm or agency, or any related 
media unit.
› Often, the client’s account team writes the 
design brief (as it is called in design studios) or 
creative brief (as it is called in advertising agen-
cies), which is then given to the creative team. 
Design briefs may take different forms.
› In a design studio, the brief might be written 
by the design director or by the client’s team.
› In an advertising agency, most often, the 
account manager gives the creative brief to the 
creative team.
› In publishing, rather than or in conjunction 
with a brief, a synopsis or a manuscript will be 
provided to the book jacket designer.

Behavioral variables refer to things such as brand 
loyalty or the frequency of a product’s use. It can 
also include activities that these people perform 
either individually or as a group, such as blogging, 
dancing, or playing soccer.
Question 3: What Is the Audience’s 
Perception of the Brand or Group?
You need to assess what the core audience thinks and 
feels about the brand or group for which you are 
going to design to better understand and appre-
ciate these people’s needs and desires. Keep in 
mind that people’s perceptions of a brand, group, 
or entity ﬂ uctuate.
Question 4: What Would You Like the 
Core Audience to Think and Feel?
Determine one clear reaction you want the audience to 
have. The designer needs to develop a design con-
cept that will engage the core audience and offer 
a positive experience. The answer to this question 
should reﬂ ect the goals of the assignment as well 
as take into account what the audience currently 
perceives (relates to Question 3).
For Figure 4-08, Superdrug asked Turner 
Duckworth “to create a new kid’s hair care range 
of shampoos, conditioners, and detanglers that 
would bring a sense of fun to a sometimes stress-
ful experience for both parent and child.
Sample Detailed Design Brief Used for 
Branding, Visual Identity, Promotional 
Design, and Advertising
Question 1: What Is Our Challenge? 
What Is Our Goal?
Every project has a purpose and desired outcome. The
project could be anything from the design of a 
comprehensive visual identity to a single applica-
tion such as the design of a brochure or informa-
tional poster. It could be for a new or established 
brand or group or for a merger. Succinct answers 
to these questions will aid concept generation. 
See “Case Study: MSF” to learn about Emerson, 
Wajdowicz Studio's interesting design challenge.
Question 2: Who Is the Core Audience?
Identifying the people who comprise the core audi-
ence is essential in formulating design concepts that 
are relevant. Many factors and criteria are evalu-
ated when deﬁ ning the core audience. The ﬁ nal 
answer is usually in the form of a demographic, 
psychographic, or behavioral proﬁ le. The term 
demographic means selected population char-
acteristics. Some common variables include age, 
gender, income, education, home ownership, 
marital status, race, and religion. Psychographic 
proﬁ les are any type of attributes relating to per-
sonality, attitudes, interests, values, or lifestyles.

their culture or community. What might con nect
to an audience in China might not connect to an 
audience in Ireland (Figure 4-09).
Question 8: What Media Will 
Best Facilitate Our Goal?
Consider media where the people you want to reach 
spend the most time. When searching for answers 
to this question, consider media in creative ways. 
Determine the manner in which your viewers 
relate to each different medium. Consider the 
capabilities of each medium. Budget can also have 
a great effect on the selection of media.
Question 9: What Are the Most Critical 
Executional Elements? What Is the Budget?
Determine visual and text elements required for each 
application. Elements can include requisite visuals, 
color palette, typeface(s), logo, tagline, sign-off, 
tone of voice, main text or copy, features, rules or 
regulations, promotions, values, expiration dates, 
800 numbers, website addresses, and games. 
Again, budget will affect many of your decisions, 
including media, paper selection or substrates for 
print, and colors for print.
The number of required elements will vary 
depending on the nature and scope of the project. 
For example, a logo and web address may be the 
only elements required for an outdoor billboard; 
for a website, there will be a long list of required 
components.
Determine which elements are most important 
in establishing visual and verbal identity and per-
sonality in a consistent and relevant manner.
 “With tongue ﬁ rmly in cheek we created a range of 
fruity little monsters, which hint at the fragrance of 
each product. Other monsters that illustrate the prod-
uct type include a dripping three-eyed monster for the 
‘After Swim 3 in 1 Conditioning Shampoo and Body 
Wash,’ for example.
“Kids love the illustrations and the name connects 
on a personal level with mums. Fun continues on 
back of pack with copy talking directly to the little 
monster in every household with a ‘helpful’ checklist 
of what you should and shouldn’t do when washing 
your own hair. Bath time transformed.”
Question 5: What Speciﬁ c Information and 
Thoughts Will Assist in This Change? 
Provide facts and information that will enable people 
to alter their beliefs and opinions. Make a short list 
of the relevant information to support the mes-
sage. Rank information by importance to further 
focus the creative development. “This is great for 
critique of the creative work, as well, by asking if 
the creative solutions address the real issues that 
need to be communicated so as to inﬂ uence the 
audience,” advises creative director Richard Pala-
tini, Delia Associates.
Question 6: What Is at the Core 
of the Brand Personality?
The brand essence should be codiﬁ ed. Each brand 
or group should have a well-deﬁ ned essence, a 
core brand personality. This allows for positioning
which will help deﬁ ne the entity against the com-
petition in the minds of the target audience.
Examples of well-known brand cores are:
› Volvo™ 
Safety
› Orbit™ gum 
Clean
› Apple™ 
Creativity
› Peace Corps™ 
Nobility
Question 7: What Is the Key Emotion 
That Will Build a Relationship with 
the Core Audience?
Identify one emotion that people need to feel most 
when connected to the brand or group. Establishing 
the right emotional connection with people cre-
ates deep relationships, builds brand communities, 
and fosters loyalty. Determining how to connect 
to a targeted audience also means understanding

A concept is visually expressed through the cre-
ation, selection, combination, manipulation, and 
arrangement of visual and verbal (text) elements.

Generating solid and creative design con-
cepts takes intelligence, work, skill, and talent. 
For many students and novices, generating con-
cepts is the most challenging stage in the design 
process. You realize it is not enough to sim-
ply arrange graphic elements; it is necessary to 
Client Review during Phase 2
During certain phases of the process, the client 
reviews and approves the direction and efforts up 
until that point. Asking a client to review and 
sign off on what has been discussed and deter-
mined can help avoid misunderstandings down 
the road.
PHASE 3: CONCEPTUAL DESIGN/
VISUAL CONCEPTS
An effective graphic design solution is driven by 
an underlying concept. A design concept is the 
creative reasoning underlying a design applica-
tion, the guiding idea that determines how you 
design; it is the primary broad abstract idea. 
Essentially, the design drives the hows and whys 
of your design decisions—how you create or 
why you select imagery and typefaces or letter-
ing, the reasoning for color palette selection. It 
sets the framework for all your design decisions. 
For example, in Figure 4-11, Matsumoto Incor-
porated explains how the design expresses their 
concept: “The square format is used because Poul 
Kjaerholm based many of his furniture designs 
on the square. The use of Futura type reinforces

QUALYS TRADESHOW EXHIBIT 
(TOP ROW: PRELIMINARY 
CONCEPTS AND SKETCHES)
• GEE + CHUNG DESIGN, SAN FRANCISCO
• CREATIVE DIRECTOR/ART DIRECTOR/DESIGNER/
ILLUSTRATOR: EARL GEE
Preliminary Sketches
Qualys Tradeshow Exhibit Concepts:
Three distinctly different conceptual 
approaches were presented to determine 
the most effective approach for the client:
Concept 1: Overlapping Rings of 
Security
Concept 2: Transparent Towers of 
Security
Concept 3: Symbolic Metaphors of 
Security
Objective: Qualys is the leading provider of 
on demand security audits to identify and 
protect against network vulnerabilities. 
The challenge was to create an effective 
tradeshow environment at the RSA 
Conference 2006, the world’s largest 
network security technology showcase.
Solution: Bold, iconic security metaphors 
establish Qualys’ “Security On Demand” 
theme. The reception “target wall” 
conveys the fi rm’s focus on targeting 
vulnerabilities while inviting a clear view 
of the presentation stage. The giant 
padlock with rotating shield logo functions 
as a powerful symbol of network security 
and projects a strong corporate presence 
across the hall. The keyhole entryway 
opens to a clean, calming all-white 
conference room for private meetings. 
The plasma screen’s fl uorescent rings and 
podium’s vertical lines represent Qualys’ 
state-of-the-art scanning technology. 
The theater structure suggests scanning 
waves and provides high-key lighting and 
surround sound for the audience. Stools 
with clocks of 12 major international cities 
symbolize 24/7 global network security. 
Key-shaped workstations embedded with 
computer code demonstrate network 
security solutions.
Results: The iconic booth was highly 
successful, generating a signifi cant 
increase in qualifi ed leads and becoming 
the anchor for nightly RSA Conference 
news coverage and generating valuable 
exposure for Qualys.

your ﬁ rst thoughts or (partially formed) ideas may 
lead to a workable design concept. Clearly deﬁ ne 
the assignment to generate a successful design 
solution. Make sure you examine the materials 
with the speciﬁ c assignment and goal in mind.
Step 2: Incubation Period
Once you have examined all the materials, it’s time 
to allow all you learned to simmer in your mind. 
Taking a break from working on an assignment 
turns the concept generation over to your subcon-
scious mind. Even when disengaged from concept 
generation, the brain is highly active. By allow-
ing the problem to percolate in the back of your 
mind, your subconscious may do the job for you. 
Often, to take a break, designers turn to experi-
encing other arts, which might engage their con-
scious minds, stimulate emotional responses, and 
encourage the subconscious. Psychologists say this 
is especially true if the mind is turning over a prob-
lem.11 Examples include reading award-winning 
ﬁ ction; seeing an art house ﬁ lm; attending a music 
or dance concert, theater performance, or ﬁ ne art 
exhibit; or creating ﬁ ne art (painting, sculpting, 
drawing, photography, ceramic arts). Some design-
ers prefer semiconscious behaviors, like doodling, 
daydreaming, or folding paper into odd shapes, to 
be a kind of constructive self-entertainment. 
Step 3: Illumination/Concept Generation 
For many, a concept is illuminated—it pops up 
as if out of a magic lamp, as Athena sprung from 
Zeus’s head in Greek mythology. Often, when we 
are relaxed and not working at formulation, while 
driving, cooking, exercising, showering, or doo-
dling, a concept comes to us. However, if incuba-
tion has not worked for you, refer to the creativity 
section in this chapter. Here are other avenues
to pursue.
More Points of Departure 
for Conceptualization
› Words: Legendary graphic designer and adman 
George Lois advises using words to generate con-
cepts. Lois asserts that visual artists can think 
equally well in words as in visuals. Try making 
word lists, word associations, word maps, word 
mergers, or any method that will work for you.
expressively communicate an idea and message to 
an audience through the visual design, to create 
clear and interesting communication. Formulat-
ing a concept necessitates analysis, interpretation, 
inference, and reﬂ ective thinking.
For any assignment, a design studio or agency 
must generate several viable concepts to present 
to their client. In Figure 4-13, we see both the 
preliminary concepts and ﬁ nished solutions for 
the Qualys Tradeshow Exhibit project. Earl Gee, 
Gee + Chung Design, presented three distinctly 
different conceptual approaches “to determine 
the most effective approach for the client.” Being 
able to generate several, or in fact many, concepts 
to solve any given problem is a design skill.
Concept-Generation Process
The generally accepted protocol for concept gen-
eration is based on the four-stage model outlined 
in The Art of Thought by Graham Wallas, English 
political scientist and psychologist, in 1926:
Preparation
Incubation
Illumination Verification
In 1965, James Webb Young, a renowned copy-
writer at J. Walter Thompson, wrote an indis-
pensable book, A Technique for Producing Ideas,
where he colorfully and articulately explains his 
process based on Wallas’s model.
Step 1: Preparation
Software can aid in organizing the materials 
you’ve gathered, allowing you to save queries, 
save views, sort topics, select topics for modiﬁ -
cation, and more. Social bookmarking websites, 
such as http://del.icio.us.com, allow you to store 
your bookmarks online and add bookmarks from 
any computer. Such sites can keep track of source 
materials and commentary you ﬁ nd online.
1/ Thoroughly examine your materials for 
insights.
2/ Examine for connections; then correlate to 
ﬁ nd an insight or idea platform.
3/ Write any idea or insight on an index card, 
in a notebook, or in a digital ﬁ le.
Developing your ability to see relationships
among elements, facts, information, places, and 
objects will help you generate concepts. Any of 

Seed Media Group is a scientiﬁ c publisher of 
magazines, books and ﬁ lms.
As we worked on the identity it became clear 
that the end result should constitute a visualiza-
tion of science and media.
Science is culture, it surrounds us, it is part of 
everything we do. We were looking for something 
open ended and ﬂ exible, a vessel we could ﬁ ll with 
new meanings as they developed.
Formally the identity is based on phyllotaxis, a 
form found everywhere from Seashells to Greek 
architecture, from pineapples to the Sydney opera 
house, horns of Gazelles to the optimum curve a 
highway turns. It plays a role in biology, zoology, 
botany, medicine, physics, geometry and math. 
It’s in the golden ratio and golden curve.
Looking at the world through this scientiﬁ c 
lens of the phyllotaxis, we developed an identity 
like a chameleon, it always takes on the form of 
the medium it is put on. On the business cards it 
shows a version of the portrait of the bearer, the 
letterhead iridescently reﬂ ects the room, etc.

PHASE 4: DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
Finally, it’s time to design your solution. Now your 
design concept takes articulate visual form. For 
many, this is a nonlinear process, where the steps 
in the design process vary markedly as a result 
of the nature of creative thinking and designing. 
Individual factors or circumstances cause design-
ers to follow different paths with deviations from 
those paths. For instance, many designers create 
thumbnail sketches throughout the process to 
develop concepts, to visualize, and to compose. 
Some designers start with visual collages; others 
start with words. The following steps are a good 
point of departure. Soon you will ﬁ nd your own 
way of working that best suits your personality.
Step 1: Thumbnail Sketches
Thumbnail sketches are preliminary, small, quick, 
unreﬁ ned drawings of your ideas in black and 
white or color. Best practice dictates that you use 
traditional image-making techniques—sketch by 
hand using a drawing tool, such as a pencil, marker, 
or pen, and do not sketch using digital media. 
Why? Sketching with a pencil or marker fosters 
exploring, problem ﬁ nding, visual thinking, and dis-
covering. When starting with digital media, many 
students do not sketch; they surf for images from 
stock houses to jump-start conceptualization. 
Using conventional drawing tools, such as a pen-
cil, also prevents you from reﬁ ning created images 
too quickly, which happens to almost every novice 
when proceeding to the computer to “sketch.”
When you sketch, the actual process of sketch-
ing allows you to think visually, to explore and 
make discoveries, and to stay open to possibilities 
during the art-making process. At ﬁ rst, generating 
many sketches may be frustrating; however, it gets 
easier with experience. Generate as many different 
sketch ideas as possible. (Unfortunately, beginners 
are often happy with their ﬁ rst few sketches, stop-
ping after a few.) Jose Molla, founder and creative 
director of La Comunidad in Miami, advises: 
“The difference between bad and good creatives is 
that they both come up with the same pedestrian 
solutions, but the bad creative stops there and 
the good creative keeps working toward a more 
unique and interesting solution.”
› Theme as concept: New media designer and 
ﬁ lmmaker Hillman Curtis discusses themes in 
his book, MTIV: Process, Inspiration and Practice 
for the New Media Designer. A theme is a distinct 
conceptual or pictorial topic-based approach, 
which can be based on a thought, an emotion, 
society, nature, politics, or religion, among other 
subject areas such as “independence,” “jealousy,” 
or “democracy.” Variations on a theme also can 
work as a platform for ideation.
› Symbol: Employ an object or image to repre-
sent or stand for another thing, thought, idea,
or feeling.
› Literary and rhetorical devices: Use a metaphor, 
simile, onomatopoeia, personiﬁ cation, pleonasm, or 
metonymy, among others, as a concept platform.
› Merge: Combine two related or unrelated objects 
or visuals together to form a unique whole.
› Synthesis: Combine/synthesize more than two 
separate elements that form a new, more com-
plex whole.
› Juxtaposition: Place two visuals side by side for 
contrast or comparison.
Step 4: Veriﬁ cation: Crystallizing 
the Design Concept
Once you generate a concept, you need to evalu-
ate it, testing for both functionality and creativity. 
Most concepts require reﬁ nement to strengthen 
them and to ensure they will work in practice. 
This is the point in the process to keenly critique 
your own concepts; it involves evaluating/assess-
ing and logically supporting your viewpoint.
 Those who are able to generate concepts quickly 
or immediately are either seasoned designers or 
well informed about the subject and assignment. 
Experienced creative thinkers rely on a warehouse 
of creative thinking tools they have utilized in 
their repertoire, just as a seasoned winning foot-
ball coach relies on his experience, range of tech-
niques, abilities, skills, and talented instincts.
Several steps are involved in concept generation:
› Deﬁ ning the design problem
› Preparation: Gathering and examining materials
› Incubation
› Generating and selecting ideas
› Assessing ideas

Tip: When you show your thumbnail sketches 
to your instructor or design director, it’s helpful to 
number them for reference, especially if you are 
e-mailing them.
Step 2: Roughs
Roughs are larger and more reﬁ ned than thumb-
nail sketches. The purpose of this stage is to ﬂ esh 
out a few of your best ideas—to work on each 
design concept and how it can best be expressed 
through the creation, selection, and manipulation 
of type and visuals in a composition. It is important 
for students and novices to work out their ideas, 
exploring how to best create, select, and manipulate 
visuals and type more fully before going to a ﬁ nal 
stage. At this point, depending on how you work, 
you will have begun or be in the midst of visualiza-
tion. (See Chapter 5 on visualization.) This stage 
also is used to explore possible creative approaches 
to image making—collage, photomontage, print-
making, drawing, or any handmade technique that 
can be used to best express your design concept. 
Even though a rough may look ﬁ nal, it is not ﬁ n-
ished at this point. Roughs should be done to scale 
(in correct proportion of the ﬁ nal format, whether 
it is a website frame or a business card). Depending 
on your design director or creative director at work, 
he or she may wish to see each visual stage—from 
thumbnails through comps for input or approval. A 
client sees a more reﬁ ned solution.
If a design concept does not work as a rough, 
it certainly will not work as a solution. If it’s not 
working, rethink, go back over your thumbnail 
sketches, or generate more concepts. It is impor-
tant to generate several workable design concepts 
at the outset so that you have backup. Most clients 
prefer to select from among at least three different 
design concepts and executions.
Tip: It is a good idea to wait a day or so between 
creating roughs and creating comps, which is the 
next step. Time in between will give you a fresh 
perspective on your work.
Step 3: Comprehensives
A comprehensive, referred to as a comp, is a de-
tailed representation of a design concept thought-
fully visualized and composed. Comps usually 
look like a printed or ﬁ nished piece, though they 
have not yet been produced. Mock-up or dummy
describes a three-dimensional comp.
When a client sees a comp, he or she will see 
a very close representation of how the piece will 
look when produced. It fully represents your solu-
tion to the design problem before it goes public, 
before it is printed or viewed digitally or in any 
other media.
(Color comps generated on an ofﬁ ce or home 
ink-jet printer will vary a good deal from color 
printed by a professional printer using printing 
inks.) Type, illustrations, photographs, and lay-
out are rendered closely enough to the ﬁ nished 
design application to convey an accurate impres-
sion of the ﬁ nal piece. Every line of type should 
be adjusted, all the letterspacing considered. A 
ﬁ nal comp must be well crafted.
Client Review during Phase 4
Rarely do clients throw up their arms in wild 
approval and say, “That’s great! Let’s produce 
this.” More often than not, clients request changes 
and reﬁ nements. During this phase, the designer 
evaluates, reﬁ nes, and secures approval from
the client.
Very often, the comp is used as a visual agree-
ment of the solution between the designer and 
client and as a guide or “blueprint” for the 
printer. If you are creating an application for 
print, it is important to remind the client that the 
paper stock will most likely change the appear-
ance of the printed piece. Also, digital applica-
tions will look different from comps printed on 
laser paper.
PHASE 5: IMPLEMENTATION
For a graphic design student, execution means 
either printing one’s solution on a home printer or 
showing it on-screen to one’s instructor or creat-
ing a mock-up of a three-dimensional application, 
such as a package design. In a professional setting, 
implementing one’s design solution takes a variety 
of forms depending on the type of application and 
whether the application is print, screen-based, or 
environmental. Very often, designers go on press 
to ensure accuracy and may work closely with the

select paper, check laser proofs and other prepress 
proofs, and deliver the job to the client.
A design solution must be prepared in the form 
of digital ﬁ les. All visual elements—photography, 
illustration, and fonts—must be prepared properly 
to ensure successful printing or digital loading.
The technical skills one needs for creating 
a comp are somewhat different from the ones 
needed to prepare a ﬁ le for the printer. Many stu-
dents and designers work in imaging or drawing 
software to create comps. For the printer, almost 
all ﬁ les should be prepared in layout programs 
or in Adobe Acrobat™. (For a fee, most printers 
can correct your ﬁ les.) You must learn to properly 
prepare font and label folders. This book does not 
attempt to cover the intricacies of print or web 
production. However, the following is a list of 
skills most often required.
Digital Design Skills Necessary 
for Implementation 
For print media, an entry-level graphic designer is 
required, at a minimum, to be ﬂ uent in industry-
standard software applications, such as the Adobe 
Creative Suite®—PhotoShop®, Illustrator®, and 
InDesign®.To be a desirable entry-level candidate, 
you need to understand how to utilize and inte-
grate these software programs to produce work 
that conforms to industry standards and your 
employer’s expectations. You should know short-
cuts and be familiar with major programs. Besides 
possessing knowledge of the Adobe Creative 
Suite, an entry-level web designer should possess 
an in-depth understanding of the capabilities of 
web browsers; website architecture (hierarchical 
organization structure of information speciﬁ cally 
for navigation purposes); (front-end) design capa-
bilities in graphics; motion (and perhaps anima-
tion); Flash® and Dreamweaver®; and knowledge 
of ActionScript®; CSS with HTML (back-end) 
is a plus. 
Craftsmanship
Craftsmanship refers to the level of skill, proﬁ -
ciency, and dexterity of the execution. It includes 
the use of papers, inks, varnishes, cutting and past-
ing, and software programs. Well-crafted work 
enhances good design concepts. Many students 
printer. For Figure 4-14, Morla Design said they 
“handled all aspects of production, from concept 
inception to delivery of 40,000 books.”
In Figure 4-15, you see some of the steps 
involved in producing and printing an applica-
tion. Brainforest comments that their goal for pro 
bono client Gilda’s Club Chicago was “to spread 
the news about this special place where the focus 
is on living with cancer. We applied for, and won, 
a prestigious Sappi Ideas That Matter grant that 
allowed Brainforest to develop, print and dis-
tribute 5000 Living With Cancer Workbooks on 
behalf of the Club. This piece won several design 
industry awards and has been used as a model for 
Gilda’s Clubs and other cancer support founda-
tions on the national level.”
Digital prepress, also called production, in-
cludes preparing the digital ﬁ les utilizing industry-
standard software, collecting all needed pho-
tographs and/or illustrations and having them 
scanned, preparing font folders and image folders, 
proofreading (with or without the client), and fol-
lowing through by working with the printer. It is 
often required of an entry-level designer because 
senior-level designers prefer to design only and 
not be involved with production work. Entry-level 
graphic designers often prepare digital ﬁ les for the 
printer and prepare digital ﬁ les for upload to the 
web. The designer must create meticulous digital 
ﬁ les and give explicit instructions to the printer,

boards, inks, adhesives, cutting tools, drawing 
tools (markers, pens, pencils, chalks, brushes, 
crayons), software programs, and graphic aids. 
Learn about materials by visiting art supply stores 
and printing shops. Attend paper shows where 
you can examine paper samples and ask questions 
of sales representatives. Learning about paper is 
crucial. When you obtain paper samples, notice 
how each paper takes ink. (Many designers are 
display their portfolios on websites, on mobile or 
other digital devices, or on DVDs. Some employ-
ers still prefer to see hard copies—comprehen-
sives and mock-ups in portfolios. Many design 
directors respond to the visceral impact of work. 
Design solutions should be neat, clean, accurate, 
functional, and ecologically mindful.
You should familiarize yourself with as many 
materials, tools, and processes as possible: papers,

D.M.
I’ve been asked to write a brief article about 
the process designers use to move an idea from 
thought to execution. Since design is the result 
of both left and right brain activity in varying 
proportions, it’s subject to the individual nuances 
of individual brains; it’s highly unlikely that any 
two designers would solve the same problems in 
exactly the same way. So although there are prob-
ably universal checkpoints in the design process, 
the only designer I can actually speak for is me. 
A lot of this may be just common sense and a 
lot happens between and around these points, 
but here’s my attempt to systemize an incredibly 
complex, nonlinear process.
1 / Have a problem. There is no more difﬁ cult 
design project than one which does not 
involve solving a problem. All of the work 
I consider my most successful has been 
built around a problem (or two). Want 
something to just look good? Big problem!
2 / Have an audience. If I don’t know who my 
client wants to be talking to, how can I 
determine which language to use?
3 / Get the information. Design is about solv-
ing someone else’s problem with someone 
else’s money, so it has to start with some-
one else’s information. I’m an “expert” 
in very few areas, but I get asked to help 
communicate for people who do incred-
ibly diverse things, and they usually know 
their stuff. So I sell my ignorance. I ask as 
many dumb/smart questions as necessary 
to try to get to the essence of any problem.
4 / Read between the lines. I pay attention to 
what I’m hearing but also to what I’m not
hearing. Sometimes there are incredible 
ideas hiding in there.
5 / Get the words right. A picture may paint 
a thousand words, but a few of the right 
words can help me visualize a design solu-
tion. I think in words. I design around 
words. There are usually lots of good ones 
ﬂ ying around in the meetings I have 
with my clients. And clients say the 
darnedest things!
6 / Bring yourself to the problem. Design 
is the product of human interpretation. 
I believe if a client has hired me to help 
solve their problem, I have to approach it 
in a way that makes sense to me. If I try 
to solve a problem the way I think some-
one else would, what value have I added?
7 / Recognize the solution when you see it. 
Buckminster Fuller summed it up per-
fectly: “When I am working on a prob-
lem, I never think about beauty. I only 
think about how to solve the problem. 
But when I have ﬁ nished, if the solution 
is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.”
8 / Don’t sell design. When I present a 
design recommendation, I’m not selling 
“design”—I’m selling a solution to my cli-
ent’s problems. Colors, images, typefaces, 
technologies, papers—whatever. No one 
cares but you and your peers. Your client 
just wants to: insert client problem here.
9 / Make sure your clients can see themselves 
in the solution. If I’ve done my homework 
and my interpretation is correct, my cli-
ents should recognize themselves—either 
as they are or as they want to be—in what 
I design. If they don’t, I missed the mark. 
If you don’t believe in listening to your 
clients, try putting your money where 
your mouth is: give your hair stylist 
$500 and let him do whatever he wants 
to your head.
10 / Make sure you can build what you’ve 
designed. Everyone has a budget, and 
everyone needs/wants more for that budget 
than they can get. Never present anything 
unless you know it delivers on that. The 
best solution isn’t a solution at all if your 
client can’t afford it.

11 / Keep the ball in your client’s court. Once 
a project is into development and produc-
tion, never get into a situation where you 
are the one holding things up. Move it or 
lose it.
12 / See it through. How a design project is 
printed/programmed/fabricated/ﬁ nished 
is critical, and attention to detail makes 
all the difference. I remember seeing a 
sign in an aircraft factory: “Build it as if 
you are going to ﬂ y it.” When the ﬁ nished 
design project is in your client’s hands, 
your reputation is too.

how the paper handles the ﬁ nishing process.
› Coated and uncoated papers take color very 
differently.

The materials you use, whether for a compre-
hensive or a printed graphic design solution, are 
critical to the execution of the design and con-

solution and present it can enhance or detract 
from it.
Debrieﬁ ng
After a design assignment has ended, some clients 
and designers ﬁ nd debrieﬁ ng useful. This involves 
reviewing the solution and its consequences.
It is exceptionally useful to debrief—to exam-
ine your ﬁ nished assignment after it has ended to 
ﬁ gure out what went wrong and what went right.

➊ Sketch four visuals that relate to the fi lm. Assign 
emotions to each visual. Creatively name each 
visual.
➋ Now pair each of your sketches with a (logical 
or absurd) related visual (found or handmade). 
Using the creative tool of synthesis, merge or 
juxtapose the visuals. If you merge the two 
seduced by the tactile aspect of a paper and forget 
to check how it will take ink.) Visit a printer and 
see how things are done; start conversations with 
printers. Learn about the different types of inks, 
ﬁ nishes, and printing techniques. In addition 
to the basic materials listed, there is a wealth of 
presentation materials available. Learning to cut, 
glue, mount, and mat are essential hand skills for 
a design student.
Presentation—the manner in which comps are 
presented to a client or the way work is presented 
in your portfolio—is important. When presenting 
to a client, a great presentation can truly enhance 
your chances of selling your solution.
Suggestions
› Make it accurate. Try to closely capture the 
colors, textures, type, and visuals of the concept 
you are presenting.
› Make it neat. You want people to notice your 
design, not how poorly something is cut or pasted.
› Present it professionally. A good and thought-
ful presentation can enhance your design solu-
tion, and a poor presentation can only detract 
from it.
Paper Tips
› Consider recycled paper or tree-free papers.
› Consider all paper attributes: ﬁ nish, weight, 
and color.
› Understand which weights of paper are best 
suited for various applications.
Tips from Sandy Alexander, Inc. of Clifton, 
New Jersey:
› Ask, “How will this paper hold up for binding, 
laminating, foil stamping, spot varnish, die cut, or 
embossing?”
› For a small quantity, the cost is insigniﬁ cant for 
a higher-grade paper.
› When choosing paper, look at printed pieces, 
not just swatches.
› Go to paper shows and get paper promotion-
als. They will allow you to see how paper takes 
ink and special printing techniques. Also, there is 
often an explanation of how it was printed on the 
back of the promo.
› Paper choice usually represents 50 percent of 
the cost of the entire printing job.

Learn the considerations of content, 
medium, and mode/style
Understand how visuals are 
classifi ed
Integrate type and visuals
Appreciate modes of visualization 
and expression
Examine the basics of visualizing 
form
VISUALIZATION
AND COMPOSITION ARE 
DRIVEN BY A DESIGN CONCEPT—BY ITS PURPOSE, ITS AUDIENCE, AND 
ITS FUNCTION, AS WELL AS WHAT FORM IT WILL TAKE (FORMAT, MEDIA, 
SCOPE). HOW YOU VISUALIZE AND COMPOSE YOUR CONCEPT HINGES ON 
WHAT YOU WANT SAY, TO WHOM YOU ARE SAYING IT, AND WITH WHAT 
CONNOTATION. AS ALICE E. DRUEDING, PROFESSOR, GRAPHIC AND 
INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND AREA HEAD OF THE BFA PROGRAM AT TYLER 
SCHOOL OF ART, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY, POINTS OUT, STEPS IN THE DESIGN 
PROCESS MAY NOT PROGRESS IN AN ORDERLY FASHION: “THE ORDER I 
EMPHASIZE WITH STUDENTS IS (1) CONCEPT, (2) GENERAL VISUALIZATION 
(CONTENT, MEDIUM, STYLE), AND (3) ORGANIZATION (COMPOSITION, GRID, 
GOLDEN SECTION, ETC.)—WITH THE CAVEAT THAT THINGS DON’T ALWAYS 
WORK IN SUCH A LINEAR MANNER.”
Often, steps in the process of conceptualization, visualization, and composition can hap-
pen simultaneously or with great overlap, with back and forth, modifying a concept as you 
make discoveries while visualizing. Or use visualizing for concept generation. Or . . . which-
ever method best allows you to visually express your concept. Undoubtedly, you will ﬁ nd 
your preliminary decisions are subject to change during the course of visualization. You may 
ﬁ nd your initial impulse overridden by intuition during the process, by a critique, by practical 
matters related to image quality, time, budget, by a happy accident that altered your thinking, 
or by any number of factors.
CONSIDER ATIONS OF CONTENT, 
MEDIUM, AND MODE
After you generate a concept, you make preliminary decisions about content, medium, 
and mode.
› Content: Required text + visual components
› Media and Methods: How the component parts will be created, rendered, and displayed 
on screen or in print. Some include illustration, drawing and painting, photography, graphic 
illustration, collage, photomontage, layering, and type as image.
› Mode of Visualization and/or Style: A mode of visualization is how you will render and 
execute the visuals and type for a project, including decisions about the qualities and char-
acteristics of the form. Although some designers develop a unique style (distinctive, iden-
tiﬁ able forms), such as Luba Lukova (Figure 5-01), most designers vary their modes of 
visualization depending on a speciﬁ c project, using what is most appropriate and expres-
sive. Many beginners ﬁ xate on style development, which should not be a concern while 
studying design; it is much more important to focus on experimentation with visualization 
Designers learn 
by doing. They can 
learn faster when 
someone gives 
them a way to do 
it. When they learn 
how, they can 
understand it.

› Notation: a linear, reductive visual that cap-
tures the essence of its subject, characterized by 
its minimalism.
› Pictograph: an elemental, universal picture 
denoting an object, activity, place, or person, 
and composition. Style also can become a means 
for composing; for example, you can base your 
composition on the compositional, structural, 
stylistic conventions of the Vienna Secession, 
art deco, Swiss school, or any other school
of thought.
ABOUT VISUALS
Graphic designers work with two main compo-
nents: type and visuals. As discussed in Chapter 
3, type can be created in a variety of ways—for 
example, computer generated, hand drawn, 
handmade, or photographed. Visuals is a broad 
term encompassing many kinds of representa-
tional, abstract, or nonobjective depictions—
photographs, illustrations, drawings, paintings, 
prints, graphic elements and marks, and elemen-
tal images such as pictograms, signs, or symbols; 
visuals are also called images.
In Type and Image: The Language of Graphic 
Design, Philip B. Meggs explains, with great clar-
ity, how we classify images, from the rudimentary 
to the complex.1 Classifying visuals and how to 
depict them helps you understand the range and 
potential of visuals to communicate (see Dia-
gram 5-01).

CLASSIFICATION OF IMAGES

P. 108
Chapter  05
There are three basic classiﬁ cations of depic-
tion as they directly refer to and then move away 
from what we see in nature (see Diagram 5-02):
› Representational: a rendering attempting to 
replicate actual objects as seen in nature; the viewer 
recognizes the image; also called ﬁ gurative.
› Abstraction: a simple or complex rearrange-
ment, alteration, or distortion of the represen-
tation of natural appearance, used for stylistic 
distinction and/or communication purposes.
› Nonobjective: a purely invented visual, not 
derived from anything visually perceived; it does 
not relate to any object in nature and does not 
literally represent a person, place, or thing; also 
called nonrepresentational.
SIGNS AND SYMBOLS
Graphic design signiﬁ es. Graphic design repre-
sents. Graphic design communicates. From the 
theory of semiotics, the study of signs and sym-
bols, we get a classiﬁ cation of signs—what they 
mean and how they are used in graphic design.2
(Please see Diagram 5-03.)
› Sign: a visual mark or a part of language that 
denotes another thing. For example, the word dog
and a pictograph of a dog are both signs used to 
represent “dog”; the $ denotes money; the letter 
“H” is a sign for a spoken sound.
› Icon: a generally accepted (pictorial or symbol) 
visual to represent objects, actions, and concepts; 
an icon resembles the thing it represents or, at 
a minimum, shares a quality with it. It can be a 
photograph, a pictorial representation, an elemen-
tal visual (think magnifying glass desktop icon), 
arbitrary (think radioactive sign), or symbolic 
(think lightning bolt to represent electricity).
› Index: a visual that directs the attention of 
the interpreter (viewer) due to its neighboring 
relationship to it without describing or resem-
bling the thing signiﬁ ed. There are a variety of 
ways this happens: whether as a cue that makes 
the viewer think of the reference (for example, 
a paciﬁ er is an indexical sign for an infant), by 
its proximity to it (for example, a divers down 
ﬂ ag means someone is under water and you must 
steer clear of the area), by actually pointing to 
the thing signiﬁ ed (an arrow at an intersection 
in a road), or by being physical evidence of it (for 
captured through shape—for example, the images 
denoting gender on bathroom doors.
› Silhouette: the articulated shape of an object 
or subject taking its speciﬁ city into account (as 
opposed to the universal visual language of a 
pictograph).
› Linear: a visual created by a predominant use 
of line to describe shape or form.
› Contour: a shape or form created through the 
linear outline of an object or subject’s boundaries.
› Light and Shadow: using light and shadow to 
describe form most closely simulates how we per-
ceive forms in nature. Also, a logical ﬂ ow of light, 
as it touches and describes forms, can help unify a 
composition. An extreme use of light and shadow 
is called chiaroscuro (also called claire-obscure).
› Naturalistic: a visual created by full color or tone 
using light and shadow that attempts to replicate 
an object or subject as it is perceived in nature; also 
called realistic. (Please note, in modern and con-
temporary ﬁ ne art theory and criticism, the terms 
naturalism and realism are deﬁ ned differently and 
represent different schools of thought.)
› Expressionistic: an expressionistic visualization 
is characterized by a highly stylized or subjective 
interpretation, with an emphasis on the psycho-
logical or spiritual meaning; there is no strict 
adherence to things as they appear in nature, as 
opposed to naturalism.

example, a photogram of a hand or a hoof print 
on the ground).
› Symbol: a visual that has an arbitrary or con-
ventional relationship between the signiﬁ er and 
the thing signiﬁ ed. The interpreter decodes mean-
ing through learned associations (for example, a 
dove has become accepted as a symbol of peace). 
Spoken or written words are symbols as well.
› Some symbols take on greater meaning than 
others due to their context and roles in religion, 
culture, history, or society; for example, the cross 
in Christianity, the ankh as symbol for life associ-
ated with ancient Egypt, the Star of David as sym-
bol for Judaism, and the yin–yang as the Chinese 
symbol of the interplay of forces in the universe. It 
is hard to think of anti-war protest posters with-
out thinking of the nuclear disarmament symbol 
designed by Gerald Holton in 1956. This graphic, 
a circle with a few lines in it, stands for something 
as profound as the idea of peace (Diagram 5-04).
Use of Signs and Symbols 
in Graphic Design
Signs and symbols serve many functions and pur-
poses in graphic design, whether as a stand-alone 
image, such as in a logo or as a pictograph on a 
bathroom door, or most often as components of a

COMMUNICATION DEVICE UTILIZING ICONS
• CREATIVE DIRECTOR: ALAN ROBBINS, THE 
DESIGN CENTER, KEAN UNIVERSITY OF 
NEW JERSEY
• DESIGNERS: VARIOUS DEDICATED 
STUDENTS
• CLIENT: SELF-INITIATED
The Talk Chart is a communication 
device for patients in hospitals and 
nursing homes. Using the 81⁄2" × 
11" laminated chart, patients with 
aphasia, throat tubes, or other 
impairments to their speech can 
now make their needs known to 
family and staff by pointing to the 
graphic symbols or letters of the 
alphabet that appear on the chart. 
The graphic symbols represent 
twenty basic patient needs and 
fi gures of the human body for 
pinpointing problems.
The Talk Chart was created and 
designed by college students 
in The Design Studio at Kean 
University under the direction of 
Professor Alan Robbins and is 
donated to local hospitals. Thanks 
to a generous grant from Sappi 
Paper, the Talk Chart is currently 
used in 2,000 hospitals throughout 
the United States.

design solution, such as a sign system that is part 
of a visual identity program, or a symbol, such 
as a heart, as a visual component within a poster
or brochure.
Today, so much information must be univer-
sally understood, crossing language and cultural 
barriers. Signs or icons in the form of picto-
grams serve this purpose wonderfully; they are 
purely visual, nonverbal communication. The 
Talk Chart, a communication tool for patients in 
hospitals, designed at Kean University’s Design 
Center, is an example of graphic design using pic-
tograms and the alphabet (Figure 5-02).
Wayﬁ nding signs and systems are used interna-
tionally. Usually, these wayﬁ nding systems assist 
and guide visitors and tourists to ﬁ nd what they 
are looking for in museums, airports, zoos, and

DISABILITY ACCESS SYMBOLS PROJECT
• X2 DESIGN, NEW YORK
• THE DISABILITY ACCESS SYMBOLS WERE PRODUCED BY THE GRAPHIC ARTISTS GUILD FOUNDATION 
WITH SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE OFFICE FOR SPECIAL CONSTITUENCIES, 
NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS. SPECIAL THANKS TO THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR 
THE ARTS. GRAPHIC DESIGN ASSISTANCE BY THE SOCIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL GRAPHIC DESIGN. 
CONSULTANT: JACQUELINE ANN CLIPSHAM.
The project was extremely challenging in terms of design because the client 
insisted on having organizations representing people with various disabilities 
review and comment on the proposed symbols. With the help of a disability 
consultant, we were able to reach consensus among all these groups and still 
achieve the primary objective—for organizations to use these symbols to better 
serve their audiences with disabilities.
Several existing symbols did not meet the standards we established and needed 
redesign. For example, the old symbol for Assistive Listening Systems focused on 
the disability (an ear with a diagonal bar through it). The new symbol focuses on 
the accommodation to the disability, i.e., a device that amplifi es sound for people 
who have diffi culty hearing. Other upgraded symbols include Sign Language 
Interpreted, Access (Other than Print or Braille) for Individuals Who Are Blind or 
Have Low Vision, and the International Symbol of Accessibility. A new symbol for 
Audio Description for TV, Video and Film was developed which, through design, 
proved less likely to degenerate when subjected to frequent photocopying.

city centers. Icons are widely used today in other 
functions; they are also referred to as symbol signs or 
access symbols by some in graphic design vernacular.
Screen-based media make great use of icons, 
usually in the form of pictographs (Figure 5-03). 
The primary objective of the Disability Access 
Symbols Project is for organizations to use these 
to better serve their audiences with disabilities 
(Figure 5-04).
Designing a system requires a clear design con-
cept and a consistent use of shapes, scale, and all 
the formal elements. The signs or icons in a sys-
tem must look as if they belong to the same fam-
ily. At times, more than one designer in a design 
ﬁ rm or studio will work to produce a system. It 
is imperative to establish a ﬁ rm design concept, 
style, and vocabulary of shapes for the system to 
look like it was created by one hand and mind, as

props would I need? Who are the people? What 
are their clothes? Where are they? In a room? On a 
boat? In America? Then I imagine the setting and 
the people and then start to draw. I usually do a 
rough drawing and then a ﬁ nished drawing.”
The following list explains broad categories of 
producing and creating images.
› Illustration: a handmade unique visual that 
accompanies or complements printed, digital, or 
spoken text, which clariﬁ es, enhances, illuminates, 
or demonstrates the message of the text. Illustra-
tors work in a variety of media and most often have 
uniquely identiﬁ able styles, as does Mitzie Testani 
in Figure 5-05. The AIGA notes, “Each illustrator 
brings a different perspective, vision and idea to play 
that, when married with great design, becomes an 
original art form.” When you are working profes-
sionally and need to hire an illustrator, you can ﬁ nd 
them in annuals, in source books, on the Internet, 
and through agents/representatives. (On a histori-
cal note, prior to the invention of photography, and 
also when photography was in its infancy and the 
equipment cumbersome, illustration was the most 
popular form of imagery in visual communication. 
Visit http://societyillustrators.org.)
› Photography: a visual created using a camera 
to capture or record an image. Commercial pho-
tographers specialize in various genres, such as still 
life, portraiture, sports, outdoor imagery, fashion, 
journalist, aerial, landscape, urban, moving image, 
events, food, and others. When you are working 
professionally and need to hire a photographer, 
in the complete set of ﬁ fty passenger and pedes-
trian symbols developed by the American Insti-
tute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (Timeline, page 
TL-15).
TYPES OF IMAGES AND 
IMAGE MAKING
Imagery is either created by the designer, commis-
sioned from an illustrator or photographer, selected
by the designer from among stock imagery or the 
client’s archives, or found by the designer (to be 
discussed in this chapter).
Visuals can be created using a multitude of 
tools and media—for example, using photogra-
phy, software, assemblage, collage, photogram, 
photomontage, drawing, painting, printmaking, 
mixed media, sculpture, ceramics, and more. (Any 
three-dimensional image would have to be pho-
tographed to be utilized on a printed or digital 
two-dimensional surface.)
When you create your own image, you are in 
control; you decide what goes into the image or 
scene (point of view, colors, textures, people, room, 
clothing, setting, etc.). When you select an image, 
you either accept the image as is—as someone else 
conceived it, visualized, and composed it—or alter 
it, assuming the stock image provides rights for 
such alterations. This difference is critical because 
every component of an image contributes to com-
munication. For example, legendary American 
cartoonist Henry Martin elucidates: “I get the idea 
ﬁ rst and then think how the idea would look. What

› Photomontage: a composite visual made up of 
a number of photographs or parts of photographs 
to form a unique image.
› Mixed media: a visual resulting from the use of 
different media—for example, photography com-
bined with illustration.
› Motion graphics: time-based visual commu-
nication that integrates visuals, typography, and 
audio, created using ﬁ lm, video, and computer 
software, including animation, television com-
mercials, ﬁ lm titles, and promotional and infor-
mational applications for broadcast media and 
new media.
› Diagram: a graphic representation of informa-
tion, statistical data, or a structure, environment, 
or process (the workings of something). A chart 
is a speciﬁ c type of diagrammatic representation 
of facts or data. A graph is a speciﬁ c type of dia-
gram used to indicate relationships between two 
(or more) variables, often represented on axes. A 
map is a speciﬁ c type of diagrammatical repre-
sentation used to depict a route or geographical 
area—to show location.
More on Visualization: 
Approach and Connotation
Designers may choose an approach—a look, man-
ner, tone, style, or any appearance—to communi-
cate or connote meaning. For example, utilizing 
a retro approach reminiscent of the 1950s for a 
hair gel product might endow the brand with a 
vintage look. Or using a historical period type-
face or hand lettering for an American Civil War 
Memorial Museum should add to its authenticity 
rather than seem clichéd.
Some approaches are:
› Retro
› Psychedelic
› Funk
› Primitive
› Childlike
› Grunge
› Surreal
› High-tech
› Homemade
› New Wave
› Futuristic
you can ﬁ nd one in annuals, in sourcebooks, and 
on the Internet. Fine art photography and journal-
ist photography are also utilized in graphic design. 
(Today, photography is probably the most popular 
form of image in visual communication.)
› Graphic interpretation: an elemental visualiza-
tion of an object or subject, almost resembling a 
sign, pictogram, or symbol in its reductive repre-
sentation (see Diagram 5-05). Although a graphic 
interpretation employs economy (stripping down 
visuals to fundamental forms), what differentiates 
a graphic interpretation from a sign or pictogram 
is its expressive quality; it is often more descrip-
tive. With the same skill set used to design logos or 
pictograms, graphic designers can capably create 
graphic interpretations.
› Collage: a visual created by cutting and pasting 
bits or pieces of paper, photographs, cloth, or any 
material to a two-dimensional surface, which can 
be combined with handmade visuals and colors. 
A conventional collage technique can be simu-
lated and rethought for digital media using com-
puter software (and its tools and capabilities) and 
hardware, a digital camera, and/or a scanner.

› Combination: merging two or more different 
or related visuals into a unique whole
› Deliberated camera angle and viewpoint: the 
perspective from which you position your camera
Presentation 
How you present a visual affects communication. 
Will you crop it? Bleed it? Isolate it? Juxtapose it? 
Frame it? How will the visual be presented on the 
page? Matters include:
› Margins: the blank space surrounding a visual 
on the left, right, top, or bottom edge of a page 
can frame a visual, almost presenting it in a formal 
manner. Margins also afford space for page num-
bers, running heads in publications, notations, 
captions, headings, titles, and credits.
HISTORICAL PERIODS 
AND CONNOTATION
Studying the history of graphic design affords 
one an understanding of how style communicates 
a period and the spirit of an age—the zeitgeist. 
Without a knowledge of design history, one risks 
designing without understanding the provenance, 
heritage, and associated meanings, as well as 
how form communicates meaning. For example, 
the art nouveau letterforms carry meanings that 
are reminiscent of that time period. By using 
an art nouveau–period typeface for a logo, that 
logo design would share in the vested meaning 
of the art nouveau period. (The essential book is 
A History of Graphic Design by Philip B. Meggs 
[Wiley].) Go to our website for a list of the styles 
and periods every designer should be able to grasp 
and visualize. 
Selecting Images and Image Manipulation
When a budget does not allow for commission-
ing an illustrator or photographer, you can turn 
to available archives of preexisting illustrations 
or photographs, referred to as stock (royalty-free
and “rights’ managed”), which can be licensed 
for a project from stock houses. Footage (a shot or 
sequence of shots on videotape or ﬁ lm) and music 
also are available from stock houses.
Some designers employ found imagery, utiliz-
ing existing imagery or objects in environments, 
public domain, or copyright-free images (wood-
cuts, linocuts, etchings, patterns, rules, and more), 
historical imagery, ephemera, old postcards, old 
letters, old maps, family photos, old photos, old 
playing cards, stamps, old greeting cards, old wrap-
ping paper, old cigar box labels, old labels, old signs, 
et cetera (all involving securing necessary rights if 
any are required).
Image making also involves manipulation. A 
common decision a designer must make is whether 
to use a visual as is or change it—manipulate it. 
Image manipulation includes:
› Alteration: a modiﬁ cation or change to the 
appearance of a visual
› Exaggeration: a modiﬁ cation that embellishes, 
ampliﬁ es, or overstates
› Economy: a reductive visualization
IMAGERY
IMAGERY, IMAGE APPROPRIATION, 
AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Many students start the visualization process by searching through stock image 
websites. This route stunts thinking and visualization. Also, the ease of fi nding high-
resolution visuals on the Internet has led to some signifi cant issues concerning 
image appropriation and violating intellectual property rights. Other than images 
that are in the public domain, which are copyright-free, photographs, illustrations, 
and graphic representations found on the Internet or in print publications are 
intellectual property (original creative work that is legally protected) belonging to 
other visual artists. In a professional setting, a designer or art director would have 
to commission images from a photographer or illustrator for a design application 
and/or license stock images from an archive or a stock house (a creative resource 
for graphic design, advertising, and media professionals that provides illustration, 
photography, footage, and rights services).
Most design directors and creative directors prefer to see original visuals cre-
ated by students themselves in their portfolio projects, demonstrating a student’s 
creativity, individuality, range, and initiative. With the advantage of digital cameras, 
students can take their own photography and work in Adobe Photoshop™. Scanners 
allow students to scan in their own handmade images and illustrations or illus-
trate using computer software. Some use of stock imagery in your portfolio allows 
creative directors to see that a beginner can choose stock appropriately and well. 
Choosing appropriately and well entails understanding images—their denotative and 
connotative meaning, classifi cation, style, shape, orientation, lighting, point of view/
angle, color palette, and composition.

edit it, to improve it, or to delete visual infor-
mation that might distract the viewer from the 
communication. Cropping alters the original 
visual; it alters its outer shape, its internal scale, 
and how the inner content is framed, and can 
change its focus.
› Bleed or full bleed: type or a visual that extends

three sides. See Diagram 5-06.
INTEGR ATING TYPE 
AND VISUALS
When type and visuals interact, then you have to 
determine how they will interact.
› Will the type and visuals share characteristics?
› Will the type and visuals work in opposition, be 
contrasted in style of visualization and/or form?
› Will the type drive the composition? Will the 
visual drive the composition?
› Will the type and visuals be organically 
intertwined?
› Will they touch, overlap, be juxtaposed, fuse? 
Will they be words that incorporate images or be 
images that incorporate words?
› Will one be the star and the other the support-
ing player?
To best explain visual/type integration, let’s 
break it into three categories:
› Supporting partner: a classic “neutral” typeface 
works cooperatively with the visual as the “star.” 
(This is, by far, the biggest category.)
› Sympathetic type and visual relationships. (This 
is the next biggest category.)
› Contrasting type and visual relationships. (This 
is an under-utilized category.)
SUPPORTING PARTNER
For the sake of clarity and visual interest, the 
tendency is to allow either type or visual(s) to 
be the star, hero, or heavy lifter, with the other 
component acting in a more neutral fashion, like 
a supporting actor. As an analogy, when reviewing 
a recent revival of David Mamet’s play, Speed the 
Plow, Ben Brantley, chief theater critic of The New 
York Times, described Scott Pask’s “tasteful, sterile 
› Rules: thin stripe(s) or line(s) used for borders 
or for separating text, columns of text, or visuals. 
Most often, rules function best when used to sep-
arate, as dividers, attracting little notice to them.
› Borders: a graphic band that runs along the edge 
of an image, acting to separate the image from the 
background, like a frame, by something as simple 
as a thin rule or as ornate as a Baroque frame. Bor-
ders also can act to emphasize the boundaries of 
an image. A border should never overwhelm or dis-
tract from what it frames.
› Cropping: the act of cutting a visual, a pho-
tograph, or illustration to use only part of it, not 
using it in its entirety. You can crop an image to

the type designed for clarity to complement the 
image. For Figure 5-08, a photographer’s website, 
it certainly makes sense to allow the visual to be 
the star; as John Clifford, Think Studio, com-

sets” for a character’s ofﬁ ce and house as “blank 
slates; words are what furnish these rooms.”3 Sim-
ilarly, in a design, type might be the well-chosen, 
sterile, blank slate, and the visual “furnishes the 
room.” For example, in Figure 5-06, the light 
bulb “icon” reigns supreme. If both type and visu-
als attract our attention due to equal prominence, 
then focus is diffused or lost.

One of the ways the ﬁ eld of graphic design is rad-
ically changing relates to the increasing emphasis 
we are placing on images for communication. The 
digital revolution and especially the technology of 
the web have pushed this steady evolution into an 
explosive mode. We are bombarded with images 
on our streets, in our homes, and in every device 
we use to keep in touch. Still and moving images 
dominate the media to the point that it is rare 
now to see isolated text or even isolated images. 
Instead, our visual surround is becoming a vast 
matrix of images, a virtual world we increasingly 
live inside.
As designers, we therefore need to understand 
the impact that images have and the ways we can 
manipulate and present them to achieve our goals. 
We need to understand, in other words, the kinds 
of information that images can convey, the way 
people look at images, and the impact our choices 
have on viewers.
One thing to keep in mind when working with 
images is that we understand them in many ways 
and on many different levels. Looking is an active 
process in which we very quickly build up the 
meaning of an image by probing it with our eyes 
and brain. For this reason, very few images have 
one single impact or meaning; most images affect 
us in a number of different ways.
But image creation is not accounting; there 
are no common rules to follow. The goal in using 
images, as it is in all of design, is to become sensi-
tive to the impact of the decisions we make and to 
understand what our options are as we pursue our 
objectives. As we select and alter images, we have 
to remember that many parts of that image may 
be signiﬁ cant depending on its ﬁ nal use. That can 
include details that we choose to emphasize or 
eliminate, colors and tones that we adjust or cre-
ate, and the sense of balance, hierarchy, or rhythm 
that we decide to manipulate or impose.
Take the ﬁ rst issue about which details in the 
image matter. Ask yourself what the focus, the 
main point, in the image is or should be. What 
do you want people to notice ﬁ rst, second, third? 
Even a simple tool like cropping can have an 
impact here. Or you can enhance certain parts of 
the image and diminish the effect of others by 
selectively sharpening or blurring. You can also 
adjust the tones of the image through contrast 
and brightness to create different moods.
The colors and shapes, which are thought of 
as two of the visual elements of an image, have a 
different and subtler impact. Ask yourself which 
colors matter and what the palette or overall color 
scheme communicates. Shifting the colors gen-
erally—or adjusting speciﬁ c areas of color—can 
have a profound effect on the impact by making 
the image softer or harsher, warmer or cooler, 
more or less intense.
And along similar lines, what kinds of feelings 
do the shapes convey? Angles and sharp edges can 
be softened to make images more seductive or, on 
the other hand, can be hardened to give the image 
a blunter effect. Busy images can be simpliﬁ ed 
for more direct impact, as is often the case with 
logos that have to be recognized quickly, whereas 
images that are too simple can be enriched for 
more in-depth viewing, like many book covers.
Composition plays a role here too. Balanced 
images are seen as stable and calming; imbalanced 
ones are dynamic and moving. For example, 
images that are religious in nature tend toward 
the former, whereas those that relate to music 
tend toward the latter. And again, the rule is that 
there is no rule, just your awareness of the effect 
your decisions have. Keep your goal in mind, your 
sense of what you want the viewer to see or feel, 
your objective for the communication.
The question about whether to create our own 
image or use or alter an existing one is a consistent

issue for designers in a world of images. Different 
projects require different solutions, but in general, 
we always want to leave our creative stamp on 
everything we make. Ideally, you can create your 
own images that reﬂ ect your unique skills and tal-
ents, but even when that is not possible, try to 
make each image your own by altering, adjusting, 
manipulating. A poster or page that you design 
should work because all the elements—including 
the image—work together to achieve your goal, 
not simply because it relies on a strong image that 
you found online.
And then there is the relationship of images to 
text to consider. This too is a complex challenge 
with no simple rules. Words tend to provide more 
precise, in-depth meanings while images tend to 
have a broader, more immediate impact. When an 
image is used to support written text, it can serve 
many functions. If it is used to illustrate the content 
of the words (for a magazine article, for example), 
then the question is which part of the text is worth 
illustrating and whether you can create an image 
to achieve that in a compelling way. If the image 
is used to demonstrate an argument made through 
the words (like a chart, for example), then the ques-
tion shifts to whether the image is clear, accurate, 
and precise. Images can also be used to simply sup-
port the general mood or tone created by the words, 
in which case the subtle impact of shape, color, bal-
ance, and hierarchy become more signiﬁ cant.
But of course, in many cases and increasingly, 
the image is the focus of the communication, and 
words are used to support, explain, or expand on 
it. Then the question becomes how to present the 
words in a way that clariﬁ es rather than confuses 
the impact of the image—where to place them, 
how big to make them, how to connect them 
visually to the image.
And one ﬁ nal point about the new world of the 
image: We never see images in isolation anymore 
but almost always in conjunction with other 
images—adjacent, linked, connected, overlap-
ping. So in addition to all the decisions you make 
about individual images for various projects, you 
also have to keep in mind the entire image land-
scape you create, how the parts interact, and what 
the overall effect is.
Plenty to think about and keep in mind now 
that we are just at the beginning of this image 
revolution. New developments, media, and inno-
vations are happening all the time, leading to new 
types of images and new uses for them. All of 
this will require designers who are sensitive to the 
impact of every choice they make regarding each 
image they select or create.
Stay tuned.

matches these elements to create unique greeting 
cards,” says Jonathan Herman. The type plays a 
contributory role to the humorous illustrations’ 
leading roles.
SYMPATHETIC
Type and visuals possess shared or similar quali-
ties and characteristics, and the resulting har-
monious agreement communicates or enhances 
meaning, or type and visuals share apparent 
thematic character and purpose. Congruence 
relies on agreement in shape, form, proportions, 
weights, widths, thin/thick strokes, lines, tex-
tures, positive and negative shapes, and historical 
period. For example, Corey Harris’s name, image, 
and album title are treated similarly in Figure 
5-10. In Figure 5-11, a spread for The New York 
Times Magazine, the Teutonic initials “KL” and 
the photograph of Karl Lagerfeld share qualities, 
black and white color palette, shape relationships, 
and central positioning.
Again, it must be understood that even though 
visual/verbal components share characteristics, 
there is the hierarchic strategy that one compo-
nent—either type or visual—is the star, possessing

A Circular Universe is a newspaper

to support the one doing the heavy lifting, as in the 
poster for the Funk Brothers (see Figure 5-18).
In Mike Perry’s cover for A Circular Universe,
although the imagery corresponds to the let-
terforms in many ways—shape formation, color 
palette, and movement—it takes a subordinate 
role to type as the hero (Figure 5-12). Similarly, 
in all of Luba Lukova’s work, her hand letter-
ing and illustrations share visual characteristics, 
but there is always a clear hierarchy, as in Fig-
ure 5-1.
CONTRAST
Type and visuals possess apparent differences, con-
trasting points of differentiation, contrasting or 
opposing qualities and characteristics that become 
interdependent to produce an effect only when 
present together. There are two basic ways in which 
type and visuals work in contrast: complementary 
relationship or a formal ironic relationship.

Complementary Relationship
Typefaces or hand-drawn type are chosen to 
work in opposition to or in juxtaposition to visuals,
relying on contrasts in shape, form, proportions, 
weights, widths, thin/thick strokes, lines, tex-
tures, positive and negative shapes—for example, 
geometric versus organic, elegant versus rough, 
reﬁ ned versus sloppy, detailed versus loosely ren-
dered (such as a detailed linear illustration con-
trasted with freely-drawn type). In Figure 5-13, 
a public service advertising campaign to promote 
motorcycle safety, the display typeface is juxta-
posed to startling imagery to communicate the 
twist on what we think about riding on the open 
road. In Figure 5-14, a logo for Ground, a land-
scape architecture ﬁ rm, hard-edged, geometric 
type contrasts with the organic plant imagery. 
For the “Day without Art” symbol, by contrast-
ing a brushstroke “X” with the regularity of the 
square representing a picture frame, meaning is 
enhanced (see Figure 5-25). 
In this category, Professor Martin Holloway, 
Kean University, would include a type/visual 
relationship where the type is purposely under-
stated in contrast to a strong visual statement, 
where, perhaps, the visual is the “big idea.” This 
doesn’t mean the type, or text for that matter, is 
given a diminutive role; rather it means the type 
simultaneously contextualizes the image and by 
its understatement bestows celebrity status to the 
image while being noble itself. Mixing styles and 
historical periods can also create opposition.
Formal Ironic Relationship
Typeface and visual are chosen for incongruity, for 
an ironic effect—for example, the typeface chosen 
for Figure 5-15, Catch of the Day, by Scorsone/
Drueding or the irony of choosing a subway map 
typeface to write “Lost,” the twist that it reads 
lost when it should be mapping in Figure 5-16.
VISUALIZATION MODES
In the visual arts, there are theories on modes of 
visualization and their respective meanings. For 
example, French seventeenth-century painter 
Nicolas Poussin utilized ancient Greek musical

modes as the basis for some of his compositions. 
Other visual artists and schools, such as the Bau-
haus, maintained speciﬁ c theories about visu-
alization and meaning. Although many of the 
terms in this section are largely used to describe 
ﬁ ne art, they also can be used to better under-
stand how to make decisions about visualization 
in graphic design, as Professor Donis A. Dondis 
does in the essential book A Primer of Visual Lit-
eracy to explain the dynamics of contrast.

In his seminal work Principles of Art History: The 
Problem of the Development of Style in Later Art,

modes of representation, which help us under-
stand how form and style communicate meaning 
and how they are shaped by culture, time period, 
and context. (In Chapter 6 on composition, we

will examine Wölfﬂ in’s other modes: “plane and 
recession” and “closed and open form.”)
A linear mode is characterized by a predomi-
nant use of lines to describe forms or shapes 
within a composition (see Figures 2-01 and 2-02). 
In graphic design, painterly modes are charac-
terized by the use of color and value to describe 
shapes and forms, relying on visible, broad, or 
sketchy description of form rather than the speci-
ﬁ city of lines. Sarah Smitka uses a linear mode to 
visualize the ﬂ owers in the logo in Figure 5-17, 
and the logotype shares characteristics. The gen-
eral sketchiness of the forms, type, and visuals 
make The Funk Brothers poster “painterly” (Fig-
ure 5-18), and the rendering of Bob Dylan on the 
book cover in Figure 5-19 is painterly in contrast 
to the typography. Both modes can also contrib-
ute to structuring compositions.
Related to this mode are the opposites of unity 
and multiplicity. According to Heinrich Wölfﬂ in, 
in this context, unity means forms that seem to 
merge, where edges are blurred as in a painterly 
style (think Peter Paul Rubens, Diego Velázquez, 
Robert Motherwell). In multiplicity, individual 
shapes or forms maintain a certain amount of 
independence from one another; at times, the 
forms are so distinct that they could easily be cut 
out with scissors.
PROXIMATE VISION VERSUS 
DISTANT VISION
In his “must read” essay “On Point of View in the 
Arts,” in Dehumanization of Art and Other Essays 
on Art, Culture, and Literature philosopher José 
Ortega y Gasset offers “proximate vision” and 
“distant vision” modes, accounting for the differ-
ence in how visual artists describe forms that they 
see. He explains the point of view of the artist 
in relation to the thing seen, with these changes 
reﬂ ecting the culture, religious beliefs, and phi-
losophy of their time periods.
All images are rendered in focus and in detail 
in proximate vision regardless of whether they are 
located near or far in space. There is no evidence 
of the effect of the atmosphere on the thing seen. 
We see every form and shape with clarity and in 
detail no matter how far from us it is. Figure 5-20's 
lush “poster within a poster” sets the stage (reset 

P. 124
Chapter  05
In distant vision, the effect of the atmosphere 
between the artist’s (and viewer’s) vision and the 
thing seen is in evidence. There is one point of 
focus (in any given moment, we can only focus on 
one thing at a time) with surrounding elements 
somewhat obscured. Distant vision is usually 
partnered with a painterly mode.

V ISUALIZING FOR M
Examining basic methods of describing form is 
important for visualization. How you describe 
form affects communication and expression.

PACKAGE DESIGN: CIAO BELLA
• WALLACE CHURCH, NEW YORK
If you’ve ever had gelato in a restaurant, it was probably Ciao Bella. This 
super premium, super indulgent brand was originally marketed only to the 
food service trade. Launching Ciao Bella at retail demanded that the brand 
establish a distinct personality. This young company, however, had severe 
budget restrictions that made photography impossible. Wallace Church’s 
dynamic graphics solved the problem, immediately distinguishing the brand 
as very different from everything else in the freezer case. The simple icons 
change to differentiate gelatos and sorbettos; the bold colors change to 
highlight the exotic fl avors. As a result of this new design effort, the Ciao 
Bella brand has established a stronghold with consumers at retail.

prox imate vision, hyperrealism, photorealism, 
closed compositions, and limited type alignment. 
Blurred forms and boundaries, transparencies, 
muted color palettes, layering, open compositions 
(think Helen Frankenthaler), and painterliness 
characterize diffusion.
ACCURACY VERSUS 
DISTORTION
Viewers believe an object or subject to be accurately
depicted when it conforms with what they know 
or to common knowledge of that form. When 
an object or subject is twisted, stretched, bent, 
warped, buckled, or signiﬁ cantly altered from its 
normal appearance, it is distorted. Pixilation of 
the image of Chrissie Hynde and the type in the 
poster promoting a concert by The Pretenders 
distorts them for creative purpose (Figure 5-21).
ECONOMY VERSUS INTRICACY
Economy refers to stripping down visuals to fun-
damental forms, using as little description and 
as few details as possible for denotation. For the 
Ciao Bella package design, Wallace Church used 
simple icons that change to differentiate gela-
tos and sorbettos, with bold colors changing to 
highlight the exotic ﬂ avors (Figure 5-22). Intri-
cacy is based on complexity, on the use of many 
component parts and/or details to describe and 
visually communicate.
SUBTLE VERSUS BOLD 
Using a subtle visualizing treatment is about 
restraint. Subtlety can be created through low con-
trast, muted color palettes or tints, static composi-
tions, transparencies, layering, limiting typefaces 
and alignment, distant vision, and atmospheric 
perspective. Boldness can be conveyed with big, 
brassy, aggressive movements and compositions, 
saturated color palettes, thick lines, high con-
trast, cropping, or images that are near (see Figure 
7-06). Related to this is understatement versus exag-
geration. An understated depiction is less dramatic, 
subtle, and restrained, whereas an exaggerated 
visual uses visual hyperbole and might be bigger, 
grander, more prominent, more dramatic, embel-
lished, or ampliﬁ ed.

OPAQUE VERSUS 
TRANSPARENT 
Opaque elements are dense, seemingly solid, 
and not see-through. Elements, type, and visu-
als can be transparent, which means see-through 
from one image to another, from one letterform 
to another, or from one texture to another, as in 
the free-form shapes constituting the visuals in 
Figure 5-24. Seeing through could imply space to 
various degrees of graphic depth. Digital transpar-
ency involves altering the opacity of any graphic 
element or image in print or motion. The con-
trast of an element is lowered so that it appears 
transparent in relation to its original opaque 
form. Visualization can rely on a juxtaposition of 
transparent and opaque components.
Patterns often employ graphic transparency
where layers of lines, shapes, textures, forms, 
letterforms, or ﬁ elds or bands of color overlap. 
Related to graphic transparency, linear transpar-
ency refers to transparent layering of linear forms 
or lines or outline type.
HARD-EDGE VERSUS 
BRUSHY
In ﬁ ne art painting, hard-edge visualization is 
almost diametrically opposed to those works in a 
brushy, painterly style. For the unique “Day with-
out Art” symbol, by contrasting a brushstroke “X” 
with the hard-edge delineation of the square rep-
resenting a picture frame, meaning is enhanced

an opening of several minutes set in Manhattan, in 
crowded noisy restaurants, smoky nightclubs, glamor-
ous penthouses. But then we cut to the shot of him 
and Nelle, just off a dusty red train, deposited on the 
platform in Holcomb, Kansas.
“The train ﬁ lls the shot, top to bottom, side to side. At 
the start of the shot, a conductor signals the driver that 
the passengers from New York—Truman and Nelle—
are off. The train slowly pulls out and, in so doing, 
appears to wipe the screen clean: as it leaves to the left of 
screen, to the right it begins to reveal the vast emptiness 
of the Kansas plains, until ﬁ nally there is nothing in 
the shot but the high sky, the endless horizon, the empty 
ﬁ elds, and the two New Yorkers, one of whom has his 
very pretty luggage stacked high beside him.
“It is a quiet shot. There is some music, but gently 
played, so that the audience is aware of how noise-
less the new world is. I held the shot for a long time, 
without moving the camera, to let the audience feel 
the change in mood. Up till then everything had been 
merry and bustling, bursting and jolly. It also allows 
the audience to notice how Truman was dressed which, 
without getting into it too much, was not typical for 
the Kansas man of 1959. By keeping it as a single shot, 
without close-ups, and letting it sit there for a minute, 
I allow the audience to discover all the things it needs to 
on its own, which is always more ﬂ attering and pleas-
ing to the viewer because it says that you trust them—
and you trust the image, with all its information.”
—Doug McGrath, Writer/Director
A FINAL WORD ON 
VISUALIZATION: 
STORYTELLING
How can an image tell a story? How can combin-
ing text and image tell a story more fully?
Every image tells a story through its subject, 
visualization, and composition. And every aspect 
of that image—color, light and shadow, details, 
angle/point of view, value contrast—all contrib-
ute to the nature of the story: what you leave in 
an image, what you edit out—how you frame it, 
whether you crop it, and so on.
A still image is an artiﬁ cial construct; it is a delib-
erately constructed visual held in time for us to con-
template, to help inform us, to help us make sense 
of the world. Motion—moving images whether 
created by a ﬁ lmmaker or motion designer—are 
also artiﬁ cial constructs that are deliberate and 
deliberated. All tell stories—the story the visual 
artist, director, or writer intends—and the story 
the viewer gleans from it and brings to it.
If you doubt that a single image can convey 
meaning, then look at the work of great photog-
raphers, illustrators, and painters. If you look at 
stills from great ﬁ lmmakers, you will also see how 
each shot tells a story on its own, yet contributes 
to the greater story. Doug McGrath, a writer and 
director, shares this story about his work:
“In my ﬁ lm INFAMOUS, which was about the 
making and undoing of Truman Capote, a key scene 
is his arrival in Kansas. He has come with his child-
hood friend, Nelle Harper Lee, who lived, as he did, 
in New York City. Capote lives his life in that city 
in a glittering way: nightclubs, private clubs, events 
that were often underwritten by his friends whom he 
chose carefully from the famous and wealthy. He him-
self was not yet famous to a wider public; he was only 
known among the rariﬁ ed social circles in Manhat-
tan and to a slightly wider literary audience. But it 
was not his way to tiptoe in to someplace new on little 
cat’s paws. He always announced himself.
“I wanted to cover his arrival in one shot: not sev-
eral angles, just one, and with no dialogue because 
in this case, I felt the image would say more than 
words would. I preceded his arrival in Kansas with

“HUSH presented several different design concepts

PURPOSE OF COMPOSITION
To create clear and interesting solutions, you need to develop keen compositional skills. You 
must understand the content well enough to structure it. Intelligibility of communication 
depends upon logic—upon how you visually order information in terms of its importance 
to the message. And interesting form depends upon a good concept in concert with ﬁ nely 
honed visualization and compositional skills.
WHAT IS COMPOSITION?
A layout is the visual organization of type and visuals on a printed or digital page; it is also 
called spatial arrangement. A layout is about how all the parts of your design work together. 
Like layout, one could simply say that a composition is a group of organized component parts 
WHEN
YOU LOOK AT A POSTER, YOU MOST LIKELY ASK 
YOURSELF: “DO I FIND THIS INTERESTING?” AND “DO I GET IT?” “IS THE 
MESSAGE CLEAR?” THAT’S EXACTLY HOW ANY OBSERVER WOULD RESPOND. 
SINCE THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF GRAPHIC DESIGN IS TO COMMUNICATE 
INFORMATION OR A MESSAGE TO AN AUDIENCE, CREATING INTEREST AND 
CLARITY ARE TWO MAIN GOALS. FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF APPLICATIONS AND 
CATEGORIES OF GRAPHIC DESIGN SUCH AS INFORMATION DESIGN (THINK 
CHOKING POSTER OR SUBWAY MAP), CLARITY IS ESSENTIAL AND PERHAPS 
ENOUGH. FOR OTHER CATEGORIES OF DESIGN WITH GREATER PROMOTIONAL 
INTENT (THINK WEB BANNER OR BOOK COVER), CATCHING PEOPLE’S 
ATTENTION IS CRITICAL SINCE SOMEONE HAS TO BE ATTRACTED ENOUGH BY 
THE DESIGN’S FORM TO TAKE THE TROUBLE TO INTERPRET THE MESSAGE. 
ALTHOUGH A FORMULAIC SOLUTION MIGHT BE CLEAR, IF IT’S BORING, NO 
ONE IS GOING TO BOTHER TO SPEND TIME WITH IT. OFTEN, VIEWERS WILL 
SPEND MORE TIME TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF A MESSAGE IF THE FORM OF 
IT INTERESTS THEM. THE HIGHER THE DEGREE OF INTEREST YOU CREATE, 
THE MORE SATISFACTION THE VIEWER WILL FIND IN THE SOLUTION. ONCE 
YOU OBTAIN SOMEONE’S INTEREST, THE MESSAGE SHOULD BE CLEAR. IF 
SOMEONE LOOKS AT A DESIGN AND THINKS “I DON’T UNDERSTAND THIS,” 
THEN THE SOLUTION IS INEFFECTIVE.

are tactics/tools that I think we all use to further our 
communication . . . but how to choose what to use? 
That is, type-driven or graphics-driven? Emphasize 
what, subordinate what? In other words, how to go 
about thinking about solving a problem in order to 
choose a methodology?
Point of View: Design is the visual organization 
of a communication; graphic designers are com-
municators . . . promulgating a point of view. As 
designers we need to start with the question “What 
are we trying to say?” Once that question is sur-
rounded, we then need to take a stand—a point 
of view—that is, “A” is the main thrust and most 
important idea to be communicated, the rest of the 
alphabet becomes subordinate. From that point all 
other questions and methodology are answered by 
this question: Does it add to or detract from driving 
the point home?
Choice of concept, typeface, photography or illus-
tration or graphics, color versus B&W, symmetrical 
versus asymmetrical composition . . . ALL choices are 
now determined by what makes the strongest, most 
compelling communication. Taking a point of view 
affords a place to start, an anchor point that enables 
and empowers the process.
Design Architectonics: Architectonics is a fancy 
word for building the composition by imposing 
an abstract, underlying structure that holds it all 
together, emphasizes the point, de-emphasizes sec-
ondary issues. I think of composition like a build-
ing . . . if parts don’t align, lack foundation, are not 
physically attached with a tension that is visually 
palpable . . . the whole thing topples and falls apart. 
Conversely, if elements relate, are attached, bal-
anced and aligned . . . the composition holds together 
and makes a strong statement—visually as well
as conceptually.
Regardless of the composition structure designed . . . 
the concept of architectonics (that is, alignment, visual 
space vs. mass, physical/visual relationships of the ele-
ments to create a strong underlying structure) is the 
underpinning of all successful design compositions.
The informed use of these two maxims is often the 
difference between a great idea going down the tubes 
through bad execution, or even a so-so idea that is 
made powerful and compelling.

or graphic elements, but it is much more. Com-
position is the form, the whole spatial property and
structure resulting from the intentional visualiza-
tion and arrangement of graphic elements—type 
and visuals—in relation to one another and to 
the format, meant to visually communicate, to be 
compelling and expressive. The designer’s vocab-
ulary of formal elements (line, shape, color, value, 
and texture) and skill set of basic principles (bal-
ance, emphasis, unity, and proportion) and more
(which we will explore shortly) are all employed 
when composing.
Just like any human behavior, the entire process 
of conceptualizing, visualizing, and composing is 
complex, nonlinear, and largely unpredictable. 
For this reason, most designers use spontaneous 
composition as the primary methodology when 
designing single or static applications that do not 
require a grid structure, such as posters or web 
banners. (When designing multipage applica-
tions, such as magazines or newspapers, most 
designers employ and need grids as compositional 
guides.) A compelling and clear solution, whether 
working spontaneously or composing with a 
structural device such as a grid, requires itera-
tions. Since designing is nonlinear (for most of 
us, anyway) and composing is an iterative process, 
in order to create clear, interesting communica-
tion, rethinking and revising is part of the organic 
process that is composing.
MEANS
How do you begin to compose your design con-
cept? For beginners, ﬁ guring out how to compose 
can seem daunting since there are innumerable 
options and decisions to be made. Also, part of what 
might be overwhelming for many is that compos-
ing requires a willingness to experiment and work 
through problems. When I asked Ed Sobel his 
thoughts about composition, he responded with 
two extremely helpful axioms, point of view and 
design architectonics, to initiate our discussion of 
compositional means.
[T]he only thing I can think of adding is the per-
sonal problem-solving techniques I employ before I 
begin to layout/design. Once in the actual process of 
design, all those issues you mention in this chapter

visuals as secondary, as in Figure 6-01, or there 
are no visuals at all. Type can be the only compo-
nent; also called type as image.
› Image-driven: emphasis on visual/de-emphasis 
on type, where the visual is the “hero” with little 
type, as in Figure 6-02, or a no-copy solution. 
Related to an image-driven compositional mode 
is a theme-driven one—visualizing and compos-
ing based on a visual theme. Although a thematic 
approach is used for concept development, it can 
also be employed during visualization with a dis-
tinct pictorial, abstract, or nonrepresentational 
topic-based visual dominating the composition. 
For example, if your concept for an MP3 player 
has to do with the beneﬁ t of authentic sound, 
then sound could be the thematic basis for a pic-
torial, abstract, or nonobjective visual theme.
› Visual-verbal synergy: a synergistic relationship 
between title (or headline) and the main visual, 
around which all other graphic elements are sub-
ordinate; this is a fundamental means for book 
jacket design, as in Figure 6-03, and advertising.

THREE A’S: ACTION, 
ARR ANGEMENT, AND 
ARTICULATION
Composing is an extremely demanding, com-
plex process. With empirical experience, com-
positional skills develop as you employ the basic 
principles more fully and deeply. More and more, 
design principles will become second nature; you 
will be able to rely more on intuition, enabling 
you to design with greater nuance. To help with 
this illusive process and to best explain com-
position and best practice, let’s start with three 
tenets—action, arrangement, and articulation—
the three A’s. These tenets build upon the basic 
design principles discussed in Chapter 2.
usually happen at the same time as creating/
producing. This editing process isn’t the same as 
the task of a copy editor going over a manuscript 
for correct usage or pith—this means you are 
rethinking, revising as you work, which is part of 
the organic process of composing.
Spontaneous formative methods for composing 
(and visualization) include but are certainly not 
limited to:
› Spontaneous/improvisational/experimental com-
posing: mostly unplanned visualization and struc-
turing, with the design concept as driver. In the pro-
cess of creating, shaping, moving, experimenting, 
and “playing” with graphic elements while relying 
on the principles of composition and a designer’s 
intuition and insights into the creative process, 
you form a composition. This type of compos-
ing does not utilize formal structural devices or 
systems; however, it does rely on creative think-
ing partnered with critical thinking, creative 
impulses, inclinations, and intuition that result 
from a working knowledge of design principles 
and zealous experimentation. Many designers 
use creativity exercises to start the process, such 
as problem ﬁ nding, free drawing, unconventional 
methods, or any of the creativity exercises in this 
book. The best way is to start sketching, to think 
with a pencil or marker in your hand. Making
enhances thinking.
If spontaneous composing is too open-ended 
as a starting point, you can try using one of the 
following creative directives, which are essentially 
ways to visualize a concept:
› Formally driven creative directives: contrast; 
illusion of three-dimensional space, movement, 
or sound; exaggerated scale; exaggeration; near 
and far; image manipulation; synthesis; visual 
merge; unexpected juxtapositions; and abstrac-
tion, among others.
› Media-driven creative directives: collage; photo-
grams; photomontage; experimental materials; 
mixed media; painting; sculpture; 3D illustra-
tions; photography; sewing/stitching; weavings; 
rubbings/blottings; monotypes, and printmak-
ing, among many others.
› Style-driven creative directives: primitivism; 
techno; homemade; ﬂ at color; period/vintage, and 
historical references/homage, among many others.

ACTION THROUGH DYNAMICS: 
CONTRAST 
Bob Aufuldish, Aufuldish & Warinner, tells his 
students, “Contrast is your friend.” We compre-
hend “concave” juxtaposed to “convex.” “Straight” 
looks straighter compared to “crooked.” In music, 
we understand “loud” in relation to “soft.”
There are two overarching purposes for differ-
entiating visual elements:
› To create visual variety and interest, and
› To enhance the uniqueness of dissimilar ele-
ments through contrast/comparison.
A viewer can see how and if visual elements are 
alike and how they are different as well as how 
they relate to one another, how they integrate to 
equal a new whole.
In order to show differences between elements 
or components in a design, you must establish a 
difference between two or among several. You 
must make distinctions. For example, when mix-
ing typefaces, many designers select for weight 
contrast or by contrasting a serif with a sans serif 
so that people can distinguish them; after all, 
you’re using more than one typeface so that your 
composition will have visual variety. Through 
variation and contrast, we get dynamics.
Johannes Itten, artist, professor, author, and 
color and design theoretician, held to a theory of 
structural compositional oppositions, which he 
referred to as “polar contrasts”:
› big/small
› long/short
› straight/curved
› pointed/blunt
› much/little
› light/heavy
› hard/soft
Itten’s polar contrasts certainly could establish 
visual drama. Contrasts also enable the viewer to 
better understand each graphic element through 
comparison (see Figure 6-05). We understand big 
in relation to small. We understand bright colors 
compared to dull colors. We understand a rough 
texture in contrast to smooth, and so on. Imagine 
if an actor delivered all his or her lines in a mono-
tone voice—without any variation; that would be 
like a design without contrast.
When you compose, in addition to employing 
all the design principles, it is very helpful to be 
aware of these additional precepts. All of these 
involve concurrent rational decisions and intui-
tive impulses.
ACTION
Action involves the visual energy of a surface. 
Any blank surface, whether print or screen-based, 
has potential energy—it is a potentially active 
ﬁ eld. If you are conscious of the interplay among 
the graphic elements, considering each space, 
shape, and interval, creating visual tension (inter-
esting shape relationships and interstices, a taut-
ness), then all graphic elements will seem to have 
connective tissue (think ligaments). Figure 6-04 
illustrates this well. The designer’s aim for the 
Support and Resist cover was to create “tense type 
compositions.” Each typographic or visual com-
ponent should relate to the other in a way that 
creates harmony, rhythm, and consensus.

ACTION THROUGH CONTRAST: 
COUNTERPOINT 
Since we deal with balance in our lives, achieving 
formulaic types of balance (symmetry, approxi-
mate symmetry) in a composition usually comes 
more naturally to beginners than all the other 
principles; however, balancing opposing forces
through complex asymmetry is another matter. 
(This is the most difﬁ cult aspect of establishing 
contrast.) Two issues come strongly into play—
visual weight plus the notion of weight and coun-
terweight (counterpoint).
In asymmetric compositions where comple-
mentary graphic elements are positioned in coun-
terpoint, visual weight deliberations are strategic, 
not formulaic (see Figure 6-06). To understand 
counterpoint, think of every visual weight you 
position in a composition requiring a contrast-
ing counterbalancing force strategically placed in 
the composition. In music, the most rudimentary
way to think of counterpoint is “note against 
note.” In design, counterpoint is the use of con-
trast or the interplay of elements in a work simul-
taneously providing unity and variety, any graphic 
element contrasting with yet complementing 
another. (See Chapter 2 for more information on 
vis ual weight.)

Try this little experiment. If you cover one 
of the oval portraits on the upper left side of 
the poster design in Figure 6-08, the right side 
becomes heavier. Each element in this poster 
design is dependent upon the other; each element 
was thoughtfully positioned. Similarly, using the 
spread in Figure 6-09, from a new edition of 
Aesop’s Fables designed by Milton Glaser, cover 
the graphic element (artwork) in the lower right 
corner. You’ll notice that the layout is no longer 
balanced. This demonstrates just how important 
the arrangement of every element is to a success-
ful layout. (See sidebar on Balancing Forces.)

BALANCING
BALANCING  FORCES
Every graphic element positioned on a page 
contributes to a potentially balanced action, 
similar to how opposing physical movements 
operate in sports, martial arts, dance, and yoga. 
You can think of these complementary balanc-
ing forces as simultaneous actions building 
strength, stability, and harmony:
• In and Out. Pulling forces inward, toward 
the vertical midline of the page, and forces 
expanding outward, toward the edges of the 
page (see Figure 6-07).
• Afferent/Efferent. Inward contraction from 
the outer edges to the core, moving from the 
edges to the focal point (the heart of your 
composition) and then back from focal point 
to the boundaries. (Not to be confused with 
actual radial composition where the composi-
tion radiates outward from a central point.)
• Up and Down. Grounding (rooting) down while 
lifting up.

Action: Relate to the Edges 
of the Format
All visual elements must relate to (though not 
necessarily actually touch) the edges of the page. 
Not merely the end of the space, a page’s bound-
aries fully participate in the compositional struc-
ture, as do the typography and graphic elements 
in Figure 6-11, where the numbers and arrows 
relate to the edges of the cover.

have intervals of stillness and movement. In print 
and any static digital page motion is an illusion

direction. Keep all graphic elements in play (just as 
each action in a video game affects future actions as 
well as the actions of other players).
ARRANGEMENT: ADJUSTMENTS
In Chapter 2, we examined how alignment con-
tributes to unity. That bears further discussion. In a 
composition, every graphic element is positioned in 
graphic space. You determine those positions and 
their resulting alignments with other visual compo-
nents either through purely optical means (by eye) 
or with the aid of a grid or some other structur-
ing device (still requiring some optical judgments). 
All type is aligned. Visuals are aligned. Type and 
visuals are aligned. Congruity of alignment enhances 
unity and creates clarity. Designers who compose 
optically/spontaneously seek inherent ways to align 
type and visuals, by ﬁ nding movements within the 
graphic elements that can be paralleled or echoed, 
prospecting for occasions of sympathetic relation-
ships among the forms where alignments could 
occur and be capitalized on. Other than the several 
basic alignments—ﬂ ush left, ﬂ ush right, centered,

acute shifts in scale, extreme value contrasts, and 
more. In Figure 6-12, motion is implied in the

– Center alignment on vertical or horizontal

ARRANGEMENT: ENTRY POINT, 
FLOW, AND EYE DIRECTION
In all two-dimensional design compositions—
graphic design, painting, drawing, etching, or 
print advertisement—the viewer seeks a point 
of entry into the compositional space. This entry 
point can be the focal point (the largest or bright-
est or key positioned element, component with 
the greatest visual weight, etc.); it can be a path 
created by white space or any number of other 
kinds of entry points. You must structure space 
to facilitate the viewer’s comprehension (visual 
reading) of the composition, his or her passage 
through the compositional space. In Figure 6-19, 
we enter the composition along the tilted ﬂ oor 
plane, along the book’s title and author’s name. 
As we enter, we realize we are about to be crushed 
by a huge shoed foot.
Eye tracking studies (a method used to deter-
mine how people’s eyes move, scan, and rest on a 
page) reveal how visitors observe print, web ban-
ners, and websites. Besides the composition, there 
are many variables involved with how an indi-
vidual views and scans a single surface, including 
associative meaning, time exposed to the design, 
personal attention span, and distractions, among

hierarchy, or a dominant image (people tend 
to prefer visuals over copy). In addition to the 
point of entry, transitions are the key to creating 
a smooth visual ﬂ ow from one graphic element 
to another throughout the composition. A tran-
sition is the passage or progression connecting 
one graphic element or movement to another in

on semantically important regions of the image.1

a less preferred reading position); also called the 
primary optical area.
› Viewers tend to be drawn to the ﬁ gure as 
opposed to the ground.
› Unity and balance contribute to visual ﬂ ow.
› Repetition, parallel movements, and counter-
pointing movements contribute to guiding the 
viewer.
You will also need to apply agreement in spe-
cial situations:
› Agreement throughout a website: A clear sense of 
place or geography created by consistent position 
of menus will help guide the viewer (Figure 6-22).
› Agreement across a spread: Determine the most 
advantageous way to bridge the gap of the gutter
(the blank space formed by the inner margins of 
two facing pages in a publication).
› Agreement in a series: When designing for a 
series of individual but related units (for example, 
a series of brochures; a book series; a series of 
covers; related package designs), establish param-
eters to deﬁ ne a typographic system (palette and 
usage) along with a common visualization lan-
guage, compositional structure, and color palette 
a design; often, the transition is negative space or 
a subordinate element (see Figure 6-20). (Read 
more about transitions under “Articulation” later 
in this chapter.)
You can help the viewer navigate through a 
composition with a principle called continuity 
or agreement. Continuity—one element direct-
ing your eyes to the next—helps guide the viewer 
through a composition (see Figure 6-21). Think 
of agreement as design’s equivalent to the body’s 
circulation system.
Keep in mind these factors relating to 
agreement:
› Position and orientation of the elements can 
promote or inhibit visual ﬂ ow.
› An unambiguous visual hierarchy with an 
apparent focal point will provide a point of entry; 
for example, a dominant title or headline or a 
dominant visual provides a point of entry.
› All directions must be considered: right, left, 
up, down.
› A theory holds that the top left of a page of any 
single surface is a preferred reading position, a 
point of entry (with the bottom of the page as

websites, and editorial websites, some designers 
rely on the Gutenberg Rule to help guide the 
viewer. This theory posits that readers follow a 
“Z” pattern of scanning a page, starting with the 
upper left-hand corner, followed by the middle, 
and then to bottom right. Newspaper designer 
and educator Edmund Arnold is credited with 
this theory, also known as the Gutenberg Dia-
gram and the Z pattern of processing.
ARRANGEMENT: MANIPULATING 
GRAPHIC SPACE
There are as many ways to compose as there are 
ideas. That statement, although exciting, is not 
much help to a beginner; for that reason, here are 
some basic sets of compositional approaches to 
create graphic space. Please note that these sets of 
comparative compositional modes are not qualita-
tive, they are different; each can be appropriate 
for particular goals.
to ensure continuity across the individual units as 
well as to ensure that viewers see the individual 
units as belonging to a series. (See Figure 8-04, 
Futuro Passato Series.) A designer also plans for 
some variation among the individual units within 
the series for purposes of identiﬁ cation of each as 
a unique unit and to create differentiation within 
the series (think differentiation of caffeinated and 
decaffeinated beverages through color palette) 
and visual interest (Fig ure 6-23).
Mostly, discrepancies interrupt visual ﬂ ow 
(think road barrier). However, a discrepancy 
could also establish an anomaly (functioning 
as an interesting focal point), which might be 
desirable depending upon your intention. Any 
movement that pulls the viewer’s eye from the 
preferred path or from important information is 
counterproductive; that is disagreement.

Flat versus Illusion of Depth
Any two-dimensional surface is ﬂ at. A designer 
can compose graphic space preserving the page’s 
inherent ﬂ atness, resulting in a ﬂ at-appearing 
composition, or create the illusion of depth. Cer-
tain manipulations of elements contribute to ﬂ at-
ness; others contribute to the illusion of depth. For 
example, vertical and horizontal movements tend 
to give the impression of a ﬂ at surface (though 
can certainly be manipulated to create the illu-
sion of shallow depth). Alternatively, one diago-
nal line can evoke the illusion of depth. Equivocal 
or ambiguous ﬁ gure/ground relationships tend to 
appear ﬂ at, whereas overlapping shapes lend to 
creating the illusion of depth.
Gradation and Illusion
A gradual or progressive change from one color 
to another or a progressive arrangement of an ele-
ment according to size or characteristic can con-
tribute to the illusion of depth or motion.
Regular versus Irregular 
(Classical versus Baroque)
This set concerns “regular” planar recessional 
graphic space versus “irregular” recessional graphic 
space. (The term planar comes from the word plane
and suggests that the main elements of a composi-
tion are arranged in planes parallel to the picture 
plane. As explained in Chapter 2, a plane is a ﬂ at 
surface and the picture plane is the front plane of a 
print or digital single surface.) In “regular” or “Clas-
sical” (Classical here refers to the Italian Renais-
sance; think Raphael and Leonardo) compositions, 
none of the major elements penetrate the picture 
plane; nor do any move in front of the picture plane 
at an angle. Basically, this is a “picture window” 
arrangement, where, like a window pane, all that 
we see moves behind the front plane and does not 
penetrate the picture plane (Fig ure 6-24).
In contrast, in an “irregular” or Baroque (think 
Flemish Baroque/Peter Paul Rubens or a comic 
book superhero’s ﬁ st punching in front of the pic-
ture plane) or recessional graphic space, diagonal 
elements and planes move in front of as well as 
behind the picture plane, creating the illusion of 
great depth and action, suggesting an aggressive 
spatial property (Figure 6-25).

for example, an extended landscape-shaped rect-
angle (elongated poster, outdoor board, banner) 
requires different considerations than a more con-
ventional rectangular format (standard magazine, 
book page size ratio).
This set also can be thought of as “parallels ver-
sus counterpoints,” where movements parallel or 
echo the format’s edges or are positioned in coun-
terpoint to the edges. Generally, compositions 
with dominating parallel movements are deemed 
more consonant and counterpointing ones more 
active and potentially dissonant. This applies to 
print, digital, and motion graphics.
Shallow versus Deep
This set refers to how planes and/or forms func-
tion in graphic space.
› Overlapping: When an opaque ﬂ at plane or 
form is placed in front of another, that overlap 
creates the illusion of depth. Successive overlaps 
create the illusion of a recessive space, which 
can be manipulated to appear shallow or deep. 
When a transparent ﬂ at plane is placed in front 
of another, an ambiguous space is created, which 
could seem shallow.
Overlapping can function for various stylistic 
and visualization appearances; for example, over-
lapping functions well in collage, where elements 
are cut and pasted over others and can overlap. 
Collage is a technique invented and ﬁ rst utilized 
by the Cubists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. 
(You can use software to simulate collage.)
To denote associations, overlaps function to 
display a familial relationship among related infor-
mation or visuals. Overlapping can aid emphasis, 
utilized with such structures as nest structures and 
stair structures. It can also create fractured space,
as in the Cubist style of ﬁ ne art, where multiple 
viewpoints are seen simultaneously.
› Layering: By overlapping parts of an image 
simultaneously or in a sequence, the illusion of 
shallow space is created. Layers can be opaque 
or transparent; aligned or purposely misaligned; 
typographic layers in any design application; lay-
ers of information on maps or layers of data on 
charts; layers of images in motion graphics; sub-
titles on ﬁ lm and in motion graphics; layers can 
imitate actual textures found in environments 
This set is akin to “shallow versus deep” space 
and to the illusion of atmospheric perspective. 
Some designers also think of this set as static versus 
active composition. In static compositions, verti-
cal and horizontal movements are emphasized. 
In active compositions, diagonal or curved move-
ments—directions that contradict the edges of the 
format—are emphasized. For example, in Figure 
6-26 the angles of the guitar, edges of the boom 
box, and ﬁ gure’s gesture all move at angles to the 
format. However, this can be qualiﬁ ed since you 
can create activity by how you manipulate vertical 
and horizontal lines or movements, through prox-
imity, length, and groupings. Also, another vari-
able to consider is the shape of the single surface;

› Diagonals/tilted plane: A shallow or deep illu-
sion of depth is created by planes composed of 
diagonals or by elements that oppose the edges 
of the format. A recessional space created by a 
titled plane moving back in perspective can create 
a heightened illusion of three-dimensional space. 
(think peeling layers of outdoor boards or layers 
of scrapbook elements on pages). Layering con-
veys movement, thought, and the passage of time.

Layering conveys movement,

When interviewed by Sean Adams 
for Step Inside Design magazine, 
Jeremy Mende said:
Good work, whatever the medium, 
is driven partly from an authentic 
idea and partly from a unique way 
of expressing it. [A concept] has to 
result from something more than just 
the idea or the expressive method. 
Otherwise the result is at best clever 
but never really satisfying. This notion 
of a personalized and whole gesture—
one that can’t be broken down into 
“parts”—is what I fi nd compelling. In 
this sense, the concept is really how 
idea and expression are fused.

› Atmospheric perspective: This illusion simulates 
the effect the atmosphere has on color, shape, 
form, texture, and detail seen from a distance; also 
called aerial perspective.
Closed versus Open
The terms closed and open refer to the way the ele-
ments of a composition relate to the edges of a 
page, to the format. Basically, if the internal ele-
ments echo a page’s edges to a great extent and
the viewer’s focus is kept tightly within the for-
mat, that composition is considered closed. If the 
major movements within the composition oppose 
the edges (think diagonals) or direct our eyes past 
the boundaries of the format, that composition 
is considered open. Traditionally, regular compo-
sitions tend to be closed, and irregular composi-
tions tend to be open.
Dominant versus Multiple 
You can build a composition around one domi-
nant visual (using size, shape, color, or value 
contrast), where all other graphic elements form 
relationships with that dominant visual. A domi-
nant composition can be based on one major 
movement, gesture, or compositional thrust, with 
all other movements as minor ones built in rela-
tion to it through optical decisions and adjustments.
Or, you can build a composition where there is 
no one overtly dominant visual; here relationships 
are built through sequence, pattern, grid, modular

GOLDEN GRAIN/MISSION PASTA
• WALLACE CHURCH, NEW YORK
Design Problem: Merging two regional brands into one cohesive 
national brand is a true challenge. The American Italian Pasta Company 
set out to do just that when it acquired the Golden Grain and Mission 
pasta brands. Wallace Church’s design strategy sought to synthesize 
prior brand recognition equities within a new, compelling, all-American 
image. This new brand identity architecture had to be leveraged across 
more than a dozen different product forms and package confi gurations, 
visually unifying the new national brand on shelf.
Main Communications Objective: In its new design for Golden Grain 
Mission, Wallace Church sought to convey a wholesome, all-American 
image. A dynamic new logo is set against the “amber waves of grain” 
of an American wheat fi eld. The design’s rich colors convey the brand’s 
quality and wholesome goodness, while greatly enhancing the brand’s 
appetite appeal.

structure, repetition, stair structures, axis align-
ment, edge alignment, positioning and ﬂ ow, or 
some unifying principle. No element dominates. 
In a multiple composition, all movements have 
equal or close to equal force (Figure 6-29).
This structuring concept applies to single sur-
faces, multiple surfaces, and motion graphics. 
(Static versus sequence is related to dominant 
versus multiple.)
Singularity versus Juxtaposition
Whether you look at any religious icon single 
image, for example, any saint depicted during the 
Middle Ages, or at a contemporary poster using 
a single visual (Figure 6-30), you can see how a 
singular image can be employed to communicate 
a message or to symbolize or represent an idea. 
You can also juxtapose images to suggest a link or 
emphasize the contrast between them.
Static versus Movement
A static composition represents a ﬁ xed position; 
it neither moves nor implies motion. The illu-
sion of movement can be created by a variety of 
means, for example, focusing on action-oriented 
arrangements, that is, receding diagonals (Figure 
6-31); a ﬁ gurative image that relates to our sense

In my opinion, an idea is the soul of a poster and a good concept is the fruit of an analytical 
as well as intuitive process. My poster images not only come from my inspiration, but from my 
beliefs and experiences as well.
The “Victory” poster was fi rst designed in 1997 and completed in 1998. The hand is intended 
to symbolize all of humankind. I felt the capitalized “V” represented by the two fi ngers is a 
universal symbol for victory and understood by viewers of all races and cultures. According to 
Chinese folklore, the lines in human hands are not only records of the past but also foretell the 
future. In my image I wanted the palm lines in the hand to show that human beings in general, 
no matter in the past or in the future, often go through numerous struggles and endure countless 
pains and sufferings in order to survive and ultimately triumph. The fact that three fi ngers are 
missing from the hand was intended to extend the feeling of victimizing in the image while, at the 
same time, adding to the poster’s theatrical effect.
In order to convey the meaning of this image in the strongest possible way I chose the black and 
white color, which is based on the traditional Chinese philosophical idea of Yin and Yang. That was 
relevant because, in a broad sense, Yin and Yang can also be used to represent dialectic concepts 
such as brightness and darkness, hopefulness and hopelessness or victor and victim.
I gave an X-ray effect to the hand not only because it was dramatic, but also because it set the 
right tone for the viewers as to the profound inner meanings of the image.

can visualize a sequence. Or when a reader turns 
a page, that kinetic experience can be utilized to 
represent a sequence of events over a short period 
of time. Certainly, motion graphics and ﬁ lm are 
natural media for depicting sequence. Note how 
time is implied in Figure 6-32.
Sequential versus Randomness
Arrangements can seem ordered or random. 
Sequential arrangements have a discernible spe-
ciﬁ c order or form a particular sequence. Also, one 
element or frame can seem to be the consequence 
or result of the previous.
The quality of randomness in composition 
stems from an intentional organization where 
elements belong yet no discernable pattern, uni-
formity, or regularity is readily apparent.
Sequential elements can also denote the illusion 
of motion through visual multiplication. Multi-
ple positions (think a comic book rendering of a 
dog with many legs to denote running), blurred 
boundaries or edges, repetition, shift, and layers 
contribute to the illusion of motion (see Figure 
6-12 for an example of multiple positions).
Near versus Far
A designer must consider point of view, that is, 
the viewer’s position in relation to what he or she 
is looking at and from which angle. When ele-
ments or visuals are very large in relation to the 
size of the format, they appear to be physically 
closer to the viewer. Cropping also brings the 
viewer closer to the visual, so close that he or she 
cannot see the entire image. When elements are 
small in scale in relation to the size of the format, 
they seem to be farther away from the viewer. 
These two compositional approaches relate to 
human perception, to how we perceive objects in 
an environment. (This can be related to the visu-
alization mode of “proximate vision versus distant 
vision.” See Chapter 5, Visualization.)
Also, within one composition, you can contrast 
cropped images or big visuals with small ones to 
create a sense of depth.
Consistency versus Variation
Consistency helps establish unity—whether 
through symmetry, approximate symmetry, pat-
Static versus Sequence
As opposed to a static composition, a visual 
sequence is a number of things or elements or 
events in an order that might imply time, inter-
val, or motion over a period of time (duration); a 
sequence can be established on a single surface, 
on sequential pages, or in motion graphics. For 
example, a storyboard or comic graphic format

ARTICULATION: 
CREATING INTERESTING 
FOR M 
Articulation involves how well you express and 
how fully you craft transitions. 
Creating interesting form (harmony, beauty, 
contrast)—creating any desired effect with 
impact—requires articulation and attention to 
clarity, coherence of expression, and how compo-
nent parts are united.
HARMONY
To establish harmony, consistency, and agreement 
among elements and forms within a composition, 
you need to pay attention to several principles.
Proportions
Paying close attention to the proportions of 
component parts in the composition, their size 
relationships, how they are constructed, and how
they function in relation to one another will
aid harmony.
tern, any logical harmonious relationship of 
parts without discrepancy, an even level of visual 
weights, thicknesses of elements, or smooth-
ness or roughness of elements. When there is no 
variation or minimal variation, consistency/con-
gruence uniﬁ es and produces harmony. However, 
no variation could prove uninteresting; also, a ﬂ at 
hierarchy, where everything is treated equally, 
tends to be monotonous (though it can be medi-
tative; think architectural lacework patterns).
Some variation adds visual interest. When one 
or more elements differ in visual characteristics 
(color, shape, form, texture, value, size) or in 
treat ment or in position (isolated versus group-
ing), then variation is established. Besides creat-
ing difference among some graphic elements, you 
can employ a theme with variations. Variation 
must be uniﬁ ed in some way or it looks chaotic.
This set is also called “neutrality versus anom-
aly.” Neutrality is the same as consistency; an 
anomaly is an obvious break from the norm in a 
composition.
AVOID AMBIGUITY 
In visual perception, theoretically, a viewer asso-
ciates psychological tension with the position of 
a visual element in a composition. Accordingly, 
viewers feel confused if the position of a visual 
element is ambiguous, if the positioning seems 
tentative. People prefer declarative positioning 
that produces stability, certainty. (This is not to 
be confused with ﬁ gure/ground shapes that are 
intentionally unequivocal.)
In Art and Visual Perception and The Power of 
the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual 
Arts, Rudolf Arnheim, distinguished psycholo-
gist, philosopher, and critic, used a diagram to 
illustrate this theory. 
 If you place a dark 
circle slightly off center as if it had migrated from 
the center and should be returned to it, it might 
be disconcerting (psychologically frustrating) for 
the viewer. Therefore, if you place an element off-
center, make sure it looks off-center, not out of 
kilter. If you want a line quality to be scratchy, 
make it really scratchy. If you want it to feel tall, 
make sure it is really tall. Rule of thumb: avoid 
tentativeness; make your intention clear (see 
sidebar “Have you M.E.N.T. It?”).
“HAVE YOU
HAVE YOU  M.E.N.T. IT?”
To ensure your arrangement is deliberate and each graphic component (visuals 
and type) is thoughtfully and deliberately positioned, consider employing these four 
reminders, which will aid awareness of how you position graphic elements in relation 
to the format. Here, the word “relate” means “having some bearing to”; it doesn’t 
mean graphic components need to literally touch the midline or edges.
1/ M = midline
Relate all graphic components to the midline of the format.
2/ E = edges
Relate all graphic components to the format’s edges.
3/ N = negative shapes/space
Consider all negative space.
4/ T = transitions
Consider all transitions among graphic components.

P. 154
Chapter  06
you think of negative space as a dramatic pause 
in the same way a pause is used between musical 
notes or dance movements, then you can consider 
an “empty” space as a purposeful break between 
positive shapes.
Dynamics
Know when to play it down or punch it up. Unity 
relies, in part, on consistency; however, if all forms 
are treated equally, or played down, then the com-
position will be lacking, whether it lacks a focal 
point, a dynamic quality, or any type of visual 
interest. Conversely, if all elements are punched 
up, ﬁ ghting for visual attention, it might result 
in discord. For a dynamic quality, you punch up 
certain elements and play down others.
ATTENTION TO INTERSTICES 
AND TRANSITIONS
“Seventy-ﬁ ve percent of dance is about the 
transitions.”
—Winter Gabriel, dancer and choreographer
Consider each and every interstice and every 
transition from shape to shape, letter to letter, 
form to form, visual component to type compo-
nent. If you focus on the interstices, those spaces 
that intervene between shapes and forms and 
type, then the entire composition will be appear 
organically related and taut. (Imagine chore-
ography composed of individual dance moves 
with awkward or unconsidered transitions and 
you get the importance of efﬁ cient transitions 
to smooth visual moves.) Create interconnect-
edness among the graphic elements of the com-
position by paying attention to the transitions 
(Figure 6-34).
Create Relatedness
This goes back to unity, continuity, and ﬂ ow: atten-
tion to every element as a voice in a choral piece 
or as an actor in an ensemble cast who works to 
ensure relatedness, belonging, and connections.
Focus
Your attention to the logic of your communication 
will allow a viewer to focus and glean the message.

in a digital image is a module, a rectangular unit 
in a grid system is a module, and a ﬁ xed encapsu-
lated chunk of a composition is a module.
Modularity is used to create modular alphabets, 
hand-lettering (see Figure 3-12, Country Things 
logo), typographic treatments, signage systems, 
symbol systems, pixel effects, or any modular-
based imagery (for example, a transformation or 
sequence developed in modular units; ﬁ gures com-
posed of units).
CHUNKING
A technique related to modularity in graphic 
design, where content is split or information is 
grouped into chunks, is chunking or encapsulat-
ing. You do this by combining units or capsules of 
content or information into a limited number of 
units or chunks. The aim of chunking is to make 
information easily understood: it affords the 
viewer digestible amounts of content at a time. 
Chunking is utilized to facilitate memory and in 
other disciplines, such as musical composition.
In the solutions for Virgin Atlantic, a large 
amount of text and visuals are organized on the 
front and back of each piece, by grouping and 
Work the Entire Composition 
at an Equal Level
Work from the general to the speciﬁ c. When 
beginning students draw a still life, they will often 
draw one object at time, attempting to bring one 
object to ﬁ nish and then move on to the next, 
rather than ﬁ rst focusing on the relationships 
between the objects, on where everything sits in 
the compositional space. Never work at 100 per-
cent level of detail from one end of a composition 
to the other. Start with the most general elements 
of the composition and gradually work toward the 
more speciﬁ c. Evaluate continually, making local 
adjustments in the context of the entire page.
Use a Fine-Toothed Comb
Evaluate your own composition by eye, transition-
by-transition, part-by-part, as a whole. Judge all 
type by eye. Judge all interstices by eye. Do any 
areas of the composition appear to have been 
ignored? Critique your composition as if your life 
depended upon it, as if you were responsible for 
the maintenance of an aircraft where hundreds
of lives depended upon how responsible you are 
to your duties. (See sidebar “Basic Composi-
tional Checklist.”)
MODULARITY
In graphic design, modularity is a structural 
principle employed to manage content using 
modules. A module is a self-contained, ﬁ xed unit 
that is combined with others to form a larger 
foundational structure composed of regular units. 
Modularity helps manage content as well as 
complexity (think of all the content on a govern-
mental website). Modularity has three main 
advantages: (1) the underlying structure produces 
unity and continuity across a multipage applica-
tion, (2) the content within each module can eas-
ily be replaced or interchanged, and (3) modules 
can be rearranged to create different forms yet 
still remain uniﬁ ed.
A module is also deﬁ ned as any single ﬁ xed 
element within a bigger system or structure; for 
example, a unit on graph paper is a module, a pixel

Have you employed action to create visual interest, dynamics through contrast?
Have you used alignment to foster unity?
Have you arranged the composition to guide the viewer through the space?
Have you chosen a compositional approach that best enables communication?
Have you ordered the visual hierarchy for clarity?

RULE OF THIRDS 
The rule of thirds is an asymmetrical composi-
tional technique often used by painters, photog-
raphers, and designers to create interest, balance, 
and energy in visual arts by overlaying the space 
with a grid and positioning or aligning the focal 
point or primary graphic elements of the compo-
sition along these grid lines or especially on the 
intersections of the lines of the grid. This rule is 
also sometimes called the golden grid rule, since 
the modules created by the grid roughly relate to 
the ratio of the golden section (rule of thirds: 2/3 = 
0.666; the golden section: 0.618). In practice, the 
aim of the rule is to prevent the placement of the

Chapter  06
THE GRID
Open up a magazine. How many columns do you 
see? How are the visual elements organized? All the 
elements, display and text type, and visuals (illus-
trations, graphics, and photographs) on the pages 
of a print or digital magazine, book, or newspaper 
are almost always organized on a grid. A grid is a 
guide—a modular, compositional structure made 
up of verticals and horizontals that divide a format 
into columns and margins.
If we go back to the original premise in this 
chapter, that composition should produce clar-
ity and visual interest, then the purpose of a grid 
system makes good sense. Grids organize type 
and visuals. If you have to organize the enormous 
amount of content in any given newspaper, text-
book, or corporate, governmental, museum, or 
editorial website, you would want some type of 
structure to ensure that readers would be able to 
easily access and read an abundance of informa-
tion (see Figure 6-37). Imagine designing your 
daily newspaper using a spontaneous composi-
tion method, where you would have to intuitively 
design each page and then make sure each page had

subject of an image at the center of a composition 
or to discourage placements that divide the image 
in half. Theoretically, the rule of thirds produces 
aesthetic results.
To employ the rule, imagine an image divided 
into thirds both horizontally and vertically by the 
placement of a grid or a framework of equally 
spaced horizontal and vertical lines that cre-
ate four intersections and nine equal squares or 
modules. Then place the points of interest in 
your composition along the lines or at their inter-
sections. The focal point may be placed at one 
intersection, for example, and a counterbalanc-
ing secondary graphic element or accent placed 
at an opposing intersection. In a landscape, this 
often translates into placing the horizon line in 
your image along one of the horizontal lines. 
Although the intersections provide guidelines for 
the placement of primary elements, when work-
ing with asymmetry, you will still have to make 
judgments involving balance and counterpoint; 
inﬂ exible adherence to any compositional rule 
is deemed undesirable and you should be able to 
relax such adherence after working with the rule 
as a guideline for a while.

some resemblance to all the others while ensuring 
a sense of congruence across all the pages. Cer-
tainly you could compose spontaneously, but you 
would not meet a daily deadline. Not only does a 
grid spare you the time of having to spontaneously 
compose every page, it affords a skeletal structure 
that can provide continuity, congruence, unity, and 
visual ﬂ ow across many print or digital pages.
A grid is about maintaining order. If you think 
of the pool lanes in a swim meet and how they 
efﬁ ciently keep the swimmers where they are sup-
posed to be, then one goal of using a grid structure 
becomes clear. Compare the orderly swim meet 
in Figure 6-38 to the frenzied sea of bodies in a 
triathlon ocean open swim in Figure 6-39. A grid 
deﬁ nes boundaries and keeps content in order.

GRID ANATOMY

P. 161
Diagram 6-01 illustrates the anatomy of a grid.
A grid’s proportions and spaces provide a consis-
tent visual appearance for an application with many 
pages (Figure 6-40); a grid is a structural system 
that holds together all the visual elements. There 
are even and odd number grids, ranging from one 
to four and sometimes even six columns.
A designer can strictly adhere to a grid or break 
a grid. For the sake of visual drama or surprise, 
you can occasionally break the grid. If you break 
the grid too often, however, the armature it pro-
vides will be lost (similarly, sculptural relief on a 
column can’t go too deep or it will break the col-
umn). Often, magazines have several grid options 
that work together, as shown in the three sample 
grids used in Print magazine (Figure 6-41).
MARGINS 
Deﬁ ning boundaries starts with margins—the
blank space on the left, right, top, or bottom edge 
of any printed or digital page (Diagram 6-02). 
Basically, in grids as well as on any single surface,

Sample grid designs: when you have many elements to organize—display type, 
text type, and visuals—you usually need to establish an underlying structure 
that can provide help in maintaining clarity, legibility, balance, and unity. This is 
especially true when you are working with a multipage format where you need 
to establish a fl ow or sense of visual consistency from one page to another.

FLOWLINES
Flowlines establish horizontal alignments in a 
grid and can aid visual ﬂ ow. When ﬂ owlines are 
established at regular intervals, a regular set of 
spatial units called modules are created.
GRID MODULES
Grid modules are the individual units created by 
the intersection of the vertical column and hori-
zontal ﬂ owlines. A text block or image is placed 
in a grid module. Examples of modular grids are 
shown in Diagram 6–03; a text block or image 
can be positioned on one or more modules.
SPATIAL ZONES
Spatial zones are formed by grouping several grid 
modules in order to organize the placement of 
various graphic components. Spatial zones can be 
dedicated to text or image or either. When estab-
lishing spatial zones, keep proportional relation-
ships, position of the page (point of entry), and 
visual weight in mind.
EXERCISE 6-1
GRAPHIC SPACE: DOMINANT VISUAL 
VERSUS MULTIPLE VISUALS
➊ First composition: Find or take a photograph of 
an object or person, which will be the dominant 
visual in the fi nal composition. Then fi nd or take 
margins function as frames around visual and 
typographic content, concurrently deﬁ ning active 
or live areas of the page as well as its boundaries. 
(When planning margins for a bound book, mag-
azine, or annual report, allow for the space needed 
for binding in the gutter margin, the blank space 
formed by the inner margins of two facing pages 
of a book.)
Considerations for determining the margins 
include:
› How the margin can best present the content
› Legibility
› Stability
› Determining the proportions of the margins to 
produce harmony
› Desired visual appearance
› Symmetrical versus asymmetrical margins
COLUMNS AND COLUMN 
INTERVALS
Columns act similarly to the lanes of a swim meet. 
Columns are vertical alignments or arrangements 
used to accommodate text and images. In any 
grid, the number of columns depends upon sev-
eral factors, mainly the concept, purpose, and how 
the designer wants the content to be presented. 
When using more than one column, columns 
can be the same width or vary in width. One or 
more columns can be dedicated to only text or 
only images or a combination thereof. The spaces 
between columns are called column intervals.

➋ Build a composition around one dominant visual 
(using size, shape, color, or value contrast), 
where all other graphic elements form relation-
ships with that dominant visual.
➌ Second composition: using the same silhou-
ettes, now build a composition where there is no 
single overtly dominant visual; here relationships 
are built among several shapes or forms through 
some unifying principle. No element dominates. 
In a multiple composition, all movements have

➊ Find photographs that commemorate or repre-
sent important moments in your own life or in the 
life of a country’s president. Scan the photos.
➋ Write text that contextualizes or complements 
the images.
➌ Design a basic modular grid. Grids organize con-
tent. First, design a simple three- or four-column 
grid. Add horizontal fl owlines to create grid mod-
ules. Grid modules are the individual units cre-
ated by the intersection of the vertical column 
and horizontal fl owlines.
➍ Place type or images in a grid module. As a 
point of departure to learn about the purpose 
and aesthetic of utilizing a modular grid, do not 
break the grid modules.
➎ Use the grid for a three-page history.

WHY WE LOVE POSTERS
It is not unusual to walk through a public space, see a poster, and think, “I would love to 
hang that in my home.” In fact, some people ﬁ nd some publicly displayed posters so attrac-
tive that they go to extremes; for example, people tried to steal Gail Anderson’s poster for 
the School of Visual Arts from subway platforms (see the Showcase of Gail Anderson’s work 
on page 168).
One could surmise that French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s adoption 
of the poster medium (Figure 7-01) encouraged other ﬁ ne artists’ interest in this 
vehicle for graphic communication. The American, Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, 
Israeli, Russian, and European art and design communities (and governments) 
have embraced the poster. Innumerable visual artists have designed them, such 
as Eduardo Munoz Bachs (Cuba), Romare Bearden (United States) (Figure 
7-02), Milton Glaser (United States), Eiko Ishioka (Japan), Oskar Kokoschka 
(Austria), Dan Reisinger (Israel) (see Figure 7-28), Ben Shahn (United States), 
and Tadanori Yokoo (Japan).
When someone chooses to hang a social protest poster or concert poster in his 
or her room, that individual, of course, believes in the cause or favors the musical 
artist. Yet, the association with the poster may be more signiﬁ cant—emblematic, 
perhaps, choosing a poster as an expression of one’s individuality. Milton Glaser’s 
poster of Bob Dylan has adorned countless walls and has become an icon (Figure 
7-03). Depicting an individual as an icon communicates meaning about its sub-
ject, as does the poster for 50 Cent (see Timeline, page TL-24). Or perhaps one 
can identify with the designer’s social or political commentary (Figure 7-04).
THE PURPOSE OF POSTERS
The purpose of any poster is to communicate a message. To do that, a poster 
must ﬁ rst grab a viewer’s attention. A poster is seen while someone is on the 
move—driving, riding, or walking by—so it must be engaging enough to cap-
ture a person’s attention amid all the other visual clutter.
OBJECTIVES
Realize why people love posters
Learn the purpose of posters
Understand the context
Appreciate a poster designed as 
social commentary
Become conscious of a poster as 
a vehicle for change
WHETHER
A POSTER IS A PROMOTION FOR AN ART EXHIBIT, A 
MUSICAL GROUP, OR THE VOICE OF DISSENT, IT IS COMMON TO SEE ONE 
TACKED ON A WALL OR FRAMED, HANGING IN HOMES AND OFFICES ALONG-
SIDE PAINTINGS, PHOTOGRAPHS, AND FINE ART PRINTS. NO OTHER GRAPHIC 
DESIGN FORMAT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN CAPTURING THE ATTENTION 
AND HEARTS OF MUSEUM CURATORS, ART CRITICS, SOCIAL HISTORIANS, 
AND THE PUBLIC. SOME PEOPLE HAVE EXTENSIVE POSTER COLLECTIONS 
THAT CONTAIN EITHER A VARIETY OF POSTERS OR A SERIES.

When I say months, I’m not kidding. I made little

and called it ‘typography soup,’ but people tried 
to steal it from the subway platforms, so someone

Chapter  07
A poster is a two-dimensional, single-surface 
format used to inform (display information, data, 
schedules, or offerings) and to persuade or promote 
(people, causes, places, events, products, compa-
nies, services, groups, or organizations). Produced 
in multiples and (usually) widely circulated, post-
ers are often posted in numerous locations around 
town and are seen more than once by the public. 
Ubiquity and multiple viewings reinforce messages 
for any single viewer. In public spaces, we see post-
ers promoting events such as ﬁ lms, plays, concerts, 
lectures, and conferences. Figure 7-05 promotes 
a student design conference and multiple copies 
were sent to colleges and universities. Posters fea-
turing attractive models and celebrities endorsing 
brands are hung in bus shelters and subway sta-
tions. Theatrical or musical events, public service 
advertising, sporting events, rallies, protest causes, 
messages of dissent, politics and politicians, pro-
paganda, wars, museum exhibits, and brand adver-
tising are all subjects for posters.
If a poster is not well designed or is dull, surely 
it will be ignored when surrounded by other visual 
communication or an interesting environment. 
An appealing poster design can capture our atten-
tion and imagination and perhaps provoke us like 
no other graphic design application. When words 
and visuals are effectively combined, a poster has 
the potential to communicate and become more 
than just a ﬂ eeting visual communication; it can 
become an object to return to, again and again, for 
contemplation, enjoyment, or provocation. It is 
fascinating that in this age of moving images and 
Flash graphics, a still form of visual communica-
tion—a poster—continues to hold our attention; 
as does the poster for John Leguizamo’s one-man 
play (Figure 7-06).
A LITTLE HISTORY
Before posters became a visual communication 
staple, broadsides were used to communicate 
ephemeral information—to make announce-
ments and publicize news and events, as well as 
to promote merchandise. A broadside, or broad-
sheet, is a large sheet of paper, typically printed 
on one side. In Europe, after the invention of 
moveable type, broadsides were used to make 
announcements. Once printers began working in

the American colonies around the mid- to late 
seventeenth century, broadsides had a role in 
colonial life.
Broadsides were relatively inexpensive to pro-
duce and served their purpose for local advertis-
ers and information seekers. In both Europe and 
America, there were advances in printing tech-
nology by the late nineteenth century; in France, 
color lithography was signiﬁ cantly advanced by 
Jules Chéret, allowing for great color and nuance 
in poster reproduction. By 1900, colorful posters 
would eclipse broadsides as visual communica-
tion that could attract viewers.1
Before the end of the nineteenth century, print-
ers composed posters primarily only with text, 
sometimes embellishing the poster with decora-
tive yet conventional graphic elements, such as 
borders or dingbats.
Inﬂ uenced by the strong graphics and ideas 
found in Japanese prints and the advantages of 
color lithography, artists such as Chéret, Toulouse-
Lautrec, and Bonnard replaced type with the 
integration of images and hand-lettering. These 
new posters, by the mid-1890s, were embraced, 
collected by connoisseurs, and discussed in illus-
trated books and magazines.2
POSTERS IN CONTEXT
Most posters are meant to be hung in public places 
and to be seen from a distance. Understanding the 
context for any graphic design is crucial. Where 
will it be seen, and how will it be viewed? How 
close will the viewer be? In today’s competitive 
visual landscape, a poster must catch the attention 
of passersby while competing for attention with 
surrounding posters, outdoor boards, neon signs, 
and any other visual material. We only need to 
think of the myriad of posters in the city square 
near a theater district to realize just how much a 
poster must do to capture attention.

Sometimes, we can almost see the designer think-
ing, and in these cases, the design concept is very 
clear. The poster by Bob Aufuldish for the lecture 
series at the California College of the Arts Archi-
tecture examines ideas surrounding global prac-
tice (Figure 7-07). The background is composed 

P. 174
Chapter  07
of abstracted airline route maps, and Aufuldish 
designed the information to “ﬂ oat on top of this 
ﬁ eld.” In Figure 7-08, the symmetry and vertical 
microphone stand evokes the title’s form.
On their website, SpotCo, a leading entertain-
ment advertising agency, presents case studies of 
their work stating their “big ideas,” “key mes-
sages,” and “real results” for each poster proj-
ect (www.spotnyc.com). Several issues must be 
addressed simultaneously in a poster. As SpotCo’s 
creative director Gail Anderson says, “A good deal 
of information has to live on each design.”
Clearly identifying and then stating your three 
“big ideas” and three “key messages” is an extremely 
helpful guide for the conceptual development of
a poster. 
To formulate your key messages, based on 
Gail Anderson’s assessment, ask:
› What will make the average theatergoer/mov-
iegoer/concertgoer buy a ticket?
› What makes this poster’s attraction/cause/
brand different from the other choices out there?
› What are you promoting?
› Why should someone be interested in this 
social cause? Political view?
› How can you craft the message so the target 
audience believes what you’re conveying?
DESIGN DEVELOPMENT 
Like all other graphic design, the success of a 
poster depends on expressing the design concept 
through a cooperative combination of type and 
image, interesting visualization, and considered 
composition. The very nature of designing for 
one large graphic surface absolutely invites exper-
imentation; for example, Steven Brower used 
hand-torn paper and a photo collage to visualize 
Figure 7-09.
Visualization 
Any visualization should best serve the design con-
cept. Before a major gallery renovation, Southern 
Exposure invited artists to respond to the gallery’s 
tangible space exploring “the notion of home and 
the relationship between space and identity.” For 
the exhibition poster Between the Walls, Mende-
Design visualized a relationship between the walls 
and the artists in Figure 7-10.

The theme for a California College of the 
Arts Architecture lecture series was “resourceful-
ness.” Bob Aufuldish comments about his design 
for Figure 7-11, “In the context of architecture, 
resourcefulness means both thinking nimbly and 
being conscious of the impact architecture has on 
the planet. Thinking resourcefully, we built all the 
text for the poster out of ﬂ owers.”
Explore techniques to see which ones might 
work best for your concepts. As listed in Chapter 
5 on visualization, experiment with collage, pho-
tomontage, and the following:
› Printmaking techniques: If you’ve studied print-
making, then further explore one of these options: 
woodcut, linocut, screen printing (serigraphy), 
etching, dry point, intaglio, and mezzotint, among 
others. If you haven’t studied printmaking, start 
with a monotype, a one-off technique (producing 
one copy) in which a ﬂ at surface (Perspex, glass, 
cardboard, copper or zinc plate) is painted with 
printmaking ink or oil colors; it is then passed 
through an etching press or pressed by hand (roll-
ing pin or other tool).
› Screen printing: Due to its popularity, screen 
printing deserves its own entry. Screen print-
ing can be created at home using a porous mesh 
screen stretched over a wooden frame, a stencil, 
a squeegee, ink, and a surface, such as paper or
a T-shirt.
› Letterpress: Letterpress is a printing method 
using “relief” type printing plates where the image 
or printing areas are raised above the nonprinting 
areas. (Your university or neighborhood arts cen-
ter may have a letterpress that you can use.)
› Woodblock: Originating in China, woodblock 
printing is a technique for printing text, images, 
or patterns on textiles or paper.
› Mixed media and experimental media: Experi-
ment by combining different visual art media; for 
example, combine paint with collage or combine 
photography with drawings. Try illustrating with 
unusual media; for example, use black coffee to 
paint on unprimed canvas or on paper towels, or 
model 3D forms out of Model Magic™ mate-
rial, or create imagery with torn paper. Try a 
photogram; the placement of an object on light-
sensitive paper creates an image of its silhouette. 
No camera necessary.

COMPOSITION BASICS
1/ Grab attention. A poster can persuade 
people to see a show, purchase a brand, donate 
blood, get a mammogram, protest censorship, or 
buy concert tickets. However, a poster can per-
suade only if it attracts someone’s attention, if it 
pulls someone in. Second, it has to be interest-
ing enough to keep a person from turning his or 
her head in another direction. Finally, a poster 
has to call you to action—persuade you to do 
something.
2/ Set it apart. To attract attention, a poster 
must be visually interesting as well as different 
from its surroundings. Just like packaging on a 
market shelf, a poster needs to be differentiated 
from others competing with it. Since there are 
many posters advertising ﬁ lms and theatrical 
events, why should I choose to look at one rather 
than another? How you visualize and compose 
can and should create distinction—a unique look 
and feel, mood, or emotional level for the subject. 
Your choice or creation of display type and how 
you visualize will contribute greatly to distinction.
3/ Communicate key messages. Hierarchy plays 
strongly into how well your composition commu-
nicates the key messages. You can use type, visu-
als, color, or all of them to orchestrate hierarchy. 
Once a focal point ushers the viewer into the 
composition, the composition should guide the 
viewer on. On a single surface, color can guide 
the viewer as well as establish visual connections 
among elements.
4/ Single surface, one unit. Since a poster is seen 
from a distance, ensuring all component parts act 
in concert to form a cohesive entity is paramount.
The advantage of structuring a composition for 
a poster is in dealing only with a single surface, 
similar to a painting or drawing, where you don’t 
have to worry about continuity over several pages, 
as in magazine or brochure design. For a novice, 
it helps to decide if the composition will be domi-
nated by a visual, by type, or by a visual/verbal 
amalgamation. In Figure 7-13, promoting the 
Olivetti Valentine, the composition is dominated 
by Milton Glaser’s famous illustration, which is 
the focal point. Figure 7-14, Hypatia Lake, is type 
driven; the stars and tape add to the ﬂ ow of the 
composition, and the arrow aids our focus.

can be fused in a poster design, as in Figure 7-16,

promoting the appearance of Modern Dog in 
Raleigh. In Figure 7-17, a theater poster for Mac-
beth, designer Cedomir Kostovic comments, “The 
title’s typography is purposely incorporated into 
the image to support its communicative power.”
How you visualize and structure a composition 
depends on what you want to communicate. In 
Figure 7-18, George Tscherny divides the for-
mat into a modular grid, using eight of the nine 
subdivisions to promote a new press capable of 
printing eight colors plus coating in one pass. 
Using a trompe l’oeil effect, the espresso cup in 
Figure 7-19 pops forward of the picture plane

“full of human presence.”
Poster Series
Often, a poster stands alone, as a single unit. 
Sometimes posters, either one design or a related 
series, are posted in multiples (Figure 7-21). The 
entire Mission Mall was wallpapered with these 
fun and nostalgic posters to create a barricade 
effect. When designing a series, such as that for

A regional shopping mall was going to open in two

“We have 150,000 square feet of blank storefront 
barricades and it looks desolate in here!” So, in order 
to get something produced and installed in two weeks 
and respond to a limited budget situation, I designed 
a series of three-color silk-screen posters. We printed 
75 each of the posters on cheap billboard paper 40" 
× 60" and simply wallpapered the entire mall. These 
posters quickly became collectors’ items.

play is represented by a large singular graphic

SOCIAL COMMENTARY
If graphic design and advertising can sell us 
mouthwash and movie tickets, they can also 
advance political ideas and social causes. As a 
mass communication vehicle, the poster can be 
used to voice dissent, to incite, to propagandize, 
or to inform. Whether worrisome propaganda 
or in the service of the public good, a poster can 
potentially inﬂ uence many. In the interest of

(Figure 7-22), it is important to establish elements 
of continuity so that the posters seem to belong to 
one another, like triplets or cousins. Some design-
ers design a template so that elements are posi-
tioned similarly from poster to poster within a 
series, yet they create enough variety to make each 
individual poster distinctive. (Also see Chapter 8 
about designing a cover series.)
Ideas can be expressed through a series—

CLIENT: THEATRE PROJECT
The Mistero Buffo poster, for 
instance, distills the picaresque 
play’s iconoclastic characters (all 
played by a single actor) into a 
fl at, bowler-hatted bottle careening 
precariously across the page. To 
“get something a little gritty,” I 
drew the original and then kicked 
out individual separations and 
distressed those separations from 
my printer, producing an image both 
easy to print and iconic. I try to get 
a feeling of spontaneity that will 
strike the viewer on an emotional 
level if not an intellectual level.

society, with each designer comes the potential 
for uniquely effecting change. In a single visual, a 
poster can carry a message to those who see it, perhaps 
to people who wouldn’t read extensively about a sub-
ject or listen to long political debates. 
Figure 7-25 is one of the ﬁ rst widely distrib-
uted “protest posters,” a diagram produced by 
Thomas Clarkson, British abolitionist, and the 
Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, 
published in 1789. About this poster, the Inde-
pendent's art critic Tom Lubbock, writes: “The 
power of art has received many tributes, often 
from those within the profession. But if you’re 
interested in images that have real power in the 
world, they’re probably not going to be bona ﬁ de 
works of art. They’re going to be cartoons, post-
ers, documentary photos, emblems, logos, maps, 
and plans. Perhaps the most politically inﬂ uential 
picture ever made is not a painting but a diagram; 
and it was devised not by an artist but by a cam-
paign group. Its full title is Stowage of the Brit-
ish Slave Ship ‘Brookes’ under the Regulated Slave 
Trade Act of 1788.”3
In the tradition of using the poster to give 
voice to ideas that matter, contemporary design-
ers create for a myriad of causes, voicing dissent 
or hope, protesting or urging. In Figure 7-26, 
Fang Chen pleads for a stop to global warm-
ing using a metaphor. Chen says, “I have always 
believed that a good designer should be able to 
express complicated and profound meanings in a 
simple way and a good poster should make people 
think.” Using the violin as a metaphor in Figure 
7-27, Cedomir Kostovic dismantles it, rendering 
it useless, to represent the division of Bosnia into 
three sections along ethnic lines. Dan Reisinger, 
born in Yugoslavia in 1934, spent the German 
occupation hidden by a Serbian family. In Figure 
7-28, he warns against the rise of neo-fascism/
neo-Nazism in the former Soviet Republic. Steff 
Geissbuhler comments on the meaning of the 
poster in Figure 7-29, “The friendship of Godz-
illa and King Kong makes them mightier than 
any other single beast. Friendship does not mean 
that one has to eliminate the other. It means 
coexistence with mutual respect and understand-
ing. Nobody has to be the winner—nobody has 
to lose.”

PEACE—GODZILLA AND KING KONG • COMMEMORATION OF THE 40TH

• CHERMAYEFF & GEISMAR INC., NEW YORK
• DESIGNER AND ILLUSTRATOR: STEFF GEISSBUHLER
Godzilla is a modern folk hero and a symbol of Japanese superpower, 
called upon in times of crisis and invasion by other superpowers such as 
King Kong. Apparently, Godzilla emerged from the volcanic emptiness after 
a nuclear blast. Therefore, it is even more of a symbol relating to peace. 
King Kong was used as the American counterpart to Godzilla.
The centered red sun on a white background is another symbol of 
Japan (Japanese fl ag, etc.). The color palette of red, black, and white is 
classic, and typical in Japanese calligraphy, painting, and woodcuts. The 
red-to-white gradation in the background relates directly to contemporary 
airbrush techniques frequently used in Japanese design.

A single image that captures multiple aspects of 
the concept, balancing simplicity and complexity 
in the mind of the viewer, is an experience that is 
unlikely to be dismissed or quickly forgotten.
The visual alchemy of transforming the familiar 
into imagery with an unpredictable message is the 
goal of poster design at Scorsone/Drueding. We 
aim to tap into what is known and understood 
by the audience and then turn it on its head. The 
stylistic approach for each poster is determined 
by what we believe will be the most effective way 
of visualizing a particular idea. Visual style has a 
powerful inﬂ uence on the way images are read. 
Style should always support the concept.
Style is the “poetry” of visual language. The way 
something is said—either visually or verbally—
makes it unique and enhances its meaning. Design-
ers take their stylistic cues from the subject to 
maximize the expressive power of their concept. 
From simple vector drawings to complex, layered 
collages, stylistic choices bring concepts to life.
This poster [Over 1,000,000, Sold] is about 
human slavery, which is ongoing and shockingly 
pervasive around the world. Sexual slavery of 
women and children is one of the most prevalent 
forms of the practice. In this case, we were faced 
with another intangible. Slavery is not something 
you can see. Most people readily understand 
chains as a representation of slavery or imprison-
ment. We used the chain to represent one aspect 
of our subject. The other aspect of the subject is 
slavery as “commerce.” Buying and selling human 
beings is making many people very wealthy. The 
woman, representing all victims of slavery, hangs 
by a chain as though she were literally a piece of 
meat for sale in the marketplace. Her arm is bru-
tally pierced with a price tag. She hangs there in 
Designers communicate information and ideas to 
an audience. Successful images for design engage 
the viewer in a process of learning something not 
previously known or understanding a known sub-
ject in an entirely new way. The most interesting 
design happens in part on the printed page; the 
rest happens in the mind of the viewer.
To communicate effectively, a designer begins 
by developing a concept that will drive the 
image-making process. The design concept is a 
communication strategy that keeps the designer 
focused while exploring visual options. Through 
research and various associative techniques, such 
as mind-mapping, concepts achieve traction when 
the potential for seemingly unrelated elements to 
work together is identiﬁ ed. Visual economy is key.

a gesture of abject hopelessness. Nothing about 
the image is literal—this is not what slavery actu-
ally looks like. Again, we are able to capture the 
intangible through metaphor.
We use metaphor to express ideas that are 
intangible. Emotions are experienced internally. 
Their full implication is difﬁ cult to communicate 
without tapping into the power of metaphors and 
symbols. Common verbal metaphors often lead to 
interesting visual solutions. Being “consumed” by 
an emotion—jealousy, rage, or in this case, fear—is 
a readily understood ﬁ gure of speech. In this poster 
[Fear], the brain is literally consumed by a relent-
less swarm of insects. But the viewer understands 
that it is really the mind—the center of human 
understanding, identity, and action—that is the 
ﬁ gurative target. The insects represent the relent-
less cultural agents of fear (government, media, 
etc.) that bombard our conscious and unconscious 
selves daily. Visualization of the head itself, raw 
and exposed, enhances the horror of the image.
In this poster [Alternatives to War], soldiers 
are identiﬁ ed by an iconic image that was found 
in an old military manual. With their identical 
uniforms and rigid posture, these soldiers rep-
resent an abstract paradigm of the modern war-
rior, precise and impersonal cogs in the wheel of 
the military machine. What is unexpected here 
is their essential and even poignant humanity as 
they participate in familiar and wholesome peace-
time activities. The faceless representatives of a 
national armed force are transformed into indi-
viduals engaged in living lives that resemble our 
own. They are clearly and disconcertingly one of 
us. The contraction within the imagery turns this 
poster into a complex question about the implica-
tions of sending soldiers—ourselves—to war.

EXERCISE 7-1
A graphic design solution can be a catalyst for 
change. If you had a chance to raise your voice in 
protest through a poster, what would you protest? 
War? Child abuse? Pollution? What would you pro-
mote? Freedom? Clean water? To whom would you 
appeal?
Select one cause that you deem important.
➊ At the top of a page, write the name of the cause.
➋ Sketch or write as many objects as you can think 
of having similarities to your subject. If you’re hav-
ing diffi culty, use attribute listing (see Chapter 4) 
to help you or treat this as a kind of a Rorschach 
inkblot test, where you simply sketch the fi rst 
thing that comes to mind when asking yourself, 
“What might this remind me of or be similar to?”
➌ Sketch visual metaphors, at least two, for your 
cause.

d. Generate a few design concepts. Concentrate 
your conceptual thinking on fi nding a way to 
prompt people to think about the cause. Select 
and refi ne one concept.
Step 2
a. Determine whether the poster should be visu-
ally driven or type driven.
b. Your poster should be able to grab the atten-

process of designing a cover

series of publications
Pick up the basics of how to 
structure the interior of a publication
THE PURPOSE OF COVER DESIGN
Have you ever lingered at a newsstand to look more closely because a magazine cover caught 
your eye? Or, when walking by a bookstore window display, has a book cover stopped you in 
your tracks? That’s part of the purpose of a cover.
Although not every book or magazine is aimed at the same audience, in a bookstore 
or newsstand environment, covers are in competition, all vying for attention. At once, a 
cover must grab a reader’s attention and, in visual shorthand, communicate the book’s 
substance. Whether a reader views a reduced version of it online or in a catalog or sees it 
in its actual size displayed in a bookstore, a cover must generate intrigue and make you 
want to pick it up.
The design of a cover or book jacket may inﬂ uence your decision to purchase a book or 
magazine. At the very least, it gives a clue as to what is between the covers. Book covers have 
a hybrid purpose—they are both promotional and editorial. Attracting someone, a cover 
promotes the book or magazine. Covers are also editorial, needing to communicate the pub-
lication’s content. For example, for Dave Eggers’s short story collection, How We Are Hungry 
(Figure 8-01), where animals (cows, an anteater, and even a talking dog) appear in almost 
every story, the cover conveys a sense of the creatures to come.
THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING A COVER
As with any design project, the standard process is illustrated in the following diagram:
Design
Orientation
Analysis
Concepts
Implementation
Once you have generated a design concept, visualization and composition are next. 
For cover design, there are required components. For a book, title (and subtitle), edition, 
author(s), and possibly the publisher’s imprint logo and other special elements (award,

endorsement, among others) are usually required. 
For a magazine, the title, date, and price are part 
of every edition.
A cover should give the reader a sense of what 
the book or magazine is about. You can think 
of a book cover as a ﬁ lm trailer or preview, both 
informing and creating suspense or curiosity, as in 
The New York Times Magazine, The Annual Design 
Issue cover in Figure 8-02. A book jacket or maga-
zine cover must communicate its message quickly 
and clearly, and arouse interest. How much of the 
book do you reveal in the cover design? Which 
visual would capture the book’s essence? Subject? 
Plot? Main character?
The cover is a reader’s ﬁ rst experience with a
book. After the initial reaction to a cover in a 
bookstore, online, or at a newsstand, once the 
reader starts reading, a new relationship develops. 
Often a reader will turn to and contemplate the 
cover. Though a magazine cover is more ephem-
eral than a book’s, it is still part of the entire 
reading experience. In a fashion similar to our 
experiences with CD covers, a reader develops a 
relationship with a book or magazine cover and 
returns to it again and again.
INTEGRATION OF TYPE 
AND IMAGE
Like any other graphic design application, a book 
jacket or magazine cover most often combines 
type and image. Sympathetic or contrasting ele-
ments comprising cover and spine—typeface 
versus image, pattern versus solid, computer-
generated type versus hand-scrawled illustra-
tions—all should support the thesis of the book 
or magazine’s main article or theme.
Type and image should work cooperatively 
to communicate the subject and design concept, 
working in a supporting, sympathetic, or con-
trasting relationship (see Chapter 5, Visualiza-
tion). There are four basic routes.
› All-Type. When budgets won’t cover the cost 
of hiring an illustrator or photographer, or if the 
designer believes type is the best way to commu-
nicate the design concept, an all-type treatment 
should be considered. In Figure 8-03, a book 
where Mark J. Cherry makes a case for a means

is the predominant visual element, the viewer 
is expected to be attracted to the title’s mean-
ing or the author’s reputation. When shopping 
for a William Trevor novel or short story col-
lection, many people scan bookstore shelves for 
his name. In Figure 8-05, Paul Buckley creates 
a clear visual hierarchy with the author’s name as 
the driving element. Two of Buckley’s other solu-
tions for this cover are also shown. Focusing on 
a provocative title, Hand Job: A Catalog of Type,
naturally, the typography has been hand-drawn 
by Michael Perry, the author/designer (Figure 
8-06). Although the background image works 
to explain the title as an astronomical reference, 
Norton’s Star Atlas, this cover is also type-driven 
(see Figure 6-37).
› Image-Driven. There is no doubt that most 
viewers are attracted to interesting images. When 
a publication’s cover is image-driven, it means 
that the image is the predominant visual element 
on the cover—the one doing the most work to 
attract the viewer. If you have any doubt about 
a visual’s potential power to capture and move 
us, look at this cover published shortly after the 
terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on

HAND JOB: A CATALOG OF TYPE BY MICHAEL PERRY
• MIKE PERRY
Hand Job collects work from an international array of contemporary 
typographers who draw by hand. Graphic designer and hand 
typographer Michael Perry selected the works to represent various 
styles and methods. In his review, Mark Woodhouse, Library 
Journal, wrote: “Hand-drawn letterforms exhibit the kind of unique 
and sometimes accidental quality that sets them apart from the 
more precise, computer-generated graphics with which we’re more 
familiar today.”

The Yiddish Policemen's Union by Michael Cha-
bon, a classic noir with a comic twist, is an his-
torical “What if. . .” set in an alternate reality in 
Sitka, Alaska. The symmetry of the composition 
and characteristics of the forms are references to 
native art from Alaska. The imagery sets the stage 
for murder and a fascinating world of good cops 
facing a hard-boiled underworld.

9/11 (Figure 8-07). For B. Glen Rotchin’s The 
Rent Collector, the trompe l’oeil visualization of 
the wallet drives the composition, symbolizing 
the novel’s main character’s belief that we have 
debts to pay, both temporal and spiritual (Fig-
ure 8-08).
Since people tend to be more attracted to visu-
als, especially of other people, most popular mag-
azine covers are image-driven, as in this cover for 
The New York Times Style Magazine (Figure 8-09).

› Visual-Verbal Synergy. Every respected de-
signer knows type and image should work coop-
eratively, but many beginners create interesting 
visuals only to “slap” type on a cover as if they 
were simply typing text to accompany the valued 
visual. The goal, always, is visual and type work-
ing synergistically, as in the cover for Advertising 
by Design™, where the type is a natural part of the 
visual (Figure 8-10). Mirko Ilic´’s cover for The
Anatomy of Design integrates type and image to

The concept of the dramatic trompe 
l’oeil design is based on the book’s 
goal—to reveal the underlying 
infl uences of design. Peel away 
the outer skin and the skeleton

that function with others.

is crucial to make decisions based on the design 
concept, on any component’s appropriateness to 
the subject matter.
There are many creative approaches to visual-
ization, as discussed in Chapter 5. Some design-
ers begin by sketching; others start with collage; 
some experiment with a variety of visualizing 
techniques. Here are two stages in Paul Buckley’s 
process of designing the cover for The 351 Books 
of Irma Arcuri (Figure 8-14) and Steven Brower’s 
reveal, to visually explain the notion of “uncov-
ering the inﬂ uences and inspirations in modern 
graphic design” (Figure 8-11).
At times, type and image are so fully integrated, 
they become emblematic, as in Figure 8-12 for Dr. 
Delicious. With text type as water for Dead Man’s 
Float, we immediately get a haunting feeling 
from the cover in Figure 8-13. Choosing a clas-
sic typeface for this cover allows the visualization 
and composition to reign. During visualization, it

› Design the spine for graphic impact and 
readability
› Treat back cover and spine as part of the 
“whole” design
› Consider the relationship to the cover when 
designing the interior pages
Often, people think of a book jacket as just 
the front cover. The entire cover—including the 
spine, which is a key player in a bookstore envi-
ronment—must be considered as a whole. Both 
the front and back can be treated as a continuous 
piece. Whether on a bookstore or library shelf, 
it is the spine of the book that works to grab the 
reader’s attention (Figure 8-17).
DESIGNING FOR A SERIES
When designing for a series, corresponding visual 
elements and positions will help people recognize 
and identify the books as belonging together. 
Among the covers or jackets, there should be 
similarities; for example, method of visualization, 
composition/template/placement of the elements, 
type treatments, color, or use of visuals.
John Gall approaches cover design as a ﬁ ne 
artist manipulating collage elements, as in this 
series for Gabriel García Márquez’s novels (Fig-
ure 8-18). Steven Brower interviewed Gall for 
sketch for a Print cover (Figure 8-15). There are 
many options for creative visualization; for exam-
ple, once Brower formulated a concept for the 
Print magazine cover, he spent a Sunday after-
noon chasing down knickknacks for the cover of 
Print’s European Design Annual (Figure 8-16).

each cover or relate it to another in the series. 
Each cover is a “fraternal twin” to the next, with 
enough variation to distinguish the individual 
titles within the series. Some templates include 
very little variation. Others allow for greater 
variation, creating the look of “cousins” among 
the covers; there is some family resemblance, but 
they are not as close as fraternal twins.
DESIGNING 
THE INTERIORS 
OF EDITORIAL 
PUBLICATIONS
Whether online or in print, a publication design 
starts with orientation, analysis, and concep-
tual development, and involves the same design 
basics as any other graphic design application—
organizing content, visualization, composition, 
integrating visuals with type, creating visual 
interest and clarity of communication. What 
separates publication design is the task of orga-
nizing an enormous amount of content, creating 
a structure that organizes, uniﬁ es, and integrates 
across many pages. Some editorial publications, 
such as newspapers and magazines, are periodi-
cals or series-based, with a number of editions. 
Therefore, a structure is created for more than 
one issue and needs to work and be consistent 
across editions.
STRUCTURING A PUBLICATION
I asked Steven Brower, a designer with extensive 
publication design experience, what would be 
the ﬁ ve things he would stress if he were teach-
ing a speed course in publication design. Brower 
replied with this surprising response, surprising 
because he placed “concept” last:
1/ Clarity of communication
2/ Legibility
3/ Use of type/imagery
4/ Audience
5/ Concept
What this reveals is not that Brower doesn’t 
believe in the importance of a design concept; 
from experience he knows that editorial design 
Step Inside Design magazine and asked, “How 
did you learn to manipulate the 2D surface 
in such fascinating ways?” Gall replied, “I’ve 
always been kind of interested in ﬂ at 2D space 
vs. representational 3D space and how to cre-
ate space using 2D elements as well as negating 
or poking holes in space within a 3D context. 
When designing a cover we’re basically rework-
ing the same 5 × 8 or 6 × 9 space over and over, 
so I’m always trying to arrange elements into 
interesting juxtapositions and trying to ﬁ nd 
some breathing room. It’s very easy to clutter 
up the page.”
When Helen Yentus redesigned the complete 
works of Albert Camus, she chose to interpret 
Camus’ existential angst in black and white opti-
cal interplay (Figure 8-19). Interviewed by Lind-
say Ballant in Print magazine, Yentus commented 
about redesigning a series of master works: “They 
have a voice in their own time period, their own 
culture,” she says. “You have to ﬁ nd a way to give 
them a contemporary voice in our culture while 
respecting the past.”
When designing a new edition for a popu-
lar, existing book, several factors must be kept 
in mind:
› Target the audience
› Design a cover that represents the content as 
an enthusiastic and intelligent approach to the 
book’s topic
› Retain some visual equity from the previ-
ous cover (contingent on publisher’s marketing 
objective)
› Make clear to current readers that this edition 
has new subject content and illustrations through 
an updated cover look
› Differentiate the cover from the current 
competition
› Make the author’s name easy to see and read
For a series, often a designer will create a 
template1—a compositional structure with des-
ignated positions for the visual elements. The 
author’s name, book title, and visuals are usu-
ally placed in the same position on each jacket or 
cover, or with only slight variations in position. 
A template unites each individual cover within 
a series so that the viewer can easily identify

European publishing giant RCS manages a large

For Mucca the job required addressing a vast, 
twofold challenge that included extensive brand 
strategy, project planning, and the development of 
unique design solutions: ﬁ rst, to reﬁ ne and improve 
the market position of the premier Rizzoli brand, 
and second, to reinvent and revitalize the lagging 
BUR brand. Beginning with the logos and uniform 
style guides for each imprint, Mucca implemented 
the new brand and art directed well over 800 books 
within the ﬁ rst year. [The result was] a marked 
improvement in overall sales. To further capital-
ize on its newfound momentum, BUR seized the 
opportunity to utilize Mucca’s branding and art 
direction to introduce several new and highly suc-
cessful book collections and print series.

For this heavily illustrated book, The Works: 
Anatomy of a City, by Kate Ascher, Alexander 
Isley says his team “worked with Kate Ascher to 
organize her research material. We initially pre-
pared a rough layout of every page and illustration 
(over 140 in all) so that Kate could write the text 
to correspond to the imagery. We then worked 
with our assembled team of talented designers 
and illustrators and, over the course of six hectic 
months, produced what we consider to be a once-
in-a-lifetime project. (At least that’s what we kept 
telling ourselves as we put yet another late night 
or weekend into the endeavor.)”

magazine into the new format, maintaining the 
basic grid structure—that Armin had previously 
implemented with Michael Bierut at Pentagram 
when they redesigned the magazine in 2006—
while modifying the typographic and visual lan-
guage to reﬂ ect a more sophisticated look.”
To help you identify serial components, 
determine:
› Volume of content
› How much content will change from edition 
to edition
› Sections and sequence
Editor Richard Stengel’s comments about the 
redesign of Time magazine, shown in Figure 8-23, 
offer great insight into the requirements and goals 
of an iconic magazine design, or any magazine for 
that matter:
Every issue of TIME tells a larger story about the 
world we live in, and we wanted to create a design 
that would best present that story. . . .The magazine 
typographers, since it is a magazine written by 
them for them.”
› Identify serial components. Sections or columns 
recur from edition to edition. For example, The 
New York Times offers a weekly Science section 
and a daily Sports section, as well as daily Edito-
rial and Op-Ed pages. In Figure 8-22, you can 
see Creativity magazine’s various sections and 
serial components that had to be considered in 
the redesign. Bryony Gomez-Palacio and Armin 
Vit comment about this on their UnderConsid-
eration blog: “Creativity magazine, a monthly 
publication from Crain Communications, brings 
together information and visuals of the most rel-
evant work in advertising and design from around 
the world. With their May 2008 issue the publica-

it from an oversized 11 × 14.5 inches to a smaller, 
but still commanding 10 × 12 inches and shedding 
its saddle-stitching in favor of perfect binding.

with TIME’s managing editor Richard Stengel

‘DNA.’ We deliberately chose fonts and

Paula Scher, who collaborated on the

insight: “We created a system that we 
thought would resonate with today’s readers. 
It’s full of quick bits and relevant info, but 
still retains the spirit of TIME. We used the 
display typeface Franklin Gothic that was 
part of the history of the magazine, and 
revisited the grid used by Walter Bernard,”

toward smaller trim size, fewer pages, or both. For 
REVERB, a 120-page anthology of sustainability 
(Figure 8-24), “in response to the immediacy of 
the pieces, Tricycle’s in-house design team cre-
ated a book that is itself an experiment in form; 
cut to three sizes including a textbook, a ﬂ ipbook, 
or full-size integrated design, REVERB’s graph-
ics and layouts react and respond to the content 
of the pieces.”
GRID FOR EDITORIAL DESIGN
A grid for a publication provides a system for 
ordering content that can lend both clarity and 
visual interest for the reader and can ease design-
ing and compositing for more than one designer 
and production team, as in Figure 8-23. Once 
you’ve identiﬁ ed the content components, start 
with the format. The trim size (actual size of a 
book page after excess paper has been trimmed 
during production) and proportions of the for-
mat will help you best design the grid. For the 
anatomy and basic grid principles please see 
Chapter 6, Composition.
Many reference books contain sidebars, case 
studies, and projects, which are serial compo-
nents. For each section of Trout and Salmon of 
North America, Charles Nix needed to design an 
overview of the species; a sidebar summarizing 
physical information; and a description of the 
ﬁ sh and its biology, distribution, evaluation, clas-
siﬁ cation, and conservation requirements (Figure 
8-25). Speciﬁ c kinds of nonﬁ ction books require 
planning several components of information on 
a page or spread; for example, in Figure 8-26, a 
cookbook designed by Lowercase Inc., each rec-
ipe requires title, description, ingredients, prepa-
ration method, and image.
There are two basic grid options:
› Modular grid: The main functional beneﬁ t of a 
modular grid is how information can be chunked 
into individual modules or grouped together into 
zones. When designing heavily illustrated con-
tent, a modular grid offers the most ﬂ exibility. 
When designing moderately illustrated content, 
a modular grid can accommodate one column for 
running text (body of writing). Many designers 
believe a modular grid is most ﬂ exible, allowing 
for greater variety.

› Whether you will break the grid and how
› Text to image relationships
As with all graphic design, spontaneous com-
position comes into play even when utilizing a 
grid. For the most part, you can adhere to the grid 
alignment and break the grid to allow for visual 
interest, the importance of the image, for a detail 
that needs to be seen, for example, or to bleed an 
illustration or run an illustration into the gutter. 
It is best to never break the grid arbitrarily, for 
example, bleed an illustration rather than ending 
it in the margin. 
FLOW AND VARIATION
A grid is used to create a cohesive structure as well 
as a visual ﬂ ow across pages, whether it is across 
a spread or throughout the publication. Just as in 
a popular song, where the listener hears parts of 
the song repeated, relying on those components 
for continuity and coherence, so does a reader 
rely on the underlying structure of a publication. 
However, strict adherence to a grid without some 
structural variation and visual cues to alert the 
reader to changes among parts of the publica-
tion would detract from readability. The lack of 
› Column grid: A column grid can be very ﬂ ex-
ible and works well for running text. Depend-
ing upon the size and proportions of the format, 
determine the number of columns and whether 
columns can be combined to accommodate head-
ers and large visuals or divided to accommodate 
captions and smaller visuals. A column grid can 
also be designed with dedicated columns for text 
and large visuals. Columns can be even or uneven 
depending upon content and function.
When making your grid determination, con-
sider the following:
› Column width to ensure readability of running 
text (too long or too short line lengths inhibit 
readability); experiment with type sizes ﬁ tting 
into the column width
› Column width for illustrations
› Margins to accommodate column width, side-
bars (see Figure 8-17, Birds of the World), call-
outs, folio, footnotes
› Gutter measure

variation would become tiresome and not create 
distinction among the component parts.
Cues to content change are important; they can 
be established through color, template, or grid 
variation, or color or typographically. Giving the 
reader distinct signals enhances communication, 
facilitating comprehension. Similarly, creating 
distinction among the publication’s component 
parts facilitates use.
Creating Variation
Designers utilize several methods to create 
variation.
› Syncopation: Employ two or three alternating 
grids.
› Section function: Each section of the publica-
tion has its own grid or the same (ﬂ exible) grid 
is used but zoned differently for each section. 
Alternatively, each section is denoted by color cue 
or type of illustration or the relationship of text 
versus illustration.
› Column reversal: Same grid but the running 
text column and illustration change positions 
from spread to spread.
› Spread reversal: Same grid but the running text 
and illustration change from recto (right-hand 
page) to verso (left-hand page), and vice versa, in 
some syncopated pattern.
DESIGNING STANDARD 
COMPONENTS 
Most publications have standard elements or 
component parts, such as those diagrammed at 
the end of this section. Once you have settled on 
a grid, you need to build a visual and informa-
tion hierarchy to ensure clarity, readability, and 
rhythm. In Figure 8-28, a spread for The New 
York Times Magazine, the right-hand page is a 
full bleed illustration by Christoph Niemann, bal-
anced by the left-hand page where we enter the 
graphic space via the title, “2011.” Then we read 
the subtitle of the article, followed by the author’s 
name, move to the ﬁ rst column, rest at Niemann’s 
name in blue, and ﬁ nally read the second column 
of text. The white spatial intervals between “2011” 
and the subtitle, between Niall Ferguson’s name 
and the columns, and between the end of the sec-
ond text column and Niemann’s name all add to 
balancing and corresponding to the illustration on 
the right-hand page.
Using typography well—headers and subheads 
and display typefaces—you can organize and 
structure large amounts of content into manage-
able “chunked” sections, distinguishing content, 
to clarify and improve readability, as well as aid-
ing visual ﬂ ow and rhythm. Depending upon the 
nature of the content and publication, sound bite

INTERVIEW
What made you realize you wanted to be a cre-
ative professional? 
I’d always been in the arts, tapped into an hon-
ors program at an early age as a ﬁ ne artist. . . . 
This may sound silly but I always loved the fact 
that in rather serious businesses there was often 
a room with a door that had a sign labeled “The 
Art Department.” I wanted to be in there!

What advice would you offer an aspiring art 
director or graphic designer?
I think you always have to remember that you 
are serving a business . . . it’s not enough to make 
something look cool. We always have to deliver in 
content, user-friendliness, and of course style and 
attitude depending on the type of business. Also, 
I’d advise young designers to learn as much about 
the business aspects of your clients or employers 
as it will make you better, faster, and smarter than 
the rest.
Further, the very best work is done when one 
is not self-conscious but focused on becoming 
better as an individual—at anything, whether it’s 
running, singing, or design. Just work through 
those struggles which always seem like barriers 
but are really opportunities.
Where do your ideas come from?
They come from my human experiences. From 
being a living being on the planet right now—in 
our time. They come from my deepest emotions. 
They come from the fact that I am female, and 
they come from my personal beliefs. They come 
from my compassion, my love, my anger, my 
fears, my height, and my age, my hair color, and 
my passions.
Do you go through a specific design process, 
for example, conceptualization, visualization, 
composition? 
Yes, for the most part. But sometimes I see an 
artist’s work and wonder how I can incorporate 
their style and wit into my projects and keep that 
in the front of my brain for a while.
Why did you choose editorial design as your focus?
Well, I’d always been a magazine junkie, 
because of the qualities of escapism, the style, 
the wit, the perfection, and the authority in 
their voices. I learned also that when I started in 
advertising, there was very little room for indi-
viduality and my personal voice. In magazines I 
felt the opposite. There was room for my voice 
and everyone’s who worked there. Also, I loved 
the idea of putting together a product the way a 
theater troupe might put on a show—everyone 
doing their part, lines blurring here and there as 
to territorial rights but working for the best prod-
uct possible. This kind of process enables a quick 
way of dealing with each other, because we are 
so familiar with each other’s communication and 
creative processes. It often creates for personal 
breakthroughs if you push yourself.

color mixed with gray is called a tone or a reduc-
tion of the fully saturated hue.
Color saturation may be selected and adjusted 
for practical function within a composition. A 
saturated color will call attention to itself when 
placed alongside duller tones. A single saturated 
hue on a black-and-white page or computer 
screen will grab one’s attention because it is most 
vivid. In a composition, a saturated hue has an 
advantage of being noticed ﬁ rst when surrounded 
by hues of lower saturation.
TEXTURE
The actual tactile quality of a surface or the simu-
lation or representation of such a surface quality is 
a texture. In the visual arts, there are two catego-
ries of texture: tactile and visual. Tactile textures 
have actual tactile quality and can be physically 
touched and felt; they are also called actual tex-
tures (see Diagram 2-10). There are several print-
ing techniques that can produce tactile textures 
on a printed design, including embossing and 
debossing, stamping, engraving, and letterpress.
Visual textures are those created by hand, 
scanned from actual textures (such as lace), or 
photographed; they are illusions of real textures 
(see Diagram 2-11). Using skills learned in draw-
ing, painting, photography, and various other 
image-making media, a designer can create a 
great variety of textures.
Pattern 
Pattern is a consistent repetition of a single visual 
unit or element within a given area. In all cases, 
there must be systematic repetition with obvious 
directional movement. (An interesting aspect of 
pattern is that the viewer anticipates a sequence.) 
If you examine patterns, you will notice that their 
structures rely on the conﬁ guration of three basic 
building blocks: dots, lines, and grids. In a pat-
tern, any individual small unit, whether nonob-
jective (think organic) or representational (think 
leaf) shape, can be based on the dot or point. Any 
moving path is based on lines, also called stripes.
Any two intersecting units yield a pattern grid.
If we refer back to the common checkerboard 
pattern, we see a ﬁ gure/ground reversal created 
by an allover pattern; that balanced design is 
COLOR
COLOR  AND GRAPHIC DESIGN
• Color can create a focal point (low saturation color amid a fi eld of highly satu-
rated colors, and vice versa).
• Color is often used symbolically.
• Color can have cultural and emotional associations.
• Color can be associated with a brand and be chosen to express a brand’s person-
ality—for example, Coca-Cola™ red or Tiffany™ blue.
• Color juxtaposition can create the illusion of space.
• Color selection should enhance the readability of type.
• Ramped color, or a gradation of color, creates the illusion of movement.
• A color should always be selected in relation to the other colors in the piece.
• There are established color schemes, such as monochromatic schemes, analo-
gous colors, complementary colors, split complementary colors, triadic schemes, 
tetradic schemes, cool palettes, and warm palettes, among others. Color palettes 
are also associated with techniques, historical periods, and art and nature, such 
as batik colors, art deco, Victorian, retro palettes, ancient Chinese ceramic colors, 
and earth tones.
• Grays can be warm or cool.

black and white make gray. Grays are the inter-
val neutral colors between black and white. Black 
and white are separately mixed into paint and ink 
colors to make them darker (shades) or lighter 
(tints). A black and white mixture will also dilute 
the intensity of the hue, as noted in the next sec-
tion on saturation.
Even if black and white seem to be pure, some 
level of hue may still be discernible. A neutral 
black or white can appear “warm” (containing 
red, orange, or yellow) or “cool” (containing blue 
or green). A neutral color will also react to and 
be affected by its placement in a composition. 
Placed next to a hue or among particular hues, 
the pure neutral color will seem to take on the 
hue itself.
In composition, value contrast is most useful for 
purposes of differentiating shapes. Note the value 
contrast of the type (black) and substrate (white 
paper) of the page of words you are now reading. 
The value contrast most clearly differentiates the 
ﬁ gure from the ground. Hue contrasts alone have 
less impact and therefore may not be as effective 
for differentiating between the ﬁ gure and ground 
images or between elements of a single composi-
tion (Diagram 2-09).
Different value relationships produce different 
effects, both visual and emotional. When a nar-
row range of values, which is called low contrast,
is used in a design, it evokes a different emotional 
response from the viewer than a design with a 
wide range of values, or high contrast. The high 
contrast in the poster for Amnesty International 
by Woody Pirtle easily captures one’s attention 
(Figure 2-08). (Other types of contrast will be 
discussed in detail in Chapters 5 and 6.)
Saturation
Saturation refers to the brightness or dullness of a 
color or hue; a hue at its highest level of intensity 
is said to be purely saturated. A saturated color 
has reached its maximum chroma and does not 
contain a neutralizing color (pure black and white 
are without hue) or the mixtures of the neutral 
colors (gray). Mixed with black, white, and espe-
cially gray, the fully saturated hue becomes dull in 
various degrees. The neutral colors dull the inten-
sity or saturation because they dilute the hue. A 
Value
Value refers to the level of luminosity—lightness 
or darkness—of a color, such as light blue or dark 
red. To adjust the value of a hue, two neutral col-
ors are employed: pure black and white.
Black and white are colors (pigment), but they 
are not considered hues. The two are not found 
on the visible spectrum and therefore are consid-
ered achromatic or neutral (without hue).
Black and white have relative value and play an 
important role in mixing color. Black is the dark-
est value and white is the lightest. Mixed together,

b. Write an objectives statement. Defi ne the pur-
pose and function of the problem, the audience 
for the books, and the information to be com-

that describe the work of each writer.
Step 2
a. Name the series.
b. Design a logo for the short story series (see 
Chapter 10).
Step 3
a. Design three book covers—one for each writer 
in your series. Design front covers and spines.
b. The covers must be similar in style and yet 
express the individuality of each writer.
c. The logo must appear on each cover in the 
same position.
d. Produce at least ten sketches for each jacket 
that could be expanded into a series format.
e. Your solution may be purely typographic, visu-
ally driven or type-driven.
f. Think about the various ways the series could 
be tied together:
i. Through the use of similar visuals: illustra-
tions, graphics, photographs, typography
ii. Through the use of a technique: woodcut, 
mezzotint, torn paper, xerography (See 
Chapter 5, Visualization)
Step 4
Refi ne the sketches. Create one set of roughs for 
the series.
Remember: Book covers are very much like post-
ers—they must attract the potential consumer. They 
should have initial impact. Any book cover design 
must compete against other books sitting next to 
it on a shelf.
Step 5
a. Refi ne the roughs and create one comp per 
book.
b. The covers should be 6" × 9", held vertically.
c. You may use black and white or full color.

WHAT IS BR ANDING?
Whether people like it or loathe it, almost every product, service, major city, business, and 
organization has been branded. Steve Liska, Liska + Associates, points out in Designing
Brand Experiences: “When a carefully monitored and consistent experience is factored into 
the strategic success of a coffee company; when millions of dollars can be raised for cancer 
research with a simple yellow rubber wristband; and when symbols can instantly trigger a 
range of emotions based on our perception of what they stand for—you begin to understand 
the power of a brand’s meaning and how it can shape our daily lives.”
Understanding what a brand is and how a branding program operates lays some ground-
work for understanding the roles and objectives of individual graphic design applications, 
such as logos and websites. Many think of a brand as a proprietary name for a product, 
service, or group; however, on a more multifaceted level, a 
brand is the sum total of all characteristics and assets of a 
brand name product, service, or group that differentiates it 
from the competition, as well as the perception of the brand 
by the public. (In this book, the term group is used to denote 
a company, organization, corporation, social cause, issue, 
or political group. For the sake of brevity, all branded enti-
ties—whether a product, service, or group that has beneﬁ ted 
from any type of branding—will be referred to as a brand 
or group or entity.) Typically, several applications are key 
components of an overarching branding effort or program, 
beginning with a logo and visual identity through interac-
tive experiences, package design, corporate communica-
tions, promotional design, and advertising. Although many 
people use the terms visual identity, corporate identity, brand 
identity, and branding interchangeably, branding is a broader 
marketing effort than visual identity since it often involves 
naming, advertising, and promotion. A visual identity is the 
visual and verbal articulation of a brand or group, includ-
ing pertinent key graphic design applications, such as logo, 
letterhead, and business cards, and could include package 
design, uniforms, signage or environmental design, and cor-
porate communications. Before learning to design a logo,

the cornerstone application of any visual identity 
or branding program, let’s start with an overview 
of branding to put logo and identity design into per-
spective. When you study visual identity in the 
next chapter, we will more closely examine how 
to create an identity program.
Branding is the entire development process of 
creating a brand, brand name, and visual identity, 
among other applications. Creating an integrated 
branding program (across media) entails weaving 
a common thread across all of an individual’s expe-
rience with a brand or group, and integrating the 
common visual and verbal language into all expe-
riences with the brand. An integrated branding 
program is the creation of a comprehensive, stra-
tegic, uniﬁ ed, integrated, and unique program for 
a brand, with an eye and mind toward how people 
experience—interact with and use—the brand or 
group. Rather than approaching individual appli-
cations as isolated brand design solutions, it is a 
strategic imperative to see every application—a 
comprehensive brand identity, every appropriate 
graphic design application, and an advertising 
campaign, including traditional, new, and emerg-
ing media—as a contributor to the entire brand-
ing effort and therefore to a person’s experience 
with the brand.
THE PURPOSE 
OF BR ANDING
Due to many convergent factors—new and emerg-
ing media, the economies of nations with rapid 
industrial growth, greater mass production, com-
peting companies manufacturing parity products 
and offering parity services, rise of disposable 
income, desire for new products and better pack-
aging, sustainability (green) issues, and changes 
in the scope and global reach of corporations—
branding, including brand names, logos, visual 
identity design, package design, and advertising, 
has become indispensable to marketing. In an 
overcrowded, competitive marketplace, relevant 
and engaging branding can ensure efﬁ cacy for 
a quality product, service, group, individual, or 
commodity, for example, Chiquita Brands Inter-
national, Inc.—a leading international marketer,

(RED)’s ambition was to harness the power of the world’s greatest companies to eliminate AIDS 
in Africa. To do this it created both a new business model and a new brand model that would 
do three things: deliver a source of sustainable income for the global fund, provide consumers 
with a choice that makes giving effortless, and last but not least generate profi ts and a sense of 
purpose for partner companies.
The fi rst challenge was to get the all-important founding partners on board. So we helped Bobby 
Shriver and his team to paint a vision of what (RED) could be. We built the brand around the 
idea that (RED) inspires, connects, and gives consumers power, with a visual system that unites 
participating businesses by literally embracing their logos to the power (RED).
We continue to work with (RED) on developing partner strategies, inspiring new partners to 
participate, and briefi ng employees and agencies. Within the fi rst fi ve weeks of the U.S. launch, 
the (RED) brand registered 30 percent unaided awareness. (RED) partners delivered $45 million 
to the global fund in one year, more than was received from the private sector in the last fi ve 
years. This is enough money to give 290,000 people life-saving drugs for a year.

content or spirit of the advertising, and the com-
munities and celebrities who adopt the brand as 
part of their lives.
VERBAL AND VISUAL 
DIFFERENTIATORS
Two main verbal differentiators are the brand
name, a proprietary name, and the tagline—a
slogan or short distinctive phrase used to identify 
and promote. The main visual identiﬁ er is a logo, 
the cornerstone of a visual identity. Other graphic 
elements certainly contribute to a visual identity 
or branding program. When brands were ﬁ rst 
introduced, the brand name, logo, and packag-
ing established the brand identity. Now we think 
of branding in more comprehensive integrated 
terms, where the resulting design solutions all 
should be in sync. As Steve Liska states, “A brand 
is not one thing. It is not just a logo or a package. 
It is a complex set of visual, verbal, and experien-
tial cues supported by media messages.”
BR ANDING PROCESS
The design process for branding is
Design
Orientation
Analysis
Concepts
Implementation
The branding process is a complicated one, 
demanding collaboration among marketing, cre-
ative, and IT professionals. Often, a lead brand 
agency hires other expert ﬁ rms (identity, advertis-
ing, interactive, public relations, market research, 
and package design, among others) to help 
develop the brand or execute particular applica-
tions. After what can be extensive research and 
footwork during orientation, strategy is the next 
crucial step during the Analysis phase.
STRATEGY
Brand strategy is the core tactical underpin-
ning of branding, uniting all planning for every 
visual and verbal application. The brand strategy 
deﬁ nes the brand’s personality and promise, dif-
ferentiates the brand from the competition by 
deﬁ ning the brand’s positioning, and codiﬁ es the 
brand essence; it is a conceptual plan providing 
Certainly, factors other than branding contribute 
to a brand’s success, including the quality of its 
product or service, public perception and enthu-
siasm, relevance to people’s lives, the time period 
and culture, and the communities and/or celebri-
ties who adopt it.
DIFFERENTIATION
How many brands of coffee or toothpaste can 
you name? Ten? Twenty? What about automo-
biles? Cell phone carriers? Shoes? Cable chan-
nels? Charities? Museums? When you can easily 
list many brands of any consumer packaged good, 
service category, or nonproﬁ t institution, the 
need for differentiation becomes clear. When 
most goods and services offer the same beneﬁ ts, 
why do you choose one over another? When you 
receive requests for donations to several charities, 
all of which you hold in high regard, why give to 
one over another?
Products, services, commodities, groups (non-
proﬁ t organizations, causes, charities, companies), 
and individuals (musicians, celebrities, politicians, 
among others) depend upon branding to differenti-
ate them in the minds of the public in a glutted 
and highly competitive market. Very few prod-
ucts, services, or groups offer unique beneﬁ ts, 
usually offering similar or identical functions as 
their competitors, a characteristic called parity.
Therefore, branding helps differentiate products, 
services, and groups in a crowded brand world.
Functional and Emotional Beneﬁ ts
A brand or group is the sum total of its func-
tional and emotional assets. Each brand has 
functional beneﬁ ts or capabilities (tangible fea-
tures) that may or may not be unique to a product 
or service category; for example, most toothpaste 
brands contain the functional beneﬁ t of ﬂ uo-
ride, a cavity-prevention ingredient. (For many 
people, quality or functional beneﬁ ts and a brand 
name are inseparable.) Due to its heritage, parent 
company, logo and visual brand identity, envi-
ronmental design, advertising, endorsements, 
and associations, each brand also carries intan-
gible assets—emotional beneﬁ ts. Emotional, as 
well as cultural, associations arise in response to 
the spirit of any brand identity, the emotional

CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
AND THE BRAND CONSTRUCT
Every brand or group should possess a core value 
or quality that can become its construct, a quality 
or position a brand “owns” against the composition 
(as explained in Question 6 of the Sample Design 
Brief in Chapter 4). Owning a quality, even though 
others in your category have the same quality, 
establishes a brand in the audience’s mind as the 
primary possessor of that quality; it is position-
ing of the brand in the public’s mind against the 
competition. The tactic, then, is to “claim” owner-
ship of a beneﬁ t or quality before anyone else does, 
to preempt the competition, and to express that 
construct through the visual and verbal identity. 
For example, although many luxury cars are well 
engineered and perform well in safety and crash 
tests, one brand established its construct as great 
engineering and another brand established its con-
struct as safety. (Can you name them?)
A construct relies heavily on how a brand casts 
itself. Can you think of any brand constructs? 
When you think of Disney, do you think of fun? 
When you think of The Salvation Army, do 
you think of compassion? Do you associate the

a more sophisticated, directed, and 
globally appropriate expression while 
being considerate of the airline’s 
extensive heritage. The Delta symbol 
is further leveraged through a 
dynamic cropped livery treatment 
that speaks to momentum, growth, 
and optimism.

achieve differentiation, relevance, engagement, 
and resonance. (When a design solution does not 
ﬁ t the strategy, the messaging is off brand; when it 
does work with the strategy, the messaging is on
brand.) However, it is the design that makes the 
strategy corporeal, that truly gives brands their 
distinctive look and feel.
Delta Air Lines is the third largest U.S. car-
rier with more than 47,000 employees. To coin-
cide with the airline’s emergence from a Chapter 
11 restructuring, Delta came to Lippincott for a 
strategic reposition, image revitalization, and cus-
tomer experience redesign (Figure 9-04).
During the strategic analysis, some design or 
branding ﬁ rms help determine the brand archi-
tecture—the structuring of brands within the 
company’s offerings (product portfolio). Basic 
brand architecture models include monolithic 
(the company name is used on all products or 
services), endorsed (sub-brands are linked to the 
company by name), and freestanding (each prod-
uct or service is individually branded). When 
the Nickelodeon brand saw the need to evolve, 
it turned to AdamsMorioka (see “Case Study: 
Nickelodeon”).

› A brand or group embodies something: eth-

NAMING A BRAND
Naming a brand involves many crucial consider-
ations. What does the name mean? What type of 
spirit or personality should it convey? How will 
people react to it? What does the name mean in a 
speciﬁ c language across cultures?
As stated earlier, a brand name is the verbal 
identity—a proprietary name—and coupled with a 
tagline or descriptor, it becomes the verbal signa-
ture. Without question, the brand name is the main 
point of reference to any brand and is the main ver-
bal marketing tool. When a Swedish candy store 
chain intended to enter the U.S. market under 
the name “Sweetwave,” Paula Scher, Pentragram 
partner, suggested a name that would play up the 
company’s European origins. The word öola was 
invented (Figure 9-05).
Usually, the name is the one brand element that 
remains unchanged or, at least, in place for a long 
Southern Poverty Law Center with tolerance? 
Would you purchase a Toyota for its reliability? 
Is there an energy drink you think is cool to carry 
around? Do you Bing or Google?
Constructs can be based on heritage, a unique 
functional or emotional beneﬁ t, authenticity, 
originality, earthiness, high-tech expertise, and 
authoritative expertise, among many qualities. 
Several factors must be considered when formu-
lating branding and a brand construct:
› Differentiation: distinguished by a unique, con-
sistent visual and verbal presence
› Ownership: the brand or group “owns” or claims 
an identiﬁ able attribute, a quality, personality, or 
posture preempting the competition from claim-
ing the same
› Consistency: construct used across media, per-
mitting a consistent brand voice and tone in all 
verbal and visual communication
› Relevance: branding is based on an insight into 
the audience and an insight into the brand, mak-
ing the brand relevant
How a construct can be cast:
› A brand or group symbolizes something: hon-
esty, stability, authenticity, style, originality, safety, 
reliability, good health, luxury, prosperity, down-
home goodness, et cetera.

IDENTITY: ÖOLA

• PARTNER/DESIGNER: PAULA SCHER

PHILADELPHIA, NEW YORK, AND 
WASHINGTON, DC
Öola is a chain of Swedish candy 
stores in American shopping malls. 
The company intended to enter 
the U.S. market under the name 
“Sweetwave,” but when Paula Scher 
was commissioned to design their 
retail identity, she expressed a 
concern that the name would not 
be interesting enough to American 
consumers. Scher recommended 
playing up the company’s European 
origins with a new name and a 
bright, clean graphic look.
The word öola was invented and 
became the basis for the stores’ 
entire visual identity. Öola was 
chosen for its Scandinavian sound, 
geometric letterforms, and the 
umlaut, which has become a central 
motif in graphic applications.

The Nickelodeon brand had grown and diversi-
ﬁ ed over its history. Not atypically, the brand did 
not have a speciﬁ c long-term overview, but had 
grown organically. While the success of Nickel-
odeon had turned it into one of the world’s leading 
children’s entertainment companies, it now faced 
the danger of dilution as various business ven-
tures and divisions moved further apart in mes-
sage. The audience was shifting demographically 
and psychographically. And, over time, employee 
defections to the competition had enabled oth-
ers to emulate and co-opt Nickelodeon’s equity. 
Knowing there was a potential problem in the 
future, Nickelodeon approached AdamsMorioka 
with the assignment to determine the assignment. 
Often, companies don’t turn to a communications 
ﬁ rm until revenue is decreasing, or audience share 
has shifted negatively. In this instance, Nickel-
odeon was exceptionally successful, seeing only 
increased revenue, ratings, and diversiﬁ cation. 
Rather than settling for this, waiting for a down-
turn, Nickelodeon saw the need to evolve.
AdamsMorioka approached the issue with a far-
reaching discovery phase. Working with internal 
and external audiences, they mapped a process and 
set of deliverables to maintain and increase Nickel-
odeon’s success, while planning for expansion. After 
the discovery phase, AdamsMorioka interfaced 
with all components of the brand and returned 
with new brand architecture and an execution
plan. This new structure allowed each division’s 
culture to expand, while reinforcing the primary 
set of promises and message of Nickelodeon.
A reface of the on- and off-air visual system 
followed, putting the ﬁ ndings and architecture 
into real time. The visuals are based on the idea 
of “kid modernism.” Opposing the standard visu-
als in children’s entertainment—complex layers, 
multiple typefaces, lots of purple and green—the 
Nickelodeon system approaches from the oppo-
site side. The system is reductive; creating a focus 
on the brand and its product, with characters like 
SpongeBob SquarePants and other properties. 
There are no extraneous shapes, colors, or images. 
The message is simple, clear, and direct. This is 
not about collage, but ideas and narrative. The 
system is utilized in all media, print, advertising, 
online, and on-air. This provides a proprietary 
visual for Nickelodeon, separating the “voice of 
Nick” from other advertising, and reducing the 
pace of children’s television.
Success for all companies is a result of multiple 
factors including product, distribution, program-
ming, and human resources. Strategy and design

play parts of this role. It is disingenuous to por-
tray strategy and design as the only activator of 
that success. Following implementation and dis-
semination, however, Nickelodeon had its high-
est proﬁ t the following year. Programming blocks 
were created to reach new audiences such as 
tweens; with new brand extensions and activities 
implemented, the existing product was fortiﬁ ed.
NICK JR.
Nick Jr. is the arm of Nickelodeon that communi-
cates with preschool children. As Nick Jr. became 
more successful, both ﬁ nancially and critically, it 
became apparent that it should be treated as its 
own brand and given a clear proprietary look. The 
brand message includes the need for Nick Jr. to be 
a safe place for two- to ﬁ ve-year-olds with a pri-
ority of education and entertainment value. The 
visual system addresses the strategic needs of com-
munication on two levels, talking to children and 
parents simultaneously. Parenting messages use 
iconography to explain the beneﬁ ts of each televi-
sion program. Children’s messaging addresses the 
limited reading capability of this age group and 
show character recognition. Characters like Dora 
the Explorer and Blue from Blue’s Clues are used to 
communicate messages from the network.
NICK AT NITE
Nick at Nite’s strength was its rich programming. 
Comprised of sitcoms including I Love Lucy, The 
Brady Bunch, and Three’s Company, the network is 
made of images and icons that make up our culture. 
AdamsMorioka designed a graphic system begin-
ning with the idea of “less color, more content” and 
is designed to “get out of the way.” The black and 
white color palette allows a wide variety of pro-
gramming with different visual qualities to live 
together. The simplicity of the program stands in 
stark contrast to traditional television graphics and 
provides a proprietary attitude to Nick at Nite.

and any other visual elements). The brand look 
and feel is a visual “attitude” that differentiates a 
brand from the competition, making it unique, 
distinctive, memorable, and relevant to its audi-
ence. It should deﬁ ne its individual character, be 
synonymous with the brand, not be in any way 
generic, and deﬁ nitely not look like its competi-
tors. For example, when Keith McNally decided 
to open a large, classical French brasserie and 
bakery—in a part of east SoHo that most people 
simply avoided—he asked Mucca Design to col-
laborate in the design and development of an 
extensive and fully integrated identity that would 
deﬁ ne the restaurant’s traditional feel with a sense 
of freshness, romance, and attention to period 
details (see “Case Study: Balthazar”).
Brand Promise 
The brand promise—essentially what the brand 
claims it will or can do, expressed through the 
identity and advertising—has always been an 
important part of what makes a brand desirable. 
Dating back to one of the ﬁ rst American brands, 
Uneeda biscuit, the National Biscuit Company 
created brand promise when it offered consumers 
an “inner-seal package,” promising sanitary pack-
aging and fresh, crisp crackers.
There is the actuality of a brand, and then there 
is the audience’s perception of it. It is important 
to understand this component in design devel-
opment. How an individual perceives a brand 
depends upon several factors:
› Whether a brand delivers on the brand promise
› The individual’s response to the brand identity 
and advertising
› The experience of the brand on the website 
and at other touchpoints
› Brand placement and positioning in ﬁ lms, tele-
vision programs, and sports events
› Celebrity endorsers and users (paid and 
unsolicited)
› Testimonials
› The public image and behavior of the company 
or group
› Any public relations crisis, incident, or scandal 
involving the brand
› Each separate experience a user has with the 
brand
for the sky’s brightest star), Nintendo, Vanguard, 
and Apple Computers.
› Acronym: a brand name formed from the ini-
tials or other parts of several names or words; for 
example, GE for General Electric, BMW for 
Bayerische Motoren Werke, KFC for Kentucky 
Fried Chicken, IBM for International Business 
Machines, and BP for Beyond Petroleum.
Name Efﬁ cacy
There are many ways to make a brand name 
effective.
› Distinction: a name that characterizes, dis-
tinguishes, and differentiates the brand among
its competitors.
› Memorable: a name should be worth remember-
ing and sufﬁ ciently engaging. Most say a brand 
name should be easy to pronounce and spell; how-
ever, one could make a case for interest over ease.
› Purposeful: a brand name can be meaningful, 
adding signiﬁ cance, purpose, or cachet to a prod-
uct, service, or group. A brand name should com-
municate the personality of the brand and address 
its target audience.
› Extendable: a name should be capable of grow-
ing and changing with the company and possible 
brand extensions.
› Long-lasting: a name that endures will be viable 
for a long time.
› Legally owned: the name or domain should 
be available to be legally registered, owned, and 
trademarked. It should not legally infringe on any 
other trademarked name.
DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
Based on the strategy, name, and construct, visu-
alization and composition begins during design 
development. You will need to consider brand 
differentiation, brand promise, and branding 
applications and media.
Differentiation through Look and Feel
As part of the design solution, a brand’s unique 
personality is established and communicated 
through its “look and feel,” expressed through 
the particulars of the visualization and composi-
tion (including color palette; characteristics and 
qualities of lines, shapes, and textures; typeface; 

Keith McNally, the man behind Café Luxembourg, 
Odeon, Nell’s, Lucky Strike, Pravda, Schiller’s, 
and Pastis, is one of New York’s most successful 
restaurateurs; he is a truly inspired and inspiring 
visionary, and one of Mucca’s favorite clients.
As with most of the projects we’ve undertaken 
with McNally, the process of creating Balthazar 
Restaurant was deeply involved and truly col-
laborative. It was immediately apparent to the 
Mucca team that the Balthazar identity had to 
communicate McNally’s obsession with quality 
and detailed authenticity. From the logos and sig-
nage to menus and matchboxes to packaging and 
delivery vans, every part of the Balthazar brand 
was designed and orchestrated to give it the feel 
of a place that had evolved over generations to 
become the familiar institution that it is now.
Mucca Typo created the Decora Typeface 
(based on vintage Victorian examples) speciﬁ cally 
for Balthazar packaging, and gathered dozens of 
other fonts and faces to support it. Elements of 
the brand identity are leveraged throughout the 
restaurant and have become widely recognizable 
symbols of quality and luxury.
With the overwhelming growth of Balthazar’s 
popularity came several extensions of the brand, 
including Balthazar Bakery and its wholesale divi-
sion, as well as its popular gift items and famous 
cookbook, all of them designed by the Mucca 
team. Though they share deﬁ ning characteristics, 
each new division or extension of the central Bal-
thazar brand was given an individual identity with 
its own color scheme and typographical system in 
order to clarify the unique brand proposition.
Balthazar is now one of New York’s most pop-
ular restaurants. Widely recognized as an insti-
tutional landmark and credited with sparking 
the revitalization of several city blocks in lower 
Manhattan, the McNally ﬂ agship is also highly 
regarded as a singularly successful and multifac-
eted luxury brand.

can vary, depending upon factors such as project 
scope; budget; and type of product, service, or 
group. In Figure 9-07, the branding involved sev-

and sponsorships. It is important to identify the 
media that will be most focused and powerful in 
carrying the brand message to the public and in 
inﬂ uencing the target audience’s brand percep-
tions. Every contact point that offers a positive 
experience for the audience strengthens the audi-
ence’s brand perception; therefore consistency is 
key in how the Muzak brand, for example, is uti-
lized across applications (Figure 9-08). For exam-
ple, when Duffy & Partners designed the branding 
system for The Islands of the Bahamas, they cre-
ated an entire brand language that is “endlessly 
adaptable—in signage, online communication, 
ads, merchandise, and iconography.” (See “Case 
Study: The Islands of the Bahamas.”)
REBRANDING
Often, designers are faced with the challenge of 
rebranding an existing brand identity or brand 
program for a variety of reasons. Duties might in-
clude reinventing a brand, repositioning, renam-
ing, redesigning, or all of these (covered more 
fully in the next chapter on visual identity). For 
example, Landor advised Federal Express that the 
name FedEx conveyed a greater sense of speed,

In his autobiography, Songs My Mother Taught 
Me, actor Marlon Brando wrote that he didn’t 
ask for “power and inﬂ uence”—people bestowed 
it upon him. Audiences decide whom they like 
and which brands they like as well. Ultimately, 
it is the public who decides which brands are 
stars. It is the opinion (reviews, ratings, pur-
chases) and perception (blogs, sites, and videos 
that go viral) of the audience that can make or 
break a brand.
There are other contributing factors to brand

WEBSITE: THE ISLANDS 
OF THE BAHAMAS
PROCESS & SKETCHES: THE 
ISLANDS OF THE BAHAMAS
• DUFFY & PARTNERS, MINNEAPOLIS
BACKGROUND
It was late 2001, just after the travel and tourism 
industry had witnessed its most crippling down-
turn in history—9/11. The Ministry of Tourism 
of The Islands of the Bahamas was looking for 
a new partner to help it rebrand its country and 
present its unique tourism product to the world.
Many choices and much clutter lead to cat-
egory fragmentation at best and a sea of sameness 
at worst. No one stood out. Nothing seemed dif-
ferent. The Bahamas was signiﬁ cantly outspent 
by many of its competitors.
CHALLENGE
“We want people to look at the Bahamas again 
and again.”
—Vincent Vanderpool-Wallace
Former Director General, Ministry of Tourism, 
The Islands of the Bahamas
It was our self-described objective to “create 
branded desire for the Bahamas.” Differentiate 
the nation as the preferred sun and sand vaca-
tion destination. Celebrate the many offerings of 
a multiplicity of islands. Provide a branding sys-
tem that would be used by one and all alike—the 
country, many individual islands, and numerous 
private and public sector entities. And ultimately 
revitalize an economy that depends on over 60 
percent of its GNP from tourism.
THE DESIGN EXPLORATION
We immersed ourselves in the culture and learned 
that the beautiful island nation offered myriad 
experiences for any travel desire. We were struck 
by the sights and the sounds, the shapes and col-
ors, the ﬂ ora and fauna. We started to use those 
elements to begin to deﬁ ne possible solutions in 
our visual brief collage board.
Duffy & Partners concluded that the Bahamas 
needed an entirely new brand identity, one that not 
only made the country stand apart, but also was 
ﬂ exible for many different constituencies to use.
We quickly landed upon the concept of design-
ing a stylized map of the Bahamas—an identity sys-
tem to highlight each of the fourteen major tourist 
destinations and their many unique offerings. This 
set in motion an entire brand language that is end-
lessly adaptable—in signage, online communica-
tion, ads, merchandise, and iconography.
RESULTS
• The new branding initiative was unanimously 
embraced by The Ministry of Tourism and its 

BR A N D I N G

private sector partners to become the single 
rallying point for the country.
• Quantitative research in the United States, 
Europe, and the Bahamas showed double-digit 
increases in critical brand attributes such as 
communicating that the Bahamas is a chain 
of islands with many friendly, vibrant, and 
novel experiences.
• Efforts that emanated from this new brand 
presentation have consistently driven increased 
visits and increased tourism revenue in the 
double digits since its introduction in 2002.
• Visitor satisfaction scores have consistently 
increased and intent to return and recommend 
the Bahamas are at historic highs.

for Americana inspired the branded line of mer-
chandise, which comprised videos, soundtracks,

“Overlooking Seattle’s beautiful Elliott Bay, 
Cascade and Olympic mountain ranges, and 
the city’s magniﬁ cent skyline is where Hornall 
Anderson delivered on the Space Needle’s tagline 
of ‘Live the View!’ positioning, by creating a guest 
experience unlike those typically found at view-
oriented tourist attractions.” Hornall Anderson 
further explains their work shown in Figure 9-11: 
“Interactive designers and technicians built a 
series of intuitive, highly user-friendly kiosks that 
extend the 360-degree view, not just visually, but 
experientially, as people learn about the many 
treasures of the Emerald City. The branded expe-
rience is called SkyQ.
“The Experiential Branding™ system is im-
mersive, engaging, and leaves an indelible mark 
perceive the brand as delivering or not delivering 
on its brand promise; and if they deem it to not 
be delivering, they will voice their opinions and 
move on to another brand.
BRANDING AN EXPERIENCE
At every point of contact, a person experiences 
a brand or group—whether it’s through contact 
with packaging, customer relations, a branded line 
of merchandise, an interactive kiosk, an exhibit, a 
website, or an event. Every experience, whether 
from one point of contact or from many points 
of contact of an integrated campaign, should be a 
positive and consistent one.

series for maximum exposure so that it can be

EVENT BRANDING 
Most branding programs are intended to endure. 
However, there are branding programs created for 
events and ﬁ lms that are shorter lived. Most major 
motion pictures are heavily branded, with websites, 
TV commercials, posters, and screen-based media 
utilized. However, once the ﬁ lm has left the the-
aters, the branding program is no longer necessary 
(until DVD release or for award nominations). 
Similarly, special events such as conferences, gala 
beneﬁ ts, marketing events and parties, tradeshows, 
and award events, among others, are also branded.
The London Design Festival, the umbrella 
organization that promotes the annual season of 
design-related events in London each September, 
commissioned Domenic Lippa of Pentagram, 
with senior designer Paul Skerm and design assis-
tant Ali Esen, to design the identity and every 
element of the festival’s citywide graphic pres-
ence including brochures, signage, guidebooks,

At the View kiosk high-defi nition cameras controlled by visitors enable them to zoom in on 
various points of interest and learn about what they’re seeing from presentations delivered in 
multiple media formats. Interactive maps, meanwhile, fl ank the View station, offering touch-
screen capabilities linked to live video, produced movies, still images, and text factoids about 
Seattle landmarks. The viewing experience is further enhanced by aural content delivered 
through holophonic audio spotlight speakers.
From there, visitors might choose to move to the Vignette kiosk, where they can gather 
authentic local perspectives about Seattle destinations, which are delivered by local residents. 
The 20–40 second segments are shot in high-def, and also include still images complemented 
by directional audio.
Or, people can move to the Reveal kiosk and interface with motion-sensitive screens that 
serve up factoids and illustrated 360-degree views of the city from directly beneath the O-deck. 
Factoids on such popular destinations as the Pike Place Market, the Seattle Aquarium, Mount 
Rainier and others pop up when the user clicks on a touch-screen button mounted over fi ve 
30" LCD panels showing the Seattle skyline.
Arguably, the most dramatic visuals in the entire experience may reside at the Time-
Lapse kiosk. Four 30" LCD panels display a 360-degree, digitally stitched panoramic view of 
the Seattle skyline shot from the roof of the Space Needle. These are taken in one-minute 
increments over a twenty-four-hour period. A single knob guides the experience, allowing for 
forward or backward travel throughout the day. The control also allows for panning the view 
across the assembled screens to get the full interactive effect.

EXERCISE 9-1
INVENTING A NAME
➊ Choose a product or service and invent a brand 
name for it.
➋ The name should be appropriate and communi-
cate the brand’s personality.
➌ The name should be memorable.
➍ The name could convey the brand’s or group’s 
functional benefi t. Functional benefi ts are the 
practical or useful characteristics of a product 
or service that aid in distinguishing a brand from 
its competition, such as nutritional, economical, 
or convenient advantages.
➎ The name should have a long life span.
➏ If the company is international, the name should 
refl ect its global status.
➐ If the brand is international, the name should 
work for each country in which it is sold.

PICTURE
AN INSURANCE COMPANY. WHAT COMES 
TO MIND? YOU MIGHT THINK OF A HUGE OFFICE SPACE WITH PEOPLE IN 
CUBICLES WORKING ON COMPUTERS, TALKING ON PHONES, AND PARTICI-
PATING IN MEETINGS. NOW, LET’S TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER—WHAT IS THE 
DIFFERENCE IN HOW YOU IMAGINE FIVE DIFFERENT INSURANCE COMPANIES? 
ON THE SURFACE, MOST COMPANIES SEEM LIKE FACELESS, VAST CORPO-
RATE ENTITIES, WITHOUT MUCH TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM ONE ANOTHER. 
WITHOUT A VISUAL IDENTITY, LOGO, OR ICON, ALMOST ANY COMPANY OR 
ORGANIZATION WOULD SEEM A GENERIC GROUP.
VISUAL IDENTITY: WHAT IS ITS PURPOSE?
The basic purpose of visual identity is the same as a branding program—to identify, differen-
tiate, and build a sustainable presence and position in the marketplace, as well as to engender 
trust in the brand or group.
DEFINITION OF VISUAL IDENTITY
In today’s competitive worldwide marketplace, with so many different brands in each prod-
uct and service category, it is a business imperative for each brand’s identity to communicate 
clearly and consistently. Similarly, any organization or social cause requires an interesting and 
coherent visual identity. A visual identity is the visual and verbal articulation of a brand or 
group, including all pertinent design applications, such as the logo, letterhead, business card, 
and website, among other applications; also called brand identity, branding, and corporate 
identity. Figure 10-01 shows the straightforward visual identiﬁ er that Crosby Associates cre-
ated for Edward Jones based on a simpliﬁ ed company name.
The keystone of any visual identity is a logo, a unique identifying symbol. Every time a 
viewer sees a logo for a brand, group, or social cause, that viewer should be able to imme-
diately recognize and identify the entity it represents. A logo can carry enormous value for 
a brand, social cause, or company. Simply think of famous brands or groups and their logos 
should pop into your mind, such as the 3M logo (see Figure 10-05). As Milton Glaser states, 
“A logo is the point of entry to the brand.”
Kinds of Visual Identity or Branding Projects
› New company, product, service, or group
› Name change
› Revitalization to stay relevant: redesign of an existing visual identity to have bearing in 
the marketplace
› Revitalization to ensure continued success (see “Case Study: Nickelodeon” in Chapter 9)
› Reposition: redesign of an existing logo to redeﬁ ne an existing brand, aiming at a different 
audience, or to reposition the brand for a new audience

› Merger of two brands or groups: newly designed 
logo to represent the merger and accrued equity 
of companies or groups who discard their previ-
ous logos
› Integrated media program to establish consis-
tency across applications and media
GOALS OF AN IDENTITY
Ideally, a visual identity communicates meaning, 
adds value, is relevant to its target audience, and 
should be
› Recognizable: The shapes and forms are identi-
ﬁ able and decipherable.
› Memorable: The shapes, forms, and colors are 
sufﬁ ciently coherent, interesting, and unusual.
› Distinctive: The name, shapes, forms, and col-
ors are uniquely characteristic to that entity and 
differentiate it from the competition.
› Sustainable: The name, shapes, forms, and colors 
would endure, be relevant for a period of years.
› Flexible / Extendible: The name, shapes, forms, 
and colors are ﬂ exible to work across media, to 
grow with the entity’s new services, and to adapt 
to brand extensions and sub-brands.

Edward Jones is the leading 
investment resource for individuals. 
But a cumbersome name Edward 
D. Jones & Co. was confused with 
competing fi rms, a problem that was 
further compounded by the lack of 
a recognizable visual identifi er.
Crosby Associates’ solution was a 
comprehensive program built upon 
a simplifi ed name Edward Jones and 
an equally simple visual identifi er.
The signage program for Edward 
Jones had to be distinctive, cost-
effective, and suitable across a 
wide range of facilities, from the 
fi rm’s upscale urban offi ce buildings 
to its more than 4,000 local offi ces, 
many of which are in storefronts 
and converted residences. The 
solution was a dramatically 
simple system of standard sign 
types and sizes, together with 
the establishment of a single, on-
demand sign manufacturing and 
installation resource.

DESIGNING VISUAL 
IDENTITY
As with any design project, the standard process 
for designing visual identity is shown here:
Design
Orientation
Analysis
Concepts
Implementation
Depending upon the nature of the ﬁ rm assigned 
to the visual identity project, they may be involved 
in market research, a brand audit, a competitive 
audit, setting or clarifying existing strategy, and 
naming. After orientation and analysis, concep-
tual design begins and is based on the strategy set 
forth in the brief (for more information on design 
briefs, see the section on the logo design process 
in this chapter and Chapter 4).
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
The design concept is conceived with a brand’s 
or group’s core value/quality and signiﬁ cance 
(as manifested in a brand construct, a quality 
or position a brand “owns” against the competi-
tion), visually communicated through its logo

and visual identity. A logo tells a focused visual 
story—meaning is distilled and then compressed 
into a unit—for example, Wolff Olins created a 
visual identity that expresses “vitality” for Uni-
lever (Figure 10-02).
Designers and their clients assign meaning 
to logos. Today, the public “owns” brands and 
groups—reviewing them, blogging about them, 
even helping to build a logo’s meaning. It is the 
public who interprets and accepts (or rejects) what 
it signiﬁ es. A visual identity system or a brand-
ing program, and other applications and efforts, 
support the assignment of meaning in order to 
build consensus. Of course, meaning evolves, 
sometimes naturally with age, with changes in the 
marketplace, or with revitalizations.

As always, you are looking for an insight that 
will generate a design concept and will drive 
your design. For example, in Figure 10-03, Sub-
stance151 developed a brand image for Baltimore 
Bioneers by identifying what they are chieﬂ y 
about: “creating a sustainable world, being better 
neighbors to other species, healing human com-
munities, and sending a message of hope to the 
future generations.”
Designing a visual identity begins with the logo, 
which we will explore a bit later in this chapter. 
Basic key graphic elements for identity design are 
color, type, and imagery, which will be discussed 
in logo design. The font, shape, and forms of the 
logo, visual characteristics of the logo, and color 
palette will set the framework for the entire visual 
identity. For The Time Hotel, a hotel located in 
Manhattan’s Times Square with small rooms each 
in a primary color of red, yellow, or blue, Mirko 
Ilic´ positioned the square in the “H” as a reference 
to Times Square, and the small red hotel room 
inside the “H” as the international symbol for 
hotel (Figure 10-04). All the other applications 
for the identity followed from there.
CREATING COHERENCE 
ACROSS A VISUAL IDENTITY 
OR BRANDING PROGRAM
A program of strategic, uniﬁ ed, and integrated 
solutions for a brand or group, including every 
graphic design and advertising application for 
that brand, results in harmonious brand expe-
riences for its audience. A brand experience is 
an individual audience member’s experience 
as he or she interacts with a brand—at every

All points of contact with the 3M 
brand—advertising, literature, 
packaging, websites, tradeshows 
and even vehicles—use this 
identity system. The result is a 
recognizable design that focuses 
on brand messages and images 
to communicate value. The new 
3M identity was launched globally 
and is used throughout the world 
by 3M communicators and creative 
suppliers adapting the message 
by language, culture, market 
and customer.

touchpoint. A uniﬁ ed brand experience was the 
goal of the 3M identity (Figure 10-05). “3M is 
a global diver siﬁ ed technology company operat-
ing in more than 60 countries. Historically, the 
3M brand identity varied by country and mar-
ket. Visually, beyond the 3M logo, there was not 
much to strongly connect the company’s market-
ing efforts,” the 3M design staff explains. “3M 
sought a way to maximize marketing resources 
and strengthen brand recognition by establishing 
one company-wide identity—providing one face 
and one voice to customers globally.”

without a consistent expression,” explains Abbott 
Miller. “The primary goal of the new identity was 
to provide a deﬁ nitive graphic signature for the 
MICA acronym, as the institution fully embraces 
the moniker. And perhaps most importantly, it 
will provide MICA with a clear graphic expres-
sion on the national and international stage of
its activities.”
Considerations for establishing visual and ver-
bal coherence are as follows.
› Strategy: All agencies, studios, and designers 
as well as other creative professionals working on 
brand applications should follow the same master 
brief and strategy in order to create solutions that 
are coherent and harmonious. All graphic design 
solutions should be consistent with the strategy 
and values and have a similar brand voice.
› Look and Feel: The brand look and feel is a 
visual “attitude” functioning to create unique 
visual interest and differentiate a brand from the 
competition, expressed through the particulars 
of the visualization and composition (including

CONTEMPORARY ARTS
“MICA is a great art school with a 
rich history and an exciting future,” 
says Miller. “Our new identity 
refl ects the patina of that history 
with solid historical letterforms that 
are played off against a modern 
linear framework. This mix of old 
and new is a direct reference to 
the school’s two major buildings, 
the Main Building and the Brown 
Center—one very new and one very 
old—that ‘talk’ to each other across 
the main street of the campus.” 
In fact, it was the rhythmic lines 
of the Main Building’s Beaux-Art 
facade that inspired the rules that 
separate the letters of the new 
mark, while the last, angled rule 
references the slanted glass prows 
of the contemporary Brown Center. 
Campus buildings also inspired the 
colors used in the new identity: 
oxidized green of the historic 
copper railings and architectural 
details, and brown and slate, the 
colors of the buildings’ stone 
and brick.

2007/04/new-work-mica.php
“The process was to identify existing best prac-
tices based on the thousands of communications 
tactics created globally and isolate a style and lay-
out that was contemporary, effective and could 
be replicated across the company and around 
the world. The solution became a design system 
that began with a white background and applied 
a horizontal montage with a powerful message 
anchored to it. The montage can vary in color and 
structure but always contains images of people, 
product and pattern to bring the montage mes-
sage to life.”
Creating coherence entails weaving a common 
thread or voice—seeming like one voice, across 
all of an individual’s experiences with a brand—to 
integrate the common visual and verbal language 
into all experiences with the brand. It includes 
the coordination or harmonization of all the ele-
ments of a visual identity throughout all experi-
ences, as in Figure 10-06, identity and signage by 
Abbott Miller/Pentagram for MICA. “The acro-
nym has made its way into many publications, but

color palette; characteristics and qualities of lines, 
shapes, and textures; typeface(s); images; and any 
other visual elements).
› Clarity: Since the primary purpose of graphic 
design is to communicate a message to an audi-
ence, creating clarity is one main goal of visual 
identity design. Clarity aids communication. All 
language—names, descriptors, taglines, headlines, 
titles—should be written with clarity of message 
in mind.
For visual/verbal coherence (see “Sidebar:
Identity Coherence”), common components 
across brand applications are:
› Strategy
› Logo
› Tagline
› Look and feel
› Color or color palette
› Typeface(s)
› Abbreviations and titles
› Signature
› Tone of voice
› Attitude of imagery and copy
› Descriptive writing
Identity Standards
Graphic designers create standards for the use 
of identity design and logo on all applications to 
ensure consistency and logo recognition across 
media. Consistent use guarantees immediate rec-
ognition in a cluttered commercial environment 
and ensures integrity of meaning (see “Sidebar: 
Identity Usage Guidelines”). An identity stan-
dards manual, also called a graphic standards 
manual, sets up guidelines for how the logo is 
to be applied to numerous applications—from 
business cards to point-of-purchase materials to 
vehicles to websites. Color palette, area of isola-
tion (the ideal amount of space surrounding the 
logo), brand signatures, and placement are all part 
of the speciﬁ cations. The manual also provides a 
range of possibilities and guidelines for the use of 
typefaces in various combinations and in various 
applications—print, digital, and environmental—
as well as guidelines on choosing weights, size, 
numerals, symbols, bullets, and the use of small 
caps—for both print and electronic applications.

IDENTITY COHERENCE: FOUR KEYS 
TO DESIGNING CONNECTIONS
• Color: recognition and brand equity can be built through color.
• Logo: a well-designed logo identifi es, unites a company’s offerings, builds equity, 
and confers authenticity.
• Type: a unique and proprietary typeface builds equity with or without the logo.
• Shape: shape characteristics used in the logo and typeface and/or the shape of 
packaging build visual equity.
IDENTITY
IDENTITY  USAGE GUIDELINES
1/ Handle logo with care and consistency.
• A logo is one of the most important identity assets.
• Do not scan a logo or recreate it. Do not type the letterforms.
• Do not stretch the logo or modify it in any way.
• Do not use the logo in conjunction with any other symbol or shape or enclose it 
in any shape.
• Do not use the logo in a sentence or catchphrase.
2/ Use specifi ed colors only.
3/ Position it on applications as per specifi cations in the identity manual. Consis-
tent placement in and across layouts adds recognition.
4/ Separate the logo or signature from all other text and visuals using the specifi ed 
area of isolation.
5/ Use specifi ed typeface(s) and cases. Use only the typeface(s) designated by the 
identity manual. Usually, there are designations for primary and secondary typefaces, 
as well as alternative faces; follow type specifi cations for web text.
6/ Use specifi ed signatures to link the logo or signature to descriptors, taglines, 
product name, title, or core attribute.
7/ Limit the number of times a logo appears on any one surface (to one).
8/ To protect a trademark, correctly utilize symbols: ™ and ®.

the logo need to refer to the standards manual. 
Maintaining standards helps guard, maintain, 
and build brand equity, as Figure 10-07 and Fig-
ure 10-08 illustrate.
WHAT IS A LOGO?
A logo is the single graphic design application that 
will be a part of every other brand design application. 
It is the signiﬁ er. It is the identiﬁ er. It is the two-
second “label” or alarm screaming out which brand 
or company or person or entity you are dealing 
with. It carries enormous weight and signiﬁ cance 
and is the keystone of any graphic design plan.
A logo is a unique identifying symbol. Stem-
ming from the word logotype, “logo” is the most 
commonly accepted term; it is also called a sym-
bol, mark, brandmark, identiﬁ er, logotype, or 
trademark. Providing immediate recognition, a 
logo represents and embodies everything a brand, 
group, or individual signiﬁ es. (See “Case Study: 
Saks Fifth Avenue.”) Most often, a logo is part 
of a broader identity design project. (Again, many 
use the terms visual identity, brand identity, and 
branding interchangeably.)
With one glance, the average person should be 
able to recognize and assess a brand or group by 
looking at its logo. If you shop for athletic foot-
wear, you need only see the logo to know a lot 
about the shoe—who manufactures it, the quality, 
the price range, and perhaps even which athletes 
endorse that brand. Many logos, such as Nike™ 
and Puma™, are instantly recognizable. Not only 
does the logo serve as a label, it also conveys a mes-
sage about the brand’s image and quality, one that 
is reinforced through marketing, packaging, adver-
tising, the communities who adopt it, customer 
relations management, and product performance.
As with an entire visual identity, there are vari-
ous purposes for logo projects:
› Logo for a new entity
› Redesign of an existing logo for revital-
ization, to stay relevant in the marketplace
(Fig ure 10-09)
› Redesign of an existing logo to redeﬁ ne an 
existing brand, aiming at a different audience, or 
to reposition the brand for a new audience
› Logo for a merger of two brands or groups

LOGO CATEGORIES
A logo can take various forms and combinations; 
it can be a wordmark, lettermark, symbol mark, 
combination mark, or emblem.
› Logotype (also called wordmark): the name 
is spelled out in unique typography or lettering 
(Figures 10-10 through 10-14).
› Lettermark: the logo is created using the ini-
tials of the brand name (Figures 10-15 through 
10-18).
› Symbol: a pictorial, abstract, or nonrepresen-
tational visual.
› Pictorial symbol: a representational image, resem-
bling or referring to an identiﬁ able person, place, 
activity, or object (Figures 10-19 through 10-21).
› Abstract symbol: a simple or complex rear-
rangement, alteration, or distortion of the repre-
sentation of natural appearance, used for stylis-
tic distinction and/or communication purposes
(Figures 10-22 through 10-25).
› Nonrepresentational or nonobjective sym-
bol: purely invented and not derived from any-
thing visually perceived; it does not relate to any 
object in nature. It does not literally represent a 
person, place, or thing (Figures 10-26 through 
10-29).
› Character icon: a character trademark that 
embodies the personality of a brand, cause, or 
group, such as The Maytag Repairman™ (May-
tag washers and dryers), Energizer Bunny™ 
(Eveready Energizer batteries), Aﬂ ac Duck™ 
(Aﬂ ac Insurance), Rosie the Riveter (recruitment 
of women into the workforce during WWII) 
(Figure 10-30), and Smokey the Bear™ (ﬁ re pre-
vention). One of the purposes of character icons, 
such as Pillsbury’s Doughboy™ or Miss Chiquita 
Worldwide Personality™ (see Figure 9-01) is to 
create a “face” for a product, service, or group.
› Combination mark: a combination of words 
and symbols (Figures 10-31 through 10-37).
› Emblem: a combination of words and visu-
als that are always seen together, never separated 
(Figures 10-38 through 10-45).

The American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) 
experienced substantial growth during the 
last decade. While it had historic brand 
equity, Crosby Associates was engaged by 
this association of designers and branding 
professionals to strengthen its logo and develop 
identity guidelines which would assure visual 
consistency when many independent designers 
were creating materials that personifi ed the 
brand. The result was a quantum increase in 
awareness of AIGA without increasing products

DESIGNING A LOGO
As with designing visual identity or any design 
project, the standard process for designing a logo 
is shown in the following diagram.

CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
For branding and logo development, some cli-
ents provide a brand brief, a document deﬁ ning 
the brand essence, the construct, what the brand 
represents. (More often, the information from the 
brand brief is incorporated into a design brief or 
creative brief, forming one document.) A brand 
brief is used in conjunction with a design brief; 
together they address strategy, used as a platform 
for concept generation.
Once in the conceptual design phase of the 
design process, generating design concepts for a 
logo depends, in part, on a designer’s ability to 
compress and condense meaning and complexity 
into one small unit, a unit that will have to endure 
for years (if not decades), function, and be integral 
to every visual communication for that entity. As 
Gui Borchert, associate creative director at Syrup, 
says, “A logo is the smallest canvas for story tell-
ing.” A logo must be driven by a design concept, 
the driving idea underpinning what and how you 
are depicting it; and, that concept is based on the 
brief and brand strategy. It bears repeating—
you must condense a great deal of meaning into 
one mark that will distinguish and differentiate 
an entity in a crowded commercial or nonproﬁ t 
sphere. In Figure 10-46, Filip Blažek’s design 
concept for D-dur, a digital radio station stream-
ing classical music, is visualized with “a handwrit-
ten typeface standing for tradition, while the tilde 
with gradient symbolizes the continuous stream 
of music. It is a connection between the history 
and the future.”
As you’ve learned, the design process is often 
nonlinear, relying on iterations, evaluating itera-
tions, moving on those, and then perhaps cycling 
back to other ideas. During visualization and 
composition, through the sketching process, ideas 
can transform or evolve.
Figure 10-47, the logo for VisionSpring, illus-
trates this evolution. VisionSpring is a nonproﬁ t 
enterprise that helps local entrepreneurs in poor 
countries provide eyeglasses in their communities, 
thereby stimulating the local economy and reduc-
ing poverty. Bryony Gomez-Palacio and Armin 
Vit of UnderConsideration worked closely with 
the VisionSpring team as well as their brand con-
sultants, ?What If!, who helped them develop a 
brand positioning, mission, and values. Armin 
Vit comments, “Through the positioning of “See

(Figure 10-49). For the New Museum (Figure 
10-50), Wolff Olins’ website describes their design 
approach: “In a city over-saturated with cultural 
institutions, we faced an exciting challenge: To 
create a brand that would drive the museum’s 
vision and ambition to become a world player in 
contemporary art and a ﬁ rst-choice 21st-century 
cultural destination.
“Based on the idea of ‘New Art and New 
Ideas,’ our ﬁ rst step was to simplify the name to 
loosen up the museum’s institutional feel. More 
importantly, to broaden their scope from the nar-
row deﬁ nitions of an art museum to becoming 
recognized as a cultural hub.”
VISUAL BRIEF COLLAGE BOARD
A visual brief collage board is a visual way of 
determining strategy and a construct; also called 
a visual positioning collage. It will help you visual-
ize the entity’s essence, personality, color palette, 
and how all that might be compressed into a unit.

The colors used respect the color 
guideline for Czech radio. While 
designing the logotype, I was sure 
it would win. The concept of a 
simple form, a hidden connection 
to a logotype of another classical 
music station of Czech radio, and 
a surprising form of the letter ‘d’ 
(not very common in Czech hand 
writing), it all led to the satisfaction 
of the client. Although I preferred 
a more typographic version with 
classical roman typeface instead 
of a script.

START WITH THE NAME
The brand’s name is a good starting point for 
conceptualization. In the chapter on branding, we 
looked at categories of brand names. Because of 
their creative nature, invented and symbolic names 
more easily lend themselves to visualization than 
do founders’ names. Similarly, some names point 
to intuitive solutions, where the name itself could
inherently solve the logo problem—for example, 
Apple computer or Summit, an American bras-
serie designed by architect Adam D. Tihany with 
identity design by Mirko Ilic´ (Figure 10-48). 
For One Laptop per Child (OLPC), Michael 
Gericke of Pentagram chose to depict the name

Using a visual brief collage board is a great start-
ing point for visualization, in particular for logo 
design, since a collage board should encompass 
the general look, mood, personality, colors, imag-
ery, and perhaps typefaces; essentially it could 
replace a brand brief. 
Some people confuse the purpose of a visual 
brief collage board with a mood board. A visual 
brief replaces a written design brief and/or brand 
brief, used to determine strategy before concept 
generation. A mood board is created and utilized 
after concept generation, to help focus and indi-
cate the visual characteristics, as well as emotional 
and contextual aspects of the design concept. It 
is also used as a guide for the design team and 
the client, a tool to exemplify the look, feel, and 
emotional tone of the concept.
LOGO DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
Two main goals during conceptualization, visual-
ization, and composition are to meaningfully dif-
ferentiate the brand and to do so in a form that 
has impact.
A logo should be synonymous in meaning with 
the entity it represents as well as be unique, mem-
orable, and recognizable at a glance, just the way 
that the Nike swoosh, the Mercedes symbol, the

While awareness of O-Cel-O™ was high com-
pared with competitive cleaning products, con-
sumers were having difﬁ culty recognizing the logo 
mark. 3M enlisted Wallace Church to help better 
communicate O-Cel-O’s colorful and optimis-
tic brand essence. Lowercase letters within a soft, 
rounded holding shape are used to signal a younger, 
more playful experience (Figure 10-51). Clean, 
vibrant colors speak to the efﬁ cacy of the prod-
uct. The addition of a “smile” below the “l” gives 
the logo a more proprietary shape while further

A new identity designed by Pentagram for iconic 
New York retailer Saks Fifth Avenue launched on 
January 2, 2007. Partner Michael Bierut describes 
the process behind the development of an iden-
tity with more variations than there are electrons 
in the known universe:
Saks approached us in 2004 about designing 
a new identity for their stores, seeking a graphic 
program that would encompass signage, adver-
tising, direct mail, online and, most importantly, 
packaging.
We understood quickly that this was more than 
a logo design project. The current Saks logo . . . 
had been in use since the mid-nineties, but had 
done little to create a proﬁ le for the brand, par-
ticularly as part of a gray-on-gray packaging pro-
gram that was recessive to say the least. Terron 
Schaefer and the leadership at Saks were look-
ing for something that could be ubiquitous and 
iconic, immediately identiﬁ able when glimpsed 
across a busy street. But, unlike Tiffany, the store 
has never had a signature color; unlike Burberry, 
no signature pattern. On the contrary, examining 
their history we found the store had used literally 
dozens of logos since its founding.
There was one interesting fact, however. Many 
of these logos were variations on the same theme: 
cursive writing, sometimes casual, sometimes 
Spencerian.
Of these, one stood out, the logo drawn in 
1973 by Tom Carnese, adapted from a signature 
introduced almost twenty years before. In many 
people’s minds, this still was the Saks logo. By 
coincidence, I knew it well: it was the logo that 
was at the heart of the identity system designed 
by my ﬁ rst boss, Massimo Vignelli, shortly before 
I started working for him in 1980.
But simply reinstating a 30-year-old logo 
wouldn’t be enough. Saks was happy to empha-
size its heritage, but it was even more eager to 
signal that it was looking to the future, a place 
of constant change and surprise with a consistent 
dedication to quality. In our early creative sessions 
at Saks, we’d gathered a lot of visual inspiration. 
The team kept coming back to the boldness of 
artists like Franz Kline and Barnett Newman. 
Was there a way to get that kind of dramatic scale 
and energy into the program?
We were excited when we ﬁ nally hit on the 
solution. We took the cursive logo, redrew it with 
the help of font designer Joe Finocchiaro, and 
placed it in a black square. Then, we subdivided 
that square into a grid of 64 smaller squares.
The 64 tiles can then be shufﬂ ed and rotated to 
form an almost inﬁ nite number of variations. We 
say almost inﬁ nite, but obviously there’s a ﬁ xed 
number of possibilities. Curious about what that 
might be, we consulted a friend who’s a graduate 
student in theoretical physics at Yale. He calcu-
lated that the number of possible conﬁ gurations 
is in fact 98,137,610,226,945,526,221,323,127,
451,938,506,431,029,735,326,490,840,972,261,
848,186,538,906,070,058,088,365,083,852,800,
000,000,000. He helpfully pointed out that this is 
nearly 100 googols (a googol is a 1 with 100 zeros 
after it), and many times the number of electrons 
in the known universe.
Most of the individual logo tiles are quite lovely 
in their own right, and within the system can be 
used in various combinations to form still more 
abstract compositions. Each of these suggests 
within its details the graphic character of the 
new logo. Enlarged, they have a kind of energy 
and drama that contrasts nicely with the original 
mark from which they were derived.
The advantage of the program, deployed in 
black and white like the store’s holiday “snow ﬂ ake” 
packaging, is that it creates recognizable consis-
tency without sameness. The logo elements will 
be used in signage and direct mail and advertis-
ing. Most importantly, there are over forty differ-
ent packages in the program, from jewelry boxes 
to hat boxes, and four sizes of shopping bags. In 
the new program, no two of these are alike, yet 
they all go together. Our hope is that they will all 
become associated in the minds of shoppers with 
the style and élan of Saks Fifth Avenue.

Logo Format: A Self-Contained Unit 
versus Free-Form Unit
Self-contained unit: We can start by thinking of a 
logo format as a closed unit based on one of seve-
ral basic shapes: circle, square, or triangle (Figures 
10-53 through 10-55). Any of these three shapes 
can deﬁ ne a symbol’s or logo’s boundaries.
We can extend logo formats to include organic, 
rectilinear, curvilinear, irregular, and acciden-
tal shapes or recognizable closed shapes (ﬂ ower, 
human form, star, tree, lotus bud) as units that 
can become the logo’s boundaries (Figures 10-56 
and 10-57).
Breaking the unit: Shapes, letterforms, or 
forms within a logo unit can break through the 
boundaries yet maintain the gestalt, the appear-
ance of the original unit shape. Think of how a 
block of marble is transformed into a sculpture. 
A sculptor chisels away at the solid block to cre-
ate forms. Some marble sculptures stay close to 
the original block form; others seem to break 
away from the original form, seeming to belong 
far less to the original block (Figures 10-58 
through 10-61).
Free-form: Another approach to logo composi-
tion is to consider a logo unit as a free-form shape 
or combined free-form shapes—not contained by
a rigid outer deﬁ nable shape boundary (circle, 
square, rectangle, triangle, or trapezoid) or for-
mat, but still a unit that is independent, that can 
stand on its own and be incorporated into other 
applications. The design should hold together 
as a whole, stable unit (Figures 10-62 through 
10-64).
Many logos are a formalized combination of 
two elements: a symbol plus brand name, which 
is called a signature. A signature may also be a 
combination of three unique elements: a symbol, 
the brand name, and the tagline or a descriptor 
(or a number of business lines or divisions). This 
prescribed juxtaposition is a composition in itself, 
with proscribed guidelines for an area of isola-
tion (empty space surrounding the signature), to 
protect the integrity of the mark so that no other 
information is positioned in its zone. A signature 
can be designed in a vertical composition or a 
horizontal composition, or both. In Figure 10-65,

As a compositional unit, a logo must be independent, 
able to stand on its own, since it is incorporated 
into many other applications, including print 
advertising as part of the sign-off, in television 
commercials (usually in the last frame), on all 
print applications such as corporate communi-
cations, CDs, posters, and packaging, in most 
digital applications (websites, mobile, kiosks), 
and so on.
In 2D: Visual Basics for Designers, Professor 
Rose Gonnella states that logo designs are “com-
positional microcosms, which may be studied 
for their economical precision in arrangement of 
shapes.” By nature of its application, a logo must 
communicate broad ideas and meanings in a very 
limited compositional space. Visualizing a logo 
as a “compositional microcosm” entails ensuring 
unity and a visual hierarchy that contributes to 
making a logo memorable and stable. At times, 
more information than you might think has to 
be embedded into a logo, as for Polly-O in Fig-
ure 10-52.

images, and symbols you utilize contribute to the 
denotative and connotative meaning. Any result-
ing characteristic of a design has to do with every 
decision you make. For the Maharam identity 
(Figure 10-67), creative director Takaaki Mat-
sumoto explains: “The vertical lines positioned 
between the letters in the logotype are an abstract 
suggestion of fabric threads, the core of Maha-
ram’s business. When the logotype is printed in 
yellow and red, the woven effect is strengthened: 
the red advances in space while the yellow recedes. 
Other color schemes are used for the logo; which 
one is used depends on the needs of the applica-
tion. These colors do not compromise the quality 
and effect of the logotype.
“Letters and lines combine in the simplest 
manner for a highly sophisticated logotype. The 
woven texture effect is not only a result of the 
placement of lines between the letters, it also 
arises from the contrast and repetition of the 
letters within the name maharam. This word is 
structured by alternating consonants and vowels. 
The letter m begins and terminates the word; 
the letter a repeats three times, centered within 
the word; the h and r are linked by shared visual 
attributes. The patterning and grouping of these 
letters imbue the logotype with a pleasing sym-
metry. The geometric design of Futura letters 
contributes to the visual strength of the logotype. 
For example, the counterform of the a, which 
forms a dot, appears repeated three times in the 
logotype for an accentuated rhythm.”
What might be appropriate for one entity might 
not be appropriate for another. Should an insur-
ance company and amusement park be represented 
similarly? How about a nonproﬁ t organization and 
a commercial one? A logo should express, through 
visualization and composition, the spirit and pur-
pose of the entity. Every aspect of a logo commu-
nicates something about what it represents.
When Professors Rose Gonnella and Martin 
Holloway, my esteemed colleagues at Kean Uni-
versity, teach logo design, they categorize funda-
mental ways of depicting shapes or forms for the 
purpose of visualization.
› Elemental form: line or ﬂ at tone used to reduce 
an image or subject to stark simplicity, similar to 
a pictograph or sign.
Associates, you can see the symbol alone, with the 
signature and guidelines for usage. On its website, 
Captive Resource’s symbol is animated, where the

Visualization 
A logo has to tell a story; it must communicate 
meaning—clearly express a voice, communicate 
an essence. The characteristic manner and/or 
appearance of all shapes, forms, typefaces, colors,

› High contrast: depiction of forms based on 
extreme contrast of light and shadow falling on 
a three-dimensional form (Figure 10-68, Quaker 
Oats Company logo).
› Linear: line used as the main element to depict 
or describe the shape or form. This can be as 
simple as a notation or as complex as a full-out 
rendering.
› Volumetric: light and shadow, gradation or 
modeling used to suggest the illusion of three-
dimensional form.
› Texture or pattern: line or marks used to sug-
gest form, light, texture, pattern, or tone using 
hatch, cross-hatch, cross-contour, dots, smudges,

Color
Many brands are synonymous with the color or 
color palette of their visual identities (think BP’s 
bright yellow/green palette, Dunkin’ Donuts’ 
orange and pink, Coca-Cola’s red, or IBM’s 
blue). Color contributes to distinction and inﬂ u-
encing people’s brand perception. Clients often 

P. 266

have speciﬁ c color notions, as did Jacquelina Di 
Roberto, founder and owner of The Pink Door 
(Figure 10-69), who recalled the color pink from 
her year-long trip to Florence, Italy. People are 
greatly affected by color, inﬂ uenced by cultural 
and psychological color associations. However, 
color is culture speciﬁ c and should be carefully 
selected by culture or country. Color plays an 
important role and it is speciﬁ ed along with other 
visual identity guidelines. For the San Francisco 
Zoo, Kit Hinrichs and his team created a color 
palette of natural earthy and vibrant hues to aid 
in expressing the design concept for the identity 
(Figure 10-70). As another example, the Media-
FLO color palette “consists of rich jewel tones 
that convey a sense of style and contemporary 
sophistication characteristic of the MediaFLO 
experience” (Figure 10-71).
Keep in mind these basic color considerations 
for logo and visual identity:
› Choose color or color palette for distinction 
and differentiation from the competition. Like a 
construct, a brand should “own” a color.
› Choose wisely for meaning, connotations, and 
symbolism across cultures.
› Use color to build meaning (as did Tiffany, 
Coca-Cola, and BP).
› Use color variations in different logos of the 
same company or brand to represent different 
operating units or brand extensions 
› Ensure color consistency across media and 
platforms.

Type 
Very often, design students choose typefaces, 
visuals, and graphic elements and forms without 
fully understanding that each and every typeface 
and visual element carries a heritage and conno-
tative meaning. A novice often chooses a typeface 
on a purely personal basis, because he or she likes 
the look or shape of the face. Choosing a typeface 
for a logo should be done for its form, appropri-
ateness, and expressive potential, with knowledge 
of both the denotative meaning and the conno-
tative meaning (heritage, voice, expressive mean-
ing) of the face.
Keep in mind these basic typographic consid-
erations for logo and visual identity:
› Legibility
› Connotation: appropriateness, personality, and 
expression
– Uniqueness and distinction (consider a 
proprietary typeface)
– Differentiation from competition
– Select a typeface family for range, ﬂ exibility 
of use, weights, widths, including numerals 
and bullets
– Limit number of typefaces in one piece
– Works in a range of sizes and across all 
applications (website may require its own 
font and standards)
– Works well in black and white and color
– Choose typeface to complement the logo, 
not necessarily replicate it

ofﬁ cial or legal. The letterhead printed on a sheet 
of ﬁ ne paper or viewed as a digital page includes 
speciﬁ c content and is part of a broader visual 
identity system with consistent elements—such 
as the logo, color palette, and any graphic element 
or verbal component associated with the brand or 
brand signature—that allow for identiﬁ cation of 
the brand.
LETTERHEAD DESIGN PROCESS
As always, any design is based on a design con-
cept. Before you begin the design process, deter-
mine how the letterhead will be used (letters, 
faxes, print or digital, invoices) and if versions 
(corporate only, executive, divisions, personal) are 
required; and obtain all required content (com-
pany’s name, address, telephone and fax numbers, 
e-mail, and website address, and may include the 
executive or manager’s name, among other con-
tent). While developing the design, you should 
explore paper samples in order to make your paper 
and envelope selections, as well as determine the 
production method so that you can guide your 
visualization process with production parameters 
in mind.
Consider the following points when selecting 
paper for letterhead:
› Surface quality and texture (feel the paper, fold 
the paper)
› Compatibility with laser printers
› Paper color in relation to ink colors and brand 
colors
› Stock availability
› Content: tree, tree-free, or recycled
› Cost
› How the paper takes printing ink (you must 
see samples)
› How the paper takes a signature or pen’s ink
› How the letterhead paper coordinates (in sur-
face quality, texture, and color) with the busi-
ness card paper (business card paper stock will 
be heavier)
You also need to consider which printing pro-
cess to use:
› Offset lithography
› Gravure
› Flexography
› Screen printing
Sound and Motion
The interplay between type and visuals in a logo 
in screen-based media is much the same as for 
print, except the bonus of sound and motion 
might add potential for heightened dramatic or 
comedic effect. To communicate the Intel Inside® 
in television commercials, Intel added a signature 
ID audio visual logo, a distinctive and memorable 
three-second animated jingle, displaying the logo 
and playing a four-tone melody. According to the 
Intel website, “Starting in 1995, the now-familiar 
tone helped cement a positive Intel image in the 
minds of millions of consumers.”
In screen-based media, motion is king. We 
expect it. Many of us turn off the sound, but we 
are entertained by animation and motion graphics, 
as with the logo for Alex Coletti Productions, a 
TV production company that produces documen-
taries, television series, halftime shows, and awards 
programs in the music genre (Figure 10-72).

LETTERHEAD
A core application of any visual identity or brand-
ing program is the letterhead. The letterhead is 
a formal business tool used for many purposes, 

V I S UA L  I D E N T I T Y
P. 269
› Template guidelines: Along with the letterhead 
solution, the designer provides the client with 
a template for letter positioning and size, type-
face and font size, and color. The template helps 
ensure coherence.
Layout
Very often, the pertinent information resides at 
the head (or top) of the page—hence the term 
letterhead. That kind of arrangement leaves ample 
room for correspondence. Some designers split 
the information and position some type at the 
foot, or bottom, of the page. Others break with 
tradition and position type, graphics, or illustra-
tions in any number of ways—in a vertical direc-
tion at the left or right side, all over the page in 
light or ghosted values or colors, or around the 
perimeter of the page.
Any arrangement is ﬁ ne, as long as it works, 
as long as it is a sound solution to a visual com-
munication problem. Information should be in 
a logical information hierarchy, for example, the 
ZIP code should not be the ﬁ rst thing the reader 
notices. The logo is usually the most prominent 
element on the letterhead (see Figure 10-73, for 
example); all other type and visuals should be 
arranged accordingly, from the most important to 
the least important. A graphic element other than 
the logo can be the most prominent element in 
your design, as long as your solution stems from 
your strategy and is based on a design concept that 
has visual interest and clarity of communication.
The design—the arrangement of the elements, 
the creation of a visual hierarchy; the use of the 
logo, and the selection of colors and typefaces—is 
usually consistent within the parts of the stationery 
and visual identity. Any design system, whether it 
is stationery or an extensive visual identity, should 
have continuity—that is, similarities in form. 
Some designers feel it is perfectly acceptable to 
have slight to moderate variations in color, type, 
or arrangements among the letterhead, envelopes, 
and business cards. It is possible to design a uni-
ﬁ ed stationery system that incorporates variety.
Other integral applications—package design, 
websites, brochures (corporate communication)—
will be covered in following chapters. (See “Case 
Study: The Suzhou Museum.”)
› Non-impact (which includes electronically 
driven ink-jet)
› Letterpress (although no longer popular)
› Specialty processes:
– Engraving
– Embossing
– Watermark
– Foil stamping
FUNDAMENTALS 
OF LETTERHEAD DESIGN 
Every design decision counts, from the typog-
raphy to the placement of the contact informa-
tion. Whether you specify the paper’s weight or 
choose the color palette, each aspect of the design 
is an opportunity to present a consistent iden-
tity. Usability (for example, enough space for 
written content) and coherent identity elements 
are imperatives. (See Figure 10-65.)
Function
Student designers tend to “overdesign” a let-
terhead, leaving little room for correspondence. 
Always include a sample letter on your sketches 
and comps to plan space for correspondence. In 
fact, when you present letterhead in your port-
folio, a letter should be on the letterhead design 
solution as well, demonstrating to reviewers you 
understand a letterhead’s function.
Keep in mind these other functional 
considerations:
› Size: The U.S. standard size is 8.5" × 11", 
which is also used in Mexico and Canada. Other 
countries use the metric system of measurement 
for paper sizes and envelopes.
› Fax: The letterhead should be legible when 
faxed.
› Folds: A letterhead is folded to ﬁ t into a stan-
dard size envelope. The composition should take 
the folds into account. Also, the paper selection 
should hold up to folding, and not crack or bulge.
› Ink: The letterhead paper and envelope should 
take printing ink, laser printer ink, and pen
ink well.
› Second sheet: Correspondence often requires 
more than one sheet of paper. For letterhead 
design, a second sheet is designed with less con-
tent (only the brand or group name and website).

The new Suzhou Museum opened to critical 
acclaim in October 2006. This new contemporary 
museum is located in the historic garden city of 
Suzhou, about 100 kilometers northwest of Shang-
hai. Started in 1960, the museum was originally 
housed in an historic home with limited space to 
display its many signiﬁ cant collections of Chinese 
antiquities and cultural relics. To rectify this, the 
city fathers of Suzhou invited the world-renowned 
architect I.M. Pei, whose family was originally 
from Suzhou, to design the new museum.
The contemporary architectural design of the 
Suzhou Museum derives its inspiration from 
traditional Chinese courtyard and garden archi-
tecture, so notable and unique to this region of 
China. The museum is next to two of Suzhou’s 
most famous garden museums: The Garden of 
the Humble Administrator (Zhuo Zheng Yuan) 
and the Lion Forest Garden (Shi Zi Lin Yuan), 
both UNESCO World Heritage sites.
The new museum houses over 30,000 historic 
works of art from Suzhou and its environs in over 
5,000 square feet of exhibition space. Known as 
the Wu Region, this prosperous area of China 
was a center of artistic and literary development 
from the Song to Qing Dynasties. This gave rise 
to a highly cultivated class of scholars and literati 
whose devotion to the ﬁ ne arts made a lasting 
contribution to the cultural heritage of China.
Tracy Turner (Tracy Turner Design Inc.) was 
engaged by I.M. Pei and the Pei Partnership 
Architects (PPA) to design all of the graphics 
and signage, as well as exhibits and other visual 
details, all important elements to the success of 
the museum. Ms. Turner had worked with Mr. 
Pei on previous projects in China, including his 
ﬁ rst hotel project in 1982, called Fragrant Hill 
Hotel (Xian Shan Fan Dian) and the Bank of 
China Headquarters, which opened in 2001, both 
in Beijing. With Mr. Pei. and the PPA team, and 
her experience and knowledge of the culture, she 
developed the following scope of work.
SCOPE OF WORK
A comprehensive environmental graphic program 
was created, which included:
 1 / Identity Standards and Manual of Usage, 
for Print and Other Graphics
 2 / Comprehensive Exterior and Interior 
Signage Program
 3 / Exhibition Display Banners: seven were 
designed for the Opening
 4 / Exhibition Labeling and Object Arrange-
ment throughout the Museum
 5 / Color Schemes for Each Gallery
 6 / Museum Map Guide
 7 / Two Major Exhibition Designs for the 
Opening:
a. Famous Master Painters from the 
Ming Dynasty (loaned by the Shang-
hai Museum)
b. Prosperous Gusu based on a famous 
scroll, a Chinese national treasure 
(loaned by the City of Liaoning)
 8 / Reception Area: Permanent Exhibit
 9 / Rug designs for four major public areas 
within the museum
 10 / Various items for promotion and sale in 
the Museum Shop
 11 / Opening program, etc.
DESIGN CHALLENGE
The ﬁ rst design challenge was to create a logo, as 
a basis of the environmental graphic design and 
identity program. The parameters came from sev-
eral sources:
• modern and up-to-date, yet sensitive and 
acceptable to the Chinese and feng/shui 
approved
• the Architect: that the logo have some deriva-
tion of the building
• the Museum Director: that it be understood 
immediately as the Suzhou Museum
• the Chinese characters of artist Guo Mo Ro 
must be used, for “Suzhou Museum”
• use Chinese/English in designated 200/100 
ratio
LOGO AND BRAND DEVELOPMENT
Inspiration for the logo came from Pei’s use of 
geometric forms delineating the architectural fea-
tures, predominantly with white stucco and gray

granite, all based on traditional uses of local mate-
rials. In addition, Feng Shui masters reviewed and 
approved the logo in the ongoing design process.
Feng Shui (the Chinese literal translation 
means “Wind” and “Water”) is a discrete Chinese 
belief system involving a mix of geographical, psy-
chological, philosophical, and aesthetic ideas with 
interpretative postulations to create harmonious 
energy. The logo was received enthusiastically by 
the director of the museum, and it was noted that 
the line work within the square creating the logo 
formed many auspicious Chinese characters.
EXHIBIT GALLERY SIGN CHALLENGE
At the last minute, the museum director insisted 
on commemorating the “Wu” culture (famous to 
Suzhou) on all of the signs for all of the twenty-
six gallery names, with the use of four different 
esoteric characters for each gallery. These four 
characters were basically not easily intelligible to 
the average Chinese, and were signiﬁ cant only to 
this commemoration. Each gallery still required 
a description that could be readily understood in 
Chinese/English for the general public.
While there were limited budget constraints, 
the schedule was rigorous: 1 year start to ﬁ nish 
with the designer having to spend a full 7 weeks 
in Suzhou with an additional staff member on 
site to get everything done in time for the open-
ing date. In addition, all of the English for the 
major collection descriptions (28) was rewritten 
by the designer and the project architect.
For the signage fabrication, stainless steel and 
glass were used throughout. Chinese and English 
characters were cut out dimensionally of metal, to 
accommodate accessibility issues. Chinese char-
acters always appeared in a black color and the 
English, always a gray color, in a 200/100 ratio.

BUSINESS CARD
Besides television advertisements that come into 
your living room, a business card is, perhaps, the 
most intimate design application. Often passed 
from hand to hand, a business card quickly and 
directly tells its reader who you are, what you do, 
with whom you are afﬁ liated, and how to contact 
you. Even when a business card is enclosed within 
correspondence, its small size begs intimacy. A 
business card is a printed or digital surface—a 
small rectangle—on which a person’s name, busi-
ness afﬁ liation, and contact information are printed. 
The business card, a very portable marketing tool, is 
an integral part of a broader visual identity system, 
as in this identity for Le Cirque (Figure 10-73). A 
designer’s own card often reﬂ ects his or her own 
spirit, vision, or point of view (Figure 10-74).
Most large corporations or organizations 
issue both general and executive business cards. 
Usually, there are small differences between the 
These are the components of a letterhead 
program:
› General letterhead (short and long) and gen-
eral envelope
› Executive letterhead (short and long) and 
executive envelope
› Digital letterhead (customized variations to

To include more information or graphics, some 
design a two-sided card, utilizing the reverse side. 
For the Green Building Institute, Substance151 
designed one side for the organization’s identity 
and the reverse side for the individual’s contact 
information (Figure 10-75). (To see the full iden-
tity program for the Green Building Institute, see 
Figure 14-04.) Although most cards do not have 
printed information on the reverse side, some 
designers ﬁ nd it a wonderful “canvas” for expand-
ing the brand experience and engaging viewers, as 
in Figure 10-76.
There are many good reasons to employ the 
reverse side of a card, especially in a global mar-
ketplace. A reverse side may hold any of the fol-
lowing information or graphic elements:
general business card, used by a large percentage 
of employees, and the executive card, used by a 
small executive group; those differences may be 
in the paper quality, paper color, printing, or, per-
haps, the brand signature. General business card 
paper stock is usually coordinated with the paper 
of the general stationery; likewise, executive cards 
are coordinated with the executive stationery. (See 
"Practical Considerations" for more information 
about paper.)
IDENTITY STANDARDS FOR 
BUSINESS CARDS
Establishing coherence entails creating identity 
standards and then employing them consistently. 
In the visual identity for Captive Resources, LLC, 
Crosby Associates provides standards for business 
cards (see Figure 10-65).
For both general and executive business cards, 
the standard content guidelines usually include:
› Individual’s name
› Job title
› Organizational corporate unit or department 
name
› Address or ofﬁ ce location
› Phone and fax numbers
› E-mail address(es)
› Web address
Either the client or the designer speciﬁ es such 
components as the name structure, acronyms, posi-
tion of professional titles, capitalization, abbrevia-
tions, identiﬁ er formats, use of reverse side, and 
any other relevant information with examples.
Since business cards must include critical contact 
information and the brand logo on a small surface, 
usually no other information is included on a card. 
Limiting the amount of information on a business 
card can aid a viewer’s ability to glean information.

M.B.
A while ago, I was designing the identity for a 
large, fashion-oriented organization. It was time 
to decide which typeface we’d use for their name. 
Opinions were not hard to come by: this was the 
kind of place where people were not unused to 
exercising their visual connoisseurship. But a ﬁ nal 
decision was elusive.
We decided to recommend a straightforward 
sans serif font. Predictably, this recommendation 
was greeted by complaints: it was too generic, too 
mechanical, too unstylish, too unreﬁ ned. I had 
trouble responding until I added two more ele-
ments to the presentation. The ﬁ rst was a medium 
weight, completely bland, sans serif “C.” “Does 
this look stylish to you?” I would ask. “Does it 
communicate anything about fashion or taste?” 
Naturally, the answer was no.
Then I would show the same letter as it usu-
ally appears as the ﬁ rst in a six-letter sequence: 
CHANEL. “Now what do you think?”
It worked every time. But how?
The answer, of course, is context. The lettering 
in the Chanel logo is neutral, blank, open-ended: 
what we see when we look at it is eight decades’ 
worth of accumulated associations. In the world 
of identity design, very few designs mean any-
thing when they’re brand new. A good logo, 
according to Paul Rand, provides the “pleasure 
of recognition and the promise of meaning.” The 
promise, of course, is only fulﬁ lled over time. “It 
is only by association with a product, a service, a 
business, or a corporation that a logo takes on any 
real meaning,” Rand wrote in 1991. “It derives its 
meaning and usefulness from the quality of that 
which it symbolizes.”
Everyone seems to understand this intellectu-
ally. Yet each time I unveil a new logo proposal 
to a client, I sense the yearning for that some 
enchanted evening moment: love at ﬁ rst sight, 
getting swept off your feet by the never-before-
seen stranger across the dance ﬂ oor. Tell clients 
don’t worry, you’ll learn to love it and they react 
like an unwilling bride getting hustled into an 
unsuitable arranged marriage. In fact, perhaps 
designers should spend less time reading Paul 
Rand and more time reading Jane Austen: after 
all, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a 
corporation in possession of a good fortune must 
be in want of a logo, isn’t it? Finding that one 
perfect logo is worth its own romantic novel.
All of this is compounded by the fact that 
designers themselves have very little faith in con-
text. We too want the quick hit, the clever idea 
that will sell itself in the meeting and, even better, 
jump off the table in design competitions. More 
than anything, we want to proffer the promise 
of control: the control of communication, the 
control of meaning. To admit the truth—that

so much is out of our hands—marginalizes our 
power to the point where it seems positively 
self-destructive. This is especially true in graphic 
design, where much of our work’s functional 
requirements are minimal on one hand and vague 
on the other. “The pleasure of recognition and 
the promise of meaning” is a nice two line per-
formance speciﬁ cation, but one that’s impossible 
to put to the test.
Yet all around us are demonstrations of how 
effective a blank slate can be. It’s just hard to learn 
from them. I’d like to think, for instance, that I’d 
see the potential of a red dot in a red circle if I 
was designing a logo for a company named Tar-
get. But in truth I’d probably say, “What, that’s 
all?” and not let it into the initial presentation. 
How, after all, could you guarantee that the client 
would invest 40 years in transforming that blank 
slate into a vivid three-dimensional picture?
Appreciating the power of context takes 
patience, humility, and, perhaps in the end, a 
sense of resignation. You sense it in this account 
of designer Carolyn Davidson’s disappointing pre-
sentation for her ﬁ rst big ($35) freelance project:
After sifting through the stack of drawings, 
Knight and the other men in the room kept 
coming back—albeit with something less than 
enthusiasm—to the design that looked like a 
checkmark.
“It doesn’t do anything,” Johnson complained. 
“It’s just a decoration. Adidas’ stripes support the 
arch. Puma’s stripe supports the ball of the foot. 
Tiger’s does both. This doesn’t do either.”
“Oh, c’mon,” Woodell said. “We’ve got to pick 
something. The three stripes are taken.”
That was the trouble, thought Davidson. They 
were all in love with the three stripes. They didn’t 
want a new logo; they wanted an old logo, the one 
that belonged to Adidas. Davidson liked [them] 
but found it disheartening to go out on her very 
ﬁ rst real job and get this kind of reception.
We all know the ending to this story: the client 
grudgingly accepted Carolyn Davidson’s chubby 
checkmark, and the rest, as recounted here in 
Swoosh: The Unauthorized Story of Nike and the Men 
Who Played There is corporate identity history. The 
swoosh has proven durable enough to stand for the 
company’s dedication to athletic achievement, its 
opponents’ resistance to the forces of global capi-
tal, and a lot of things in between. Sometimes, the 
client is smarter than we think. Give Nike founder 
Phil Knight credit: he had the vision to admit, “I 
don’t love it. But I think it’ll grow on me.”
Maybe he believed it. Or maybe he was just 
tired of trying to decide. Either way, context did 
the rest.

EXERCISE 10-1
PREPARATION 
VISUAL BRIEF COLLAGE BOARD
A visual brief collage board is your “visual position-
ing,” which can be created in any way that best 
serves your working method. If you prefer working 
methodically, you might want to use a graphic aid 
such as a grid or a graphic organizer, or divide the 
page using the rule of thirds (see Chapter 6). If in 
doubt, use a four-column modular grid, where the 
two left-hand columns are narrower than the two 
right-hand columns. Many people start with a focal 
point at the board’s center, almost like a visual 
mind map technique (see Chapter 4), holding the 
board either landscape or portrait.
» Determine a color palette.
» Select a limited range of shapes, textures, and 
patterns for your strategy.
» Find or create imagery or fi ne art that inspires 
you. Some people include industrial design 
images that inspire them.
» Select one or two typefaces.
Your board should establish a visual position in 
line with the brand strategy and provide a design 
direction.
PROJECT 10-1
VISUAL IDENTITY 
This project calls for a comprehensive visual iden-
tity—from its marketing strategy to its deliverables. 
It demonstrates your ability to be consistent yet 
creative.
This is a diffi cult and involved assignment. It 
demonstrates to potential employers your ability to 
formulate a strategy and design concept and follow 
it through with a visual identity that includes several 
design applications. The experience and knowledge 
› ISO certiﬁ cation (the International Organiza-
tion for Standardization is a network of the national 
standards institutes of 161 countries, which coor-
dinates the system of standards for industrial and 
business organizations of all types, among other 
things [www.iso.org])
› Translations (international brands and social 
organizations, in particular, may want transla-
tions on the reverse side of cards)
› Additional phone numbers and ofﬁ ce locations
› Brand division signature
› Other graphics that are related to the brand 
experience
Business Card Production Speciﬁ cations
Providing the client with guidelines for produc-
tion speciﬁ cations will ensure that all employees 
using and ordering business cards will understand 
and communicate the proper, established brand 
image. Although some of these points are gen-
eral and can pertain to all brand applications, it’s 
important to list all necessary guidelines to main-
tain consistency throughout the brand identity.
Make sure to provide the client with the 
following:
› A template that delineates:
– size and color of logo
PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Choosing paper for your letterhead, envelope, and business card is part of a design 
solution. There are many paper companies and numerous qualities, styles, and colors 
of paper. The weight of the paper is very important because the letterhead and 
envelope must stand up to computer printers, pens, and markers. Letterhead must be 
sturdy enough to withstand being folded. Business cards are usually inserted into wal-
lets and therefore must be a heavier weight paper than the letterhead. When choosing 
paper, also think about texture, how the color of the paper will work with the color of 
the ink, and whether the shape will fi t into a standard envelope. Most paper companies 
provide paper samples and have shows to promote their products. They also advertise 
in leading graphic design periodicals.
Papers and envelopes come in standard sizes; anything other than standard size is 
more expensive. A business card should be of a size and shape that fi ts into a wallet—
usually the size of a credit card. If a card must be folded to fi t into a wallet, the design 
is being compromised (pre-folded cards are an exception). A designer must also be 
aware of the printing processes available, including special technical processes such 
as die-cuts, varnishing, and embossing. Research the printing process by visiting a 
good printer.

Step 2
a. Design a logo.
b. Be sure to use your strategy and design brief.
c. Design stationery consisting of a letterhead, 
envelope, and business card. Include the 
name, address, telephone and fax numbers, 
e-mail address, web address, and CEO’s name.
d. Design at least two other related applications, 
such as a brochure or website (or add these 
after you’ve read the appropriate chapters in 
this book). Use visual elements consistently 
across applications—you are creating a visual 
identity.
e. Produce at least twenty sketches for each 
design application.
f. Use black and white or color.
Step 3
Refi ne the sketches and create two roughs for each 
design problem, the logo, stationery, and other 
applications.
Step 4
Refi ne the roughs and create one comp for each 
application.

gained here can be applied to any identity. If your 
solution to this project is successful, it could be 
one of the most important pieces in your portfolio.
Designing a visual identity is a creative activity, 
but do not forget the bottom line—to identify, differ-
entiate, and inform. Create more applications, and 
then create another visual identity for a different 
type of brand or group.
» Creating an integrated brand experience entails 
weaving a common thread or voice, and integrat-
ing the common language into all experiences 
with the brand.
Step 1
a. Choose one of the following clients:
» Architectural fi rm, or
» Nut-free consumer packaged goods 
(snacks, baked goods, breads), or
» National Crime Prevention Council (http://
www.ncpc.org) or any nonprofi t organization 
b. If you choose the architectural fi rm or food 
company, invent a brand name. See Chapter 9 
on naming.
c. Work on your strategy. Write the design brief 
(see Chapter 4). Research the competition. 
Determine an audience.
d. Identify key descriptive words. On an index 
card, write one sentence about the brand or 
group using two adjectives to describe it.

PACKAGE
DESIGN AFFECTS YOU MORE THAN 
YOU REALIZE. IF YOU SAW AN ATTRACTIVE PACKAGE ON DISPLAY IN A STORE, 
WOULD YOU PICK IT UP? AN APPEALING PACKAGE DESIGN CAN SEDUCE YOU 
INTO PURCHASING A BRAND, AT LEAST ONCE. WELL-DESIGNED PACKAGING 
CAN MAKE A COMMODITY (THINK TEA, COFFEE, RICE, EGGS) LOOK SPECIAL; 
CONVERSELY, POORLY DESIGNED PACKAGING CAN MAKE A SUPERIOR 
PRODUCT LOOK INFERIOR. POORLY ENGINEERED PACKAGING CAN INFURIATE 
THE CUSTOMER, JUST AS WELL-ENGINEERED PACKAGING CAN FACILITATE 
THE USE OF A PRODUCT AND INCREASE BRAND LOYALTY.
WHAT DOES PACK AGE DESIGN ENCOMPASS? 
Besides promoting a brand, packaging is functional, encasing and allowing access to a product 
by means of a pour spout, ﬂ ap, clasp, drawstring, or another device. Package design involves 
the complete strategic planning and designing of the form, structure, and appearance of a 
product’s package, which functions as casing, promotes a brand, presents information, and 
becomes a brand experience. It is a specialized area of graphic design, since package designers 
must be knowledgeable about a range of construction and technical factors. Familiarity with 
and knowledge of materials and their qualities—such as glass, plastic, paperboard, paper, 
and metal—and with manufacturing, safety, display, recycling, regulatory management, and 
quality standards, as well as printing, is necessary. Package designers work in collaboration 
with identity designers, marketing executives, product developers, manufacturers, industrial 
designers, and packaging engineers. Designers may also work as part of a group to develop 
the basic shape of the package, materials, and structure.
PROJECT SCOPE AND KIND: PACKAGE DESIGN, 
BRANDING, AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Most often, package design is one part of an integrated branding program whose market-
ing strategy may feature a variety of marketing initiatives, including promotions, product 
launches, and advertising. Think of a Pepsi, General Mills, and 3M sub-brand and you can 
understand how the package design is part of an entire branding program, from logo to 
mobile applications.
When package design is part of a brand identity program, other applications may include 
logo, visual identity, signage, van graphics, and more, as shown in the All Seasons Wild Bird 
Store case study on page 282.
In Figure 11-01, Wal-Mart wanted to “up the style-quotient” of No Boundaries, its chief

The Challenge: As part of a broad strategic effort to 
combat fashion-friendly retailers like Target and Kohl’s, 
Wal-Mart wanted to up the style-quotient of its fl agship 
youth brand, No Boundaries.
The Solution: We recommended a graphic shorthand 
of the No Boundaries name—NoBo—and designed a 
clean, high-impact identity. The NoBo nickname extends 
a friendly “insider” invitation to style-conscious shoppers, 
creating an identity with more personality and universal 
appeal. A playful evolution of the original brand, the new 
look-and-feel elevates No Boundaries’ cool-factor while 
leveraging its existing brand equity. To accommodate 
the retail giant’s mass production challenges, we also 
developed a system of packaging templates that ensure 
ease of implementation across a diverse range of 
products, media, and global manufacturers.
The Result: The NoBo brand has been rolled out 
successfully across Wal-Mart stores internationally and 
supported line extensions into lucrative new market 
segments from accessories to housewares.

BUSINESS PLATFORM FOR 
CLEANWELL
• IDEO, PALO ALTO
• © CLEANWELL COMPANY 2008
In a culture that is at once 
increasingly vigilant about 
germs and the value of natural 
ingredients, an herb-based 
antimicrobial that is lab-proven to 
kill 99.9 percent of harmful germs 
would fulfi ll unmet user needs. 
Additionally, the opportunity tied 
in closely with IDEO’s approach to 
market validation of innovation and 
disruptive brands and technologies.
Working with Dr. Larry Weiss, 
a scientist and physician with 
expertise in natural products, 
chemistry, and infection control, 
and a set of strategic capital 
partners, IDEO helped found the 
CleanWell brand of Ingenium 
products. The fi rst FDA- and EPA-
approved all-natural antimicrobial, 
Ingenium is the effective ingredient 
in CleanWell hand sanitizer and 
hand wash, currently available 
at select independent pharmacy, 
grocery, and specialty retailers 
across the United States as well as 
many Whole Foods markets. As a 
non-toxic, alcohol-free alternative 
to competing hand sanitizers, 
CleanWell stands out as a school- 
and child-friendly solution.
In addition to helping to build 
CleanWell’s operational and 
manufacturing capabilities, IDEO 
designed the packaging and 
graphics for the brand’s line of 
sprays and skin towelettes. After 
going from concept to market in 
less than two years, CleanWell 
distribution continues to expand.
—IDEO
of nature with science, the design concept of the 
identity is visualized by combining a plant that 
turns into a ﬂ ower made up of molecular diagrams 
in the logo.
If package design is part of a broader branding 
program, the design team meets with the brand 
identity designers or design director to ensure 
everyone works from the same strategic platform. 
Also, a package design project may be one in a line 
of products (think carbonated beverages in several 
ﬂ avors, diet and regular, caffeinated and caffeine-
free). The team needs to examine the brand archi-
tecture and identity standards. For most types 
of packaging, mandatory information—such as 
nutritional information or ingredients—must be 
included and considered when designing, as per 
industry and federal regulations. Other issues, 
such as printing specs, structural specs, functional 
data (usage, durability, tamper resistance, and 
more), and copy are all addressed at the outset.
Typically, a design company must leverage 
the brand equity of an established brand. Other 
times, design companies are involved with the 
launch of a business. IDEO describes just such an 
opportunity. “When IDEO was presented with 
a yet-to-be marketed technology for a nontoxic, 
alcohol-free hand sanitizer and cleaning product, 
the business case was undeniable. . . . To bring this 
patented technology—now known as Ingenium—
to market, IDEO began building a business from 
the ground up using principles of design thinking” 
(see Figure 11-03).
National Brands versus Store Brands
National brands are products and services that are 
promoted and distributed nationally and often 
globally. If we examine one category—the beverage 
category—some national brand companies include 
Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Cadbury Schweppes. Wal-
lace Church was called on to “revitalize the Ocean 
Spray brand positioning, redesign its entire fam-
ily of beverages, and launch an entirely new sub-
brand, Juice & Tea.” Not only was it tasked with 
retaining all of the brand’s positive equities and 
visual cues, Ocean Spray desired to see signiﬁ cant 
changes in shelf impact, appetite appeal, and form/
ﬂ avor differentiation. In the Before & After fea-
ture, you can see how the package design looked 
before Wallace Church’s redesign.

or a branded house, where all products fall under 
one name, such as Waitrose supermarkets in En-
gland, Scotland, and Wales. Turner Duckworth 
wanted its designs to reﬂ ect Waitrose’s values: 
“Effective, with style. Sales with wit. Originality 
with relevance” (Figure 11-04).
Besides carrying national brands and boutique 
labels, retail store chains often offer their own 
branded products, called store brands, retailer 
brands, and private label brands. The model for 
store brands usually is either a house of brands, where 
each product is named and branded individually,

Redesign of Waitrose’s range of premium dried fruits: Targeted at Waitrose core consumers, 
these packs use evocative close-up photography of individual fruits in all their perfection. Product 
titles further emphasize the provenance and care with which the fruits have been selected.
WAITROSE COOKIES
• DESIGNER: SAM LACHLAN
• PHOTOGRAPHER: STEVE BAXTER
• RETOUCHER: PETER RUANE
Our brief from Waitrose was to create clarity of choice for consumers within their own brand 
biscuit range. The biscuit category was becoming increasingly diffi cult to shop, as products had 
been refreshed on an ad hoc basis, which, in turn, had created a fragmented range in store.
The cookie design needed a premium edge versus the everyday range of biscuits (custard 
creams, digestives, etc.) but not so special that consumers would feel that they were only for 
Sunday afternoons. Our solution uses ingredient color-coded mugs and product titles as well as 
close-up photography to communicate yumminess, all set off by the dark backgrounds. Just right 
for coffee and a chat with the girls!

• ARTWORK: REUBEN JAMES
Waitrose asked us to refresh their canned vegetable and pulses ranges. Store cupboard staples 
for most consumers, the ranges had not been looked at in entirety for a number of years 
resulting in a fi xture that had become confused and diffi cult to shop.
Our solution focused on using the vegetables and pulses to create graphic panels of the 
products shot against complementary backgrounds that would allow consumers to not only 
stock up on their favorites but also fi nd new ingredients, too. Typographic style was kept as 
simple as possible to further aid communication.
WAITROSE FRUIT CRUSHES

• ILLUSTRATOR: JACQUES FABRE
• RETOUCHER: REUBEN JAMES
When Waitrose wanted to create a point of difference between their own range of fruit crushes 
and the competition, they briefed us to single-mindedly communicate “FRUIT.”
We rose to the challenge by putting fruit quite literally at the heart of the design, with luscious 
illustrations of ripe, juicy fruit. The product titles further supported refreshment cues with 
provenanced fruits such as Sicilian Lemons and Alphonso Mangoes, etc. Just the drink for 
a hot summer’s day.

MAIN COMMUNICATIONS OBJECTIVE
The signature “wave” at the bottom of the labels 
has been retained and updated to leverage the 
product’s refreshment cues. To this end, a soft, gra-
dated blue sky has been added to the background 
as well. The top of each bottle features the famil-
iar Ocean Spray logo while the bold, luscious fruit 
illustrations have been evolved signiﬁ cantly to bet-
ter express the product’s intense ﬂ avor and increase 
appetite appeal. A system of curved banners, con-
sistently placed on every label, is used to segment 
sub-brands and ﬂ avors (the new Juice & Tea sub-
brand is positioned slightly differently, with a gra-
dated green background and green banner).
Finally, to perceptually distinguish the brand 
from the competition, Wallace Church sought 
to communicate Ocean Spray’s authentic New 
England heritage. The addition of the lighthouse 
logo at the top of each banner neatly captures the 
spirit of Cape Cod and provides the brand with a 
sense of place. The new brand design gives more 
than 100 SKUs, of varying sizes and shapes, one 
cohesive identity, while clearly differentiating all 
sub-brands and ﬂ avors.
—Wallace Church
DESIGN PROBLEM
The exponential growth of the beverage market 
in recent years had expanded Ocean Spray’s com-
petitive set well beyond breakfast juice drinks to 
include carbonated beverages and even bottled 
water. Accompanying this growth were dramatic 
changes in the visual language used by leading 
brands to communicate emotional beneﬁ ts and 
product attributes such as “taste,” “refreshment,” 
and “premium.” While the Ocean Spray iden-
tity and package design remained familiar to its 
core audience (sophisticated moms), its emotional 
relevance, appetite appeal, and shopability were 
beginning to wane.
Wallace Church was called on to revitalize 
the Ocean Spray brand positioning, redesign its 
entire family of beverage SKUs [stock-keeping 
units] (Base Cranberry, Cranberry Light, 100% 
Premium Juice, Ruby, and White Cranberry), 
and launch an entirely new sub-brand, Juice & 
Tea. The challenge: retain all of the brand’s posi-
tive equities and visual cues while signiﬁ cantly 
increasing shelf impact, appetite appeal, and 
form/ﬂ avor differentiation.

ULTRASILENCER
• BVD, STOCKHOLM
• CREATIVE DIRECTOR: SUSANNA NYGREN BARRETT
• CLIENT: ELECTROLUX FLOOR CARE AND LIGHT APPLIANCES
Assignment: Name, logo, packaging design, PR (Public Relations) material, tote bag, and store 
presentation for Ultrasilencer Special Edition Pia Wallén. Scandinavia, Europe 2007.
Challenge: Electrolux needed a graphic identity and packaging solution for the Ultrasilencer 
Special Edition Pia Wallén. It needed to mirror Pia Wallén’s own interpretation of the product, 
inspired by the quiet sound of falling snow.
Solution: A typographically based identity was created and applied directly onto the vacuum in 
a light grey tone. The packaging was turned “inside-out.” The interior has a white, glossy surface, 
encasing the vacuum, and the exterior is brown, natural cardboard. “Ultrasilencer Special Edition 
Pia Wallén” was screen-printed on the outside of the package in white and orange in order to 
create an industrial expression in contrast with the white perfectionism of the vacuum.
Result: Ultrasilencer Special Edition Pia Wallén for Electrolux had its world premiere at the 
design store Asplunds on October 4, 2007. The product was produced in a limited edition of 
5,000, 500 of which were designated for Sweden, and sold very well. There was a 20 percent 
increase in production costs, but because of the quality of the design, the consumer price was 
raised by 60 percent, increasing the overall margins for the product. An impressive PR campaign 
created “hype,” and there is now a waiting list for this limited edition.

(may include focus groups, interviews, in-store 
observations and market interceptions [speaking 
to consumers in stores at the shelves], or any other 
market research), clarifying positioning (func-
tional and emotional beneﬁ ts, brand personality, 
speciﬁ c features), and setting strategy.
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
The concept underlying the package design solu-
tion must be relevant to the audience, be on strat-
egy with the broader brand identity, and, of course, 
have on-shelf impact. Any design concept, visu-
alization, and composition for a package design 
solution must make sense for the product category 
as well as be appealing, be compelling to its audi-
ence, and make an emotional connection. BVD’s 
solution for Electrolux, Figure 11-05, did all that.
The Psychology of Package Design 
People are often drawn to package design for 
emotional rather than rational reasons, such as 
price or ingredients. In The Culture Code, Clotaire 
Rapaille offers startling insights into how Ameri-
cans feel about products and why they buy as they 
do. For example, Rapaille theorizes that people 
equate coffee with home, where perhaps as chil-
dren they awoke to the aroma of morning coffee 
brewing. Therefore, following this argument, one 
should incorporate the concept of home into cof-
fee package design, branding, and advertising. As 
you will see by examples in this chapter, there are 
many routes for developing a solid design concept 
for package design.
According to Louis Cheskin, a mid-twentieth-
century marketing innovator, people “transfer 
their perception of a package to the product it 
contains,” which he termed “sensation transfer-
ence.” In other words, “The package is the prod-
uct.” The aesthetics of the package design can be 
relevant to someone; it can appeal or not, greatly 
affecting our perception of the product’s value.
Creating a desired perception of the product 
requires detailed attention to not only the pack-
age’s looks, but also how it feels in the hand and 
even the sounds it makes. The package’s sensory 
cues are an enormously important contributor 
to the consumer’s experience of the product. A 
package design is a tangible brand experience.

Five Phases of the Design Process:

During the ﬁ rst two phases of the design process, 
the client and design team deﬁ ne the problem, 
establish goals, determine the project scope (proj-
ect may include several brand extensions or sub-
brands), conduct any necessary research, including 
marketing and competitive audits, scru tinizing the 
competition, understanding the target audience

product, subtle shaping distinctions have more to 
do with emotional beneﬁ ts than functional ones. 
The form of a soda bottle, shampoo bottle, box 
of tea, individual tea bag, box of cereal, or candy 
mint container contributes to its brand personal-
ity, appeal, sensuality/tactility, and the relation-
ship to the audience.
All that a package is—visuals, form, color, 
typography, materials, and textures—will be 
absorbed as a total unit by each viewer. Most 
every person who looks at a package sees the 
whole package rather than the separate visual or 
tactile elements; however, each visual component 
has more of an effect on the individual than one 
realizes. Some visual components “cue” the viewer 
more than others.
Color plays a major role in cueing people as 
to ﬂ avor, scent, type, and contents of a particular 
product packaging. Color can also send a signal 
about status and quality. With only seconds (or 
a couple of minutes at most) to make a purchas-
ing decision in a supermarket or drugstore, color, 
visuals, and type must all work together to com-
municate brand essence and information. Dan 
Olson, creative director at Duffy & Partners, 
Minneapolis, says: “So much of food packaging 
is about appetite appeal. We don’t want our pota-
toes green or our ketchup blue, and the package 
shouldn’t miscue the experience of the product by 
incorporating inappropriate colors.”
Photography or illustrations on packaging play 
two important roles: they are cues that convey 
information while creating an emotional connec-
tion. Emotionally, visuals can cue the consumer 
to how he or she will feel after purchasing this 
product, which beneﬁ t will be reaped. For exam-
ple, a buoyant woman depicted on a nutritional 
supplement or the image of a ski slope on an oral 
hygiene product signals the resulting sensation 
after use.
Package copy includes brand name, product 
name, pertinent and required information, and 
a tag line or descriptor, which communicates the 
emotional and functional beneﬁ t of the brand. 
Typography communicates on a connotative level, 
hopefully working with all the visual elements to 
establish an effective brand identity, to establish 
the brand as individualistic and with spirit.
DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
Certainly, people make brand choices based on 
multiple factors. An individual’s state of mind, 
familiarity with a brand, and the brand’s func-
tional or emotional beneﬁ ts, quality or perfor-
mance, value related to cost, and convenience all 
inﬂ uence brand choices. In addition, exposure 
to advertising, promotions, brand associations, 
brand loyalty, and necessity, not to mention how 
receptive someone is to new or familiar items sit-
ting on the store shelf at any speciﬁ c moment, all 
play a part in inﬂ uencing which item we select.
For someone to be interested in purchasing a 
new brand, the package design must be intriguing 
enough for someone to want to pick it up in the 
ﬁ rst place—or pick it out amid myriad choices 
online. Many design experts believe that package 
design is the make-or-break decision for a person 
reaching for a product on the shelf. It is estimated 
that about 65 to 75 percent of purchase decisions 
are made standing in front of the packaging in 
the store.
Package design has that much inﬂ uence over 
your buying decision. The print ad, web banner, 
television commercial, or website you’ve seen or 
visited are in your memory bank, but the pack-
age—the most visceral, tangible brand experi-
ence—is right there in front of you, whether on 
the shelf or pictured on the retail web page; the 
packaging is the ﬁ nal brand experience you have 
before you make a purchase.
Beneﬁ ts 
There are both functional and emotional beneﬁ ts 
of any package design. The functional beneﬁ ts are 
part of the structure: how it holds the product, 
the materials, the weight, and how easy (or dif-
ﬁ cult) it is to use. If you think about condiment 
sauce packaging, you might consider packaging 
beneﬁ ts, such as excellent valve performance and 
a reliable dispensing closure. Those are deﬁ nitely 
worth considering when so many people com-
plain about ease of squeeze or leaky dispensers. 
That type of functional attribute appeals to us on 
a rational level, whereas color, visuals, and texture 
appeal to us on an emotional level.

ing and pouring easier; however, for each brand or

Chapter  11
Many eye-tracking studies have been con-
ducted on how people “read” a package. A clear 
visual hierarchy with a dominant visual or typo-
graphic treatment as the entry point will draw 
you into the composition. Then your eyes will go 
to the next element of emphasis in hierarchical 
order, and so on. Orchestrating ﬂ ow and rhythm 
will aid the composition and hierarchy. The 
clearer the cues, the fewer elements in the com-
position, the easier it will be to read the composi-
tion. Psychologically, people tend to be attracted 
most by visuals and, as mentioned earlier, often 
Clarity of Identiﬁ cation and Information
With so many brands on a store shelf, how will 
a shopper ﬁ nd a particular one? First, a package 
design has to be interesting enough for someone 
to notice it. Sound familiar? This is true for most 
graphic design. Usually when someone notices a 
package, he or she is also considering other prod-
ucts in the category, on the same shelf or in the 
same aisle, and giving roughly twenty seconds to 
all in consideration. Then, if the package holds 
the person’s interest, the shopper begins to scan 
the package for information.

In the store or at home, you want consumers 
to be able in a couple of seconds to decipher and 
comprehend product information. For example, 
Turner Duckworth’s brief for Homebase “was to 
create a range of packaging that communicated 
the breadth of their range of lawn seeds (Figure 
11-08). Consumer research had identiﬁ ed a need 
for single-minded beneﬁ t led communication in 
an area of the store where self-selection could end 
project the visual attributes of the package onto 
the product.
The visual hierarchy should not only ensure 
order, it should ensure a logical order. Some infor-
mation is more immediately critical to a shopper 
in the few seconds in front of a shelf, and the 
designer must understand that communication 
hierarchy, referred to as package architecture. 
As a shopper yourself, you know that you “hunt” 
for particular information on packaging, such as 
ﬂ avor, scent, size, quantity, or compatibility. If 
someone isn’t shopping for a speciﬁ c brand but 
scanning for a product descriptor such as ﬂ avor, 
form, or variety, how will he or she notice that 
information? How will someone be able to distin-
guish among brand extensions, between ﬂ avors, 
ingredients, or choices within a category such as 
tea, cookies, or baby food?
Number 17 uses two main cues to identify 
HOMEMADE BABY’s new line of organic 
baby food for their identity/package design 
shown in Figure 11-06: the dominant, bold, and 
playful visual denoting the food and the name of 
the food, such as “Just Apples,” directly under the 
logo. As you see here, to ensure a positive brand 
experience, information should be clear and con-
sistent across packages, similar to the positioning 
of elements on a website, so that people know 
where to look and can easily ﬁ nd information 
on each package. Color is an important design 
element in the packaging of products like food, 
toiletries, and beverages, often conjuring up key 
associations and used to designate ﬂ avor or fra-
grance choices. Color differentiates choices and 
can also unify a product line.
When the Dial Corporation needed to bring a 
unique experience to market, they engaged Wal-
lace Church to “help separate the men from the 
boys by making a more sophisticated statement 
on shelf. Wallace Church’s design was inspired 
by the elements that are critical to a young man’s 
active lifestyle—electronics, sports, energy drinks, 
and ﬁ rst impressions” (Figure 11-07). The male 
body spray category had already exploded onto 
the scene, so to differentiate the fragrances, color 
is used both on the pump and below the logo as 
the background for the fragrance name.

design solution “uses photographic imagery to 
highlight both the problem and solution using 
turf cut into shapes that consumers could identify 
with the needs of their lawn. For example, Lawn 
Revival uses a cross to indicate care; Lawn Feed, 
a heart.”
In Figure 11-09, for Sesmark Savory Minis, 
Wallace Church provides two cues to the ﬂ avor—
the name of the ﬂ avor placed in a distinct color 
band directly under the product name, and then 
to reinforce the name, a visual cue is strategically 
positioned directly under it—salt for one and 
garlic for the other. For the Multigrain Chips, 
the ﬂ avor name is reinforced by the photograph 
of the chips and by the bucolic photograph of a 
ﬁ eld of grain.

Wallace Church revolutionized the

Aesthetics are particularly important when 
the target audience is sophisticated, as in the 
target audience for The Gracious Gourmet, an 
identity and package design solution for a bou-
tique condiment company (Figure 11-11). Here 
the type of condiment is denoted in the same 
color across the product line; however, the color 
of the ﬂ avor/ingredient name changes along 
with the visual background.
PACKAGE DESIGN BASICS
What makes you notice any particular packaging 
sitting on a store shelf amidst numerous others? 
Take the walk-down-the-supermarket-aisle test 
to see which packaging stands out among the 
competition. Once a package stands out, is it well 
identiﬁ ed and is the information clear?
Most packaging is displayed on shelves in 
multiples, where we see the cumulative effect of 
several packages lined up next to one another, as 
well as how one brand looks competitively against 
another. (Online shopping may change how we 
view and react to packaging; however, once it is 
delivered to our homes, we interact with it.) How 
will a design look stacked on the shelf? Will each 
individual package make any implied visual con-
nections with the next? Will any patterns emerge? 
Connections?
Package design must be attractive, legible, and 
appropriate for its audience and marketplace. (See 
sidebar “Objectives for Effective Packaging.”)
The 2D and 3D of Package Design
Package design is a merging of two- and three-
dimensional design, promotional design, informa-
tion design, and engineering. The casing aspect 
of package design is three-dimensional. It’s the 
structural design; it’s a form (think carton, bottle, 
can, jar, tin, wrapper, bag, etc.) made out of mate-
rials and substrates (glass, metal, plastic, paper, 
and so on) possibly involving special ﬁ nishes. Your 
assignment may require designing a new struc-
tural form or for an existing form (think carbon-
ated soda can). Any packaging has several surfaces 
to be designed for graphics, and all sides must be 
OBJECTIVES
OBJECTIVES  FOR EFFECTIVE PACKAGING
• Design appropriately, with relevance, for the product, brand, and target audience.
• Make sure it has impact on the shelf or screen (when image is reduced).
• Differentiate from the competition; ensure identifi cation.
• Consider how the design fi ts into the broader visual identity system (if applicable).
• Ensure legibility and clarity of information.
• Consider the shelf context; the packaging will be seen in multiples when on display.
• Consider appropriate color associations and coding.
• Coordinate for differentiation and unity with other fl avors or choices or products in 
a product line.
• Realize that it may be seen on screen (reduced) for online shoppers. (When shop-
ping online, consumers view packaging on the computer screen, and its visual 
appeal must somehow remain effective in that setting.)
• Research materials and construction.
• Recommend using recycled and nontoxic materials and processes.

each plane of the form relates to every other must 
be taken into account. As with any design, it’s the 
best practice to solve the graphics and structural 
form design aspects at the same time, which would 
make for the most organic solution. For packaging, 
you do need to create a prototype. If the form is 
new, then a prototype would be constructed. If the 
form exists, you could start by sketching the face 
panels, with 2D sketches, and position them in a 
photo-editing program on a form. Does informa-
tion cross panels? Do planes line up when sitting 
next to another on the shelf? Can you create any 
visual connections among the panels/planes of the 
three-dimensional form?
As always, the design is based on a design con-
cept. And, as with some other applications that 
may be a series, you may have to determine how 
your concept will work for a line of products, and 
how you can differentiate among the products 
(think shampoo, conditioner, and body wash), 
make their functions clear, create visual interest, 
as well make sure they are uniﬁ ed as a series.
SUSTAINABILITY
All visual communication professionals should 
make an earnest attempt to practice sustainable 
design—design that incorporates environmental 
matters, also called eco-design, green design, or 
design for the environment, as did Chen Design 
Associates for The North Face in Figure 11-12, 
where materials with high percentages of post-
consumer content and environmentally friendly 
inks were used. Investigating how materials and 
processes impact on the environment, trouble-
shooting for potential hazards and wasteful-
ness is critical. Consider how materials affect 
(deplete, pollute, add unnecessary refuse to) the 
environment. We can make choices to use envi-
ronmentally friendlier materials and inks, as well 
as encourage clients to reduce packaging mate-
rials to essentials. (See sidebar “Eco-Friendly 
Design Concerns.”)

AUDIO PACK AGE DESIGN
For many people, listening to a CD at home 
involves contemplating the cover, reading the 
inside booklet and lyrics, and looking at the 
photographs of a favorite recording artist such 
as Willie Nelson (Figure 11-14). Like a poster, 
audio packaging takes on greater meaning. We 
may glance at a superbly designed shampoo bot-
tle with appreciation, but we study a CD cover 
intently! Looking at a CD cover becomes part of 
the listening experience. Also, audio packaging 
can draw in a new listener.
People feel very strongly about the music 
they enjoy and the recording artists they prefer. 
Audio package design absolutely must reﬂ ect 
the recording artist’s or group’s sensibility—no 
equivocations. The package design must express 
the unique quality of the artist or group, while 
inviting the browser in a music shop to pick up, 
consider, and purchase it. From your own musi-
cal preferences and those of other people in your 
life, you can understand how different people’s 
listening choices are and how a designer must 
not only address the recording artist—the audi-
ence must be addressed as well. Designing for a 
Broadway audience, as in Figure 11-15 for the 
musical Sweeney Todd, is different than designing 
for David Byrne’s audience as in Figure 11-16. 
“This round-cornered Feelings CD packaging 
features happy, angry, sad, and content David 
Byrne dolls. . . . The type was actually made as a 
model and then photographed,” says Sagmeister. 
One of the art directors working on this CD was 
the recording artist himself, David Byrne.
Special manufacturing techniques can help 
render an imaginative concept a reality, as shown 
help redeﬁ ne its brand expression. Small in size, 
with limited distribution, Pangea Organics was 
in need of an identity and brand language that 
would increase demand while embracing the sus-
tainability and organic living philosophies upon 
which the company was founded. IDEO explains 
the approach:
To learn more about Pangea Organics, IDEO 
visited the company’s facilities, where the team spoke 
with multiple stakeholders, from an herbalist to pro-
duction staff to board members. They also observed 
the company’s sustainable process for crafting 100 per-
cent organic soaps, lotions, and facial care products. A 
workshop followed the visit to promote brainstorm-
ing and idea sharing between the two companies. 
From the workshop, the IDEO team took inspiration 
from Pangea Organics’ dedication to sustainability 
and wellness, embodied in Pangea Organics’ products, 
practices, and emerging nonproﬁ t—the Pangea Insti-
tute—to which 25 percent of the company’s proﬁ ts go 
to support sustainability research and education.
Equipped with a deep understanding of Pangea 
Organics’ core values, IDEO deﬁ ned the company’s

Sagmeister of his innovative design solution 
(Figure 11-19).
Often, images of recording artists are featured 
on CD covers. When that solution isn’t the best 
route, just as with any graphic design problem, you 
can visualize and compose a concept in a variety of 
compelling ways. In Figure 11-20, John Clifford 
notes, “The repetition of the texture of the pen line, 
along with the lines’ endpoints as edges, make a 
unique CD cover for this band.” For Figure 11-21,

True to the album title, Fantastic 
Spikes Through Balloon, we 
photographed all the balloon-like 
objects we could think of (sausage, 
fart cushion, blowfi sh, etc.), and 
punched a lot of holes through 
them. Simple.
Since the band did not want 
their audience to read the lyrics

is not a poetry affair”), the words 
to the songs are printed fl ipped so 
they are only readable when seen

SOLUTION
Visual Dialogue looks at these CD covers as basi-
cally 4 3⁄4" square ads. Using just a few elements—
photo, artist’s name, and title—we create covers 
that engage the desired audience while also giv-
ing a sense of the music. The end result is a visu-
ally distinctive and memorable identity that lasts 
for years.

PROBLEM
Rounder Records is an independent label special-
izing in music ranging from reggae to bluegrass, 
blues to folk, and a few genres that defy categori-
zation. With every release it’s important to have 
the design reﬂ ect the character of the featured 
artist and the music they create.

➏ How will this be communicated?
» Identity design and package design
» Applications: logo, signage, package design, 
store environment including uniforms
Note that package design should include at least fi ve 
elements: cups, bags, boxes, et cetera. Include one 
unusual shape and be aware of texture and color pal-
ette especially. 
Optional: Include seasonal packaging or specialty 
items beyond the basic group. Additionally, design 
the environment of the café. 
➐ What is the tonality of the communication?
» Sophisticated; a rich food experience
If you have your own strategy, you may expand or 
change any of it, but you will need to rewrite the brief.
CHOCOLATE CAFÉ 
BRAND IDENTITY CONCEPT
Suggested point of departure for concept and art 
direction provided by Rose Gonnella, Professor of 
Visual Communications, and Executive Director of the 
Robert Busch School of Design, Kean University.
What approach will you take to communicate a 
sense of sophistication and richness (perhaps even 
of the exotic)? Think in terms of comparisons, for 
instance, make an association to ancient cultures 
that developed the use of cocoa; compare with Euro-
pean cultures that manufacture the world’s best; sim-
ply relate to gold and the color of chocolate itself.
RESEARCH
Read about chocolate. Have a chocolate tasting 
party. Survey people about their chocolate tastes. 
Talk to friends about chocolate—see what leads 
they might give you.
ART
a. Color—select a palette of three or fi ve colors 
that will communicate the idea of sophistica-
tion, richness, and/or the exotic. The color 
choices should be based on research as well.
b. Texture—select a pattern/texture that will tac-
tilely compel the viewer. Chocolate is a sensory 
experience, so the identity should be as well, 
and there is no better visual way than through 
texture.
c. Type—as always, the typeface should be in an 
appropriate and complementary “voice.”

EXERCISE 11-1
COLOR
Did you know that ancient civilizations may have 
held the belief that chocolate has magical powers? 
When was sugar fi rst added to chocolate? Does 
chocolate have medicinal benefi ts? Research the 
history of chocolate.
Create three different color palettes that would 
be appropriate for a Chocolate Café identity aimed 
at women ages 15–54. At least one of the palettes 
should not imitate the actual color of chocolate.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A BROCHURE?
When you visit a travel agency, bank, nonproﬁ t outreach organization, or any number of 
businesses or organizations, you will most likely be handed a brochure or series of brochures 
(Figure 12-01). A brochure is a widely used tool, a multiple-page application for communi-
cating information or for promotion (sales and marketing); it is also called a booklet (depend-
ing on binding and trim size) or pamphlet. Whether in print or PDF, whether external or 
internal business communication, people rely on brochures for their efﬁ ciency and content. 
A project may involve the design of a single brochure or a brochure system, a series of related 
brochures. A cohesive brochure system serves two main functions: to increase brand or group 
recognition and to provide comprehensible information or communication in digestible 
amounts, with each brochure covering a different topic, service, or product.
The subject matter of a brochure or brochure system can be any topic related to any com-
mercial, educational, government, health, or nonproﬁ t sector. For example, Figure 12-02 is 
an annual appeal for the Scojo Foundation, an organization devoted to providing affordable 
eyeglasses to tailors, electricians, and goldsmiths around the world who live in poverty and 
depend on their jobs for a livelihood. Utilized for internal communication (aimed at manag-
ers, a sales force, or employees) or for external communication (general public or a target 
audience), brochures run the full gamut from being information driven to almost seeming 
A
BROCHURE JUST MIGHT BE THE MOST WIDELY 
USED AND VERSATILE GRAPHIC DESIGN APPLICATION, SERVING MANY 
PURPOSES. IN A FEW PAGES, WITH TEXT AND IMAGES, A BRAND STORY CAN 
BE TOLD, INFORMATION CONVEYED, INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED, PRODUCTS 
DISPLAYED, OR DESIRE CREATED. OTHER SIMILAR APPLICATIONS COMMONLY 
USED BY A VARIETY OF COMMERCIAL AND NONPROFIT SECTORS INCLUDE 
PROMOTIONAL OR INFORMATIONAL BOOKLETS AND BOOKS, AS WELL AS 
COMMON CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS SUCH AS ANNUAL REPORTS, 
OFFERING MEMORANDUMS, BOOKLETS, CATALOGS, DIRECT MAIL, AND 
SALES KITS. WHAT IS COMMON AMONG THESE FORMATS IS THEY HAVE 
MULTIPLE PAGES OR PANELS, AND THEIR PURPOSE DIFFERS FROM OTHER 
PUBLICATION DESIGN IN THAT THEIR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES INVOLVE 
TOPICS OTHER THAN EDITORIAL CONTENT. WE WILL EXAMINE TWO OF THE 
MOST PREVALENT ONES—BROCHURES AND ANNUAL REPORTS—AND ALSO 
LOOK AT EXAMPLES OF A NEWSLETTER, OFFERING MEMORANDUM, BOOKLET 
AND BOOK FORMAT, CATALOG, AND DIRECT MAIL.

new identity system featuring a simplifi ed name, a new symbol, and fresh, 
new visual environments. Signs for Cole Taylor’s bank locations feature the 
bold new corporate signature and color scheme. Large, exterior monument 
signs and interior wall graphics use dimensional letters to update and unify 
the bank’s image and provide connectivity among facilities having varied 
architecture. Promotional, informational, and fi nancial communications 
used to support the Cole Taylor brand position are driven by the company 
“voice,” defi ned by qualities such as “intelligent, customer-focused, relevant, 
approachable, and trustworthy.”

For any integrated media project, there may 
be many deliverables such as logo, visual iden-
tity, web and online media, packaging, sales kits, 
and others.
When a brochure or brochure system is part of 
a broader marketing or communication program, 
the design objectives strategically relate back to 
the greater design brief and its core goals and val-
ues. Once you have gone through orientation and 
analysis, conceptual design begins with examin-
ing the content and formulating a design concept 
based on strategy, content, brand, and an insight. 
Figure 12-04 was funded by Sappi Ideas That 
Matter for CYCLE Kids Inc., an independent, 
nonproﬁ t organization introducing children to 
the joys of cycling, the beneﬁ ts of healthy eating, 
and the world of physical science. According to 
Sappi, this brochure “invites readers to reminisce 
about the sheer joy of owning and riding a bike as 
a child, how good it feels to exercise, how healthy 
it is for the body and the heart. Using these 
stories as a starting point, each of the collateral 
pieces informs readers about how the organiza-
tion empowers children to stay ﬁ t and how much 
they beneﬁ t from the program.”

Objective: An Asian-focused web 
hosting company combines a classic 
Asian motif with an integrated 
circuit, conveying connection, 
integration, and the linking of 
cultures through technology.
The presentation folder uses the 
logo as an Asian string-tie clasp to 
provide prospective clients in Asia 
with the experience of unwrapping a 
gift. Folder pockets evoke a Chinese 
moon-gate shape and rivets of an 
Asian door, symbolic of iAsiaWorks 
providing its customers with a 
gateway into Asia.
Product data sheets combine 
Asian and technology metaphors 
to create a unique visual language 
for the company.
Results: The comprehensive, 
integrated branding program 
successfully launched the 
iAsiaWorks brand in all of their 
important markets throughout 
Asia, leading the company to a 
successful purchase by AT&T.

like picture view books. Each individual unit in a 
brochure system (series) covers one subject in a 
series of related topics—for example, the various 
major areas of study at a university or the various 
types of banking services.
A brochure may be one part of a larger infor-
mation program or a comprehensive, integrated 
branding program for a brand or group, as you saw 
in Figure 12-01. Figure 12-03 shows a branding 
program for iAsiaWorks, an Asian-focused web 
hosting and Internet service provider that sought 
to be the dominant player for global companies 
trying to do business in Asia and Asian companies 
seeking world markets. This brochure is a trade-
show giveaway. Earl Gee, Gee + Chung, com-
ments, “Using a format inspired by Asian folding 
screens, a pocket-sized tradeshow giveaway deﬁ nes 
iAsiaWorks’ services on the front while providing 
useful travel tips and business protocol for each 
country of operations on the back.”

For Figure 12-05, Brenda McManus and Gio-
vanni Jubert designed a newsletter on the concept 
of “U” for the graduate department of the Com-
munication Design Program at Pratt Institute. 
McManus comments, “It was to be a piece that 
would explore the diversity of our GradComD 
program as a whole, a piece that would become a 
tool to encourage community, identity, and stu-
dent union.”
Design Development of a Brochure
Once you have generated a design concept, your 
visualization process may partly be dictated by 
brand guidelines, where type of imagery or look 
and feel is predetermined. A brochure’s design 
may be based on characteristics of the visual iden-
tity; for example, when P.E.O. (Philanthropic 
Educational Organization) wanted to revitalize 
their visual identity, they turned to Sayles Graphic 
Design (see “Before and After: P.E.O./Sayles 
Graphic Design”). The ﬂ ower graphic that punc-
tuates the new logo and color palette is the same 
used on collateral materials.
When a brochure is less tied to the visual iden-
tity, then you determine a greater degree of the

NEWSLETTER
• DESIGNERS: BRENDA MCMANUS, GIOVANNI JUBERT
Our concept was “U” so it only seemed natural that our 
structure came from the letterform “U.” We decided 
to create our newsletter by hand collage; this was 
an intentional decision to drive home our underlying 
message of “What U put in = What U get out.” We wanted 
to make our process visible.
The newsletter folds down to 9 × 12 and opens into a 
24 × 36 poster. The fi rst fold opens to the Letter from 
the Chair and our Diary of a Newsletter. The second 
fold then opens to reveal the heart of our research, the 
information graphics that visually depict the statistics 
of our department. They serve as a visual interpretation 
of the student “voice” represented in orange juxtaposed 
with the faculty “voice” represented in white. Below the 
graphics and on the fi nal panels of our newsletter are the 
interviews of our alumni and senior faculty. The last fold 
opens up to reveal a 24 × 36 poster made up of “U’s.” 
In the composition one “U” is separated from the rest 
by color to communicate our underlying message. The 
usage of color helps link the individual to the message. 
It helps establish the individual’s identity within the 
greater context of the community of the Pratt graduate 
design program.

OLD LOGO/BANNER
“As with many organizations that have been 
around a long time, P.E.O.’s identity elements 
had become somewhat tired and lacked continu-
ity. Yet the organization did not want to lose the 
equity it had invested in its symbolism.”
NEW LOGO/BANNER
Not wanting to abandon the past altogether, 
designer John Sayles chose a marguerite as part 
of P.E.O.’s new identity; the daisy look-alike has 
been the group’s ofﬁ cial symbol since its found-
ing in 1869. Upon the new logo’s introduction, 
members were told that it “is not meant to replace 
the historic ‘star’ emblem, but rather serves as an 
alternate way of identifying our sisterhood.” The
palette chosen for P.E.O.’s identity—PMS 584, 
208, and 116—is fresh and contemporary yet 
retains a connection with history and tradition.

to relate to identity issues? Obtain speciﬁ cations 
and identity guidelines.
2/ What type of content: Obtain copy, 
required imagery, logo, signatures, taglines, and 
any graphic components, such as charts, graphs, 
or pictograms. Understanding content will guide 
your design decisions and help you determine 
how to design the grid.
3/ How you will communicate the content: 
Determine how to communicate with clarity, a 
comprehensible hierarchy, and impact. Deter-
mine whether your design will be copy driven or 
image driven.
4/ How the brochures function in context 
(how they are distributed, seen and used): If 
you think of a brochure as related sound bites of 
information or as an efﬁ cient workhorse, it may 
help you understand that its purpose is to make 
communication extremely easy to understand for 
the reader—the public, a sales force, a patient, a 
student, a citizen, or anyone on the receiving end.
5/ Budget will help in determining paper, visu-
als, printing, special printing techniques, and color 
(two-color, four-color, Pantone versus process 
visualization, including the sort of artwork (illus-
tration, photography, typography, etc.). For this 
European shoemaker’s introduction to the United 
States, Chen Design Associates built identity, a 
retail brochure, and packaging inspired by Ada-
mo’s meticulously designed shoes (Figure 12-06). 
To announce Capital Printing Corporation’s green 
certiﬁ cations, Rizco Design developed a direct 
mail piece that is a trifold brochure, with an inside 
pocket that housed additional sheets with instruc-
tions to “make your own” origami heart, tree, and 
windmill (see “Case Study: Capital Printing Cor-
poration Goes Green/Rizco Design”).
Five Things to Factor into Design 
There are ﬁ ve main issues to keep in mind 
when designing brochures or similar corporate 
communications:
1/ How the brochure system will work with 
the existing visual identity system: Will the 
brochures be largely visually related to the brand 
identity through color palette, look and feel, 
signature, typefaces, kind of imagery, and tone? 
Will the brochure be independent but still need

CASE STUDY
C A P I TA L  P R I N T I N G  C O R P O R A T I O N  G O E S  G R E E N / R I Z C O  D E S I G N
OVERVIEW
Capital Printing Corporation (CPC) was chal-
lenged to develop a marketing piece to introduce 
their two environmentally friendly certiﬁ cations, 
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Sustain-
able Forestry Initiative (SFI), and announce that 
a portion of the plant had been converted over to 
green power. The goal was to target existing cli-
ents and attract new ones, especially agencies.
DESIGN CHALLENGE
Rizco Design, a seven-year client of CPC, was 
enlisted to take on the task of creating a piece that 
would make a “green” statement in both its design 
and message. Knowing that printing and paper 
choices have a major impact on the environment, 
our goal was to make sustainable design choices 
throughout the process: this included minimizing 
resources, choosing FSC-certiﬁ ed paper stocks 
and turning to vendors who utilize wind power.
DESIGN SOLUTION
A tri-fold brochure titled Nurture Nature Em-
power featuring an origami heart, tree, and 
wind mill was born. The piece tied in CPC’s 
announcements and educational information 
about printing and the environment. The inside 
of the brochure included a pocket that housed 
(1) a business card and (2) patterned sheets with 
directions on how to make your own origami rep-
lications. This dimensional leave-behind acted 
as a reminder that CPC is an environmentally 
friendly vendor.
SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION
Though the piece was designed to minimize 
resources, the print production process offered 
many challenges.
Paper selection was a top priority, and the choice 
of turning to Mohawk Paper was only natural due 
to its extensive variety of high quality, yet sustain-
able, recycled, FSC-certiﬁ ed, wind powered, and 
carbon neutral paper lines. As a result, two differ-
ent paper stocks were selected. First, wind pow-
ered and FSC-approved Mohawk Options Cream

for the inside. Opaque PMS colors were selected 
to ensure color consistency and density against 
both uncoated paper stocks. The result on this 
piece proved that a design can be environmentally 
responsible without sacriﬁ cing print quality.
Secondly, retouching played a critical role, since 
the photography of the origami needed to repro-
duce accurately on two different colored papers. 
Additionally, the investment in color correcting 
helped to eliminate unnecessary press time when 
it came to matching color on press. Last, a mul-
tiple process bindery using recyclable dyes and 
water-based glues ensured that the end product 
would be as recyclable as possible.
MEASURING THE RESULTS
The results were measured through the Beleaf 
report card. Rizco Design’s Beleaf program is a 
three-tiered model that measures environmental 
decision making throughout the creative process 
in the ﬁ rm—starting with how the ofﬁ ce oper-
ates, to how the design is established, and ﬁ nally, 
to how projects are printed. Some of the major 
changes include converting the ofﬁ ce to 100 per-
cent wind power, restructuring our vendor base 
to include FSC-certiﬁ ed printers, and specify-
ing recycled and/or FSC-certiﬁ ed paper stocks 
from mills that are using green power. The goal 
for clients is to reach 70 percent sustainability 
on each project. After a project is completed, the 
end-result is rated through a web-based tool, and 
an electronic report card will be distributed to 
clients to showcase the sustainability of their job, 
enabling them to witness the impact ﬁ rst hand.
How did Capital’s piece measure up? An 87!
FINAL STATEMENT
The success of this project is a testament to the 
beneﬁ ts that agencies, paper mills, and printers 
reap when they work hand-in-hand in the devel-
opment of green products.

seen in particular contexts: on tabletops, in wall 
unit dispensers, on counters, or in racks. Brochures 
can be mailed directly to people’s homes or busi-
nesses, too. Determine how the brochure system 
will be seen and distributed before making layout 
decisions. For example, there are practical consid-
erations: if brochures are displayed in racks, only 
the top portion of the brochures may be seen ini-
tially, and that should be a design consideration. If 
a brochure is mailed, then space for the addressee 
needs to be taken into account.
Sometimes function gets lost while we’re busy 
creating, but it never should be forsaken. In fact, 
function can and should be the springboard for 
creativity, as in Figure 12-07, for Brave Nood 
World, which “is a brand manifesto for Nood 
Fashion, an eco-minded carpet brand. It func-
tions as both brochure and presentation in order 
to be ﬁ scally efﬁ cient. Tearing apart the perfo-
rated creases of the book reveals detailed content 
about each spread—this mimics the format of the 
accompanying online slide show. The slide show 
was designed to supplement the book. Sales reps 
for Nood may use the slide show or booklet for 
presentations and then leave the book with a cus-
tomer afterward. The idea is to ease a potential 
customer into this information. The photogra-
phy consists of staged snapshots from around our 
ofﬁ ce because of the low production budget. This 
lo-ﬁ  approach works appropriately with Nood’s 
street-smart aesthetic.”

Public Architecture identifi es and solves 
practical problems of human interaction 
in the built environment. It acts as a catalyst for public discourse through education, advocacy, 
and the design of public spaces and amenities. Believing that design is a process of making 
things that build constructive values directly into the work, the team from MendeDesign of San 
Francisco saw a coming together of their own values and vision with those of Public Architecture. 
They identifi ed in particular with the 1% program, an attempt to bring design sensitivity to the 
non-profi t sector, a sector typically woefully short of access to thoughtful space planning and 
design. By pairing non-profi t organizations with interested architects, the 1% program enables 
those organizations to develop more healthy, dignifi ed, effi cient, user-friendly and meaningful 
working environments that function to better serve their clients and overall mission.

MendeDesign “came up with the 1% User’s 
Guide, a package of related print materials that 
seek to forge real, project-oriented, working rela-
tionships between architects and 501(c)(3), non-
proﬁ t organizations. The 1% User’s Guide consists 
of two booklets: one written to engage principals 
of architecture ﬁ rms, the other to engage the 
executive directors of non-proﬁ t organizations in 
need of design services (Figure 12-08). The two 
booklets are adjoined, sharing a single spine. In 
this way the architect’s booklet leads into the back 
of the non-proﬁ t booklet, and the non-proﬁ t 
booklet leads into the architect’s booklet, creat-
ing a physical model of the architect-non-proﬁ t 
relationship the project advocates.”
Function along with budget should also help 
you determine if “more” than a brochure or 
booklet is warranted or useful. Perhaps a short 
book would better fulﬁ ll your strategic objec-
tives. Books are less ephemeral and may be kept 
rather than thrown away. The page count also may 
provide the space needed to communicate the 
required content or make the appropriate impact.

I choose to do this piece for 
Depelchin because I am adopted. 
And I could not imagine being 8, 
12 or 16 years old and not having 
parents, not having a place to come 
home to, parents to take you to the 
park to play or attend your little 
league baseball game. That, on top 
of the horribly abusive situations all 
of the Depelchin kids come from, I 
just could not fathom that. So we 
decided that the piece would be a 
sort of “recruitment piece” for what 
Depelchin calls “forever families.”
Depelchin has to actually 
recruit families. This is an ongoing 
process where they have monthly 
orientations and events. And they 
have to recruit because these are 
not newborn babies that are up for 
adoption. These are kids who come 
from sexual, emotional, verbal and 
physically abusive situations. They 
are not going to come into your 
home and immediately love you and 
everything is going to be great. There 
are going to be issues, and there’s 
going to be counseling and acting 
out. It’s all these kids know. But it’s 
also a very rewarding process for 
these new parents.
The piece was designed to give 
a little background on why it’s 
important to adopt, some background 
on Depelchin and the adoption 
process, and some discussion on 
different types of adoption scenarios 
(empty nesters adopting a child, 
interracial adoptions, same sex 
adoptions, multi-sibling adoptions, 
etc.). But the heart of the piece 
are the profi les or case studies of 
different Depelchin kids.

piece,” for Depelchin Children’s Center (Figure 
12-09), Doug Hebert remarks, “We thought it 
was a great way to inspire action and provide a 
sense of hope by featuring successful stories of 
kids and families brought together through this 
process. To truly appreciate the ‘happy endings,’ 
we also needed to feature some of the sad stories 
of abuse the kids came from. So we would have 
a negative story and then a positive story to con-
trast it. We did three features of each in total. We 
wanted the piece to be sized smaller, to make it 
feel a little more personal and ‘storybook-like’ and 
we used warm, bright, happy colors to truly put a 
positive spin on this process.”
Format
At times, you will have to work with a standard 
size format and speciﬁ cations, or you will need to 
determine size based on objectives, concept, need, 
context, and budget. If you do have a choice, then 
trim size and layout should depend on your design 
concept. For the Depelchin Children’s Center, 
the designers wanted the piece to size smaller to 
be “storybook-like.” For the DCM IV Offering

Memorandum, Gee + Chung’s solution was an 
unconventional 10" w × 13.5" oversized format, 
plastic cover, Japanese binding, and French-fold 
pages to set the book apart and position DCM as 
a venture ﬁ rm committed to thinking differently 
(Figure 12-10). For this venture capital ﬁ rm, the 
book uses a transparent plastic cover and familiar 
ﬁ nancial symbols to interactively reveal the clear 
difference their fund offers investors.
“This admission catalog for Art Center College 
of Design has an oversized format and is printed 
on uncoated paper to give the publication a mag-
azine-like feel. The large type, large illustrations, 
and abundance of white space are used to make 
the book approachable and inviting to use. The 
structure of the book is meant to show off the 
school’s main asset, the quality of its student body, 
by devoting the majority of the pages to student 
work,” comments Matsumoto of Figure 12-11. 
Figure 12-12 is a catalog created for the “Bur-
row” exhibit at Oakville Galleries that “shows off 
the featured art to best advantage, and, through 
production and design, communicates a feeling 
of depth, of hidden elements, reinforcing the 
exhibit’s burrowing theme. The concrete, tactile 
elements of the catalogue—exposed stitching and 
tipped-in essay booklets—recall and continue the 
viewer’s experience of ‘Burrow,’” explains creative 
director Fidel Pena.
Grid
Once you determine the size, design the grid. 
Make sure it is ﬂ exible enough to allow for variety, 
to work for a system of brochures, and to accom-
modate the content (copy, including subtitles and 
captions, and visuals). The width of the columns 
is key to the accommodation of content. Since 
visuals usually need greater width, consider the 
ratio of text to visuals when designing the grid.
› Will you combine text and visuals on every 
panel?
› Will panels be dedicated to only text or visuals?
› Also consider a modular-oriented grid for ﬂ ex-
ibility. Make sure to be mindful of margins, too.
As you compose the layout, keep rhythm and 
pacing across panels in mind. Design panels with a 
sense of ﬂ ow from one panel to another by minding 
alignments, contrasting, and repeating elements

designing PDF ﬁ les, prototyping on paper helps 
you work through any compositional issues.
to establish continuity across surfaces. Contrast 
provides visual interest; however, a great degree of 
variation in sizes of type and images might col-
lapse the grid structure and look fragmented.
Utilizing a type family and a limited color pal-
ette helps maintain unity.
Brochure System
When designing a brochure system, there should 
be enough difference among the brochures to dis-
tinguish one from another. Each brochure should 
be able to stand alone, as a strong individual piece, 
as well as belong to the other brochures. Modular 
systems or chunking information is an interesting 
route for brochure systems.
Many designers utilize the same layout for a 
cover system, where graphic components reside 
in the same positions on each cover. This ensures 
unity among covers, but it should also allow 
for differentiation among the individual pieces 
through the use of color, image, title, or a com-
bination thereof.

Some designers specialize in corporate com-
munications with an emphasis on annual reports. 
“This ﬁ eld is specialized to the point that most 
clients want you to have experience in doing an 
annual report before they will ever trust you with 
one,” says Denise M. Anderson, design director of 
DMA. Also, some printers specialize in high-end 
annual reports, ones requiring high-quality print-
ing, special techniques, binding, and folding.
Components of an Annual Report
Most annual reports are divided into two sections. 
The front of the report carries the editorial and 
promotional content and contains the most attrac-
tive marketing elements, such as photography or 
illustrations, the CEO’s letter to shareholders, and 
thematic statements. The back of the report con-
tains all the required statistics, what some call the 
“10K wrap.” In fact, some may include the statis-
tics as an insert on different paper, enclosed in a 
back pocket, or stitched to the report.
Today, a corporate website can host the required 
annual statistics (the 10K wrap), leaving the printed 
annual report to be more of a corporate image 
tool, although still part of a required document. 
Some corporations post their entire annual report 
online—giving a visitor the ability to download an 
annual report as a PDF—as well as publish a print 
document. Depending on the company, whether it 
is a Fortune 500 company, a recent initial public 
offering (IPO), or a smaller corporation, the annual 
report may take more emphasis online than in print, 
or the parts may supplement each other.

ANNUAL REPORTS
An annual report is a document of record, published 
yearly by a publicly held corporation, that contains 
information about the corporation’s ﬁ scal condi-
tion. Essentially, it is a required report to stock-
holders and an important corporate document. 
This report—distributed to employees, stockhold-
ers, and potential stockholders—contains detailed 
information such as the income statement, balance 
sheet, description of the corporation’s operations, 
and general reports about management and opera-
tions. Given access to a corporation’s information 
on the Internet, many investors, fund managers, 
securities analysts, and corporations still maintain 
that an annual report is the single most important 
document produced by a company.
During the mid-twentieth century, when cor-
porations realized the importance of a corporate 
visual identity to the success of their businesses, 
they began to use the annual report as an oppor-
tunity to enhance their corporate identity and to 
“promote” their corporate message—the corpo-
rate ethos, drive, and main concerns.
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF 
AN ANNUAL REPORT
Certainly, a website and visual identity may carry 
more importance as visual communication tools; 
however, for a single document, an annual report 
still carries enormous weight in the minds of 
key players. Why? An annual report is not only 
a required corporate document, regulated in the 
United States by the SEC, but it is also a market-
ing tool—a visual communication tool that con-
veys a corporate image. Some think of an annual 
report as a strategic positioning vehicle as well. 
Because this document includes, very signiﬁ cantly, 
the discussion of ﬁ nancial results and the CEO’s 
letter to investors, its message carries important 
meaning to most of its target audience.
An annual report describes the state (health) of 
a company as well as predictions and intentions 
for the future, comparable to the U.S. president’s 
State of the Union address. One or more corpo-
rate communications executives work closely with 
a design ﬁ rm to guide the content (and perhaps 
the theme) of an annual report.

statement, enhance a corporate image, highlight 
achievements or strong points, or explain major 
corporate actions. A design concept for an annual 
report may hinge on a theme, a unifying quality, 
subject, or idea and involve a motif, a repeated 
shape, pattern, or image. All visual components—
photography, illustration, graphs, and charts—
should be related to the theme, the corporate 
voice, and the tone of the copy. Tim Bruce, art 
director, explains LOWERCASE’s conceptual 
thinking behind the annual reports for Chicago 
Volunteer Legal Services (CVLS) (Figure 12-13). 
Bruce comments: “We design the CVLS annual 
reports backwards. Most organizations concept 
the annual, get the directions approved, and then 
build out the piece. We talk with CVLS about 
the year, the industry, the issues that are top of 
mind, the challenges and opportunities that have 
presented themselves. From this, we build a mix 
of client and lawyer proﬁ les that reﬂ ect these 
issues. Instead of trying to ﬁ t our concept to the 
people, we let the people and the year form our 
concept. It’s organic and it relies on a high level 
of trust from CVLS. For CVLS it reﬂ ects the way 
they work and why they are so good at what they 
do.” When I asked Bruce about how this annual 
report was visualized, he responded:
“This is a perfect example of the concept being 
driven by what is at hand. The drawing (scratch 
board, something all school age kids have done) was

Annual reports become much more signiﬁ cant 
during challenging economic times. This is the 
time when clear communication is valued the 
most. If an annual report can deliver its message 
concisely, it can only beneﬁ t the company.
An economic downturn is an important time 
to stand out from the crowd. During such times, 
a company needs to prove that it is thinking dif-
ferently from its competitors.
What do you think about the current state of 
today’s Annual Reports (ARs)?
It is obvious that annual reports are going 
through a major transition. Investors are going 
online to download annual reports as PDFs more 
and more each year. It seems that annual reports 
are viewed on screen more frequently than they 
are in print. With that said, not all investors have 
access to online annuals, or they prefer to hold 
something in their hands. Printed annual reports 
are still critical. They are tactile. Investors can get 
a good sense of what a company is by how the 
book feels.
What changes have you noticed in annual reports?
The days of the really extravagant books are 
over. The creative is becoming more concise. The 
paper is thinner, print runs are shorter, and the 
MD&A [Management Discussion and Analy-
sis] is getting longer. The standard AR format is 
being challenged, and books are becoming more 
inventive.
In which direction do you see the annual 
report moving?
Digital. It is only a matter of time before we see 
highly interactive web versions of annual reports, 
perhaps involving complex animations and even 
video clips. There’s no reason why a president’s let-
ter to the shareholders couldn’t be a video clip. The 
AR might become more of a corporate report pro-
ﬁ ling the past year’s events and future objectives. 
Detailed ﬁ nancial info would be available online.
What are companies looking for when it comes 
to designing an annual report?
Companies are looking for designers to under-
stand the challenges that their industry is in. 
They’re also looking for efﬁ ciency, reliable pro-
cess, someone who can quickly understand their 
company and how they ﬁ t into the competitive 
mix. And someone who can take all of that and 
produce an AR that is interesting and different.
Do you and the client both view the AR as part 
of the company’s communications strategy?
Absolutely. An annual report is a great oppor-
tunity for a company to evaluate, revise, and rein-
force their communications strategy. The AR is 
a very important part of Anderson’s communi-
cations message. It is one of the only times they 
communicate with their complete investor base.

DESIGN DEVELOPMENT 
OF AN ANNUAL REPORT
Juggling a large amount of content and many 
components—graphs, charts, lists, large blocks of 
text, product information, ﬁ nancial statistics, data, 
photographs, and graphic elements—is part of 
designing an annual report and demands the use 
of a ﬂ exible, well-designed grid. The grid should 
be able to accommodate text, images, and infor-
mation graphics, such as charts and graphs. If you 
visualize your concept with an image-driven com-
position or with a text-driven design, it will inﬂ u-
ence your grid design.
To help guide your grid design, determine
› the number, sizes, and type of information 
graphics required at the outset
› print and online components
› how imagery relates to concept or theme
› visualization of information graphics as related 
to the concept or theme
› paper (cover stock and text stock) for visualiza-
tion and quality
During visualization, determine the kind of 
visuals and how they will be presented—silhou-
etted, collaged, squared-up halftones, duotone 
(a halftone picture made of two printed colors), 
tritone (a halftone picture made of three printed 
colors), bleeds, or ghosting (a faint printed 
image). Choose imagery that will demonstrate 
the entity’s values and attributes and that will best 
illustrate and exemplify the theme or design con-
cept. If you are using a motif, think of how much 
variation you can incorporate while maintaining 
the meaning and integrity of the motif. Again, a 
common thread in how imagery is visualized will 
help unify multiple pages. All information graph-
ics (charts, graphs, lists, diagrams) should have a 
similar style—a uniﬁ ed visual language.
Whether for an annual report or any multi-
page corporate communication, during visual-
ization and composing, it is advisable to design 
two or three spreads and single pages that have 
slightly different visual/text relationships, yet 
share enough common characteristics to unify 
them, to see how pages will ﬂ ow. Differing the 
spreads will add contrast and visual interest while 
varying the reading pace.
noting that those organizations that do spend more 
time and money addressing the red tape that comes 
attached to the money than dealing with the rea-
son they exist—to provide equal access to the law for 
the poor and working poor of Chicago and the sur-
rounding regions).
“The illustrations are crude, creative and reﬂ ect 
the hardworking pragmatic way CLVS addresses the 
larger issue at hand.”
When I asked how they select their compelling 
color palettes, Bruce replied:
“Our process is intuitive but not without reason. 
Color is subjective but also reﬂ ective of the industry 
and CVLS. We might note unusual color combina-
tions while out on a shoot, or in a lawyer’s ofﬁ ce (on 
a book, a ﬁ le, etc.) or in the neighborhood of a clinic 
or client that we might store away in our minds as 
interesting. But the color, like type, paper, cropping, 
illustration, etc. adds meaning. The pink for instance, 
while odd in the context of an annual report, is an 
exact match of typical phone message pads—some-
thing the lawyers are using all the time and reﬂ ective 
of the work that goes into the 17,000 cases they work 
on every year.”
THEME
The process for generating a theme is the same 
as for concept generation. Some platforms for 
theme generation can be:
› the entity’s mission
› the company’s charitable undertakings
› the topic of the CEO’s letter or other research 
or information
› the entity’s accomplishments, activities, changes, 
or achievements of the past year as a springboard
› a brand icon, character, or product
› a general platform, such as family, giving, 
growth, advancement, development, cultural ref-
erence, or looking toward the future
› an intangible platform, such as responsibility, 
brotherhood, or ﬁ ghting against tyranny
› a visual platform, for example, visual juxtaposi-
tions, structure versus fantasy, a visual merge of 
two objects, or a high-tech look
› a metaphor

CASE STUDY
T H E  R O C K E F E L L E R  F O U N D A T I O N / E M E R S O N , 
WA J D O W I C Z  S T U D I O S  ( E W S )
The Rockefeller Foundation is a knowledge-based 
leading global foundation with a commitment to 
enrich and sustain the lives and livelihoods of 
poor and excluded people throughout the world. 
Emerson, Wajdowicz Studios (EWS) are creative 
consultants to the foundation and the designers 
of the foundation’s outstanding annual reports.
EWS’s relationship with the foundation is 
an example of a strong, long-term, trusted, and 
creative partnership between the client and 
the designers, which, over time has produced 
a remarkably high number of the outstanding 
printed publications seen in the nonproﬁ t world.
Here are examples of two annual reports cre-
ated by EWS from over a dozen produced to 
date by the Rockefeller Foundation. Every year 
the communications challenges and objectives 
may vary. What is consistent, however, is the 
outstanding narrative and original photography. 
Among the photographers working under photo 
direction of Jurek Wajdowicz are world-renowned 
photojournalists such as Philip Jones-Grifﬁ ths, 
Antonin Kratochvil, Steve McCurry, and Jonas 
Bendiksen (whose work is shown here).
This very hands-on art direction and daily 
involvement in the photographic process helped 
achieve unusually powerful photojournalistic 
results which were a cornerstone contribution to 
the annual report.
“Our goal was to produce a multipart, compre-
hensive annual report integrating in a consistent 
and arresting way several of the foundation’s uni-
versal issues. By focusing on the foundation’s pri-
orities, we were successful in designing program 
narratives, ﬁ nancials, and grants in a memorable, 
functional, and logical way while keeping con-
sistent with the structure, detail and navigation 
involved in creating a ﬂ uid reading experience,” 
says Jurek Wajdowicz.
The creative strategy was to begin with a strong 
photojournalistic design approach and to part-
ner the narrative text of the ﬁ ve main program

goals with arresting images. Second, throughout 
the piece, EWS created a lucid and appropriate 
book design system that incorporated the issues 
of priority to the Rockefeller Foundation and 
zoomed in on the speciﬁ cs of a particular con-
tinent, country, and/or the individual challenges 
facing the grantees.
By structuring the book along major themes 
and photographing regions of the world where 
the foundation’s programs were located (such as 
food security or the working communities shown 
here) EWS created a “zoom-in” photojournal-
istic approach where the focus began on global 
challenges and strategies and then zoomed in on 
regional issues, and then narrowed down even 
further to families and the individual.
Helping to ensure that the beneﬁ ts of global-
ization are more widely shared, the Rockefeller 
Foundation is one of the most prominent organi-
zations devoted to the well-being of the world’s 
most poor and vulnerable. In the 2006 annual 
report for the foundation, the twelfth created 
with Emerson, Wajdowicz Studios, the report 
embodied the new directions and expanded ini-
tiatives that had been recently instituted. Bolder 
and more streamlined, this report was structured 
and designed around straightforward questions 
(such as “Where Are We Today?”), followed by 
concise answers (“Moving Forward”). The pow-
erful design elements and strong photojournalis-
tic photography served to reinforce this structure, 
telling a story of transition, reﬂ ection, and con-
tinued growth.
These annual reports exemplify EWS’s strong 
photojournalistic design approach. By using a 
logical and consistent design along with their edi-
torial approach, we were able to achieve a complex 
yet cohesive image of the Rockefeller Foundation 
as one of the most extraordinary organizations 
dedicated on improving chances of the under-
privileged of the world.
“With increasingly heated battles for dwindling 
donor funds, it encourages (or should encourage) 
the ﬁ nancially challenged nonproﬁ t organiza-
tions to become more aggressive and innovative 
in their communications activities. In the end, I 
do believe that good design is making something 
lucid and memorable as well as meaningful and 
worthwhile,” says Jurek Wajdowicz.

› the annual report’s look and feel are considered 
in relation to the entity’s established visual identity
› functionality: reporting information and pro-

c. Composition: If you use a grid, make sure it is 
fl exible enough to accommodate the content 
(copy, including subtitles and captions, and 
visuals). The width of the columns is the key 
to accommodating content. Since visuals need 
greater width, consider the ratio of text to visu-
als when designing the grid. Also consider a 
modular-oriented grid for fl exibility. Make sure 
you are mindful of margins, too.
d. To ensure unity and fl ow across the brochure, 
keep a checklist in front of you while sketching. 
As you compose the layout, keep rhythm and 
pacing across panels in mind. Design panels 
with a sense of fl ow from one panel to another 
by minding alignments and by contrasting 
and repeating elements to establish continu-
ity across surfaces. Contrast provides visual 
interest; however, a great degree of variation 
in sizes of type and images might collapse the

Choose a type of programming featured on a public 
broadcast channel or a cable television channel—
for example, documentaries, arts, news and public 
affairs, or children’s programming—or a commercial 
broadcast channel such as the Discovery Channel 
or CNN. During prime time, most public broadcast 
stations and cable stations present signature 
series about a wide variety of subject areas, such 
as nature, the arts, politics, fi nance, and science. 
Public broadcast and select commercial broadcast 
programming offer viewers the opportunity to learn 
about new ideas and new worlds through television 
and broadband content.

a. Research the topic of the program you 
selected. Gather information that you can 
utilize in your brochure.
b. Write a design brief, determining the goal of 
the brochure and the audience. Determine 
your strategy.

THE PURPOSE OF ADVERTISING
Advertising is used in a free market system to promote one brand or group over another. 
Whether used to launch a new brand or remind us to buy an established brand, advertis-
ing helps build the value of brands, groups, causes, and even individuals in people’s minds. 
Advertising motivates us to act on behalf of a cause, helping to save lives and aid people in 
countless vital ways.
Most competing brands are on a par—parity products or services; for example, most sham-
poos in the same price category (or perhaps across price categories) are parity products. That 
said, effective advertising could persuade you that a particular brand is better or more appealing 
than the competition even though the brands are parity. An ad campaign for shampoo might 
convince you that your hair would be shinier or fuller or curlier or straighter or less frizzy or smell 
better or anything else that might appeal to you. In order for that shampoo advertising to affect 
you, it has to be relevant to you, and it has to be carried in media channels that will reach you as 
well as help make it relevant.
Advertising has become more ubiquitous than ever, as advertisers try to ﬁ nd new ways to 
get their message through to people. Advertising differentiates brands, groups, and causes, and 
ultimately sells products and calls people to action. An advertisement (ad) is a speciﬁ c message 
constructed to inform, persuade, promote, provoke, or motivate people on behalf of a brand 
or group. (Here, “group” represents both commercial industry and social cause/not-for-proﬁ t 
organizations.) An advertising campaign is a series of coordinated ads, based on an overarch-
ing strategy, connected by look and feel, voice, tone, style, imagery, and tagline, where each 
individual ad in the campaign can also stand on its own. An integrated ad campaign involves 
various media, and might include broadcast, print, interactive, and other screen-based media, 
out-of-home, and unconventional media. Figure 13-01, “So Real You Can Feel It,” is an 
integrated campaign for Toshiba HD DVD, which includes high-deﬁ nition TV commercials, 
print advertisements, Internet banners, taxi toppers, and a “Times Square Extravaganza.”
TYPES OF ADS
Commercial advertising promotes brands and commodities by informing consumers; it is also 
used to promote individuals, such as political candidates and groups, including corporations 
and manufacturers. Commercial advertising messages can take the form of single advertise-
ments or campaigns in any media.
ADVERTISING
MATTERS. FROM PUBLIC SERVICE TO HELPING DRIVE 
THE ECONOMY, CREATIVE ADVERTISING IS AN IMPORTANT CONTEMPORARY 
VISUAL COMMUNICATION VEHICLE. ADVERTISING IS PART OF DAILY LIFE AND 
INSEPARABLE FROM AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE. IN MANY COUNTRIES, 
ADVERTISING IS THE ONE COMMON EXPERIENCE THAT IS SHARED BY A LARGE, 
DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE. ADVERTISING IS A MASS MEDIA LEVELER—IT IS 
THE ONE POP CULTURE VEHICLE WE ALL COME INTO CONTACT WITH—FROM 
OUTDOOR BOARDS TO WEB BANNERS TO TELEVISION COMMERCIALS.

Challenge: Toshiba HD DVD and Sony Blu-ray were 
in the early stages of a “format war,” competing 
for the right to be the high-defi nition DVD player 
of choice among consumers.
Solution: Capture the feeling of being totally 
immersed in a movie. Focus on the shared 
experience of watching movies at home—
especially on a Toshiba HD DVD player, when 
the movie is “so real you can feel it.”
Result: While being outspent nearly 10-to-1 by 
Sony, Toshiba HD DVD sold out of its entire 
inventory of early product, secured sell-through 
agreements with all targeted retailers, and got 
the endorsement of virtually every major movie 
studio not owned or affi liated with Sony.

Renegade staged photo shoots with real DoubleClick clients and employees, showcasing them 
doing what they love doing outside the offi ce, in the offi ce environment. We then incorporated 
testimonial quotes about how DoubleClick professional tools save time, stress, and hassle at 
work, so that end users have room to pursue the passions that make them original people.
HIGH IMPACT DIRECT MAIL
For the launch of DART Motif, a rich media ad design tool, Renegade sent top agency creative 
directors fully functional light boxes with a clever collection of cutouts to piece together banners. 
A recent upgrade to the DART Search media management suite inspired Renegade to invent a 
“key word” board game called “Click To It” that we mailed to media buyers. The response rates 
for both of these programs are more than fi ve times a typical DM (direct mail) piece.
GLOBAL TRADE SHOWS
Renegade created the “Originals Playground” booth for technology trade shows around Europe 
and the United States. The objective was to integrate people’s playful, creative sides into the 
work setting. To that end, we loosened up invitees with a full bar designed to look like a light 
box, and invited them to play with assorted wigs and costumes stashed in offi ce fi le cabinets. 
We photographed their shenanigans and gave them the goofy pictures with DoubleClick product

Commonly referred to as PSAs, public service 
advertisements are created by various advertising 
agencies around the world for a great variety of 
social causes and not-for-proﬁ t organizations. 
The following Case Study discusses a PSA, an 
anti-steroid campaign that was created by volun-
teer agency TBWA/Chiat/Day and produced by 
The Ad Council. (Also see Figure 1-14, a PSA 
to stop buzzed driving.)
In most countries, PSAs are considered a ser-
vice to the community, and therefore there is no 
charge by the media to run these advertisements 
on television, on radio, or in print—although in 
order to have more control over the media and 
Within this category, the three biggest sub-
categories are consumer ads, which are directed 
toward the general public; business to business 
(B2B) (Figure 13-02), which is from one com-
pany to another; and trade ads, which are directed 
at speciﬁ c professional or business groups.
Public service advertising is advertising that 
serves the public interest. According to The 
Advertising Council, an American public service 
advertising organization (www.adcouncil.org): 
“The objectives of these ads are education and 
awareness of signiﬁ cant social issues, in an effort 
to change the public’s attitudes and behaviors 
and stimulate positive social change.”

In 2007, the federal government seized 56 under-
ground steroid labs in the United States, resulting 
in the conﬁ scation of 11.4 million doses. The use 
of performance-enhancing substances is of pri-
mary concern in American sports. No segment of 
sports—from professional to youth—is immune 
to this problem. With increasing media coverage 
on steroid use in sports, teen usage has become a 
matter of greater consequence.

decisions about the idea, approach, art direction, 
and copywriting, supervises the creative team 
before the work is presented to the client. Some 
agencies prefer unconventional creative teams or 
brand teams with several other members, which 
might include an account manager, IT expert, 
interactive designer (if appropriate), and market-
ing expert, among others. Together they work on 
conceptual development, generating “big ideas.” 
After generating ideas, the art director is respon-
sible for the art direction (overall look and feel, 
visual style, selection of photographer or illustra-
tor) and design; and the copywriter is responsible 
for the writing. When a creative team works well, 
the division of labor might overlap. Any good 
art director should be able to write copy, and any 
good copywriter should be able to think visually.
Advertising is collaborative. Besides the tradi-
tional creative team of art director and copywriter, 
advertising depends upon other professionals, 
including strategic planners, marketing managers, 
programmers, and interactive designers or agencies 
when dealing with screen-based media, uncon-
ventional marketing agencies, media planners, 
commercial directors, producers, talent (actors, 
musicians, photographers, illustrators), casting 
directors, and location scouts, among others.
Traditionally, advertising agencies created ad-
vertising and controlled the brands. Now technol-
ogy (iMovie, digital video cameras, Pro Tools, and 
other tools) makes it possible for regular people—
customers, consumers, anyone—to economically 
and practically create in ways previously privy to 
advertising professionals. Brand companies and 
agencies are handing over the making of content to 
the public, ceding some control, trying to engage 
people as brand-makers. Technology has shifted 
much of a brand’s power to people. The more peo-
ple participate with a brand, the more those people 
will use as well as feel loyal to that brand. The 
Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners (BSSP) “Converse 
Brand Democracy” campaign (Figure 13-03) is 
one of the ﬁ rst examples of this new trend:
BSSP’s Premise
Since the 1950s, Converse has had the best ad 
agency in the world working for them: Dean, Pollock, 
Ramone, Cobain, Pop, and Warhol. The brand had 
time placements, some nonproﬁ t organizations 
and government agencies have begun to purchase 
advertising time and space, in addition to the 
donated time and space.
Cause advertising, sponsored by corporations, is 
used to raise funds for nonproﬁ t organizations 
and is run in paid media. Cause advertising is 
afﬁ liated with a corporation and used in part to 
promote a corporation’s public persona or brand, 
unlike public service advertising where there is no 
commercial afﬁ liation.
TYPES OF MEDIA
More and more, people are spending their time 
on their mobile phones or in front of computer 
screens. We are witnessing a convergence of media, 
where, for example, a mobile phone can become 
any person’s media hub with an Internet connec-
tion, programmed content, music, GPS, and more. 
As technology rapidly evolves, it is most likely that 
our mobile phones will become one of the most 
important players in carrying ad messages.
In the past, television commercials and print 
ads were the main carriers of ad messages. Now, 
television is often used to drive people to the web 
where they can interact with a brand or group. 
People also now do much of their “shopping 
research” on the Internet before stepping into brick 
and mortar stores. Out-of-home (outdoor, ambi-
ent, posters, and more) serves the same function, 
driving us to the web or our mobile phones. As we 
all spend more time on the web and mobile, seek-
ing entertainment and information, connecting on 
social networking sites, tweeting, using RSS feeds, 
downloading widgets, using the web to connect 
with like-minded others and friends, building web 
communities, or blogging, advertising will evolve 
to best take advantage of technology, social net-
working applications, and emerging media.
WHO CREATES

In an advertising agency, a conventional creative 
team is a duo composed of an art director and

Five Phases of the Advertising Design Process:

Clients are not saying, “Make us ads” or “Make us 
websites,” they’re saying, “Create interaction between 
our brand and our customers.” That’s our job now.
—ROBERT RASMUSSEN
Executive Creative Director
Nike Account at R/GA, as quoted in The New 
York Times Magazine
In advertising preliminary research (as well as 
post-design testing, for example, focus groups) 
can be quite extensive. Agencies receive a good 
deal of research and information from clients or 
utilize marketing research ﬁ rms. Then they move 
to strategic planning, which involves many pro-
fessionals and writing a creative brief.
ANALYSIS
Essentially, a creative brief is a strategic plan that 
both client and agency agree upon and from which 
the creative team works as a strategic springboard. 
The advertising strategy is the master plan, deter-
mined during analysis before the creative team 
goes to work on idea generation. It is outlined in 
the creative brief, and as creative director John 
Lyons puts it, “A strategy is a carefully designed 
plot to murder the competition.” A thoughtful, 
clear brief offers the creative team a solid point 
of departure and sets them on the right path for 
ideation. Research, information about the brand 
or group, and the budget all play into forming
the strategy. A brief is written by the client’s 
marketing team, or collaboratively between cli-
ent and ad agency, or by the advertising agency 
alone. (See The Design Brief in Chapter 4 for 
more information.)
always been deﬁ ned by the people who wore the shoes, 
not by its marketing. And the way we saw it, the 
worst thing any agency could do was mess up what 
these guys had done for decades. So we based our idea 
on the notion that we don’t own the brand, the con-
sumer does. We decided to let the legions of originals 
who own the brand create the communications for 
us. And maybe along the way we’d discover the next 
Ramone or Pollock.
Brand Democracy: Idea
From that thought, we created Brand Democracy: 
advertising created by the people. We solicited ﬁ lms 
from the Converse evangelists. Not commercials. Not 
scripted talking points. Just 24-second ﬁ lms. The only 
rule was that the ﬁ lms not be political or R-rated.
Solicitation
To jump-start the idea, we ﬁ rst went to ﬁ lm 
schools. Then we went everywhere else. We had over 
400 ﬁ lms in the ﬁ rst three months. And the move-
ment grew quickly from there.
Television
These ﬁ lms weren’t just a couple of friends mess-
ing around in the backyard. (Well, a few were.) They 
were real works of art that reﬂ ected the range of the 
people who love the brand. At last count, we received 
over 2,000 ﬁ lms from 20 countries.
Web
In addition to select ﬁ lms airing on MTV, the best 
ﬁ lms were featured on the web at ConverseGallery.com. 
This forum gave the ﬁ lmmakers a chance to share their 
inspiration and ambition, and allowed consumers to 
form a deeper relationship with the ﬁ lms and the brand. 
It was the epicenter of the democratic effort, and was an 
original and organic convergence of web and TV.
Print/Outdoor
We expanded this movement to painters and 
graphic designers to create outdoor and print ads. The 
outdoor was localized, so a board that ran in LA fea-
tured an emerging LA-based artist.
Product Democracy
We even created a new revenue stream for Con-
verse by developing Product Democracy, a campaign

for themselves (to please the men in 
their lives).
What do they currently think?
“I’m a little uncomfortable about buying 
sexy lingerie; lingerie is very intimate 
and private.”
What would we like them to think?
“This is a friendly, uninhibited store. 
I wouldn’t be embarrassed to ask for 
anything.”
What is the single, most persuasive 
idea we can convey?
Tabu makes buying lingerie fun.
Why should they believe it?
Because we’re honest about why people 
buy it.
Are there any creative guidelines?
Sexy and intelligent; not sexist and crude.

product or service. Ads that touch us emotion-
ally—promising greater self-esteem, a virtuous 
feeling, or any emotional beneﬁ t—can, perhaps, 
have even greater impact than those that promise 
functional beneﬁ ts. For example, all hair-coloring 
covers gray, which is a functional beneﬁ t. But, if 
a hair-coloring brand promises improved self-
esteem, that emotional beneﬁ t might connect with 
the target audience. A dark chocolate candy brand 
could tout the functional beneﬁ t of ﬂ avonoids or it 
could tout the emotional beneﬁ t of sensory delight 
or feelings of indulgence.
To drive more awareness for Oxyride (Figure 
13-06), a new entry in the competitive battery cat-
egory, Renegade partnered with the House Rabbit 
Society to “raise awareness about the health ben-
eﬁ ts of neutering your rabbit, and let the press and 
the consumer discover the competitive message for 
themselves.” The campaign makes an emotional 
connection with the youthful target through the 
kind of off-beat humor they appreciate. Bunny 
owners appreciate the practical underlying mes-
sage aimed at them.
Storytelling
Memorable advertising and branding involves 
good brand storytelling—the skill and act of 
pre senting a brand or group as part of a greater 
narrative. To do this, storytelling must be part 
of the strategy—formulating the brand or group 
CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
The creative team is briefed during orientation and 
during that phase does all that is necessary in prep-
aration for concept generation (see Concept Gen-
eration Process in Chapter 4). An advertising idea
is the creative conceptual solution to an advertis-
ing problem—a strategic formulated thought that 
communicates a message, calling people to action.
Functional versus Emotional Beneﬁ ts
What’s in it for me? Will this brand make me hap-
pier, healthier, richer, or more attractive; get me 
where I want to go; or make my life easier? Will 
I help if I give to this group or cause? An ad has 
to offer a beneﬁ t.
Functional beneﬁ ts are the practical or useful 
characteristics of a product or service that aid in 
distinguishing a brand or group from its competi-
tion. For example, bath soap may have the advan-
tage of extra moisturizer, or a credit card company 
may protect against identity theft. Figure 13-05, 
“The Practically-All-Screen TV” for REGZA 
HDTVs, focuses on a newly designed, slimmer 
frame. The functional beneﬁ t is that “you can ﬁ t 
more TV into the same space when you buy the 
‘practically-all-screen’ TV,” writes creative direc-
tor Michael “Mac” McLaurin.
Emotional beneﬁ ts are based on connecting a 
brand or group with people on an emotional level, 
not based on any functional characteristic of a

In advertising, storytelling has a cumulative 
effect when consistently told and/or reinforced 
across media in a campaign. Each individual ad, 
regardless of media—whether it’s a website or print 
ad—is a version of and contributor to the story.
Screen-based media with motion capabilities, 
especially television, web, and mobile, have the 
opportunities to tell “short stories” with sound and 
with a point of view, attributing a personality to 
it, imbuing it with an “inner life.” For example, 
the Nike spirit certainly starts with the “Just Do 
It” tagline, becoming a point of view, a moti-
vational call to action, with all the integrated 
advertising contributing to that broader story. 
(More about storytelling later in this chapter 
when we study campaigns.)

CAPTURE THEIR ATTENTION
• Partner with the House Rabbit Society to raise

MEASURABLY EFFECTIVE
Within two weeks of the launch of Neuter Your Bunny, two 
large national retailers called to discuss new distribution 
plans for Oxyride batteries.
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION
For the youthful target, the campaign’s humor hits on just 
the kind of joke they most enjoy. For bunny owners, on 
the other hand, the connection is even easier. Neutering 
reduces health risks and aggressiveness in both female 
and male rabbits.

Without ever explicitly saying the competitor’s name, 
everyone from The New York Times to Time Magazine to 
blogs around the world told the story for us, explaining 
how Oxyride outperforms the competition. Other press

“ZIG, ZAG, ZUG” ADVERTISING 
LAUNCH CAMPAIGN
Coinciding with the MINI Clubman 
on-sale date, the teaser ads were 
fi lled in with ZIG, ZAG, and ZUG 
graphics, images of the MINI 
hardtop, MINI convertible, and the 
new MINI Clubman, and the tagline, 
“MINI Clubman. The Other MINI.”
“THE OTHER NEIDERMEYER”
In addition was “The Other

enigmatic in much the same way 
the MINI Clubman does among 
the members of the MINI clan.
movement. If you compare this type of advertising 
to ﬁ lms or television programming, the skill for 
storytelling/narrative miniaturization is crucial.
MINI’s story was different than other vehicles. 
When MINI launched in the United States, it 
“zigged.” When MINI introduced its convert-
ible, it “zagged.” For the all-new MINI Clubman 
(Figure 13-07), Butler, Shine, Stern & Partners 
(BSSP) decided MINI would “Zug.” Although 
the Clubman is a MINI, its ﬁ ve-door conﬁ gu-
ration and proportions distinguish it from the 
MINI family. Aimed at cultural trendsetters, to 
engage them in a brand story and conversation, 
BSSP’s idea was based on the fact that “the world 
is ﬁ lled with mass-produced sameness, even the 
copies are copies,” and explained that’s why 
“some of us ‘zug.’” To tell this story, BSSP cre-
ated teaser wallscape ads that simply read “ZIG” 
and “ZAG” placed in major U.S. transportation 
hubs. Those were followed by print ads that 
began to explain the “ZIG ZAG ZUG” story, 
including the MINI Clubman tagline, “The 
Other MINI.” This campaign story unfolded 
across media, including print, television, guer-
rilla marketing, out-of-home, online videos, ads 
embedded in video games, and a 24-page book-
let magazine insert called “The Book of ZUG,” 
which explained the philosophy behind the car. 
The ad deﬁ nes the word ZUG as an “adjective, 
verb or noun” meaning “to be unlike others, to do 
something different, and a place in Switzerland.” 
This integrated advertising launch campaign 
was bolstered by national cable television spots 
and a variety of other applications across media, 
including those mentioned earlier as well as 
online banner and video ads on Car Enthusiast, 
design-oriented, and social networking websites, 
and mobile telephone content.

compared with large, streamlined American cars. 
Doyle Dane Bernbach’s (DDB) solution was to 
emphasize the characteristics that set VW apart 
from the competition; for example, the care 
put into manufacturing and inspection, which 
resulted in the now famous “Lemon” ad (Fig-
ure 13-09). Other VW ads from DDB touted: 
“Think small” and “It’s ugly, but it gets you 
there.” In the late 1990s, the Leo Burnett agency 
APPROACHES TO 
CONCEPT GENERATION
Creative advertising is the goal—stretching 
beyond the ordinary, to be original, innovative. 
No one notices humdrum advertising. Illustrating 
points of departure for developing ideas might 
seem counterintuitive to being creative; how-
ever, these can serve as a springboard, as starters, 
to demonstrate how one could mine for creative 
avenues. Liken it to learning to paint by studying 
Paul Cézanne’s methodology or any other exem-
plary painter’s process.
› Figure of speech/pun. Using any type of rhetori-
cal device can help jump-start an idea; although 
the poor pun is considered by some to be a low 
form of humor, many people ﬁ nd creative word-
play a rich source for entertainment. Other ﬁ g-
ures of speech include oxymoron, synecdoche, 
and metonymy.
› Visual analogy, simile, or metaphor. A visual 
analogy is a comparison based on some likeness 
or similarities. We assume that if two things are 
alike in one respect, they are alike in other or all 
respects. A visual metaphor uses a visual that 
ordinarily identiﬁ es one thing to signify another, 
thus making a meaningful comparison; for exam-
ple, a rhinoceros to designate dry skin, a Shar-Pei 
dog to designate a wrinkled human face, a pretzel 
and the human back, or a white-washed fence as 
a metaphor for whitened teeth.
› Symbolism. In this ad, IBM declares its support 
for programs designed to strengthen women’s 
skills in areas such as math and science by using 
colored baby booties, which symbolize gender 
(Figure 13-08).
› Icons. Icons can represent a corporation or 
brand in a very friendly way.
› Life experience. If people can relate to what 
you’re saying, you’re halfway home. “Yeah, that 
happens to me,” should be someone’s response 
to your ad. These ads behave as observa tional
humorists, pointing out the humor in every-
day occurrences.
› The problem is the solution. Often, the answer to 
an ad problem is looking at the problem itself. In 
the late 1950s, Volkswagen wanted to sell a good 
deal more VW Beetles in America. The prob-
lem was the Beetle was small and strange looking

the Panasonic “Share the Air” Case Study; Wil-
liam Shatner in Figure 13-22); or, it may feature 
an endorsement from an everyday person with 
whom the potential consumer can identify.
› Irony. Since the advertising creative revolution 
of the early 1960s, ad professionals have found 
value in a self-conscious wink at the audience, 
with no pretense, no hard sell. The underlying 
approach is: “We know you know we’re trying to 
sell you something, so let’s just enjoy this transac-
tion together.” 
Engaging Content
How can advertising connect with people? Sto-
rytelling is certainly one way. Entertainment is 
another way to connect with an audience.
“EVB developed a lifestyle marketing campaign 
titled ‘Football Resurrected’ that combined music, 
sports, and gaming cultures to mark 2K’s return 
used Altoids “curiously strong” peppermint ﬂ a-
vor to their advantage.
› Compare and contrast. A comparison between 
brands can be boring or seem mean-spirited, like 
the old cola and fast-food wars. However, com-
parisons to things other than the competition can 
be very seductive, for example, comparing the 
sensation of eating a YORK Peppermint Pattie™ 
to skiing in crisp mountain air or standing under 
a refreshing waterfall, or contrasting rough and 
soft as in prickly cacti versus cotton socks.
› Exaggeration. Exaggeration can easily drive 
a point home. A classic example is an ad for 
Colombian coffee in which the pilot turns the 
plane around because they forgot the Colombian 
coffee. This brand is so good that. . . . These high 
heels are so high that. . . . Our vacuum cleaner is 
so powerful that. . . .

to the football videogame arena with All-Pro 
Football 2K8.” As shown in Figure 13-10, EVB’s 
“campaign was designed to connect with next-gen-
eration gamers and football fans through engaging 
content carried across TV, print, online, wild post-
ings, street teams, packaging, and logo design. At 
its core, EVB worked with six of hip-hop’s most 
well-known legends to develop six 2-minute epi-
sodes, shot in a stadium tunnel, featuring each artist 
performing freestyle rap poetry about 2K’s return 
to football gaming. The episodes were unveiled 
on a dedicated microsite, www.footballresurrected
.com, XBOX, YouTube, and MTV2. Using the 
episodic content featuring hip-hop’s Rakim, 
EVB developed 15- and 30-second spots [tele-
vision commercials] to air on stations including 
ESPN, NFL, MTV, BET, and USA. Print ads 
ran in lifestyle, music, and gaming publications. 
Street teams and wild postings occurred during 
the 2K national music Bounce Tour featuring 
2K-endorsed artists.”
People enjoy being entertained; and entertain-
ing humor disarms or endears. For example, a 
website for Burger King created by Crispin Porter 
& Bogusky, Subservientchicken.com, received an 
enormous number of hits; people spent about 
seven minutes on average on the site because they 
found it entertaining.1 Humorous ads—usually 
online ads or television ads—generate buzz or 
word of mouth. When people ﬁ nd an ad enter-
taining or outrageous, they tend to tell others 
about it, perhaps even e-mail it, which means that 
people are talking about your brand or group.
Kinetic, in Singapore, talks about Figure 
13-11: “Nike is a strong advocate of playing by 
different rules. As part of Nike’s global campaign 
to encourage the playing of football [soccer] 
anywhere and everywhere (rather than just on 
the ﬁ eld), we devised a special football vending 
machine just for the Singapore market. Given 
that all one needs is a ball to play football, this 
‘open 24 hours’ vending machine basically made 
it easy for people to access a ball anytime. Inspired 
by the spirit of football improvisation, the vend-
ing machine was placed at high-trafﬁ c urban 
spots so that consumers can have easy access to 
a football whenever and wherever they feel like 
playing. A world’s ﬁ rst, the vending machine

attention and time, it should not be all about the 
brand, it has to be about people.
Michael “Mac” McLaurin explains the chal-
lenge in creating a campaign for ﬂ at screen TVs: 
“The marketplace for ﬂ at screen televisions had 
become increasingly confusing for consumers. 
REGZA HDTVs from Toshiba now encom-
passed a full line of sizes, styles, and price points, 
but this assortment just contributed to the con-
fusion.” In Figure 13-12, “FIND THE RIGHT 
TV.COM” for TOSHIBA REGZA LCD 
HDTVs, McLaurin says, “Our idea was to ‘match’ 
consumers to the perfect TV, much like the popu-
lar match.com, which helps match people over 
the Internet. We created FIND THE RIGHT 
TV.COM to make matching you to the right TV 
fun and easy. By answering eight simple lifestyle 
questions, consumers were quickly matched to 
the perfect REGZA TV. Additionally, consumers 
were invited to upload a photo of their rooms, to 
see what their perfect TV match would look like in 
their life. Magazine, online banner ads, and point-
of-purchase displays drove people to the site.”
DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
Everything you learned about the fundamentals 
of design, visualization, and composition applies 
to designing an ad. Any effective ad is based on 
an idea—the creative team’s primary reasoning. 
The idea sets the framework for all your design 
not only met the campaign objectives of bring-
ing football to the streets, it also reinforced Nike’s 
image as the leading sports brand—a supporter of 
the innovative, bold, and unprecedented. The ﬁ rst 
in the world, the vending machine was a massive 
hit, selling more footballs in one week than two 
months in stores. Through widespread media 
coverage—it was on every news channel the night 
it was launched—and word of mouth, the vend-
ing machine attracted huge crowds. Although 
the same footballs could be bought from stores, 
people were willing to queue for the novelty of 
buying a ball from the vending machine. Even 
Japanese tourists—hailing from the land of vend-
ing machines!—were witnessed taking photos 
of it. Initially meant as an outdoor advertising 
piece rather than a sales tool per se, the vend-
ing machine did so well that now, even the US 
and KL [Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia] markets have 
bought the idea.”
As in Panasonic’s “Share the Air,” advertising 
can offer some type of valuable function or utility
or online social center, whether it acts as a media 
platform and the hub for a sport (for example, 
“Visit NikePlus.com to track your runs, set goals, 
participate in challenges, and join the largest 
running club”) or setting wellness lifestyle goals 
(for example, Kashi.com where you can use their 
“snack evaluator” or ﬁ nd family ﬁ tness activities). 
Here’s the key: for advertising to capture people’s

Visual/Verbal Synergy
Together, the image and copy (the visual and 
verbal components), how they are visualized, 
how they are designed, how they work off one 
another, express the advertising idea in a syner-
gistic visual/verbal relationship. Working coop-
eratively, the visual and verbal components should 
produce a greater effect than that of either part alone.
Visual/verbal synergy is established in this ad for 
Volkswagen (Figure 13-13). The line and visual 
depend upon one another for the total ad mes-
sage. Here is a way to test for visual/verbal syn-
ergy: cover the visual and read the line. Do you 
get the meaning of the ad? Now reverse it; cover 
the line and look at the visual. Is the ad message 
communicated? Now look at the entire ad. The 
message should be clear because of the coopera-
tive action of the visual and verbal components. 
When this type of synergistic action takes place, 
the communication becomes seamless.
Copy-Driven versus Visual-Driven
When the copy does the “heavy lifting” in an ad, 
that is, the message is primarily conveyed through 
the headline, then the ad is considered to be copy-
driven (Figure 13-14).
decisions—for how you create, select, crop, and 
arrange imagery; write copy; select colors; or 
choose a particular typeface.
An ad must:
› Grab attention (it has to be visually interesting).
› Communicate a message (it has to be clear).
› Call people to action (it has to motivate).
Elements of an Ad
Most ads consist of the following components: 
visual, headline (or line), body copy, tagline, and 
sign-off. The visual is the principal image, which 
may be a photograph, an illustration, graphics, or 
any other kind or combination of images. The 
headline is the principal verbal message. The body 
copy is the text that supplements and supports the 
message. The tagline conveys the brand beneﬁ t or 
positioning, generally acting as an umbrella theme 
or strategy for a campaign or a series of campaigns; 
also called a claim, endline, strap line, or slogan. 
A tagline helps complete the advertising commu-
nication, rounding out the meaning. The strat-
egy behind a campaign is usually revealed in the 
tagline. The sign-off includes the brand or group’s 
logo, web address, a photograph or illustration of 
the packaging or product, or both.

The ﬂ yers and posters, which are replicas of pages 
in books, are inserted in romance novels.”
When the communication is mainly or only 
determined by the visual, the ad is visual-driven, 
for example, the Apple iPod™ dancer ads. And 
what is most surprising is that you can tell a story 
in a single image (see Figure 5-26). When aiming 
at a global audience where language translations 
might cause miscommunication, some feel the 
best route is no-copy advertising, where the visual 
communicates the entire message, with no copy 
except for perhaps a tagline.
THE AD CAMPAIGN
As previously noted, an advertising campaign 
is a series of coordinated ads—in one or more 
media—that while able to stand alone are based 
on a single, overarching strategy or theme. A 
campaign serves to get people’s attention over a 
period of time and across media. Many believe a 
person needs to hear and see a brand’s ads many 
times in order to absorb the message and buy the
brand, or answer the call to action on behalf of a 
cause. The strategy and core idea for a campaign 
needs to be elastic enough to provide material for 
many individual ads, and may need to be ﬂ exible 
enough to work across media, in print as well as 
in screen-based media, out-of-home, and perhaps 
in unconventional formats. When a student has 
a portfolio composed of creative integrated ad 
campaigns, it demonstrates his or her ability to 
take a core idea and run with it.
Some print campaigns utilize the same com-
positional structure with designated positions for 
the components, as seen in Figure 13-16. The 
headline may vary and the visual will vary, but the 
composition/layout remains constant; for example, 
the famous original, long-running Absolut Vodka 
campaign where the iconic bottle is centered.
VARIETY IN AD CAMPAIGNS
An ad campaign should offer something new each 
time people see and read an individual ad from 
the campaign. Variety—that element of new-
DO’S AND DON’TS
DO’S AND DON’TS  OF ADVERTISING
There are no rules in advertising because it is a creative business/fi eld that needs 
to break rules to grab people’s attention. However, the novice needs some useful 
guidelines.
Do’s
• Design should grab someone’s attention.
• Communicate one clear message per ad.
• Create visual/verbal synergy.
• Determine a functional or emotional benefi t.
• Avoid clichéd visuals and copy.
• Visual and line should not repeat one another.
• Write in plain, conversational language. Avoid copy that sounds like a sales pitch.
• Break copy lines in logical places; line breaks should echo breaks in speech.
• Respect the audience.
• Refl ect diversity.
Don’ts
• Don’t use the brand’s or group’s logo as the headline.
• Don’t use headlines, taglines, or body copy from existing ads.
• Don’t employ negative stereotypes.
Since advertising is mass communication, even when directed toward a segment 
of a population, it is drawn in broad strokes. Those broad strokes, for many, translate 
to mean generalizing and stereotyping of cultures, groups, and genders. All of us—
clients, account managers, executives, and creative professionals—need to be more 
vigilant, to interrogate all connotative cultural messages in the visual communica-
tions they commission and create.
Using copy in an “under the radar” format in 
Figure 13-15, Kineti created a print campaign for 
Jubes Nata De Coco cubes, a healthy dessert that 
is zero in calories and high in ﬁ ber. “Perfect for 
the health-conscious, especially women,” Kinetic 
describes. “To reach out and engage them, an 
effective and refreshing approach was needed. 
Romance novels are almost a must-have for many 
women. For some, it is a staple and not a page 
is missed. Since the idea mimics the content of 
romance novels where juicy tales abound, the idea

these must be based on an advertising idea. (See 
Chapter 4 for more on creative thinking.)
› Visual surprise. Create a visual that will make 
viewers do a double take. Look at something in 
a mirror. Turn a mouth upside down. Look at 
something through a wet lens (Figure 13-17).
› Merge things. Bring two different things—
images or objects—together to make a new one. 
Merge a tennis ball and a croissant to denote the 
French Open tennis tournament..
› Be literal and really push it. Personify things—
give inanimate objects human qualities. Really 
push your point as in Figure 13-18.
Creative professionals thrive on thinking cre-
atively; however, there are various industry and 
government regulations that must be considered, 
as well as universal ethical considerations about 
what is appropriate and principled. Some advertis-
ing is closely regulated; for example, in the United 
States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulates pharmaceutical marketing. Figure 13-19 
is an example of how required information must 
be included in pharmaceutical advertising.

EFFICACY
Effective campaigns sell products or promote 
causes. When effective campaigns generate brand 
loyalty or brand endearment, storytelling is usually 
at their foundation. How do you tell an engaging 
and relevant story? A story, traditionally presented 
through action, dialogue, and narration, is told in 
advertising through various media though always 
supporting the larger story of “who and what” a 
brand or group is, as a living entity.
COMMERCIALS
As with all advertising, commercial spots for tele-
vision, web, mobile, or any screen-based media 
that has motion capability start with orientation, 
analysis, and conceptual development. Often, 
commercials are part of an integrated campaign 
with print and out-of-home components.
Potentially, a commercial has several advantages 
over print or a static screen. Commercials allow for 
storytelling with sound (including music, voice, 
and special effects) and motion (action, dance, 
demonstration, and visual effects). Only speciﬁ c 
lengths of time (15 seconds, 30 seconds, or 60 
seconds) are given to explain the message. Great 
TV or online commercials are noticed, relevant, 
remembered, and compelling, like this campaign 
for Priceline starring spokesperson William Shat-
ner (Figure 13-22). Butler, Shine, Stern & Part-
ners (BSSP) identiﬁ ed an interesting consumer 
segment—treasure hunters—people who hunt for 
the lowest prices and then boast about their ﬁ nds 
to others. They also learned that Priceline negoti-
ates directly with each of their partners (airlines, 
car rental companies, hotels, etc.) to obtain the 
best deals for their clients. Then BSSP linked this 
consumer insight to both their celebrity spokes-
person’s repute and comedic talent and to Price-
line’s functional beneﬁ t, resulting in entertaining 
spots that tell a story while driving the functional 
beneﬁ t home.
With print, you have approximately two sec-
onds to grab the viewer’s attention. It’s a little 
bit different with television. A television viewer 
may be attracted to a television commercial—also 
called a TV spot—and watch the entire ad, or he

Hooker, the playfulness of his TV

An example of effective storytelling is the Dove 
Campaign for Real Beauty, which revitalized the 
50-year-old brand by breaking with an industry 
tradition of presenting model perfect (thin, ﬂ aw-
less) images of women. Ogilvy’s online magazine 
Viewpoint said: “Dove recognized how out of sync 
the beauty industry was with women’s attitudes, 
and set out to change it.”
Unilever’s website explains: “The intention of 
the campaign was to raise consciousness of the 
issues surrounding beauty and to challenge long-
held stereotypes. It invited women’s active partic-
ipation and debate in broadening the deﬁ nition 
of beauty.
“The Dove global Campaign for Real Beauty is 
a catalyst for activating Dove’s beauty philosophy 
and to announce a wider, more refreshing view 
on beauty.
“The campaign is:
• An encompassing message and intrinsic to all 
of Dove’s communications
• A personiﬁ cation of Dove’s philosophy in front 
of consumers
• An invitation to women to join our endeavor.”

or she may drift in and out. Thus, if the viewer 
stays in the room during the spot, there is an 
opportunity to regain attention if it has waned. 
That’s where creative thinking comes in. If a TV 
spot is engaging, a person will watch. If it’s pedes-
trian, most likely the viewer will tune it out, leave 
the room, text message, or check e-mail. The same 
holds true for online or mobile commercials.
Visualizing an ad for television begins with a 
storyboard. A storyboard illustrates and narrates 
the key frames of a television ad concept. The 
visuals are drawn inside small frames, in propor-
tion to a screen; and the action, sound or special 
effects, and dialogue are written underneath or 
next to each frame. 
GUERRILLA ADVERTISING
Print, television commercials, radio, and out-
of-home are considered traditional advertising 
because of how and where they are seen and 
heard. Since the public recognizes traditional 
advertising as such—expects advertising to inter-
rupt television programming or permeate maga-
zine articles—many have learned to tune it out. 
With people watching less television, with more 
channels to watch splintering audiences while 
they hold remote controls, with digital video 
recorders allowing people to skip commercials, 
and with people spending more time gaming or 
online, television commercials are no longer the 
unfailing message carriers they once were.
Unconventional advertising “ambushes” the 
public; it appears in the public or private envi-
ronments—places and surfaces where advertising 
doesn’t usually live, such as on the sidewalk or at 
the bottom of golf holes; it’s also called guerrilla 
advertising, stealth marketing, ambient market-
ing, and nontraditional marketing. It should be 
engaging, not intrusive.
AMBIENT ADVERTISING
Utilizing existing structures in public spaces, such 
as bus shelters, lampposts, ﬁ re hydrants, cor-
ners of buildings, or parking spaces as in Figure 
13-23—ambient advertising gets under people’s 
ad radar to surprise them.

space—complete with a resident eating breakfast, reading the newspaper, and chatting to 
passersby. All of the furniture was free, and the public was encouraged to “steal” the furniture 
and take it home with them.
We deliberately chose colorful furniture to increase visibility and spread the buzz from the street

designer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
where he got his BFA in Design. 
After working in Brazil, he moved 
to New York to work for R/GA. After 
joining the agency in 2003, he quickly 
grew into one of the agency’s leading 
creatives. After four years of working 
on the award-winning Nike account, 
most recently as an associate creative 
director, Gui joined Mother New York 
in July 2007 to pursue new challenges 
in integrated advertising. As one of 
the senior creatives at the agency, he 
produced work for Mother’s largest 
clients. In October 2008, Gui moved to 
Syrup New York, part of the LBi group, 
to lead global integrated account 
Puma Teamsport, with a strong focus 
on football (soccer), which has always 
been one of his dreams.
He has won more than two dozen 
awards including top honors at 
the industry’s most prestigious 
competitions including Cannes 
Titanium Lion, Cannes Cyber Lion 
Grand Prix, D&AD Black Pencil, Best of 
Show in One Show Interactive, and the

in Print magazine as one the twenty 
most talented designers under 30. 
His work has been shown in exhibits 
and published in numerous magazines 
and books in Brazil, the United States, 
Europe, and Asia. Gui often speaks 
at events and works with students in 
workshops and lectures, as he strongly 
believes that sharing knowledge 
contributes to a stronger and more 
integrated creative community.
Gui is a futebol (soccer) afi cionado and

SHOWCASE
I N T E R V I E W  W I T H  G U I  B O R C H E RT
Q: Why did you choose a career in visual 
communication?
As a kid, I enjoyed drawing scenes. I enter-
tained myself, in my own way, through telling sto-
ries with images. That’s what I love to do. Later 
on, I thought I wanted to design cars so I started 
out as an industrial design major. In the middle 
of college, I realized I liked concepting, but the 
production part (building the model, for exam-
ple) didn’t engage me, so I changed my major to 
graphic design. Graphic design is more interesting 
to me, since it is about visual communication; for 
example, a logo is the smallest canvas for telling 
a story. A logo has to say a lot about a company. 
For me, that is a big challenge. More and more, 
my keen interest in ideas and storytelling moved 
me into advertising—I believe great advertising is 
about telling stories.
What is your day at the agency like? 
Read the news in the morning and check the 
blogs with my morning coffee. Meetings. Work 
includes a variety of activities depending upon the 
project and which phase of the project we’re in. A 
day could include: being briefed by the strategist, 
concepting with my writing partner, presenting 
work, shooting TV or print, a web shoot, talking 
to production companies, designing, or editing.
What is the relationship between being a graphic 
designer and being an art director?
Art directors should be great designers. If a 
good idea is not well designed it will die. And if a 
good design doesn’t have a viable concept under-
pinning it, it’s merely a pretty thing. Both graphic 
design and advertising involve cool ways of com-
municating things, coming up with an idea and 
ﬁ nding the best way—and new ways—to com-
municate it.
How do you generate your ideas?
By understanding the problem, knowing the 
background, I am able to ﬁ nd an insight. The 
strategist will feed the creative team a lot of infor-
mation. While reading that research, usually some 
insight pops up. (Often, the strategist will choose 
the key information—the points of inspiration. 
Collaboration happens with the strategist or plan-
ner, where we sit around a table and discuss the 
research.) To learn as much as I can, I’ll ask ques-
tions or ﬁ nd answers myself. I ﬁ nd reading about 
related topics on wiki is a good method for me. 
Out of that cluster, some fact or info will pop out. 
Always pursue as much information as you need 
to ﬁ nd an insight. As soon as you immerse your-
self in the research, good stuff happens. Going 
directly to work on the computer is the worst way 
to proceed; before you start concepting, you need 
enough to contemplate. Another avenue to avoid 
is looking at other people’s work for inspiration. 
You look at other people’s work for information, 
to see what’s been done, but not for inspiration.
Any advice on idea generation?
Avoid your ﬁ rst thoughts. Of course, once in a 
while your ﬁ rst thought may be the best one, but 
most often the ﬁ rst natural place you go is usually 
the safest, not the most creative. If you keep gener-
ating ideas, you’ll land in a more interesting place. 
Take advantage of the difﬁ culties. Find ways to do 
it in ways that haven’t been done before. Inspire 
the audience to think. With too much “see and 
say,” you’re assuming the audience is not smart. 
Don’t compromise doing mind-numbing ads 
because you think people won’t get it. Once some-
one thinks about something, they’re more involved 
with the brand. If you’re looking for good ideas, 
don’t look where most people look. Go where no 
one has looked, but also it has to make sense.
How do you convince a client to go with an ad 
that’s not “see and say,” not blatant?
A lot of clients don’t understand this, because 
they are understandably afraid that this type of 
“thinking person’s” ad won’t sell. If you’re afraid, 
then you’re not going to do or get the best work. 
Great work really does come from great clients. 
Pick your battles with clients. You don’t want to 
ﬁ ght over every little thing. You have to give in 
on some things, so, later you can push back on 
the important things. Gain their trust. At the end 
of the day, I am passionate about my work and 

A DV E R T I S I N G
P. 355
believe it will produce the best result for my cli-
ent. The client needs to believe that I want what is 
best for the brand. It’s baby steps; trust grows and 
you build your relationship with the client so that 
their trust allows for more creative work.
How do you deal with project constraints? 
Media and budget constraints? 
Use the limitations of the project to your 
advantage; view constraints as a challenge and be 
inspired by the limitations. Take those limitations 
and be more creative. If your client says, “Here’s 
ten million dollars, go create an ad,” that’s too easy. 
If the Brazilian national soccer team plays against 
ten-year-olds, they’re not challenged; and it’s not 
interesting. I always look for a challenge. For exam-
ple, if you give me a blank page and pen, I’ll spend 
ten days thinking of what I want to draw. On the 
other hand, if you tell me: “You can only use dots to 
communicate love,” I would have an easier time.
Does media ever drive the idea?
Ideally, the idea drives the media. But some-
times, the budget inﬂ uences media choices and

• CLIENT: DELL
sometimes the media might inﬂ uence it. Bottom
line: It’s all about communication.
The reality is sometimes clients come with 
their marketing plan in hand; they have the media 
ﬁ gured out and you have to deal with it. The way I 
deal with a predetermined media plan is I present 
how my idea would live in various types of media, 
to give them a sense of how it would play out if 
they were to use other media. I present a large 
deck with all sorts of applications, which might 
inspire them to change the original plan or at the 
very least plant a seed. In that case, when someone 
else does it and it works, they might think: maybe 
we could have done that and you will have earned 
their trust for next time. Or they’ll come back and 
want to do it later on. The more integrated adver-
tising is, the better. Think of how a ﬁ lm or video 
could live anywhere these days, for example.
How do you know if you’ve generated a good 
idea or a great idea?
If I am really excited about an idea, that’s how 
I know I hit it. When I can’t stop talking about 
an idea, and I can’t wait to come into the agency 

P. 356
Chapter  13
to work on it, then I know I’ve hit on something 
powerful. A great idea generates alternatives, 
series, details—”We can do this with it or we can 
do that with it”—and it keeps going, non-stop.
What does storytelling mean in this business?
It’s visual communication, whether it’s a visual 
identity or an ad. A print ad or YouTube video 
has to tell a story. One logo has to tell that story. 
Brands have to communicate speciﬁ c ideas, a feel 
in a certain tone, not literally, not overtly, but 
with hints at it. You ask yourself: What do I want 
people to think and feel when they see this logo? 
You are telling a story in one image.
What about the importance of typography?
Great type can save a design. A really good way 
to measure talent in a junior portfolio is by the 
person’s typographic skills. If I see poor typogra-
phy in a book, it is very likely I won’t be interested 
in the rest of the work. But this is something that 
can be acquired. If you love type you can learn to 
master it. And it’s easy to fall in love with it. And 
when you do, you will know it’s forever.
How do you work with existing brand strategy? 
Each client has their own brand positioning. 
There is an umbrella and if it’s in place already 
your work can live under there, make sense, and 
help build the equity they already have, and 
hopefully evolve it using what is there as a start-
ing point.
Is each commercial its own story? Is there one 
bigger story?
One big story or its own story, it depends. It 
may be the kind of brand that requires that every-
thing ﬁ ts neatly. Others are looser. It varies from 
client to client, but always a story nevertheless.
What do you look for in a junior book? 
I want to see the work they are most proud of. 
Only include work you’re really proud of in your 
book. If you include nine great pieces and one 
weaker piece, chances are a reviewer will spend 
the time on the one poor piece. Don’t ever put 
in work you’re not proud of. (That goes with cli-
ents, too. Never show a just OK piece to a client, 
not one, because chances are that’s the one the 
client will choose.) You can totally include work 
that hasn’t been produced, as long as it is good 
and you are able to explain it well. For example, 
a website doesn’t have to be live, you can include 
screen shots. Or even student work, or work 
you’ve created for fun or just to build your book. 
If it’s good, add it; just be honest about where it 
came from.
Partner up with a copywriter and/or pho-
tographer to create some speculative work that 
excites you.
Present your work well. If your portfolio looks 
thrown together, then I will assume you will not 
be careful with the work you do for me.
Anybody can learn software, but not everybody 
can think well and has talent. Know design theory. 
It doesn’t need to be the most professional work 
in the world, all I need to see is at least a spark of 
potential. That said, pay attention to detail and 
do your best to present it in a way that will elevate 
your ideas and craft. Reﬁ ne the type. It makes a 
huge difference.
I once learned this important point from a 
teacher: Don’t include the type of work that you 
don’t want to do for a living. For example, if you

want to be an art director, then don’t include a 
lot of illustration; include a favorite, so that they 
know you have the skill. A junior has to be able to 
explain his or her ideas to me. I prefer people who 
are genuinely passionate about their work. (You 
don’t have to be a slick presenter; being genuinely 
enthusiastic is good enough.)
What qualities do you look for in junior talent?
I look for hints of talent, to see if this person 
can think conceptually and can be a great thinker 
one day or will if what I see indicates he or she 
will be an amazing designer at some point. I look 
for someone who will inspire me. I want to be sur-
rounded by people who inspire me, to ﬁ nd people 
who possess characteristics or talents I don’t have. 
If the person surprises me, because he or she is 
interesting, that makes me realize I will be able 
to learn from him or her, and in turn, that per-
son will learn from me. Of course, there has to be 
chemistry, it has to be a good match. I want stu-
dents to realize that every good designer I know 
has a story about how he or she got rejected, or 
rejected more than once. Not everyone matches 
with everyone, not everyone is nice. Don’t sec-
ond-guess yourself. Don’t get discouraged, but 
use a rejection to improve. Try to understand why 
you got rejected and think, “Could I have done 
something better?”

What is the future of advertising?
Advertising is not going to change; it will al -
ways exist. The need to communicate something, 
to tell a story, will always exist. We have to sell a 
speciﬁ c good or service to this audience. Where 
can we reach them? At home? On their TVs? On 
their mobile phones? You have an idea—and then 
you come up with how and where you’re going 
to execute it. Come up with something that has 
never been done before—TV, web, out-of-home, 
mobile, and things that haven’t been done yet. If 
you just look at what’s been done before, then you 
need to say, let’s do something different.
Know what to say and how to say it; everything 
else comes from that.
Technology will keep evolving and advertising 
will have to move with it. For example, technology 
changes things, as Skype is here and has changed 
the face of long distance calling. The technology 
will help us keep things fresh, to allow us to tell 
stories in new ways and formats.
As soon as wireless is ubiquitous, we will be 
able to watch programming live from anywhere in 
the world on our mobile phones. More than ever, 
we have to create things people want to watch.
Integrated work is better because you’ll be 
inspired to see more of it in other places. At the 
end of the day, there will always be a place for 
brands to tell a story.

MINI COVERT
• BUTLER, SHINE, STERN & PARTNERS, 
SAUSALITO
“OUR STORY”
From the start, we felt that the greatest untapped 
strengths of MINI were the passion and devotion 
of its owners. So we decided to do something a 
little different. We decided to advertise to the peo-
ple who had already purchased a MINI. Sound 
strange? Here’s why it worked.
Since its U.S. launch in 2002, MINI has 
exceeded sales goals, but by 2006 it had gone 
from having no direct competitors to having 
over a dozen. This development made the early 
adopting owners of the vehicle more important 
than ever.
MINI owners are passionate. They’re border-
line evangelical. In that way, they’re more effec-
tive than any print ad could be at converting 
others who haven’t quite bought in.
With that in mind, we created a super-secret, 
integrated campaign with messages only MINI 
owners could see. We called it the MINI Covert 
campaign.
Book
First, we sent a book to 150,000 MINI owners 
called “A Dizzying Look at the Awesomeness of 
Small.” This book included an introduction with 
a secret compartment that housed the Covert Kit. 
This kit included instructions and three decoder 
tools that would help owners decipher the rest of 
the campaign.
The blogosphere responded with that much-
desired thing people refer to as “buzz,” not only 
on dozens of independent blogs but also on many 
automotive sites and general mass sites such as 
Flickr and YouTube.
Decoder
After the book was sent, three print ads in tar-
geted pubs let MINI owners know how to use 
their tools to decipher the secret messages. And, 
for the uninitiated, we even had an “overt” mes-
sage in the ads. For example, “Non MINI Own-
ers: Get your complimentary decoder with the 
purchase of any MINI.”
In the ﬁ rst print execution, owners were asked 
to use their decoder. The message led them to a 
super-secret website, and the adventure was on.
Decryptor
This ad used the sophisticated spy language 
known as Pig Latin to throw the curious off the 
scent. Again, owners were directed to a site and 
non-owners grew more intrigued.
Glasses
What’s a good espionage operation without some 
cool spy glasses? OK, maybe ours weren’t really 
that cool, but the results were.
c-Fit
The mysterious print ads led curious readers to 
corresponding websites. The sites required a little 

A DV E R T I S I N G
P. 359
more investigation in case “outsiders” happened 
to ﬁ nd them.
The ﬁ rst was dedicated to the protection of 
insects. It included short videos promoting that 
cause. (One featured an attack by an enormous 
killer bee that bore a strange resemblance to one 
of our ofﬁ ce canines.) But more importantly, it 
led MINI owners to an invitation to participate 
in a cross-country road rally called MINI Takes 
the States.
MINI Takes the States
Not only did tens of thousands of people ﬁ nd 
the reward from the c-Fit site, but thousands 
followed through and participated in the cross-
country driving extravaganza that stretched from 
Monterey, California, to beautiful Jersey City. 
Three thousand MINIs cruising down the high-
way is not a bad way to spread the love.
Spy Gear
Every good sleuth needs good spy equipment. So 
on this site, we presented cover for the next reward 
with some gag spy stuff. Of course, there were 
more videos, including the musical stylings of a 
paleontologist turned singer. But again, the true 
payoff was another reward for MINI owners.
Adventure Toggle Switches
This reward let MINI owners further customize 
their vehicles by adding a little intrigue to their 
control panels. What car couldn’t use an ejector 
switch or cloaking device?
Awesomeness of Small
The ﬁ nal site was a look at the beneﬁ ts of being 
small. It featured another informative video 
showing the adventures of a butterﬂ y with a bad 
attitude and a black belt. It also featured the 
ﬁ nal reward.
Medallion
For completing the ﬁ nal leg of the Covert print 
campaign, MINI owners could order proof of 
their participation and incredible investigative 
abilities. This reward came in the form of a 
medallion to be hung from the rearview mirror 
or to be worn around the neck while wearing a 
tuxedo at Monte Carlo casinos.
Motorby
In addition to creating a new way to talk to MINI 
owners, we created an entirely new way to directly 
communicate with drivers on the road. Using 
RFID technology embedded into a key fob, out-
door boards literally talked to MINI owners on 
the road.
Results
We preached to the choir. And the choir sang. 
Loudly.

Figure 13-24 is an ambient campaign to pro-
mote a bookstore that specializes in children’s pop-
up books. Ambient can take many forms. Instead 
of a traditional, nationwide billboard campaign, 
why not have giant cookies from outer space crash 
land onto prominent buildings in twenty cities 
simultaneously (Figure 13-25)? One could think 
of unconventional advertising as promotional 
design, public relations events, or a mix of both.
Certainly, effective unconventional solutions 
have been shown to successfully promote brands 
or groups in break-through ways that live beyond 
their media space, such as the limited edition 
mailer for Onitsuka Tiger running shoes by 
Asics, Tokyo ’64 Collection that became an eBay 
collectible (Figure 13-26).
A FINAL WORD
Since the creative revolution of the 1960s, creative 
advertising has made great strides to distance 
itself from hucksterism. More than ever before,

CREATIVE BRIEF AND CAMPAIGN: “HERO BREATH”
• STRAWBERRYFROG, AMSTERDAM
• ONITSUKA TIGER RUNNING SHOES BY ASICS, TOKYO ’64 COLLECTION
THE BRIEF
• Celebrate the reissue of Onitsuka Tigers Tokyo ’64 Collection in the run-up to 
the Athens Olympic Games.
• Cut through the massive brand spends of Nike and Adidas, while maintaining 
the innovative spirit of the Tiger brand.
• Focus on authenticity instead of sports clichés.
THE SOLUTION
• A limited edition mailer for instant glory!
• We broke through to trendsetters globally with an integrated campaign, 
pushing the only legal performance-enhancing drug at this year’s Olympics.
INSIGHT
• Onitsuka Tiger swept the board in the ’64 Olympics, winning 19 Gold medals 
for Japan.
• We recognized that something special was going on that year—so we 
captured it!
• Hero Breath—authentic breath, direct from the mouths of the Japanese 1964 
Olympians, captured in commemorative cans.
• Hero Breath was sent out to infl uencers in major world cities. The shoe 
collection and fi lm of the capture of the breath were featured on the 
accompanying website: www.tokyo64.com.
THE RESULTS
• Hero Breath has generated signifi cant worldwide press, commentary, 
and buzz. Editorials alone in opinion-forming magazines range from Italian 
Vogue to Sportswear International, covering an estimated audience of 
16 million readers.
• This tactically targeted campaign ensured that the Tokyo ’64 collection 
completely sold out.
• The controversial can of “legal dope” has now become an eBay collectible.
Hero Breath refl ects our pioneering spirit and gives us presence in a very 
competitive market. We’re delighted.

With the focus on a more unconventional means 
of promotion, Hornall Anderson convinced Cita-
tionShares to think beyond the 30-second spot 
and talk about viral advertising as a medium. The 
result was an innovative solution in the form of 
a series of three viral videos, featuring Michael 
Phelps—world-champion swimmer and winner 
of 8 gold medals in the 2008 Olympics. The 15- 
to 20-second ﬁ lm clips focus on “luxury meets 
levity” and were created for distribution to a wide 
audience via Internet channels—an audience typ-
ically comprised of 35- to 65-year-olds.
With humor in the foreground, setting the 
scenes in and around CitationShares jets high-
lights the luxury, comfort, and service inherent in 
the CitationShares experience, all the while sub-
tly driving trafﬁ c back to the client’s branded site. 
As a result of building brand equity from street 
level up, CitationShares is able to glean attention 
and interest from an audience that may otherwise 
never have been exposed to their company.
Through such themes as “Michael Phelps Flies,” 
“Michael Phelps Sings,” and “Michael Phelps 
Prank,” Hornall Anderson has effectively marketed 
a premium, niche brand to a broad and increas-
ingly media savvy audience. And by leading with 
the content, not the product, the videos provide 
a subtle, accessible introduction to the luxury and 
service that the CitationShares brand embodies.

INTRODUCTION: WHAT DO PEOPLE 
WANT FROM THE WEB?
Web design can secure a visitor’s involvement with an engaging interactive experience, pro-
viding the interactive experience is well designed. Through a collaborative effort, EVB San 
Francisco and Toy New York created the “Elf Yourself ” campaign for Ofﬁ ceMax (Figure 
14-01). EVB comments: “For the holidays, Elf Yourself allowed visitors to upload up to four 
photos and record a personal voice message through a toll-free number. The face or faces 
were then attached to an animated Elf body, the voice processed to sound elf-like, and the 
result was a dancing and talking Elf that could be forwarded to friends or posted on a per-
sonal website or blog. In six weeks, ElfYourself.com attracted a booming number of visitors 
and hit the bull’s-eye of viral success—it seeped into popular culture. Its popularity began on 
personal and industry blogs, spread to social networks, Flickr, Digg, and Facebook, and soon 
to mainstream media, USA Today and New York Times. Then, broadcasters at several stations, 
TODAY Show, Good Morning America, CNN American Morning, and ABC World News Now,
created custom greeting for their viewers.”
What makes an online experience engaging? It should be entertaining, educational, excit-
ing, intriguing, or rich. “In this seductive online experiment,” explains Big Spaceship (Figure 
14-02), “HBO invites you to experience the perverse pleasure of voyeurism. Our challenge? 
Substitute a window and binoculars for a monitor and mouse, and bring the vicarious thrill 
to life by creating detailed architectural facades and a living, breathing Manhattan setting for 
the stories. Find out what people do when they think no one is watching.
“What Makes It Different or Better? The HBO Voyeur Project brings twelve of the hidden 
stories of New Yorkers into view. Each of these stories takes place in a different apartment in 
ﬁ ve locations throughout the city, with the main action unfolding in the eight apartments of a 
tenement building in the Lower East Side. We wanted to get users close to the sights, sounds, 
and emotions of the drama without ever violating the personal space of the characters. All of 
the storylines are interconnected. So the more you watch, the more questions you have.”
A website visitor can become an active participant (user) by making choices: visit a site; 
move through a site; enter information, reviews, or comments; and generally interact with 
content at various points. A visitor can search for and download information or programs, 
purchase products, play games, enter contests, watch movies or TV programs, comment on 
message boards, IM, blog, view animations and videos, and—let’s not forget—read informa-
tion and ﬁ ction, obtain news, and take academic courses all online. Since more and more 
people spend more and more time online for entertainment, creating any “fun” digital oppor-
tunity could potentially help build a brand or organization. What would young men ﬁ nd

technological changes, and its impact on daily life 
will continue to be felt in innumerable ways.
Along with technology, environmental issues 
make regular headlines. As we ﬁ nd opportunities 
to go green, more information that was formerly 
available in print can go digital. For example, in 
Figure 14-04, “by designing the website in a way 
that it becomes The Green Building Institute’s 
primary marketing tool,” Ida Cheinman and Rick 
Salzman of Substance151 “eliminated the need 
for a number of paper-based materials.”
Designing for interactive media is collabora-
tive—involving a team of experts who develop and 
execute web design applications, usually including 
a lead creative team (a creative director, art direc-
tor, designers, writers, and producer) and technol-
ogy professionals, as well as animators, motion 
designers, programmers, testers, the client, and 
appealing? They found Figure 14-03 very enter-
taining—an application that allows you to ﬁ rst 
pull a stuntman out of clamshell packaging, while 
an urban alley movie set is instantly erected, then 
toss him about. Naturally, it went viral.
The Hear and Be Heard Fund needed a website 
to promote awareness for hearing impaired chil-
dren (see “Case Study: What Noise?/Kinetic”).
WEB DESIGN—
THE BIG PICTURE
Technology evolves daily and we can predict that 
digital media presentations, applications, and uses 
for visual communication will signiﬁ cantly evolve 
over the next decade. Since the 1990s, the Inter-
net has played an important part in advancing

Stuntman is your new unbreakable 
toy. With this completely articulated 
action fi gure, you can release all your 
accumulated adrenaline after hours 
at the offi ce. This application allows 
the user to beat and throw the main 
character without doing any harm 
or breaking a sweat. Stuntman is a 
highly addictive viral game designed 
to promote the campaign of Rexona 
for men: Action City.
Objective/Target: The main 
objective of The Stuntman and the 
whole Rexona for Men campaign 
was to position the brand in its 
target audience in Latinamerica. 
The main concept for the interactive 
Campaign and for the TV campaign: 
StuntCity, consisted of establishing 
Rexona as the deodorant for the 
modern man who loves taking risks 
and needs superior protection.
Solution: To achieve this objective, 
we created Stuntman, the viral game 
from the Rexona for Men campaign 
developed in fl ash technology. There, 
the user can live the experience of 
beating the stuntman character, 
throwing him against different 
places in the interface without 
harming him, because he is an 
action double.
The production of the site required 
a team of movie professionals to 
make the movements of the action 
double more realistic.

Project Objective: The Green Building Institute (GBI) is 
an emerging nonprofi t organization working to advance 
environmentally sustainable building practices through 
education and example. Substance151 was approached by 
GBI to create a new brand identity and a web presence that 
allows for growth and scalability.
Project: Substance151 developed a brand image that refl ects 
GBI’s vision of the world where natural and built environments 
co-exist. This fusion of geometric and organic, manmade and 
natural is the main visual concept of the new brand identity 
and its applications. The choice of evocative contrasts achieved 
through carefully selected photography and icons used in both 
online and offl ine materials continue to communicate the fusion 
between built and natural environments.
PRODUCTION NOTES:
• Paper: Mohawk Options, White Smooth—100% PCW and 
FSC-certifi ed; manufactured with renewable, nonpolluting wind-
generated electricity.
• Printing: Rainbow Printing of Maryland—uses soy-based inks.
• By choosing a local printer, we (1) minimized energy use 
associated with long-distance deliveries; (2) contributed to 
building a sustainable local economy.
• By designing the website in a way that it becomes The Green 
Building Institute’s primary marketing tool, we eliminated the 
need for a number of paper-based materials.
LESSONS LEARNED:
• Using environmentally conscious paper/inks and a local printer 
is cost-effective, sustainable, and rewarding.
• By conducting all presentations over the Internet/via PDFs, 
we saved paper otherwise needed for multiple color proofs; 
once the design was fi nalized, we gave the client Pantone 
chips for color approval.
• Using web-based marketing communications reduces paper 
waste and printing-related energy use.

Web designers must work cooperatively with 
information technology (IT) programmers. These 
professionals depend upon one another’s exper-
tise and contribution to the development of a 
functional online design application. One of their 
goals is to respect the user—making the website 
clear, useful, and frustration-free, alleviating any 

The client needed the site to be informative and 
as such, provided us with facts and ﬁ gures relating 
to the topic. We found it to be a real challenge 
because initially, it seemed like the site was to 
be primarily based on the information provided 
as the client believed that it was the best way to 
reach out to the people. After giving it some care-
ful consideration, we felt that the approach was 
too safe and predictable; hence it may not be very 
successful in the current online environment. So 
we went on to persuade the client to go about it 
in another fashion, one that captures a person’s 
attention by means of placing the user in the 
perspective of a hearing impaired child through 
interactive means.
We felt that in order for the site to work, it 
would have to be very stealthy. We needed to draw 
people in by playing up on their curiosity in order 
to sell them a very serious message. One that on 
its own, though important, is too easily ignored 
in this day and age, if done using a traditional 
method. With this in mind, we came up with a 
rather vague sounding, yet somewhat relevant 
URL “whatnoise.org” as a working title. Then we 
set about ﬁ nding a way to relate the experience of 
a hearing impaired child to the user.
After several brainstorm sessions, we decided 
that the best way to go about it would be to use 
very simple games to engage the user. However, it 
was no easy task as the game ideas needed to be 
relevant and at the same time, not come across as 
too forced. Eventually, we managed to craft three 
micro games to represent three key issues faced by 
these children, each one speciﬁ cally relating to a 
symptom. All three games have different interac-
tivity, but they all work in the same manner in that 
the ﬁ rst levels are all relatively easy to complete. 
When it comes to the second level, the user will 
feel handicapped in a certain way and will ﬁ nd 
it almost impossible to complete the task. That’s 
when they will feel the frustration and the plight 
of these children, and it is here that the relevant 
information is revealed to them. It’s only after 
playing a game that the user, on returning to the 
home page, will then ﬁ nd that it’s actually a website 
for a charity as the logo and a menu bar with more 
information will then appear. Since its launch, the 
site has been receiving a lot of attention not just 
from the local community, but also from around 
the world. It’s a very good result, especially for a 
site that is aimed at creating awareness.

PURPOSES OF WEBSITES
Compared with print, interactive media is in 
its infancy; however, younger generations have 
grown up with the web and many spend most of 
their leisure time with interactive media. Website

› Organizations (see Figure 14-05)
› Government
› Commercial
› Educational

WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT
As with solving any graphic design problem, there 
are various stages in the design and implementa-
tion process of a website design. Besides the usual 
stages of creating proposals and creative briefs, the 
web design application process requires thorough 
prototyping, where the site is created and tested for 
usability. There are ten key steps in this part of the 
website development process:
1/ Project plan: orientation and analysis to set 
and guide the goals and form the team of experts
2/ Creative brief: to outline creative strategy 
as it relates to the broader brand or visual iden-
tity, positioning and target audience, and all the 
other objectives of a brief

› Primary global or meta navigation within one 
website
› Secondary or sub-navigation (for second-tier 
information)
› Single web page navigation
A well-designed website will have a stream-
lined visual layout that provides an immediate 
sense of location at all times, one that offers con-
sistent elements from page to page. Whether the 
website is three screen pages or a hundred screen 
pages in scope, a plan is necessary for leading the 
viewer through the site.
The ﬁ rst screen the visitor sees is a splash page,
which serves as an introduction to a website, usu-
ally featuring animation or an engaging visual, 
though not all sites have splash pages. (A splash 
page offering visitors a “Skip Intro” option is best 
practice.) The splash page does not have naviga-
tion or important content, and when any anima-
tion is over, the home page comes up.
The home page is the primary entrance to a 
website and contains the central navigation sys-
tem. A visitor can also sometimes enter via a link 
to a page other than the home page. The home 
screen is more than a title page—along with a cen-
tral navigation system, it gives the visitor contact 
information and establishes the “look and feel” of 
the site. If a visitor ﬁ nds a home page engaging, 
he or she is more likely to be drawn further into 
the site. The home page can set the tone for the 
entire website experience. It should have the most 
important information visible without scrolling; 
some refer to this as “above the fold,” from news-
paper industry jargon.
The colors, graphics, textures, and spatial illu-
sions set up an emotional level of expressiveness. 
If the home page displays moving graphics that 
twist, turn, and ﬂ ip, the visitor will expect play-
ful activity throughout the site; a home page with 
clean, still imagery will cause visitors to expect 
this same simplicity everywhere else.
All navigation systems consist of visual and 
digital links that connect one location on a web 
page to another location, at either the same web-
site or a different one.
The visual areas of links are referred to as tabs 
and buttons. Tabs are simply graphic interface 
metaphors based on the function of tabs on ﬁ le 
include general information, data, news, sto-
ries, poetry, and entertainment, as well as music, 
photos, and videos; information that enhances 
knowledge and interest in the brand, institution, 
or social cause; downloadable or printable mate-
rial; and interactive “goodies” such as contests, 
giveaway items, screen savers, and games. Con-
tent should be well organized and easy to under-
stand and access.
When providing content, good writing should 
always be a priority. Rules of writing apply to the 
web and other new and emerging media, the same 
as to any print media. How well headlines and 
copy or text is written greatly affects communica-
tion. Unity, coherence, and emphasis are always 
main goals, according to Homer E. Woodbridge 
in his classic book on writing, Essentials of English 
Composition. Make messages clear, weaving them 
into the concept or theme and user experience. 
Editing for clarity and pith also applies.
Information architecture is the careful organi-
zation of website content into hierarchical order. 
For a user to be able to easily move through—or 
navigate—a website, the content must be orga-
nized and structured in a logical way, from general 
to speciﬁ c. However, web architecture is nonlinear; 
it must allow for nonlinear, nonsequential naviga-
tion. A visitor must easily be able to get where he 
or she wants to go from any point in the website. 
Clearly organized information architecture is cru-
cial to giving the user a positive and frustration-
free experience, especially for text-heavy websites, 
such as editorial sites (online magazines and 
newspapers), archives, museums, and government 
sites. The information architecture is the design-
er’s guide to the overall composition of the website 
and hierarchy of individual graphic elements.
Once clear and user-intuitive information 
architecture has been established, a designer cre-
ates a corresponding “push-button” system, or a 
graphic interface, for accessing the information. 
The visual design of information architecture is 
the navigation system. A consistent visual struc-
ture is equally critical to ease of use and a frus-
tration-free user experience. Many websites have 
several levels of navigation, including:
› Portal navigation that leads to many other 
websites

P. 374
Chapter  14
folders. Both tabs and buttons are interactive 
links. It is critical that tabs and buttons are clear, 
simple, and consistent in style, shape, and color 
so the visitor can recognize clickable links and 
move quickly and efﬁ ciently through the site. 
Color in particular is a strong visual “ﬂ ag” or 
“cue” that the visitor can immediately recognize. 
Our mind tends to see and register color before 
it does shape; therefore it is most important to 
use color clearly, effectively, and consistently. Best 
practice dictates that if red is chosen for a button 
on the home page or global navigation of the site, 
then that color red should be used exclusively for 
this purpose throughout the site and for no other 
nonclickable graphics or information.
A button is used to make selections; how-
ever, buttons do not necessarily have to look like 
little round disks. They can be graphic forms of 
any shape or they may be imagery that creates a 
visual metaphor. For inspiration, researching well-
designed, award-winning websites is the best way 
to see what is possible in designing navigation but-
tons. Almost all the visual communication trade 
magazines, such as One Club Interactive, Print, and 
Communication Arts, publish interactive annuals of 
award-winning new media design.
If the information architecture and navigation 
system graphics are well designed during the ini-
tial phase of website development, any subsequent 
phases or developments in the design will be easily 
facilitated. A plan of how the pages will “ﬂ ow” will 
ensure easy navigation and give a sense of where 
a visitor is—a sense of location/geography—
anywhere throughout a website. Some designers 
use a storyboard or ﬂ ow chart technique to deter-
mine the ﬂ ow of the site plan.
CONCEPTUAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
AND VISUALIZATION
A design concept is the driving idea—the back-
bone—of the planning for any interactive solution, 
based on the content, strategy, goals, and the brief, 
which should address the speciﬁ cs of the goals for 
the website. For a concept, visualization, and design 
development for photographer Paul Elledge, Tim

Crawling with enchanting little drawings, this site might be one of Kandinsky’s notebooks, but it’s 
not. It’s the online portfolio of photographer Paul Elledge.
“We drew inspiration from Paul’s photography,” Tim Bruce says of the highly creative site, but 
much of its style comes from a particular habit. “Travel with him,” says Bruce, “and you notice 
he’s a doodler.” Elledge doodles wherever he has a pen and a surface—on paper and all over his 
photography cases. “Stop by his studio,” Bruce goes on, “and you’ll notice that the drawing goes 
beyond the travel gear to light switches and walls. We looked to extend this experience onto the 
web.” As for Elledge, he wanted to update his site functionally, but he also wanted it to refl ect 
his diverse photographic range. He wanted to be able to go in and easily tweak his galleries. And 
he wanted, of course, to doodle all over it. “The closer we got to communicating Paul’s point of 
view,” says Bruce, “the more original it is. Paul chose this direction by instinct, and the fi nal site 
is hardly distinguishable from the initial sketches.”

which he discusses in his book, MTIV: Pro-
cess, Inspiration, and Practice for the New Media 
Designer. If you can identify a theme that best tells 
your group or brand’s story, that theme can be 
used as a consistent design element (images, color 
palette, and typography) throughout to drive the 
ﬂ ow of the design.
The brand image, conveyed through concepts 
and visual design, should be consistent across all 
media in order to sustain a brand. Usually, there is 
a lead agency or studio that establishes the strat-
egy/concept-base for a marketing effort or inte-
grated campaign.
For visualization, there must be a consistent 
“look and feel” with the existing or concurrent 
design of the brand identity, as in Figure 14-08 for 
Bruce of Lowercase not only drew inspiration from 
Elledge’s photography, he based it on Elledge’s cre-
ative habits (Figure 14-07). Bruce sought to extend 
Elledge’s penchant for extreme doodling (on any 
surface—on paper and all over his photography 
cases) to the website. Thus the visualization of 
the site became “a little look into a creative mind,” 
explains its designer, Tim Bruce. “We think one 
should look at brands as the sum total of the expe-
rience. Our work is about extending the brand of 
a person or organization out to people who haven’t 
gotten to know the person or organization directly. 
Paul Elledge photography ﬁ ts this bill.”
Related to design concept development is that 
of formulating a theme. Interactive designer Hill-
man Curtis often utilizes a thematic approach,

function to ensure an effortless and worthwhile 
user experience. For example, in Figure 14-10, 
Visual Dialogue developed a website for Incoun-
sel that gave “them a presence that stands out in 
the conservative world of law ﬁ rm websites. Text 
and images are concealed and revealed through 
the use of overlays. As the user scrolls though 
the copy, the relevant section moves to the fore-
ground, while metaphoric photos are progres-
sively brought into focus in the top band.”
Visual hierarchy ranks visuals and text in order
of importance, which should be a natural out-
growth of content, emphasizing and ordering 
content from the most important to the least 
important. Most commercial, editorial, or govern-
Chicago Partners and Figure 14-09 for Elements. 
If there are print or ofﬂ ine graphic design appli-
cations for this same brand or group, then there 
should be online and ofﬂ ine campaign integration; 
one design should be informed by the other, and 
the entire branding program should be consistent.
For example, a website design for a retailer may 
want to reﬂ ect the same type of shopping experi-
ence that the visitor has in the actual store, or the 
design may duplicate online the layout and look 
of the store itself.

allowing for some variation. Jeffrey Zeldman 
compares web design to architecture, in how the 
planes and grids of a structure facilitate its use.
The grid splits the page into columns with 
deﬁ ned widths, spacing, and margins, to establish 
positions for the standard elements on the page 
and alignment of text and pictures. Often, there is 
more than one grid per online design to allow for 
the different types of content and applications; 
when that is the case, the grids are designed with 
unity in mind.
The visual design of a website grid has a mas-
ter layout, used to guide the composition and 
placement of every element—text, headers, and 
graphics—from screen to screen. By maintain-
ing a visual grid, the visitor will have an easy time 
locating titles, information, and navigation graph-
ics, thus enabling a smooth passage around the 
site. (Software layout programs refer to a stock 
layout as a template. And non-designers utilize 
stock templates in lieu of designing a grid.)
A grid is used so that the design is consistent 
and content can be easily loaded and updated, 
affording a visitor a sense of location—so that he 
or she has a sense of the geography of the site. 
Toni Toland, professor at Syracuse University, 
refers to this as the blueprint. For example, as an 
mental websites have a great deal of content, 
with layers of relational information arranged in 
ranking order, creating multiple hierarchies. For 
example, if you want to read about advertising on 
The New York Times website, that content is a sub-
category of the business section. Or if you want to 
explore relationships among photographs on the 
National Archives Experience, Digital Vaults, you 
would go to “Pathways,” then select a pathway or 
create a new pathway. On websites with real-time 
and collaborative content, data is retrieved and 
displayed in dynamic hierarchies, where content 
is ranked according to community participation, 
for example, digg.com.
Michael O’Keefe, information systems designer, 
implores, “Guide someone through a site, so it’s 
not random, almost like a guided tour.” A strong 
grid creates a visual identity and maintains order, 
creating a sense of “geography and location,” 
making it easy for the visitor to quickly locate var-
ious options and have a smooth passage through 
a formidable amount of information. Establish 
the ﬂ ow of information from the broad message 
to the speciﬁ c.
A grid is most often used as the central order-
ing structure for a website, a framework, used to 
create a uniform layout from page to page, while

analogy, houses in a development might all use the 
same blueprint, however, each house is “personal-
ized.” Within a site, each page may have differ-
ences, yet there is still a visual unity throughout, 
as in Figure 14-11, which has a very clear visual 
hierarchy and makes ﬁ nding information easy, 
enhancing the intense energy of Big Spaceship’s 
concept and visual design for Glaceau.
Unity refers to the level of consistency and cor-
respondence throughout a site. Creating visual
correspondence among the pages—unity through-
out the entire work, rhythm from page to page, 
and a ﬂ ow from page to page—is crucial. Provid-
ing a sense of location for the visitor is equally 
important. For instance, the home page link 
should be visually consistent (the same shape and 
in the same spot on every screen page) through-
out the site. In addition, each screen should have a 
title in the same spot so the visitor knows exactly 
where to look to determine his or her “location” 
within the site. The visitor should never think, 
“Where am I?” without knowing where to look 
for the answer.
The problem of unity in a website design is 
similar to establishing unity in a song; they are 
both experienced in “chunks” or sections. “There 
are many ways to create unity in music,” notes 
Professor Matthew Halper of the music depart-
ment at Kean University of New Jersey. “One 
of the most prevalent might be generally called 
‘thematic processes,’ for example, the repetition 
of some recognizable musical chunk, let’s say a 
melody, in a slightly altered form at various points 
in the piece. Notice that such a strategy assumes 
that some aspect of the ‘chunk’ changes while 
something else stays the same.”
Color
A web page designer does have special consider-
ations regarding color. When you design for print 
and see your design through production onsite at 
the printing facility, you have a good amount of 
control over the ﬁ nal color. Not so with web design. 
You can’t control the color on the monitor of every 
web user, especially considering that Macintosh 
systems display color at a lighter value than non-
Mac systems. It’s best to view your design on all 
types of systems and browsers to ensure your color

plain ole water with vitamins 
and electrolytes. Unfortunately, 
users can’t take a sip of their 
favorite Vitamin Water fl avor 
or try out the new Vitamin 
Energy drink straight from 
their computers. So Glaceau 
challenged us to present their 
brand and full line of products 
as if the user could pick up the 
bottles and take a sip. The even 
greater challenge was to include 
massive amounts of content 
without overloading the user—
from witty, personality-fi lled copy 
to celebrity endorsements to 
the scientifi c benefi t of vitamins.
WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT 
OR BETTER?
We created a Glaceau 
ecosystem that captures the 
personality and fun of each 
product as well as the art 
and science of water. The fact 
that Glaceau’s identity is so 
well-established forced us to 
broaden the message from 
witty copy and clean graphic 
design to bringing to life the 
scientifi c makeup of each 
product and still be irreverent. 
Users can explore each and 
every bottle, fl avor, vitamin, 
and boost of energy to their 
hearts’ content. With swirling 
particles and spinning bottles, 
each drink nearly pours out of 
the monitor. With a few howler

Sony Pictures wanted to issue a 
stern warning against going up to 
Barrow, Alaska—especially for the 
month when the sun never rises, 
like in their newest vampire fl ick, 
30 Days of Night. So how do you 
make a cool subject like vampires 
even cooler?
WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT 
OR BETTER?
We built an online Barrow where 
people can wander the streets and 
wait anxiously as the sun dips below 
the horizon and the vampires creep 
out of the shadows.
We put people into the thick of it. 
Let them explore the sleepy town 
at dusk. Made sure to equip them 
with a shotgun, just in case they 
stumble upon one of those pesky 
vampires. Because Barrow is lousy 
with vampires. The sun sets fast 
and pretty soon people are glancing 
over their shoulders at whatever 
that was in the corner in their eye.

cool stuff and links them to the online multiplayer 
game we created (yes, we got to make a multiplayer 
game too). . . . Our design team tapped a vampire-
ish coworker to stand in as the fast-approaching blood 
sucker in the mini-game. Our development team

As both web and mobile applications prolif-
erate, tools and features will become ever more 
important for creating engaging content. The 
Poetry Foundation website designed by Win-
terhouse (Figure 14-16) is a rich poetry resource 
featuring the “Poetry Tool,” which allows users to 
search and ﬁ nd poems by occasion, title, category, 
or terms, such as haiku or free verse.
ENGAGING CONTENT
A rich user experience is where the website actu-
ally performs or offers value, one where the visitor 
is not just passively looking through it, according 
to Michael O’Keefe. A shopping site offering rich 
media (audio, video, Flash animation), where one 
can transact with another entity and make selec-
tions, such as Nike Lab, is a rich user experience 
(Figure 14-14).
Sony Pictures’ 30 Days of Night—a ﬁ lm about 
an Alaskan town that is plunged into night for 
30 days and plagued by vampires—engages 
visitors at their site shown in Figure 14-15. Big

never lose sight of the central navigation that tells

D.S.
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 
INTERACTIVE CAMPAIGNS 
HAVE THESE FIVE PRINCIPLES 
IN COMMON1
Reading Twitter recently, I came across a great 
quote by Tom Ajello (Meat99), who said Twitter 
is like “an army of deaf people shouting into a 
canyon.” This also describes the current state of 
traditional marketing.
If ads are losing effectiveness, is the best solu-
tion to create more ads, increase frequency, and 
heighten disruptiveness? Should you continue 
using the same words but louder? The problem is 
consumers no longer speak the language of tradi-
tional marketers. Instead, they speak digital. They 
control the messages they consume and ﬁ lter and 
navigate the media landscape with a new kind of 
freedom. Instead of screaming to get attention, 
advertisers need to create a positive experience 
that consumers will freely seek out and enjoy in 
their own time.
At EVB, we’ve experimented with new media, 
failed a few times, learned a lot, and enjoyed some 
achievements. Looking back, each successful ini-
tiative shared speciﬁ c tactics. These commonali-
ties have become our core principles.
1. Practice participation marketing. The key 
to engagement is participation. Consumers are 
empowered to engage in the content they choose; 
if they don’t “care” about a campaign, they’ll avoid 
it. When executed in a welcoming, non-disrup-
tive manner, digital content invites consumers to 
engage on their terms.
Before digital content is developed and released, 
it’s integral to ask why the consumer should care. 
A simple question, but not one marketers have 
historically considered. In today’s marketplace, 
marketers don’t build brands—consumers do. Our 
job becomes providing consumers with the con-
tent, message, and tools that enable them to create 
a personalized experience to share with others.
A great example of participation marketing is 
the “Freak your mind” campaign created for the 
third-season premiere of A&E’s Criss Angel Mind-
freak. Users provided a friend’s name, phone, and 
e-mail, and a video featuring Angel performing a 
personalized magic trick was sent to the friend, 
taking them from e-mail to video to mobile, end-
ing in a mind-boggling scare. Once someone was 
“freaked,” he or she passed it on tenfold. In weeks, 
the campaign garnered millions of visitors and 
resulted in the show’s highest ratings to date.
2. Think “working production.” The terms 
“working dollars,” to deﬁ ne media, and “non-
working dollars,” to deﬁ ne creative and produc-
tion, have never made sense to me. For engagement 
marketing, such terms are irrelevant. Instead, 
emphasis must be put on the “experience” created 
to draw consumers and retain their attention. By 
elevating the importance of creative and produc-
tion, unique consumer experiences are born, and 
consumers become brand ambassadors willing to 
share your content with their digital networks.
I’m often asked for seeding strategies “to make 
something viral.” The truth is, if the content 
doesn’t strike a chord, no amount of seeding or 
advertising will make it viral. Campaigns like “Elf 
yourself ” [see Figure 14-1] and “Freak your mind” 
each started with an e-mail to a select group of 
“inﬂ uencers,” who took it upon themselves to 
contribute to its success. Next are the blogs; they 
are the tipping point. If the blogs ignore your 
content, it has little chance. After blogs comes 
the digital press. From there, the traditional press 
furthers the spread of content.
3. Create liquid content. At this point, all mar-
keting is digital. Why should a great idea be con-
strained by the boundaries of the Web? To create 
“liquid” content capable of moving freely among 
platforms, start with an overarching idea and then 
ﬁ nd the best way to distribute it. No message 
should live and die in a single medium.
The recent 2K Sports campaign was built 
around the core idea of “football resurrected” [see 
Figure 13-10], marking 2K’s return to the grid-
iron video game arena with All-Pro Football 2K8. 
The campaign launched with a dynamic digital 
component and expanded to TV, print, street 
teams, and a national concert tour that together 
celebrated the return of “real” football gaming.

4. Simplicity is key. Digital consumers are 
“snackers” and choose to be reached on their terms 
with quick and satisfying content. They lead fast-
paced, multitasking lives with only enough time 
for content that serves a useful or entertaining 
purpose. It should allow them to brieﬂ y engage 
and move on. A campaign should give more 
to the consumer than it takes in return. Many 
assume that “digital marketing” must use a lot of 
high-tech bells and whistles. In fact, simple, use-
ful content is more effective and more welcome.
5. Integration is never an afterthought. Forcing 
together disparate parts and shoehorning creative 
doesn’t make a campaign “integrated.” Instead, 
strive for ideas that are integrated at the core and 
work gracefully together between platforms.
The Adidas soccer campaign around the 2006 
and 2007 Major League Soccer seasons utilized 
an integrated idea with powerful results. In 2007, 
the campaign, called “MLS Represent,” commis-
sioned 13 rising bands to write and record origi-
nal anthem tracks for each MLS team. The tracks 
were made available for free download. Concert 
posters were created for local postings and used 
in print media. User-generated videos were cre-
ated online. CDs were distributed at Adidas 
retail locations and events. Anthems were played 
in stadiums, some live. Music videos were ﬁ lmed 
and later used for TV and online advertising.
The days of one-way communication are 
behind us. Speaking louder will only further sep-
arate you from your audience. In fact, they aren’t 
your “audience” anymore; they are an “active par-
ticipant” in the content you create.
EVB AND “FREAK YOUR MIND”
In support of A&E’s hit show Criss Angel Mind-
freak, EVB produced an experiential, interactive 
site at FreakYourMind.com. The campaign titled 
“Freak Your Mind” seamlessly transfers the enter-
tainment experience of television to an online 
platform that appeals to a virtual audience. It’s a 
cyber magic trick you can virtually play on your 
friends, taking them on a multiplatform roller 
coaster ride that ends in a freakish scare. With the

EVB AND “MLS REPRESENT”
A website experience can include the additional 
sensory experience of sound—music, voice, spe-
cial effects, found sounds—which should never 
be underestimated in its emotional appeal, as well 
as functional beneﬁ t. For Adidas Soccer, EVB 
created the Adidas Major League Soccer (MLS) 
campaign. Titled “MLS Represent,” one of their 
ﬁ ve main goals was “to connect with soccer fans 
and soccer players through music.” EVB brought 
together MLS teams and local music talent to 
create original anthems for each team and host

Campaign Caption: For the second year, EVB created the Adidas Major League Soccer 
(MLS) campaign. Titled “MLS Represent,” EVB paired 13 MLS teams with local artists 
or bands from rock, pop, hip-hop, Latin, and punk genres to write and record an 
original anthem song that symbolized each MLS team and home city.
“MLS Represent” was designed to encourage camaraderie and rivalry around 
the sport. Participating bands included OK GO, Mike Jones, and Barenaked Ladies. 
The campaign launched in August and continued through the 2007 MLS Playoffs in 
November 2007.
CAMPAIGN RESULTS:
• MLS teams and fans embraced “MLS Represent” using team anthems during 
half-time shows, tailgate parties, at home, online, etc., in celebration of their 
favorite team;
• Over 80,000 blogs wrote specifi cally about the Adidas “MLS Represent” campaign.

were featured on fan and team sites and on the 
Adidas ‘MLS Represent’ website (www.adidas

plimentary songs and learn about each team, its 
players, and respective hometown band. Addi-
tionally, fans could represent their team by creat-
ing mash-up music videos that combine a team 
anthem with MLS game footage that could be 
sent to friends or rivals.”

When Ancestry.com ﬁ nished making 140 years, 
worth of U.S. Census data available online, they 
wanted to celebrate. For them, Hornall Anderson 
“built a microsite to mark their achievement and 
draw attention to the incredible opportunities 
this resource provides” (Figure 14-17). Hornall 
Anderson explains: “The rich, interactive site acts 
as the tip of the iceberg, giving visitors a glimpse 
of how they can use this massive repository both 
to explore their own family’s story and to learn 
more about the larger population and immigra-
tion trends of the last century and a half. The 
design incorporates authentic photos and docu-
ments to show that census records are more than 
lists of names: they are artifacts, snapshots of our 
collective and personal history.”

without knowing something about the viewer.

to the immediate attention of the visitor; how-
ever, it is acceptable to allow some content to
be “found.”)
› Offer or do something that traditional graphic 
media can’t.
› Offer a media-rich experience.

MAXIMIZING POTENTIAL: 
TECHNOLOGY AND 
INTEGRATING MEDIA
At any point, learning to embrace the strength 
and potential of available technology is a good 
rule of thumb. Knowing what newer media, 
emerging media, and media platforms and outlets 
are capable of will allow you to execute concepts 
in fuller ways. For example, Second Story’s design 
for the National Archives Experience, Digital 
Vaults, embraces Web 2.0 technology (see “Case 
Study: National Archives Experience, Digital 
Vaults/Second Story”).
In the past, television commercials and print 
ads were the main carriers of ad messages. Now 
television, as well as print, is often used to drive 
people to the web where they can interact with 
a brand or group. More and more we see a con-
vergence of media; for example, a mobile phone 
can become any person’s media hub with an 
Internet connection, camera, programmed con-
tent, GPS, and more. As technology rapidly 
evolves, it is most likely that our mobile phones 
will become one of the most important players in 
carrying content and messages. Mobile, widgets, 
and emerging digital platforms have sister solu-
tions or companion solutions related to website 
content. An informed designer or team should 
understand how to link strategy, core concepts, 
and visual design across platforms, as did R/GA 
for Nokia Urbanista Diaries (see “Case Study: 
Nokia Urbanista Diaries/R/GA”).
characteristics. AM+A designed many kinds of 
visual imagery and three-dimensional imagery to 
convey excitement and unique user experience. This 
effort was one of Microsoft’s earliest user-centered 
design efforts, which included housing teenagers in 
a house for a period of time in which their social-
izing and communication habits could be studied. 
AM+A’s prototype was shown to Bill Gates, who 
reacted favorably and gave the project a green-light 
to go forward with product development.”
IMPORTANT POINTS 
FOR WEBSITE DESIGN
What are the most essential considerations for 
web design?
› Respect the user.
› Engage the visitor through visual interest
and clarity.
› Integrate design of website with brand identity: 
color palette, graphic elements, tone, visualization 
method, imagery.
› Prototype and test, test, test!
› Ensure logical web hierarchy.
› Content should be easy to ﬁ nd, read, and print 
or download. (Most content should be brought 
POINTS
POINTS  TO CONSIDER
When designing an interactive experience, always keep the visitor’s point of view 
in mind:
• Does content download and stream as fast as possible (in less than 15 seconds)?
• Does it enable communication? Is it easy to navigate? Can someone easily fi nd 
information?
• Is it frustration-free?
• Is it relevant to the audience? Would someone want to return? Does it create 
worthwhile dialogue with the visitor? Is the online experience worth someone’s 
time?
• Is the visitor getting something he or she can’t get elsewhere (a media-rich 
experience)?

As with creating concepts and visuals for televi-
sion commercials, screen-based media can involve 
narrative forms (storytelling for linear, nonlinear, 
realism, abstraction, and experimental), sequenc-
ing of images and events, composition, and visual 
and motion variables (characteristics, attributes, 
or qualities). As always, the underlying concept 
drives the execution, as it does in Figure 14-19: 
“Smarterer. Connecteder. Funnerer. Not the typi-
cal descriptors used to explain mobile technol-
ogy. But the T-Mobile G1—manufactured by 
HTC—isn’t your typical phone. As Google’s ﬁ rst 
foray into the wireless market, the G1 is the ﬁ rst 
phone running Google’s Android platform and is 
already generating excitement.”
Hornall Anderson continues: “We developed 
the whimsical launch theme and a range of sup-
port materials for a fourteen-city tour designed to 
build momentum in the T-Mobile retail channel 
and train the sales force to be G1 experts in antic-
ipation of a surge of demand for the new phone. 
The theme employed a tongue-in-cheek misuse 
of grammar inspired by the Google name itself—
technically a misspelling of ‘googol’—and com-
municates the populist positioning of the device 
and the idea of not taking itself too seriously. The 
result: an energized and prepared sales force, and 
a solid launch pad for this historic device.”
MOTION AESTHETICS
Motion aesthetics refers to the process and con-
sideration of how form creates impact over time 
in a design. Fundamental to screen-based media 
is an individual frame—single static image, one 
MOTION
Screen-based media can support graphics that 
move over a period of time; also called four-
dimensional design. In order to create moving 
graphics, one must be well acquainted with the 
necessary technical issues, production tech-
niques, and software such as Adobe Photoshop, 
Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Flash, Apple Final Cut 
Pro, Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Fireworks, 
and Adobe After Effects. However, one must 
also apply two-dimensional design principles to 
screen-based visual communications. Like any 
other visual communications application, screen-
based media can communicate a message and be 
expressive. The audience may not know how to 
critique successful motion design but the viewer 
will be aware if your motion solution is not ﬂ uid, 
forceful, or aligned in makeup with the other 
visual components of the piece.
As always, a designer working with motion 
must consider concept generation, function, form, 
aesthetics, meaning, and ultimately, communica-
tion. Whether screen-based media is incorpo-
rated into other media or stands alone, one must 
be conversant with the following considerations:
› Concept generation based on strategy and brief
› Theories fundamental to motion or animation
› Narrative forms or storytelling (linear and 
nonlinear narrative forms)
› Planning of action
› Sequencing of images for maximum impact 
and communication
› Integration of different media (if relevant)

Urbanista Diaries is a digital platform that uti-
lizes a website, a mobile application, and personal 
widgets to allow people to capture and share 
their lives in real-time through the Nokia N82. 
The powerful Nokia N82 is enabled with GPS-
technology and a ﬁ ve-megapixel camera that 
allows users to tag each photo to a speciﬁ c loca-
tion and instantaneously share their experiences 
with anyone via widgets posted on blogs or social 
networking sites, like Facebook.
Urbanista Diaries was rolled out in an exten-
sive three-phase campaign that engaged blog-
gers, journalists, and everyday people to take 
photos of their life adventures. For the ﬁ rst 
phase, four inﬂ uential bloggers were sent across 
the globe with a Nokia N82 to record their jour-
neys and share it with guests on the Urbanista 
Diaries site. For phase two, Nokia partnered 
with several top media sites such as Wallpaper, 
Lonely Planet, National Geographic, and CNN 
to document major world events in real time via 
journalists, artists, and scientists. People could 
follow the unfolding events both on the site and 
via widgets. Phase three opens up the experi-
ence to everyone with a GPS-enabled Nokia 
device. Now anyone can upload their personal 
photos from their journeys to the site or their 
personal widget for all their friends and family 
to track. Urbanista Diaries is another example of 
how Nokia is changing the way people share the 
stories of their lives.
The driving insight behind Urbanista Diaries 
was that merely informing people that the new 
Nokia N82 came equipped with a GPS and a ﬁ ve-
megapixel camera was not enough to cut through 
a crowded market dominated by highly competi-
tive communications. Instead, demonstrating the 
Nokia N82’s capabilities and its beneﬁ ts would 
provide a more compelling case.

page ﬂ ows into the next page and the overall impact 
of the entire website. When considering the over-
all screen-based piece, the following elements are 
critical to create impact.
PROXIMITY
Grouping elements should enhance content and 
communication. All visual elements must seem 
related, but some visual elements will create 
groupings due to proximity. The negative space 
around each visual element and between visual 
elements reveals how they are related by meaning 
and function.
CONTRAST
Without contrast all visual elements would look 
the same, yielding monotony. Establishing con-
trast produces impact because it helps create 
distinction and visual diversity, and most impor-
tantly, makes a distinction among visual elements, 
helping set up the hierarchy of information in 
the screen-based application. As with any visual 
of many strung together to create motion graph-
ics. Frames are created but connected and used 
in multiples over time. A temporal relationship
exists in screen-based media—the relationship or 
interplay between two separate events or images; 
this involves chronology—the order of events. 
A screen-based design solution is composed of a 
number of media items (events, frames, images, 
and sound), each of which has its own duration. 
These can be combined into a whole by specify-
ing the temporal relationships among the differ-
ent items. Temporal relationships also refer to the 
relationships among frames.
As in all graphic design, one must consider spa-
tial relationships—the distance between the thing 
seen in relation to the viewer, how far/how close, 
and the shifts between near and far. Visuals or 
images can be seen from close-up (a shot that is 
zoomed in), a medium shot (seen from a medium 
distance), or a long shot (seen from far away). For 
example in Figure 14-20, an animated logo for 
MTV Productions, we see a variety of shots, start-
ing with a long shot moving toward a close-up.
How a designer interposes different types of 
shots, each frame forming spatial relationships to 
the other, creates rhythm and contrast. Rhythmic 
relationships in screen-based media also can be 
created by the duration of each shot, and the same 
way one does in print, by the interaction of visu-
als, with contrast, and variation. For example, in 
Figure 14-21, the use of an abstract animation of 
colored bars creates rhythmic interplays between 
frames of this television opening sequence for 
Saturday Night Live.
VISUAL BASICS FOR 
SCREEN-BASED MEDIA
Thus far in this book we have learned that, when 
designing, one must consider all the formal ele-
ments and apply all principles of composition. 
What applies to print also applies to creating 
visual communications that move over a period 
of time. Each “frame” must be considered, as well as 
how each frame ﬂ ows into the next frame and the 
overall impact of the total frames as a group. Equally, 
each web page must be considered, as well as how each 
MOTION AESTHETICS
MOTION AESTHETICS —DEFINING TERMS
Motion aesthetics, planning, and basic production techniques are involved in any 
motion project. One must also become familiar with screen-based terms and take 
into account screen-based matters.
• The Narrative/Storyline: The process of telling a story or giving an account 
of something, including the chronology, the order in which things happen, 
with the inclusion of a beginning, middle, and end, though not necessarily in 
that order.
• Sequence: The particular order in which frames are arranged or connected; 
also, it is the order of actions or events in the narrative (linear or nonlinear); 
or a chunk of visual information, like an image sequence that transitions in 
and out.
• Duration: The period of time that the motion exists.
• Pacing/Tempo: The speed and/or rhythm at which the screen-based application 
unfolds and moves.
• Montage: The use of visuals composed by assembling, overlaying different visuals 
or materials collected from different sources.

Chapter  14
communications application, one must build clear 
levels of information on a page or in motion to 
help the viewer to glean information, enhancing 
readability and comprehension.
REPETITION AND ALIGNMENT
Repetition inculcates the audience. Just as a 
“hook” in music, that is, a repeated series of notes 
or phrase, works its way into the subconscious of 
the listener, so too does visual repetition in the 
viewer’s mind. Beats and rhythms can be estab-
lished as an underpinning with other information 
overlaid. Indeed, with motion graphics, percussive 
or musical beats can be combined with rhythmic 
animation to enhance the effect.
As in music, the viewer will recall alignment 
seen before. When the viewer sees an alignment 
held throughout or changed in a meaningful way, 
that creates a remembered master layout to anchor 
the piece in his or her mind. The motion design 
solutions may feel and appear more ordered.
USE OF TYPOGRAPHY 
AND GRAPHICS IN 
SCREEN-BASED MEDIA
Determine headings and subheadings in terms 
of color, size, and weight to distinguish the hier-
archy of type from one another as well as from 
visuals. Letterforms or words may stand out by 
using weight for contrast. The interplay of posi-
tive and negative shape relationships will have 
enormous effect on establishing ﬂ ow from one 
frame to another.
The conceptual interplay between type and 
visuals in print is much the same as in screen-
based applications, except the bonus of motion 
adds potential for heightened dramatic or come-
dic effect. How type interfaces with visuals in 
screen-based media, as in print, can effectively 
communicate meaning, both literally and sym-
bolically, as in Figure 14-22, the television open-
ing sequence for Will & Grace.
Motion is an experience. It can also be part of 
an environmental encounter as in Figure 14-23, 
the 118-foot-long IAC Video Wall by Trollbäck 
+ Company, which dominates the back wall of 
the lobby of the IAC headquarters in Manhat-
tan designed by architect Frank Gehry. “It’s an

Random House Films appointed Hush Stu-
dios to create an animated identity for their new 
production company. The animation would play 
before all of their feature ﬁ lms and trailers in 
theaters as well as on future broadcast and DVD

dom House is poised to become a major player 
in Hollywood. As a result, “they were looking to 
develop a visual signature as recognizable as the 
DreamWorks moon or the MGM lion,” accord-

“You want beveled and chromed 3D typogra-
phy? Some klieg lights shining in your eyes? A

Nope, not this time,” explains Hush. “Instead, 
we took Random House’s brand—deﬁ ned by the 
world of print publications—and catapulted it 
into the world of cinema for the launch of Ran-
dom House Films. In the end, the piece moves 
us from the most intimate moments of a writer’s 
initial conception—when the ﬁ rst letter is typed 
and the ink is dried—to an expansive cinematic 
world of light, color, and sound” (Figure 14-25).

MUSIC AND SOUND IN 
SCREEN-BASED MEDIA
We’ve all heard advertising jingles that stay with 
us, provoking endearment to brands or nostal-
gic feelings as we hum them. Audio provides a 
strong component in screen-based media, lend-
ing to audience enthusiasm and engagement 
and to making the piece memorable. For Figure 
14-24, BBC’s “Inside the Medieval Mind,” an 
arrangement of Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze” 
plays a key role. “We animated to Jimi Hendrix’s 
recording, then we changed the track out and did 
minor tweaking,” explains Price. “It was good for 
us to animate to a music track because it really 
helps with timing. When you can marry two 
things together like sound and vision, it’s a much 
stronger project. So it was really great to have the

N.L
There is a quaint belief among the design com-
munity that design is an international language. 
As anyone who is mystiﬁ ed by the Beijing Opera 
or thrash metal music can testify, it is a claim not 
even music can make. Design is many languages. 
With the disintegration of the mass market, these 
languages are multiplying to reach ever more spe-
ciﬁ c audiences. Propelling this fragmentation is 
the Web—a channel that connects and atomizes 
the world simultaneously. For those of us in visual 
professions, the Web has become a dynamic, dem-
ocratic, and idiosyncratic design bazaar.
Thanks to its ever-broadening band, the Web 
has also become a medium where ﬁ lm, music, 
art, culture, and commerce meet. It is the only 
channel where all the creative disciplines come 
together to entertain, inform, and transact—all at 
once, all the time, everywhere, and for everyone. 
Art directors, designers, typographers, photog-
raphers, animators, ﬁ lmmakers, and information 
architects all contribute and collaborate. Embrac-
ing the breadth and depth of the interactive can-
vas is the ﬁ rst step to designing for the Web.
It’s easy to forget that this new interactive 
medium is so young. During the ﬁ rst years of the 
Internet, everything (including its impoverished 
aesthetic) was shaped by bold young techno fetish-
ists. Only recently have well-rounded designers 
stepped forward to push pixels. For those trained 
in disciplines like advertising, identity, and print 
design, the hardest part of designing a website is 
dealing with its additive process. For designers who 
have been trained to subtract elements and distill 
meaning, this can be counterintuitive. While the 
success of an ad, logo, or billboard is judged by its 
ability to convey a simple powerful idea, the value 
of a website is often based on its ability to provide 
multiple experiences—not only to attract, but also 
to remain attractive. In most cases, designing a 
website is an ongoing process of bringing clarity 
and appeal to this depth and complexity.
Any medium can be hamstrung by trite design 
doctrines, but to impose such a thing on interac-
tive [media] is a tragic denial of its kaleidoscopic 
nature. That’s not to say there aren’t budding 
design principles and standards emerging from 
the chaos. Designing for the Web often requires 
using standard conventions such as left-hand 
navigation, search boxes, and underlined links. 
The trick is to do so without sacriﬁ cing a dra-
matic branded experience; slavish adherence to 
standards does not make a Nike site Nike.
Most of us in the graphic design profession are 
accustomed to dividing our colleagues into styl-
ists and conceptualists. While these sensibilities 
are found in visual designers on the Web, there is 
an even more profound division between what we 
at R/GA call systematic designers and experien-
tial designers.
A systematic designer’s strength is in making 
information-rich websites coherent. Using the 
classic design elements of color, shape, and com-
position, together with typographic and iconic 
systems, they create a sensible hierarchy of entry 
points into a page. They emphasize and enhance 
the information architect’s functional intent. At 
a time when more and more people are using the 
Web as not only a source of information, but also 
of entertainment, there is a great need for experi-
ential designers—designers who understand how 
to weave multiple narratives and bring drama
to interaction.
Whatever your design aptitude, your willing-
ness to collaborate is central to becoming a suc-
cessful interactive designer. In the interactive 
medium—just as the name suggests—there are 
no solitary practitioners.

EXERCISE 14-1
OPENING TITLES
Design opening titles for either a fi lm or a television 
program that combine typography and visuals with 
an emphasis on polar contrasts (see Chapter 6 on 
Johannes Itten’s “polar contrasts”).
Storyboard your opening sequence in fi ve 
frames. The skills utilized in this exercise prepare 
one for dealing with motion and also communicat-
ing the intent of an animation or video.
PROJECT 14-1
DEVELOPING A MICROSITE
Step 1
a. Select an existing brand or organization or a 
state or city tourist board.
b. Develop a concept for a microsite. For example, 
if you select a chocolate brand, the microsite 
could focus on the health benefi ts of con-
suming dark chocolate. If you select a child 
advocacy organization, the microsite could be 
about recognizing signs of abuse. If you select 
tourism, the microsite could be about the his-
tory of the city or state.
c. Write a title or headline for the microsite.
