integrating it with proprietary software. He loves the open source approach and really trusts 
collaboration and sharing of knowledge. He strongly believes in the open source idea and 
constantly manages to spread it out in all sectors, not just the GIS sector.
He has been using GeoServer since release 1.5, configuring, deploying, and hacking it in 
several projects. Other GFOSS projects he mainly uses and likes are GDAL/OGR, PostGIS, 
QGIS, and OpenLayers.
He authored two books on GeoServer with Packt Publishing: GeoServer Cookbook, a practical 
set of recipes to get the most out of the software, and GeoServer Beginner's Guide, a first 
approach to GeoServer features.
When not playing with maps and geometric shapes, he loves reading about science, mainly 
physics and math ematics; riding his bike; and having fun with his wife and his two daughters, 
Alice and Luisa.

Preface
ArcGIS for Desktop is an important component of the Esri ArcGIS platform. ArcGIS for Desktop 
allows you to visualize, create, analyze, manage, and distribute geographic data.
ArcGIS for Desktop Cookbook starts with the basics of designing a file geodatabase schema. 
Using your file geodatabase schema, you will learn to create, edit, and constrain the geometry 
and attribute values of your data. In this book, you will learn to manage Coordinate Reference 
System (CRS) issues in the geodatabase context.
This book will also cover the following topics: designing and sharing quality maps, geocoding 
addresses, creating routes and events, analyzing and visualizing raster data in 3D 
environments, and exporting/importing different data formats.
Knowing and understanding your data is essential in any spatial analysis and geoprocessing 
process. Therefore, you will work with two main geodatabase structures that fully support all 
topics covered by this book's chapters.
ArcGIS for Desktop Cookbook will clearly explain all the basic steps performed in every recipe 
of the book to help you refine your own workflow.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase, teaches you how to create a file geodatabase for a 
topographic map. It shows you, step by step, how to create feature datasets, feature classes, 
subtypes, and domains. Furthermore, you will create relationship classes and test the 
relationship behavior.
Chapter 2, Editing Data, teaches you how to add data to your file geodatabase created in 
Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase. In addition to this, you will learn to work with COordinate 
GeOmetry (COGO) elements, such as bearings, angles, and horizontal distances. You will 
identify all invalid attribute values for the newly created or loaded features in accordance with 
the domains created in the first chapter. You will also constrain and administrate the spatial 
relationships between features with geodatabase topology.

Preface
2
Chapter 3, Working with CRS, explains how to transform a CRS into another CRS using a 
predefined ArcGIS Project tool. You will also learn how to georeference a scanned topographic 
map. Furthermore, you will learn to define a custom CRS and a custom transformation.
Chapter 4, Geoprocessing, guides you through the geoprocessing tools for vector data, such as 
Spatial Join, Spatial Adjustment, Attribute transfer, Buffer, and Intersect. In addition to this, you 
will learn to work with the Model Builder application. You will build a geoprocessing workflow for 
a project named VeloGIS. This small project will analyze the possible consequences of creating a 
cycling infrastructure, taking into account the existing road network.
Chapter 5, Working with Symbology, teaches you how to manage a collection of symbols, colors, 
and map elements into a style format. The chapter also covers the Representation topic that 
refers to an advanced technique to symbolize geographic features on a map.
Chapter 6, Building Better Maps, teaches you how to create labels with Maplex Label Engine. 
The chapter also covers the Annotation topic, which refers to an advanced technique to label 
the geographic features. In addition to this, you will learn to create a quantitative bivariate 
map, which analyzes two variables from census data: level of education and unemployment 
rate for a country/region.
Chapter 7, Exporting Your Maps, teaches you how to design, prepare, and export quality 
maps. Finally, you will publish your maps on ArcGIS Online.
Chapter 8, Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing, teaches you how to convert the 
address information into spatial data and how to manage and use these geocoded addresses. 
The second part of this chapter will show you how to build routes and events for three 
different bus lines and a complex route for delivering a customer service.
Chapter 9, Working with Spatial Analyst, teaches you how to work with and analyze raster 
data. It shows you, step by step, how to create a terrain surface, reclassify a raster, work with 
Map Algebra and statistical functions, generalize a raster, generate density surfaces, and 
perform a least-cost path analysis.
Chapter 10, Working with 3D Analyst, teaches you how to create 3D features from 2D features 
and how to create TIN and Terrain surfaces. You will analyze the visibility between buildings 
and three geodetic points from the ground, using the ArcScene application. Moreover, you 
will create an animated fly-by tour of your 3D buildings and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) in 
ArcScene and will export it to a video file.
Chapter 11, Working with Data Interoperability, teaches you how to manage different data 
formats. You will export and import a file geodatabase using the XML interchange format. The 
second part of this chapter will show you how to import vector data into your geodatabase 
using the ArcGIS Data Interoperability extension.

Introduction
Real-world objects can be represented in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using 
geographic data. In the context of the Esri ArcGIS technology, a database that stores 
geographic data is a geodatabase. The geodatabase is a native ArcGIS format that allows 
you to store, edit, and manage spatial data and non-spatial data. Before you start adding 
data to a geodatabase, it is important to think about how your data will be organized in the 
geodatabase. Another important step is to create an empty but structured schema of your 
geodatabase (data model). Paul A. Longley (Geographical Information Systems and Science, 
2nd Edition, 2005, John Wiley & Sons, Inc , p.178) has mentioned three steps in creating a 
geospatial data model:
1.	 Conceptual schema
2.	 Logical schema
3.	 Physical schema (geodatabase schema)

Designing Geodatabase
8
In this chapter, you will skip steps 1 and 2, and you will manually create the physical schema 
or the geodatabase structure.
There are three types of geodatabases: personal geodatabase, file 
geodatabase, and multiuser geodatabase. For more information about 
geodatabases, please refer to http://www.esri.com/software/
arcgis/geodatabase.
For comprehensive definitions of specific elements and terms such as 
geodatabase, file geodatabase, feature dataset, spatial domain, resolution, 
tolerance, subtype, domain, feature class, relationship, or referential 
integrity, please refer to the ESRI GIS Dictionary online at http://
support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/GISDictionary.
In this chapter, you will work with the most common geodatabase elements, such as feature 
dataset, feature class, table, and relationship class. You will test the main advantages of 
using a geodatabase by performing the following actions:
f
f
Define the common spatial reference using feature datasets
f
f
Organize the features with the same geometry and spatial reference in  
feature classes
f
f
Define attribute constraints to eliminate edit errors using subtypes, domains,  
and default values
f
f
Define spatial and non-spatial relationships using relationship classes
f
f
Add supplementary spatial and attribute behaviors by defining relationship rules  
for relationship classes
Creating a file geodatabase
In this chapter, all exercises will refer to the single-user file geodatabase format. A file 
geodatabase is suited to ArcGIS for Desktop users and is stored in a filesystem folder. The 
main advantages of a file geodatabase are:
f
f
Editing of different feature classes or tables at the same time by multiple users
f
f
A maximum size of up to 1 terabyte (TB) for the individual datasets stored in a file 
geodatabase
If you decide to use a single-user geodatabase for your project, but you 
are still thinking about the two options, personal geodatabase and file 
geodatabase, then please read the paper The Top Nine Reasons to Use a 
File Geodatabase: http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0309/
files/9reasons.pdf.

Chapter 1
9
Getting ready
In the next step, you will create a file geodatabase named Topo5k.gdb for a topographic 
map corresponding to the scale 1:5,000.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a new file geodatabase in ArcCatalog using the context menu:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. Select Connect To Folder from the Standard toolbar. Go to 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data, and click on OK.
2.	 In Catalog Tree, select <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data, and right-click to 
choose New | Folder. Rename New Folder as MyGeodatabase.
3.	 In Catalog Tree, select MyGeodatabase, and right-click to choose New | New File 
Geodatabase. Rename New File Geodatabase.gdb as Topo5k.
Downloading the example code
You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have 
purchased from your account at http://www.packtpub.com. 
If you purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit http://www.
packtpub.com/support and register to have the files e-mailed 
directly to you.
How it works...
You have created an empty file geodatabase using the context menu in ArcCatalog. You 
will use Topo5k.gdb in the later steps. Open Windows Explorer to see the structure of the 
filesystem folder created for your file geodatabase.
There's more...
Follow these steps to create a new file geodatabase in ArcCatalog using ArcToolbox:
1.	 Select ArcToolbox from the Standard toolbar. Go to Data Management Tools | 
Workspace, and double-click on the Create File GDB tool.
2.	 For File GDB Location, select Folder Connections, go to <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data, and select the MyGeodatabase folder. For File GDB

In the next recipe, Creating a feature dataset, you will learn how to organize your 
spatial datasets using feature datasets in a file geodatabase
Creating a feature dataset
A feature dataset is a container for feature classes that have the same spatial reference, 
Coordinate Reference System (CRS), spatial domain, resolution, and tolerance. In the case 
of importing features with the same CRS, the feature dataset will accept only the features that 
have their coordinates between the minimum and maximum values defined for the x, y, z and 
m values of spatial domain extent. A feature dataset cannot contain other feature datasets or 
non-spatial tables.
For more details about the feature dataset, please refer to the online ArcGIS 
help (10.2) by navigating to Geodata | Data types | Feature datasets from 
http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2.
Getting ready
You will create seven feature datasets: Buildings, GeodeticPoints, Hydrography, 
LandUse, Relief, Transportation, and Boundaries. In your file geodatabase, Topo5k.
gdb, all feature datasets will have the same CRS.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create feature datasets in a file geodatabase using the ArcCatalog 
context menu:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In Catalog Tree, go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\
MyGeodatabase, and select Topo5k.gdb.
2.	 Right-click on Topo5k.gdb, and navigate to New | Feature Dataset for the Name type 
Buildings. Click on Next. Navigate to Projected Coordinate Systems | National 
Grids | Europe | Pulkovo 1942 Adj 1958 Stereo 1970. Select the active yellow star 
Add To Favorites to add the selected projected coordinate system to the Favorites 
section. You will use this projected coordinate system later in this book.
3.	 Click on Next. Navigate to Vertical Coordinate Systems | Europe | Constanta. Click 
on Next. Accept the XY, Z, and M tolerance values. Keep checked the option Accept 
default resolution and domain extent (recommended).

4.	 If you want to see the default values for resolution and domain extent, uncheck them 
and click on Next. Examine the default values, and click on the Finish button.
5.	 If you want to examine the default values for domain, resolution, and tolerance, 
right-click on Buildings feature datasets and navigate to the Properties | Domain, 
Resolution and Tolerance tabs.
6.	 Repeat the previous steps to create the following feature datasets: 
GeodeticPoints, Hydrography, LandUse, Relief, and Transportation, as 
shown in the following screenshot:

To inspect the results, return to the Feature Dataset Properties dialog.
How it works...
After you have created a feature dataset, ArcCatalog allows you to change only the XY and Z 
coordinate system. If you take the decision to change the XY coordinate system for a feature 
dataset, you should know that you cannot modify the values for domain, resolution and 
tolerance. If you still need to change the CRS for a feature dataset, it will be more proper to 
create the feature dataset from the beginning. In conclusion, when you are thinking about a 
feature dataset, think twice and act once.
There's more...
In ArcCatalog, you can use Copy and Paste from the context menu in the file geodatabase to 
duplicate the first feature dataset. In the Data Transfer window, you can change the name 
of the feature dataset by typing in the Target Name section. In this case, the newly resulted 
feature dataset will have the same coordinate reference system as the source feature dataset.

Creating a feature class
Features are representations of the real-word objects in a geodatabase. Features are grouped 
in classes based on their common components: shape (geometry) and attributes. Features 
from a feature class share the same spatial reference. A feature class stores simple features 
(for example, point, multipoint, line, and polygon) or non-simple features (for example, 
dimension and annotation). When a feature class is created, the user can add two optional 
geometry properties for features: z value (3D data) and m value (used for linear referencing). 
The feature class table contains some default attribute fields, which are managed by ArcGIS: 
OBJECTID and SHAPE. The OBJECTID field has the Object ID type property and stores the 
unique identifier for each feature. The SHAPE field refers to the Geometry type property and 
stores the x and y coordinates of the features and optionally z and m values if the feature 
class has the z and/or m properties enabled. The feature class that stores line or polygon 
features has two supplementary fields: SHAPE_Length (length of the feature line) and 
SHAPE_Area (area of the feature polygon).
For more details about the feature class and field data types, please refer to 
Geodata/Data types/Feature Class and Geodata/Geodatabases/Defining 
the properties of data in a geodatabase/Geodatabase table properties/
ArcGIS field data types from ArcGIS help (10.2) online.
Usually, feature classes are stored inside a feature dataset and automatically inherit the 
spatial reference of the feature dataset. A feature class that is stored at the root level of a 
geodatabase is a standalone feature class and has its own spatial reference.
Getting ready
You will continue to work at the geodatabase structure by creating four feature classes: 
Buildings (polygon features), Watercourse (polygon features), WatercourseL  
(polyline features), and LandUse (polygon features).
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create feature classes using the ArcCatalog context menu:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In Catalog Tree, go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\
MyGeodatabase\Topo5k.gdb.

Chapter 1
13
2.	 Right-click on the Buildings feature dataset, and choose New | Feature Class. 
For Name, type Buildings and for Alias, type Buildings. For Type, choose 
Polygon Feature. Leave the Geometry Properties options unchecked. Click on Next. 
Select Default for the Configuration Keyword section. Click on Next. There are two 
default attribute fields: OBJECTID and SHAPE. You will create five new attribute 
fields: BD (Alias=Destination), BM (Alias=Material), Stories (Alias=Number 
of stories), BS (Alias=State of buildings) and LandUseID. For Field 
Name, in the first empty cell below SHAPE, type BD, and for Data Type, select Long 
Integer from the drop-down list. In the Field Properties section, for the Alias, type 
Destination and for Allow NULL values, select Yes. Leave empty the Default 
Value property. You will add the default value later on in this chapter. You should see 
something similar to the following screenshot:

Designing Geodatabase
14
3.	 Repeat step 2 for BM (Default Value: 0), Stories, and LandUseID.
4.	 For the BS attribute field, choose Text from the drop-down list. Notice that the 
Field Properties options have changed according to the data type. For Alias, type 
State of buildings, and for the Length property, type 4. Click on OK to close 
the Feature Class Properties dialog. To inspect the results, return to the Feature 
Class Properties dialog. Right-click on the Buildings feature class, and navigate to 
Properties | Fields. Notice the two geometry attribute fields: SHAPE_Length and 
SHAPE_Area.
5.	 Right-click on the Hydrography feature dataset, and navigate to New | Feature 
Class. For Name, type Watercourse, and for Alias, type Watercourse. For Type, 
choose Polygon Feature. Leave the Geometry Properties options unchecked. Click 
on Next. Select Default for the Configuration Keyword section. Click on Next, and 
add the following attribute fields:
Name
Data type
Alias
Allow NULL 
values
Default 
Value
HType
Long Integer
Water category
Yes
<none>
HYC
Long Integer
Hydrologic category
Yes
<none>
6.	 Click on OK to close the Feature Class Properties dialog.
7.	
Right-click on the Hydrography feature dataset, and choose New | Feature Class. 
For Name, type WatercourseL and for Alias, type WatercourseL. For Type, 
choose Line Feature. Leave the Geometry Properties options unchecked. Click 
on Next. Select Default for the Configuration Keyword section. Click on Next. You 
will add field definitions by selecting the Import button. Navigate to Topo5k.gdb | 
Hydrography, and select the Watercourse polygon feature class. Click on Add. 
You now have two attribute fields: HType (Water category), HYC (Hydrologic 
category), along with Name. Click on OK.
8.	 Right-click on LandUse, and choose New | Feature Class. For Name, type LandUse 
and for Type, choose Polygon Feature. Click on Next twice, and add the following 
attribute fields:
Name
Data type
Alias
Allow NULL 
values
Default 
Value
CAT
Long Integer
Category
Yes
<none>
SCAT
Text with Length 5
SubCategory
Yes
<none>
9.	 Click on OK to close the Feature Class Properties dialog. Return to the Feature 
Class Properties dialog for every feature class to inspect the results.

Chapter 1
15
How it works...
For every feature class, you defined different attribute fields. Because the WatercourseL 
feature class has the same attribute fields as Watercourse, you imported the field 
definitions from Watercourse at step 7. For all attribute fields, you have selected Yes for 
Allow NULL values. When you add a new feature in ArcMap, the attribute field will have a 
NULL value or an empty value that will be ignored by the functions in ArcMap. To enforce data 
integrity, you can specify that a field cannot contain empty or null values by setting Allow 
NULL values to No. This condition can be validated in the ArcMap edit session using the 
Validate Features option from Editor in Editor toolbar. You have another option to enforce 
field values by setting the Default Value property. A default value is automatically assigned to 
an attribute field when a new feature is being created in the ArcMap edit session.
There's more...
Regarding spatial reference of the feature class, if you want to move WatercourseL in the 
LandUse feature dataset, you simply select the feature class and drag and drop it into the 
LandUse feature dataset. You will succeed because both feature datasets have the same 
spatial reference. If you drag and drop the WatercourseL feature class into the root of the 
geodatabase, you will have a standalone feature class.

In the following Creating subtypes recipe, you will learn how to group features in a 
feature class based on a subtype field
Creating subtypes
Subtypes are properties of feature classes or non-spatial tables. The subtypes gather the 
features from a feature class or records from a non-spatial table that share the same attribute 
values using an attribute field. The attribute field that groups the features must be of the 
data type Short or Long integer, and it will be named the subtype field. A feature class 
can have only one subtype field. You can assign different behaviors to individual subtypes 
from a feature class/table. Generally speaking, the behavior is defined by the actions or 
characteristics of features in a geodatabase. A subtype has a code and a description. After 
you have defined the subtypes for a subtype field, you can change everything related to a 
subtype: change the value or description of code, add more codes, and delete code. The 
subtypes help you in the geometry editing process and prevent errors when editing feature 
attribute values. The subtypes maintain the integrity in a geodatabase.

Designing Geodatabase
16
Getting ready
You will continue to work with geodatabase schema by grouping features from the feature 
classes that you created in the previous Creating a feature class recipe. The integer subtype 
fields are the following: BD for Buildings, HType for Watercourse and WatercourseL, 
and CAT for LandUse.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to define subtypes using the context menu in ArcCatalog:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In Catalog Tree, go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\
MyGeodatabase\ Topo5k.gdb\Buildings.
2.	 Right-click on the Buildings feature class, and navigate to Properties | Fields. 
You will define five subtypes for the BD attribute field. Select the Subtypes tab in the 
Feature Class Properties window. For Subtype Field, select the drop-down arrow and 
choose BD. In the Subtypes section, you have a default subtype with Code with the 
value 0 and Description with the value New Subtype. Change Description of the 
first subtype by typing Unknown.
3.	 Continue to create subtypes as shown in the following table:
Code

the Feature Class Properties dialog for the Buildings feature class to check the 
subtypes you just added. Right-click on the Buildings feature class, and choose 
Properties | Subtypes. You should see something similar to the following screenshot:

5.	 In Catalog Tree, select the Hydrography feature dataset. Right-click on the 
Watercourse feature class, and choose Properties | Fields. Select the Subtypes 
tab in the Feature Class Properties window. You will define five subtypes for the 
HType attribute field. For Subtype Field select the drop-down arrow, choose HType, 
and add the following subtypes:

Repeat step 4 to create subtypes for the WatercourseL feature class using the same 
codes and descriptions.

9.	 For Default Subtype, choose the Arable subtype. Click on Apply and on OK. Open the 
Feature Class Properties dialog for the LandUse feature class to check the subtypes 
you just added.
10.	 Inspect the results in Subtypes in the Feature Class Properties dialog.
How it works...
The subtypes will help you to edit feature geometry and attribute fields faster. The default 
subtype is used as the default edit target for the Watercourse feature class when you start an 
edit session in ArcMap. In the Feature Class Properties dialog, you can add more subtypes 
for the BD attribute field, and you can delete a subtype or change Code and Description.
If you delete all code, your feature class will not have subtypes 
anymore, and all rules and behaviors related to subtypes will be 
corrupt or lost for the feature class.
Sometimes, when you are establishing codes and descriptions for a subtype field, it is 
impossible to anticipate correctly all possible values. It is good practice to add code that 
covers all unforeseen values: Code: 42 and Description: Other terrains. Another good 
practice is to add code that refers to the situation in which you know the values for all other 
attribute fields, but you are not sure about the subtype, and it will be defined later: Code: 0 
and Description: Unknown.

For information about how you can enforce attribute values for a feature class table, 
please refer to the following Creating domains recipe

Chapter 1
19
Creating domains
The domains define the valid values for the attribute fields of feature classes or non-spatial 
tables. The domains are properties of a geodatabase, and obviously are stored at the 
geodatabase level. In a feature class/table, an attribute field can have one or many domains 
associated with it. The multiple domains associated with a field are based on the existing 
subtypes that you have already defined for a feature class. A domain can be associated with 
one or many attribute fields of one or more feature classes from a geodatabase.
There are two domain types: Range and Coded Values. A range domain defines minimum and 
maximum values and can be used only by the numeric and date field types. A coded domain 
can be used by the numeric, date, and text field types and defines an explicit list of valid values. 
Every valid value has a code and a description. A domain defines the attribute behavior when a 
feature is split or merged in ArcMap using the Split policy and the Merge policy.
For more details about domains, please refer to Geodata/Data types/
Domains from ArcGIS help (10.2) online.
Getting ready
Let's continue to work with geodatabase schema by defining valid values for the attribute 
fields of feature classes that you created in the Creating a feature class recipe. You will create 
the domains in the geodatabase Properties.
In the Database Properties dialog, the Domains section has three main sections:
f
f
Domain Name | Description: This defines domain name and description
f
f
Domain Properties: This sets the domain properties, such as the data type, domain 
type and split/merge policy
f
f
Coded Values: This defines the codes and descriptions
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create domains using the ArcCatalog context menu:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In Catalog Tree, go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\
MyGeodatabase\Topo5k.gdb. Right-click on the Topo5k.gdb file geodatabase, 
and select Properties | Domains.

How it works...
At step 2, for Split policy, you selected Duplicate. When you split a building made of Brick 
material (domain code: 2) during the edit session in ArcMap, you will have two buildings 
made from bricks. For Merge policy, you selected Default Value. Let's suppose you already 
established the Default Value option for the BM (Building material) field to 0. When 
you merge two buildings made of Brick material (domain code: 2) during the edit session in 
ArcMap, you will have two buildings made of Unknown material (domain code: 0). The range 
and coded values can be validated in the ArcMap edit session using the Validate Features 
option from Editor present in the Editor toolbar. The Validate Features option helps you to 
find mistaken attribute values in the sense that it is not a valid value.
There's more...
To create a new coded value domain for a file geodatabase, based on a table that contains 
the defined codes and descriptions for a domain, you can use the Table To Domain tool from 
ArcToolbox. In ...\Data\DesigningGeodatabase\LandUseDomains folder, you have 
five dBASE tables corresponding to the following domains: dArable, dPasture, dMeadow, 
dVineyard, and dFruitOrchard.
Follow these steps to create more domains for your file geodatabase using ArcToolbox:
1.	 Select ArcToolbox from the Standard toolbar. Navigate to Data Management  
Tools | Domains, and double-click on the Table To Domain tool. Set the  
following parameters:

In the Using subtypes and domains together recipe, you will learn how to combine 
subtypes and domains for the feature classes you just created
Using subtypes and domains together
In this recipe, you will use both subtypes and domains to better control, constrain, and 
partially automate the editing processes of the field values. 
Getting ready
In this section, you will assign default values and domains to fields and subtype fields for the 
following feature classes: Buildings, Watercourse, WatercourseL, and LandUse. 
The exercise tests three cases:
f
f
A simple domain assigned to the BM (Material), Stories (Number of stories), 
and BS (State of buildings) attribute fields for the Buildings feature class.
f
f
Two feature classes will share the same domain. The dHYC domain will be assigned 
to the HYC (Hydrologic category) attribute field for the Watercourse and 
WatercourseL feature classes. 
f
f
Six domains will be assigned to a single attribute field based on the subtypes of the 
LandUse feature class. The dUnkn, dArable, dPasture, dMeadow, dVineyard, 
and dFruitOrchard domains will assign to the SCAT (SubCategory) attribute 
field for the LandUse feature class based on the subtypes defined for the CAT 
(Category) subtype field.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to assign domains to attribute fields of the feature classes:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In Catalog Tree, go to ...\Data\MyGeodatabase\ Topo5k.
gdb\Buildings.
2.	 Right-click on the Buildings feature class, and navigate to Properties | Fields. 
Select the BD attribute field. In Field Properties, the Default Value field is 1 because 
Default Subtype is Dwelling with code with a value of 1. To see the subtypes, 
select the Subtypes tab. For every subtype, you will assign three different domains to 
the following fields: BM, Stories, and BS.

Designing Geodatabase
24
3.	 In the Subtypes section, select the Unknown subtype by clicking the small box on 
the left-hand side of the row with code the value of which is 0. The rows will become 
black. In the Default Values and Domains section, set the Default Value and  
Domain columns, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 The default value 0 for the BM field corresponds to the Unknown description. The 
default value 1 for the Stories field corresponds to a building with one storey. The 
default value b for the BS field corresponds to a Good state of building. Click on 
Apply to save changes.
5.	 Select the Dwelling subtype. In the Default Values and Domains section, set the 
Default Value and Domain columns, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
25
6.	 When you define values in the Default Value field, you must think what the most 
common value used for the Dwelling subtype is. For example, most of the dwellings 
are made of brick (domain code: 2). During an edit session, when a feature is 
added, split, or merged, the default value will be assigned to the attribute field value.
7.	
Continue to assign the same domains to the next four subtypes. Click on Apply and 
on OK to save and close the Feature Class Properties dialog.
8.	 In Catalog Tree, select the Hydrography feature dataset. Right-click on the 
Watercourse feature class, and navigate to Properties | Fields. Select the HType 
attribute field. In Field Properties, the Default Value field is 1 because the Default 
Subtype field is River, where Code is 1.
9.	 For every subtype, you will assign a single domain to the HYC attribute field. In the 
Subtypes section, select the Unknown subtype, and set the Default Value and 
Domain columns, as shown in the following screenshot:
10.	 Continue to assign values to the Default Values and Domain section for the rest of 
the subtypes, as shown in the following table:

How it works...
The domains have been assigned to subtypes in the Subtypes section in the Feature Class 
Properties dialog. If your feature class doesn't have subtypes, you will assign the domains in 
the Fields section in the Feature Class Properties dialog box. 
At step 8, the Arable subtype has been assigned the dArable domain for the SCAT attribute 
field. A good practice is to have similar names for subtypes and related domains. To be easier 
to read and make a distinction between the field name, subtype name, and domain name, put 
a small d, such as dArable, in front of the domain name. It is intuitive and easy to combine 
subtypes with different domains.
At step 3, choosing the right domain was a little tricky because the field is BS and the domain 
is dState. Another good practice is to keep your own documentation regarding the data type, 
code, and description for domains and subtypes. Another aspect is the default value  
for domains. 
At step 7, you defined the default value for BM (Material), Brick value. When you add a 
Dwelling feature, the default values of the Material field will be Brick. Probably this will 
help the editing process, but sometimes it can be an illusory value. The user will not be more 
preoccupied with the correctness of this value. It would be a good idea to define as the default 
value for the Material field, code 0 (Unknown). This value will warn the user that it should 
be changed to this value according to the reality. There is no perfect solution for a default 
value, but your experience and the context of using geodatabase will help you to make the 
most appropriate decision.

Chapter 1
27
There's more...
In the last step, you assigned only six domains to the LandUse feature class only if it defined 
11 subtypes. There is another way to complete the domain listâby importing a feature class 
from another file geodatabase. When a feature class is imported, all the domains used by the 
imported feature class will also be added. Follow these steps to import the LandUse feature 
class from another file geodatabase, TOPO5000.gdb.
1.	 In Catalog Tree, right-click on the LandUse feature dataset, and navigate to Import 
| Feature Class (single). For Input Features, go to ...\Data\TOPO5000.gdb\
LandUse, and select the LandUse feature class. Click on Add. For Output Feature 
Class, type LandUseImport.
2.	 You will keep only two attribute fields: CAT (long) and SCAT (text). These fields 
are important because the first is a subtype field and the second field uses the 
subcategory domains for the Landuse feature class. You will delete all other attribute 
fields from the source feature class. In the Field Map (optional) section, select 
Zone (long), and select the X button on the right-hand side. Repeat the step for the 
remaining fields. Click on OK to close the Feature Class to Feature Class dialog.
3.	 Inspect the newly added domains in the Database Properties dialog for 
Topo5k.gdb. You now have five new domains: dForest, dHydrography, 
dTransportation, dOtherTerrains, and dUnproductive. Because you don't 
want to have a duplicate feature class, delete the LandUseImport feature class in 
ArcCatalog. The added domains still remain as file geodatabase properties.
4.	 Repeat step 12 from the How to do it... section to continue to add domains for the 
SCAT field, as shown in the following table:

In the following Creating a relationship class recipe, you will go a step further in 
defining the behavior of a file geodatabase. You will create relationships rules 
between different feature classes.

Creating a relationship class
Relationships describe how the spatial/nonspatial objects are linked. In a geodatabase, the 
relationships are stored in relationship classes. In a relationship class, you can relate only two 
classes (table/feature class) from a geodatabase. Just as with a feature class, a relationship 
class can be created at the root level of a geodatabase or within a feature dataset.
In a relationship class, you have to decide the followings properties:
f
f
Name of the relationship class
f
f
Origin table and destination table
f

Type of relationship, which can be as follows:

Simple: The objects can exist independently of each other and can have any 
type of cardinality.

You cannot modify the properties of an existing relationship class. You 
can delete and define it once again. If you delete one class (table/
feature class) that participates in a relationship class, the relationship 
class will be deleted too.
A table/feature class can be involved in more than one relationship class. Those multiple 
relationships for a table/feature class work well as long as they are coherently defined and 
don't generate contradictory behaviors. The last step in creating a relationship class is to 
define rules in order to refine the cardinality based on the subtypes of the feature classes/
tables. All types of cardinality support the relationship rules. A relationship rule is a property of 
the relationship class.
Getting ready
In this section, you will create two simple relationship classes and one composite relationship 
class between the LandUse feature class, BuildingsR feature class, and Owners table. 
Those relationships compose a stacked relationship because they link three classes in an 
open loop, as shown in the following screenshot:
When you define the cardinality, remember that term one can mean zero. For example, in the 
schema shown in the preceding screenshot, the Buildings (origin) are related to Owners 
(destination). The cardinality is many-to-many. The relationship allows the following situations:
f
f
Building with no owner (1..0)
f
f
Building with different owners (1..*)
f
f
Owner with no building (0..1)
f
f
Owner with any number of buildings (*..1)

dataset to see the LandUse feature class. Select the LandUse feature class. For 
Destination table/feature class, select the Owners table. Click on Next.
3.	 Select Simple (peer to peer) relationship, and click on Next. For the first relationship 
label, type ToOwners. For the second relationship label, type ToLandUse. Select 
the None (no messages propagated) option, and click on Next. Select the cardinality 
M-N (many-to-many) and click on Next. Select Yes, I would like to add attributes to 
this relationship class, and click on Next.
4.	 For FieldName, type OwnerProcent in the first empty row. Select Long Integer 
from the drop-down list. Select Yes for the Allow NULL values option, in the Field 
Properties section. As the primary key for the origin table, choose OBJECTID from the 
drop-down list, and as the foreign key, type LandUseID. As the primary key for the 
origin table, choose OBJECTID, and for foreign key, type OwnerID.
5.	 Click on Next to see a summary of your options, and select Finish to close the New 
Relationship Class wizard.
6.	 Right-click on the Buildings feature dataset, and select the New | Relationship

Follow these steps to create a composite one-to-many relationship class between 
LandUse (as parent objects) and BuildingsR (as child objects):
7.	
Right-click on the LandUse feature dataset, and select New | Relationship Class. 
For Name of the relationship class, type LandUseToBuildings. For Origin table/
feature class, select the LandUse feature class. For Destination table/feature 
class, select the plus sign on the left-hand side of the Buildings feature dataset, 
and select the BuildingsR feature class.
8.	 Click on Next. Select Composite relationship (peer to peer) relationship and click  
on Next.
9.	 For the first relationship label, type ToBuildingsR. For the second relationship 
label, type ToLandUse. Select the Forward (origin to destination) option and click 
on Next. Select the cardinality 1-M (one-to-many), and click on Next.
10.	 Select NO, I do not want to add attributes to this relationship class and click  
on Next.
11.	 As the primary key, choose OBJECTID from the drop-down list, and as the foreign key, 
choose LandUseID.
12.	Click on Next to see a summary of your options, and select Finish to close the New 
Relationship Class wizard.
Follow these steps to add rules for the LandUseToBuildings relationship class:
13.	In ArcCatalog, double-click on the LandUseToBuildings relationship class to open 
a Relationship Class Properties dialog box. Select the Rules tab to see the subtypes 
for the LandUse and BuildingsR feature classes. You will define relationship rules, 
as shown in the following table:
BuildingsR subtypes
Cardinality (M)
Other terrains: 
42
Cardinality (M)
Unproductive: 
51
Unknown 
0..10
0..*
Dwelling
0..2

Administrative buildings and socialcultural
0..3
0
Industrial and municipal
0..10
0..2
Historical sites, monuments, statues 
0..2
0..*
Dwelling annex
0..3
0..1
14.	 For Origin Table/Feature class subtypes, select Other terrains. For Destination 
Table/Feature class subtypes, click on the Code checkbox on the left-hand side of 
the Unknown subtype. Click on Unknown to select the subtype and to enable the 
Origin Cardinality and Destination Cardinality sections.

Designing Geodatabase
32
15.	In the Destination Cardinality section, check the Specify the range of associated 
destination objects option. First, set the Max value by typing 10. Leave the Min 
value at 0.
16.	 For Destination Table/Feature class subtypes, click on the Code checkbox to the 
left of the Dwelling subtype. Click on Dwelling to select subtype and to enable 
the Origin Cardinality and Destination Cardinality sections.
17.	 In the Destination Cardinality section, check the Specify the range of associated 
destination objects option. First, set the Max value by typing 2. Leave the Min value 
at 0 according to the previous table. The first rule says that an Other terrains 
parcel subtype can have a maximum of two dwellings. You should see something 
similar to the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
33
18.	Select the Administrative buildings subtype, and check the Specify the range of 
associated destination objects option. For the Max value, type 3. For the Min value, 
type 0. This rule says that there must be between zero and three administrative 
buildings in a parcel (Other terrains).
19.	Continue to define the rules in Destination Table/Feature class subtypes for all 
building subtypes. For Origin Table/Feature class subtypes, select Unproductive. 
Leave unchecked the Unknown subtypes in the Destination Table/Feature class 
subtypes section to allow an unlimited number of Unknown buildings.
20.	You will permit a maximum of two Industrial and municipal buildings and 
one Dwelling annex per Unproductive parcel. Select those subtypes from the 
Destination Table/Feature class subtypes section, and set the maximum value 
according to the previous table.
21.	 Finally, you will not permit a relationship with the rest of building types, such as 
Dwelling, Administrative buildings, and Historical sites. Select 
all those subtypes from the Destination Table/Feature class subtypes section, 
check the Specify the range of associated destination objects option, and set the 
maximum values to 0.
22.	For the rest of the LandUse subtypes from Origin Table/Feature class subtypes, 
set the Max and Min values to 0. This will not permit BuildingsR to associate with 
parcel subtypes, such as Arable, Pasture, Meadow, Vineyard, Fruit orchard, 
Forest, Hydrography, and Transportation.
23.	Click on Apply and on OK to save and close the Relationship Class Properties 
wizard.
You can find the final geodatabase schema at ...\Data\DesigningGeodatabase\ 
MyGeodatabaseResults\Topo5k.gdb.
How it works...
In the previous exercise, you used OBJECTID as the origin primary key field. But you could 
define your own primary key. The OBJECTID field guarantees a unique value for each record 
because it is managed by ArcGIS. You can't modify the OBJECTID values, and this can be 
inconvenient to maintaining the relationships when you are modifying feature geometry (for 
example: split, merge) or import features to another feature class.
For more details about the advantages and inconvenience of using the 
OBJECTID field as the primary key, please refer to Geodata/Data 
types/Relationships and related objects/Relationship 
class properties from ArcGIS Help (10.2) online.

Designing Geodatabase

There is a performance cost when you are working with relationship classes. The relationship 
classes will slow down the edit process because they must maintain the referential integrity in 
the geodatabase. A relationship class will assure that all changes you have made in the origin 
feature class/table will be reflected in the destination feature class/table according to the 
type and rules of the relationship.
At step 3, you created a many-to-many, simple relationship class between the BuildingsR 
feature class and the Owners table. A many-to-many relationship class requires an 
intermediary table that contains two key fields: origin primary key and destination foreign 
key. Both fields have a foreign key's role. You can see this table in ArcCatalog if you select the 
LandUseToOwners relationship class table. Select the Preview tab and the Table preview 
mode from the bottom of the Preview panel to examine the attribute fields.
There's more...
Follow these steps to test the relationship behavior:
1.	 Start ArcMap, and open an existing map document WorkingRelationships.mxd 
from ...\Data\DesigningGeodatabase. In Table Of Contents, you have two 
layers (BuildingsR and LandUse), two intermediate tables (LandUseToOwners 
and BuildingsRToOwners), and one non-spatial table, Owners.
2.	 Let's validate the relationship rules for the LandUseToBuildings composite 
relationship. Zoom in to the full extent of a map by selecting Full Extent in the 
Standard toolbar. Relationships are active and can be validated during an edit 
session.
3.	 In the Editor toolbar, select Start Editing. Select all features from BuildingsR and 
LandUse using the Select Features tool.
4.	 In the Editor toolbar, navigate to Editor | Validate Features. A message box will 
appear: 72 features are invalid. Click on OK to close. All invalid features are selected.
5.	 Open the Attributes window by selecting the Attributes button in the Editor toolbar. 
You will see two layers: BuildingsR and LandUse. Select Expand All Relationships 
In Branch to see all selected features (blue bullets), related tables, and table records.

6.	 Let's inspect a relationship error. Click on Bookmarks and choose Error2. With the 
Select Features tool, select the Others terrains parcel with LandUseID=1262. In the 
Attributes window, expand the LandUse layer. You should see something similar to 
the following screenshot:
7.	
Right-click on LandUse, and navigate to Selection | Open Table Showing Selected 
Feature to see the LandUse attribute table in the Show selected records mode. 
Navigate to Table Options | Related Tables, and choose LandUseToBuildingsR: 
ToBuildingsR. In the Editor toolbar, navigate to Editor | Validate Features. 
A message box will appear: The feature LandUse(subtype:Other terrains) 
has 4 related BuildingsR (subtype:Dwelling) features, thus violating the 
LandUseToBuildings relationships rule that specifies 0-2. Click on OK to close.
8.	 To fix the error, delete two buildings. Select the parcel and the remaining  
buildings and validate features once again. The message box will tell you:  
All features are valid.

Designing Geodatabase
36
9.	 Let's check the feature following and cascade deleting behaviors of the 
LandUseToBuildings composite relationship. With the Select Features tool, 
select the Other terrains parcel with LandUseID=1262. In the Editor toolbar, 
select Edit Tool. Drag the parcel away from the previous location. The related 
buildings should follow the parcel. Select Rotate Tool. Rotate the parcel. The building 
should rotate, too. Delete the parcel using the Delete key. The buildings are deleted, 
too. Restore the features using Ctrl + Z.

Introduction
In the first part of this chapter, you will test different ArcGIS tools in order to add different 
types of feature geometry and their attribute values.
In Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase, you constrained the attribute values using subtypes 
and domains. With the Validation option in an edit session, you can identify the invalid values 
in order to correct them.
You will continue to use the concept of validation in the feature geometry context in the 
second part of this chapter. You will constrain and administrate the spatial relationships 
between features with geodatabase topology. With the geodatabase topology, you will identify 
and fix the spatial errors from your Topo5k.gdb file geodatabase.
Editing features in a geodatabase
In ArcMap, a layer references the spatial datasets (for example, feature class and raster) that 
contain features with common geometry and attributes. A layer uses the dataset attributes to 
represent the features by one or more symbols. By default, a layer symbolizes features from a 
feature class using the subtype field.

Editing Data
38
The editing session in ArcGIS for Desktop is based on layers. When you start an edit session, 
you have to define the Feature Template that describes the type of feature that you intend 
to create. ArcGIS creates feature templates by default, based on the layer symbology. In the 
Creating Feature window, you can see the list of feature templates. You can create new types 
of features with the Organize Feature Templates option. Moreover, you can define a default 
attribute for one type of feature or for all types of features from a layer. When you create a 
new feature, the default attribute is automatically inherited. Choosing a default value works 
for subtypes and domains, too.
After you create a feature, you should edit its attributes using the Attribute window. Most 
of the attribute fields will automatically get completed according to the default subtype and 
domains you already defined in the Using subtypes and domains together recipe of Chapter 1, 
Designing Geodatabase.
Getting ready
In Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase, you learned how to create the Topo5k.gdb file 
geodatabase schema. Now, it's time to add data. There are several ways to add data  
into a geodatabase:

Using the Import/Export and Load Data options in ArcCatalog
f
f
Using the Load Objects option in an ArcMap environment
f
f
Creating new features by screen digitizing and by editing existing ones
f
f
Using the Export Data option in an ArcMap environment
In this recipe, you will work with the Editor, Snapping, and Edit Vertices toolbars to create 
new features and to edit the existing features. The LandUse and BuildingsR feature 
classes already contain features. The features were digitized based on a scanned topographic 
map at scale 1:5,000 produced in 1995.
As a base layer for updating features, you will use an orthophotography from 2012 
corresponding to a map at scale 1:5,000. The orthophoto map has a resolution of 1 pixel 
=0.5 meter and is stored as Raster Dataset in the Topo5k.gdb geodatabase.
Even if you assume that you are already comfortable with the elementary edit process in 
ArcGIS 10, please remember the main steps:
1.	 Start the edit session.
2.	 Set the snap environment (optional).
3.	 Before starting a sketch, choose a feature template and a construction tool.
4.	 Create the new feature.

Chapter 2
39
5.	 Add or modify attribute values of the feature.
6.	 Save edits.
7.	
Stop the edit session.
How to do it...
You can follow these steps to edit features in a geodatabase:
1.	 Start ArcMap, and open an existing map document Editing.mxd from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\EditingData. Notice that layers from the Table Of 
Contents section are symbolized based on their subtypes. The LandUse layer has 
defined a transparency. Right-click on the LandUse layer, and navigate to Properties 
| Display. You will notice that Transparent has a 60 percent value. Let's add a pop-
up label with the OBJECTID value in the data view. Check Show MapTips using the 
display expression, and choose the desired field. Click on OK.
2.	 From the Bookmarks menu, select Create a Fish Pond. You will create a new feature 
in the LandUse layer, as shown in the following screenshot:

Editing Data
40
3.	 In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the LandUse layer, and navigate 
to Edit Features | Start Editing. In the Editor toolbar, navigate to Editor | Editing 
Windows. In the Create Feature window, you will see the feature templates for all 
layers that are visible in the Table Of Contents section.
4.	 In the Editor toolbar, navigate to Editor | Snapping, and check the Snapping toolbar. 
In the Snapping toolbar, select only Vertex Snapping. Snapping options assure the 
coincidence of new feature coordinates with the coordinates of existing features.
5.	 In the Editor toolbar, navigate to Editor | Options | Attributes. Navigate to Display 
the attributes dialog before storing new features | For the following layers options 
| LandUse. Click on OK. Every time you create a new LandUse feature, the Attribute 
window will show up after you have finished the sketch.
6.	 Select the feature with OBJECTID as 755 from the LandUse layer. In the Editor 
toolbar, select the Cut Polygons Tool option to cut the arable polygon.
7.	
Select the Trace tool. Right-click on the polygon, and select Trace Options. In the 
Trace Options dialog, type 5 as the Offset value, select the Trace selected features 
option, and click on OK.
8.	 Use the screenshot from step 2 to follow the edit steps. Start the sketch from point 
(1) and finish it at point (2). Right-click on point (2) to choose a value for the Length 
field, type in 84, and close the window. Move the segment towards point (3), and add 
the end of the curve to point (4).
While you are sketching, press Tab to display the 
Feature Construction toolbar.
9.	 Again, go to point (2), and right-click on it to choose a value for the Length field, type 
in 61, and close the window. Move the segment to point (5), and add the last vertex 
to point (6). To finish the sketch, use the F2 shortcut key.

Chapter 2
41
Next, you will edit the attribute fields for the new polygon feature, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
10.	 In the Attributes window that automatically opens, select the new LandUse feature 
you just created. The default value for Category (CAT) and SubCategory (SCAT) is 
Arable. You defined the default values in the Using subtypes and domains together 
recipe of Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase.
11.	 Let's change the attribute values. Select the Category field, and click on the 
small button from the right to open the Choose Symbol Class window. Select the 
Hydrography value, and click on OK. For the SubCategory field, select the Fish 
pond value from the drop-down list. For LandUseID, type the value of OBJECTID. 
Click on OK to close the window.

Editing Data
42
12.	Return to the Attribute window, and expand the nodes for the Fish Pond feature to 
see the relationships. The new LandUse feature is related to the BuildingsR layer 
(BuildingsR-ToBuildingsR) and Owners table (Owners-ToOwners). Select the 
Owners-ToOwners relationship to define the owners of the parcel.
13.	Right-click and navigate to Table | Open Attribute Table. In the Owners table,  
select the owner with NameOwners as Owner1. At this point, open the 
attribute tables for the LandUse and BuildingsR feature classes and 
for the LandUseToOwners relationship. To see LandUseToOwners and 
BuildingsRToOwners relationship tables and the Owners nonspatial table,  
click on the List By Source button in the Table Of Contents section.
To see the tables as shown in the preceding screenshot, click on the 
tab of the LandUse table and drag it within the Table window. When 
you see the Dock icon, drag the selected table to the right or down 
docked position.
14.	 Return to the Attribute window, and right-click on the LandUse feature relationship: 
Owners-ToOwners. Select Add Selected. Now, your parcel has an owner with 
OBJECTID as 1.
You should check the relationship class table named LandUseToOwners; it stores 
the relationship between Fish Pond and Owner1.
15.	In the Table window, select the LandUseToOwners table to check the changes. 
Edit the OwnerProcent attribute field with its value as 100. Select and inspect 
the Owners table. To see how many parcels and buildings own the Owner1 table, 
click on the Related Tables button, and choose the two relationships one by one: 
LandUseToOwners:ToLandUse and BuildingsRToOwners:ToBuildingsR.
Next, you will create a new parcel and modify two vertices of a dwelling. In the 
following screenshot, you have all elements to create a new parcel by splitting the 
arable polygon:

Chapter 2
43
16.	 Click on Bookmarks, and select Cut a Parcel and modify a Building.
17.	 Select the parcel with OBJECTID as 755 from the LandUse layer.
18.	First, go to the Snapping toolbox and keep only the Vertex Snapping option selected.
19.	Second, select the Cut Polygons Tool option. Start the sketch from point (1) and 
select the Distance-Distance tool. Click on point (1) as a center for the first circle, 
and press the D key to type 77 for Distance. Click on point (2) as a second center, 
and press the D key to type 139 for Distance. You have obtained a point as an 
intersection of two circles. Click on the first intersection to obtain the second vertex of 
the cutting polyline.
20.	Again, select the Distance-Distance tool. Click on point (2) as a center for the first 
circle, and press the D key to type 128 for Distance. Click on point (3) as a second 
center, and press the D key to type 135 for Distance. Click on the second intersection 
to obtain the third vertex of the cutting polyline.
21.	 Select Straight Segment, and click on point (2). To finish the cutting sketch, press 
the F2 shortcut key.
22.	In the Attributes window, select the following values: Category as Other 
terrains, SubCategory as Built-up area, and for LandUseID, type the value of 
OBJECTID. Click on OK.

Editing Data
44
23.	The new LandUse feature is related with the BuildingsR layer (BuildingsR-
ToBuildingsR) and the Owners table (Owners-ToOwners). Try to manage those 
relationships by yourself. How to start? Firstly, with Shift pressed, select the building 
with the Select Features tool. Secondly, select BuildingsR-ToBuildingsR, and 
right-click on it to choose the Add Selected option.
Next, you will correct the position of two vertices of the building according to the 
orthophoto map used as a background:
24.	 Keep the building selected and with the Shift key pressed, unselect the parcel. Click 
on Edit Vertices, and from the toolbar, choose Modify Sketch Vertices. Select the 
two vertices by drawing a small box around the vertices. Drag the selected segment, 
and drop it as shown in the preceding screenshot.
Finally, you will correct a neighboring LandUse parcel. You have two options, as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
45
25.	Use the Reshape Feature Tool option to draw a line as point (1) from the preceding 
screenshot in order to cut the polygon with OBJECTID as 755 from the LandUse 
layer. You have created a gap between the parcels. To modify the parcel from the 
left-hand side, select the Other Terrains option with the Auto Complete Polygon 
construction tool from the Create Feature window. Put the first vertex in the gap and 
the second in the neighboring parcelâsee point (2). With the Select Features tool, 
select both the parcels, and from the Editor toolbar, select Merge. In the Merge 
dialog, select Build-up area (LandUse), and click on OK.
26.	Use the Cut Polygons Tool option to split the polygon. With the Select Features tool, 
select the two parcels from point (3). From the Editor toolbar, select Merge. In the 
Merge dialog, select Build-up area (LandUse), and click on OK.
27.	 In the Editor toolbar, navigate to Editor | Stop Editing, and save your edit. Navigate 
to File | Save As, and save your map as MyEditing.mxd.
You can find the final results at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\EditingData\ 
MyEditingResults\Editing.mxd.
How it works...
To select an existing parcel from the LandUse layer, and in order to edit it, first use the  
Select Features tool, and after that, select the specific edit tools from the Editor toolbar. If 
you use an Edit tool to select a feature, there is always a risk that you will create a subtle 
movement of the selected feature. A small shift will create overlaps and gaps between the 
coincident features. To protect features from this small shift, navigate to Editor | Options | 
General | Sticky move tolerance, and set a minimum distance for cursor movement before 
the selected feature will be moved too.
At step 23, we tested the multiple vertex editing. We have selected two vertices and moved 
them at once.
You can change the geometry of a segment by selecting two vertices.
Right-click on the segment, select Change Segment, and choose one of 
the options: Bezier or Circular Arc.
You can also delete multiple vertices at the same time.

Editing Data
46
In the Creating a relationship class recipe of Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase, we created 
relationship rules between the LandUse, BuildingsR, and Owners tables. We have already 
noticed at step 12 that relationships are active and must be updated every time we add new 
features. The relationship rules can be validated during the edit session. Select all features 
from BuildingsR and LandUse using the Select Features tool. In the Editor toolbar, 
navigate to Editor | Validate Features. A message box will appear stating 72 features are 
invalid. Click on OK to close. All invalid features are selected. In the Attributes window, 
inspect and try to correct the errors yourself.
There's more...
To add more data to your geodatabase schema, we will test two more options: Load Data 
using ArcCatalog and Load Objects in the ArcMap environment. Follow these steps to add the 
data in the geodatabase file using Load data:
1.	 Start ArcMap, and open the existing Editing.mxd map document from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\EditingData.
2.	 Open the Catalog window from the Standard toolbar to have access to your data. 
In the Catalog window, right-click on WatercourseL from ...\EditingData\
Topo5k.gdb, and navigate to Load | Load Data. Set the following parameters from 
panels:
Â

3.	 Click on Next and Finish. In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on 
WatercourseL, and choose Zoom To Layer to see the polyline features.
Continue to follow the steps to populate the Watercourse feature class with 
features from the LandUse feature class using Load Objects in ArcMap.
4.	 To add the Load Objects tool, click on the drop-down arrow from the right-hand 
side of the Editor toolbar, and select Customize. Select Commands, and for Show 
commands containing, type load objects. From Commands, click and drag the 
Load Objects option to the Editor toolbar. Click on Close. To use this tool, you need to 
start the editing session.

5.	 Before starting an edit session, in the Table Of Contents section, right-click on 
Watercourse, and navigate to Edit Features | Organize Feature Templates. 
You will define a default value for the Name field. All the new features from 
Watercourse that you add in this edit session will have the Name field as River

8.	 Click on Finish. In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on Watercourse,  
and choose Zoom To Layer.
9.	 Select all vectors using the Select Features tool from the Tools toolbar and open the 
Attributes window. All nine Stream features have the same attribute value for the 
HYC field as Intermittent. This is because in the Using subtypes and domains 
together recipe of Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase, we have assigned the domain 
code 2 (Intermittent) as the default value of the HYC field for the Stream 
subtype features.
Let's suppose that we mistakenly chose to load all objects in the Stream subtype. To 
change the subtype value to River for all the nine features at the same time, select the 
Watercourse layer in the Attributes window. Click on the icon from the left Stream value 
to open the Choose Symbol Class window. Select the River value, and click on OK. Read 
carefully the warning message, and select Yes to automatically assign the corresponding 
Perennial default values for HYC. The Name field already has the River Flake value. 
Notice that every feature has the same HType and HYC and the Name value. In the Editor 
toolbar, navigate to Editor | Stop Editing, and save your edit. Navigate to File | Save 
As, and save your map as Editing.mxd. You can find the final results in <drive>:\

Recall that you constrained the attribute values by subtypes and domains in Chapter 1, 
Designing Geodatabase. Every time you load features from other sources, such as existing 
feature classes or shapefiles, don't forget to validate the attribute values during the edit session. 
The Validate Features option will identify all the invalid values for the attribute fields for which 
you have already defined the subtypes and domains. All features that have invalid values will be 
selected. You should inspect and correct the reported errors with the Attributes window.

In the next recipe, Advanced editing in a geodatabase, you will continue to work with 
advanced editing tools and with COordinate GeOmetry (COGO)
Advanced editing in a geodatabase
The Advanced Editing toolbar offers tools to reshape and replace geometry, correct the 
overshoot or undershoot errors, split line features in intersection, divide a line or curve based 
on specified lengths or percentages, and edit multipart features.
The COGO toolbar allows you to work with COoordinate GeOmetry. Coordinate geometry 
refers to directions or bearings, angles, and horizontal distances that generally came from a 
topographic survey and that describe a series of consecutive lines. Those lines can be straight 
lines or simple curves and are named as courses or 2-point line. A course has only two 
vertices. The survey measurements that describe the courses can be stored in a traverse file 
in the context of ArcGIS. From the topography point of view, a traverse is a classical method for 
a detail topographic survey of an area. In ArcGIS, in a closed traverse, the consecutive lines 
start from a known point and end at the same or another known point. In an open traverse, 
the consecutive lines start from a known point and do not end at a known point. By known 
point or control point, we mean a fixed (ground) point of known X and Y coordinates.
With the Create COGO Fields, Update COGO Attributes, and Construct 2-Point Line tools 
from the COGO toolbar, you can add, calculate, and update the COGO attributes for an  
existing feature class.
For theory and worked examples about azimuth, bearings, horizontal 
distances, types of curves, and simple two-dimensional traverse 
computation, please refer to:
Principles of Geospatial Surveying, Artur L.Allan, Whittles Publishing, 2007, 
Technical Procedures, pp.7-18, Survey Computations, pp.145-150, and 
Construction and Curves, pp.240-244.

Getting ready
In this recipe, we will work with the RoadL layer to create new features using the Midpoint 
tool and to edit the existing features using the Line Intersection and Extent tools. You will 
add new attribute fields to the RoadL layer using the Create COGO Fields tool in ArcCatalog. 
Finally, you will update some parcels from the LandUse layer based on the coordinate 
geometry coming from a computed traverse. You will use a 2D closed-loop traverse. The line 
segments are described by direction, which is expressed relative to North Azimuth, and by 
horizontal distance, as shown in the following screenshot:

Editing Data
50
The curves from your traverse are circular curves with constant radius. In the context of 
ArcGIS, curves are defined by arc, radius, chord direction, and side (Curve 6) or by arc, radius, 
and side when you already know the start point and direction for a tangent and don't need to 
specify the chord direction and tangent (Curve 10). You can calculate the rest of the elements 
that describe a simple curve, such as Angle, Chord Distance, or Tangent Length, using the 
Curve Calculator from the COGO toolbar, as shown in the following screenshot:
How to do it...
Follow these steps to update the RoadL layer:
1.	 Start ArcMap, and open an existing map document AdvancedEditing.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\EditingData.
2.	 From the Bookmarks menu, select Create Field road. In the Table Of Contents 
section, right-click on the RoadL layer, and navigate to Edit Features | Start Editing. 
Add the Advanced Editing and COGO toolbars. In the Create Feature window, 
select the Field road template. In the Snapping toolbar, select only Vertex and Edge 
Snapping. In the Editor toolbar, select the Midpoint tool to create a centerline based 
on the Transportation subtype from LandUse, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
51
3.	 Click on point (1), and then click on point (2), to add the first vertex of the sketch at 
the midpoint between point (1) and point (2). To add another vertex, click on points 
(3) and (4). Those points are on the edge of the LandUse polygon. Continue to add 
vertices to the end of the road.
4.	 To connect Field road with Rural road (point (5)), and to split Rural road 
at the intersection, let's use the Line Intersection tool from the Advanced Editing 
toolbar. Select Field road and the Line Intersection tool. First, click on the end  
of the selected feature (red circle from the preceding screenshot), and secondly  
click on point (5). Press O to choose the Extend existing feature option, and click  
on OK. Finally, click again on point (5). Click on Undo Line intersection to undo the 
last action.
5.	 You will test another way to split Rural road and to correct undershoots. First,  
to specify the feature that you want to connect to, select the Rural road.  
Secondly, select the Extent tool. Finally, click on Field road to specify what  
vector you want to extend to Rural road (red circle from the preceding screenshot). 
To split Rural road at the intersection, select the Split tool from the Edit toolbar, 
and click on point (5).
6.	 Save and stop the edit session. Save the map document at ...\Data\
EditingData as MyAdvancedEditing.mxd.
Let's add new features to the RoadL layer using COGO:

7.	
Open ArcCatalog. Click on the drop-down arrow from the right-hand side of the 
Standard toolbar, and navigate to Customize | Commands. In Show commands 
containing, type cogo. Select the Create COGO Fields tool, drag-and-drop it on 
the Standard toolbar. Select the RoadL feature class, and click on the Create 
COGO Fields tool to add the specific COGO fields. Close ArcCatalog, and open 
MyAdvancedEditing.mxd.
8.	 It's time to specify the angular units. In the Editor toolbar, navigate to Editor | 
Options | Units. In the Angular Units section, choose North Azimuth for Direction 
Type and Gons for Direction Units. In Display angles using, type 4 for decimal 
places. Click on OK.
9.	 Start an edit session. In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the RoadL layer, 
and select Open Attribute Table. Inspect the COGO fields that were created. Leave 
the Table window open.
10.	 We will transform polyline 1 and polyline 2 into COGO lines and add a new 2-Point 
Line as shown in the following screenshot:
11.	 Let's consider polyline 1 coming from an old survey taken in the field and polyline 3 
coming from screen digitizing. To differentiate those two polylines, we will transform 
polyline 1 into COGO lines. Select polyline 1, and click on the Split into COGO lines 
tool from the COGO toolbar. Click on Template, choose Field road as the  
feature template, and click on OK. To calculate the coordinate geometry for the  
newly created lines, select the Update COGO Attributes tool. Inspect the changes  
in the Table window.

Chapter 2
53
12.	Let's add a COGO curve starting from point (1) as shown in the preceding screenshot. 
From the Bookmarks menu, select Create a COGO curve, then select Construct 
2-Point Line, and finally select polyline 2. The black arrows indicate the direction 
of the vector. Choose the curve with the Chord field of 100 meters, the Angle field 
of 482 gons, the Chord Direction field of 285 gons, and the Turn field of Right to 
obtain a curve. In the Reference section, navigate to Use selected line | Start Point. 
Click on Create to obtain Case 1. We expected to obtain a curve from point (1), but 
the line started from polyline 3.
13.	Select the Edit Vertices option from the Edit tool to see the direction of the vector. 
The red vertex indicates the end of the vector. To reverse the direction, right-click on 
the selected vector, and choose Flip.
14.	 Repeat step 7 to obtain Case 2. Click on Create and close the window.
15.	To calculate the coordinate geometry for the newly created curve, select the Update 
COGO Attributes tool, inspect the changes in the Table window, and save the edits.
Let's update a LandUse parcel using the Traverse tool:
16.	 From the Bookmarks menu, return to Create Field road. In the Table Of Contents 
section, check the LandUse layer to see the feature templates in the Create Feature 
window. In the List by Selection mode, set only the LandUse layer as the selectable 
layer and return to the List by Source mode. Select the parcel as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Editing Data
54
17.	 We will replace the existing parcel with a new one using the survey recently taken 
in the field. We will consider that traverse from the Parcel_Owner1.txt file was 
already adjusted for a closure error. Select the Replace Geometry Tool option from 
the Advanced Editing toolbar. Select the Traverse tool from the COGO toolbar. 
Right-click on the Traverse window, and select Load Traverse. Go to ...\Data\
EditingData, and select the Parcel_Owner1.txt file. Click on Finish, and  
close the window.
18.	Examine the spatial errors. Notice there are some overlaps and gaps between  
the parcels. Let's try to correct some errors. Select the Align To Shape tool  
from the Advanced Editing toolbar. Follow the options and steps from the  
following screenshot:

Chapter 2
55
19.	With the trace tool, start from the first point (Start buffer), and define a short 
segment on the edge of the updated parcel. To finish the trace and return to the Align 
To Shape window, double-click on the last point (Finish buffer). Try to change the 
value of Tolerance to see how the buffer changes. Next, click on Align to modify the 
edges of the neighboring parcels. Then, continue to align the parcel by updating the 
Tolerance value. Finally, click on Close to close the window. Inspect the attributes of 
the new parcel. The attributes remain unchanged because of the Replace Geometry 
Tool option.
20.	Save the edits, and stop the edit session. Save the map document to ...\Data\
EditingData as MyAdvancedEditing.mxd.
You can find the final results at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\EditingData\
MyEditingResults.
How it works...
Regarding step 3, it is not necessary to have an existing feature to define the line segment. 
We just indicate the two points directly on the orthophoto map.
To store the COGO in the attribute table of the RoadL layer, we created empty COGO fields in 
ArcCatalog with the Create COGO Fields tool. By adding a COGO curve, we have emphasized 
the importance of digitized direction.
We used the Replace Geometry Tool option from the Advanced Editing toolbar in order to 
keep the attributes of the LandUse parcel and its relationship with the Owner table.
After we updated the parcel at step 11, we corrected the edges of the neighboring parcels in 
order to maintain the adjacency between the surrounding parcels. Using the Align To Shape 
tool is a right decision because we assumed that horizontal positions and dimensions of the 
new parcel are more accurate than manual digitized parcels.

In the next recipe, Creating geodatabase topology, we will learn how to create and 
validate the spatial relationships between features in a file geodatabase
Creating geodatabase topology
In a map, topology refers to spatial relationships between features, such as:
f
f
Connectivity: This indicates that rivers from the WatercourseL feature class or 
roads from the RoadL feature class should be connected

Editing Data
56
f
f
Coincidence: This indicates that the water and roads from the Watercourse 
and Road polygon feature classes should be covered by the Hydrography and 
Transportation subtypes from the LandUse feature class
f
f
Adjacency: This indicates that parcels from LandUse have common edges and 
should not overlap or have gaps
f
f
Containment: This indicates that buildings from the Buildings feature class should 
be within the Other Terrain (Built-up area) subtype from the LandUse 
feature class
In the ArcGIS context, a topology is a collection of rules that define the spatial relationship 
between features within a feature class or between features of two or more feature classes 
belonging to the same feature dataset.
A topology is stored in a file geodatabase as an individual File Geodatabase Topology 
element. In a topology, we can apply one or more rules to a feature class. We can apply different 
rules to the feature subtypes. We can create different and complicated spatial relationships 
between subtype features of one, two, or more feature classes in a single topology.
In a topology, if we want to define topological rules between features of two or more feature 
classes belonging to different feature datasets, we have to move them in the same feature 
dataset. We can have more topology elements in a feature dataset, but a feature class can be 
implicated in only one topology at a time.
For more details regarding topology and topology rules, please 
refer the online ArcGIS Help (10.2) by navigating to Geodata | 
Data types | Topologies at http://resources.arcgis.
com/en/help/main/10.2.
Getting ready
The main steps involved in creating a topology are:
1.	 Name the topology.
2.	 Set Cluster Tolerance.
3.	 Add one or more simple feature classes.
4.	 Define the Ranks (importance).
5.	 Add one or more Rules.
6.	 Create the topology in a feature dataset.
7.	
Validate the topology.

Chapter 2
57
Cluster tolerance is the distance range where the feature vertices are considered coincident. 
Starting from classical cartographic theory, let's consider that absolute accuracy of our dataset 
at scale 1:5,000 is 0.5 meter. We will use a cluster tolerance of about 0.5/10 = 0.05 meter.
Ranks define what feature vertices will be moved during the validation process.
After we define the topology rules between four feature classes from the Topo5k.gdb 
geodatabase, we will validate the topology in order to apply the rules to our feature classes.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create File Geodatabase Topology in a file geodatabase using the 
ArcCatalog context menu:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In the Catalog Tree section, go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\
Data\EditingData, and select Topo5k.gdb. Expand the Buildings and 
LandUse feature datasets.
2.	 To create a topology for the BuildingsR and LandUse feature classes, we  
have to add them in the same feature datasetâLandUseâas shown in the  
following screenshot:

Editing Data
58
3.	 Select the BuildingsR feature class from the Buildings feature dataset, and 
drag-and-drop it in the LandUse feature dataset. Right-click on the LandUse feature 
dataset, navigate to New | Topology, and click on Next. Leave the default value for 
Enter a name for your topology. For Enter a cluster tolerance, type 0.05, and click 
on Next. Click on Select All to check all feature classes, and click on Next. Define the 
relative importance of the feature classes by selecting the following ranks from the 
Rank drop-down list: BuildingsR = 1 and LandUse = 2. Click on Next to see the 
following panel:
4.	 Select the Add Rule button. We have three sections: Features of feature class, Rule, 
and Feature class, as shown in the following screenshot:
 

Chapter 2
59
5.	 In the first and third sections, we can see the feature classes and their subtypes. This 
will allow us to define rules at feature subtype levels. In the second section, we have 
a drop-down list with the topology rules corresponding with the type of geometry. 
In the Add Rule window, we can define topology rules for a single feature class or 
between two feature classes. Click on Cancel to return to the New Topology window.
6.	 Select the Load Rules button to add a set of rules: Rule Set (*rul format). Go to 
...\Data\EditingData, select the LandUse_Topology.rul file, and click on 
Open and on OK to load the rules.
7.	
Inspect the rules. We don't have a general rule between all subtypes from 
Buildings and LandUse. As we can see, the rules refer to the Buildings 
and LandUse subtypes. In this way, we can exclude some feature subtypes from 
following a rule that applies to all other subtypes from the parent feature class. 
To exclude a feature subtype, just avoid mentioning it in the list (for example, the 
BuildingsR:Unknown subtype). Click on Next and on Finish. Select No in the pop-
up window that appears. You will validate the topology in the next step.
8.	 In ArcCatalog, select LandUse_Topology, and choose the Preview mode to see 
the topology errors. You will see a blue hatched rectangle. This means that the whole 
area is not validated and requires topology validation in order to find the errors. This 
area is called a dirty area.
9.	 We can check the topology status in ArcCatalog. Right-click on the LandUse_
Topology element, and navigate to the Properties | General tab. The topology 
status is Not Validated.
10.	 Let's validate the topology to identify any errors. Right-click on the LandUse_
Topology element, select Validate, and from the View menu, select Refresh  
to see changes in the Preview mode. Now the topology status is Validated-
Errors Exist.
11.	 Right-click on the LandUse_Topology element, navigate to the Properties | Errors 
tab, and click on the Generate Summary button to inspect the errors. You can save 
the report in a .txt file.
The Must be larger than cluster tolerance rule is added by 
default. We cannot remove this rule as it is applied automatically 
to all features participating in a topology.
Every time we make changes in a topology (add/delete rules or cluster tolerance), 
the entire area covered by our features will become a dirty area. When we edit the 
features (for example, change subtypes and add/delete features or vertices), the 
area surrounding the features will need additional topology validation and will also be 
considered as a dirty area.

Editing Data
60
12.	You can change the value of Cluster Tolerance to see changes in topology status and 
in the Preview mode.
13.	If you want to add more rules, open the Properties tab of LandUse_Topology, and 
navigate to the Rules | Add Rule button. Add the rules and validate the topology. 
Close ArcCatalog.
You can find the final results at ...\Data\EditingData\MyTopologyResults.
How it works...
A topology has one of the following statuses:
f
f
Not Validated
f
f
Validated-Errors Exist
f
f
Validated-No Errors
f
f
If you edit the features, Not Validated with dirty area
A topology is not applied to our data until we validate it. Validation helps us to find errors. 
Validation generates two processes: cracking and clustering. The connected features are 
disconnected and connected again by adding/deleting vertices and slightly moving feature 
vertices based on the cluster tolerance and ranks. In the example from the following 
screenshot, we exaggerated the value of Cluster Tolerance to 1 meter for the LandUse 
topology before the validation process:

Chapter 2
61
Notice in the following screenshot how the vertices were deleted (v1) and moved (v2) after the 
topology validation:
For more details about the cracking and clustering processes, please refer to the Esri 
Technical Paper (2010): Understanding Geometric Processing in ArcGIS.
If you validate a topology in ArcCatalog, you cannot reverse the effects of 
the validation process.
If you validate a topology in ArcMap, you can undo the changes made 
through the validation process.

It's very important to have a comprehensive understanding of our dataset and the spatial 
relationships between features before choosing the right rules for a topology and the right 
solution to correct the errors. When you inspect the error, firstly identify the features involved, 
secondly understand what is causing the error from a geometrical point of view, and thirdly

How to do it...
Follow these steps to edit LandUse_Topology in ArcMap:
1.	 Start ArcMap, and open an existing map document EditingTopology.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\EditingData. Click on the Add Data 
button, and load LandUse_Topology from ...\Data\TOPO5000.gdb\LandUse. 
Select Yes in the pop-up window to add all feature classes that participate in 
LandUse_Topology.
2.	 In the Table Of Contents section, drag the BuildingsR layer above the LandUse 
layer. Set the transparency for BuildingsR and LandUse at 60 percent.
3.	 Right-click on LandUse_Topology, and navigate to Properties | Symbology. Notice 
that the error features may be points, lines, or polygons depending on the error types. 
Inspect all other tabs to review the ranks, rules, and errors from the previous recipe, 
Creating geodatabase topology. Click on OK to close the window.
4.	 Start an edit session. Click on the drop-down arrow from the right-hand side of the 
Editor toolbar, and select Customize. Check the Topology toolbar, and click on Close. 
Select the Error Inspector tool from the Topology toolbar and dock the window at the 
bottom of the ArcMap window, as shown in the following screenshot:

Editing Data
64
5.	 Uncheck Visible Extent Only, select <Errors from all rules> in the Show drop-down 
list, and click on the Search Now button. Inspect the rules and the columns in the 
Error Inspector window. If we click on any of the column headings, we change the 
order of the errors accordingly. If we select a row, we see the selected error on the 
map. The Shape column tells you about the error geometry: polygon error, polyline 
error, or point error.
6.	 Let's examine and correct some errors with the Fix Topology Error tool. First select 
<BuildingsR: Dwelling-Must Be Covered By-LandUse:Other terrains> in the Show 
drop-down list, and click on the Search Now button.
7.	
Select the first error, shown as Must Be Covered By | BuildingsR:Dwelling | 
LandUse:Other terrains | Polygon | 72 | 0 | False. Right-click on the error, and 
choose Zoom To. The Dwelling subtype is on the Arable parcel. This is a violation 
of the rule that says that the Other terrains subtype parcel must contain only the 
Dwelling subtype buildings. Because the orthophoto map is from 2012, and some 
changes could have happened, we can assume that this error could be a false error, 
and we will declare it as an exception to the rule. With the Fix Topology Error tool, 
select the error, right-click on the map, and select Mark as Exception. To see this 
exception, check Exceptions in the Error Inspector window. Click on Search Now to 
refresh the rows.
8.	 Select the next error, shown as Must Be Covered By | BuildingsR:Dwelling | 
LandUse:Other terrains | Polygon | 77 | 0 | False. Right-click on the error, and 
choose Zoom To. The dwelling is overlapping on two parcels. This is a real error, and 
you should correct it. How do you do it? With the Fix Topology Error tool, select the 
error, right-click on the map, and select Select Features.
9.	 There are three main possible solutions: delete a vertex, use Topology Edit Tool, or 
use Reshape Edge Tool and slightly shift the buildings.
1.	 First solution: Click on Edit Vertices from the Edit toolbar. With the  
pointer on vertex 4, right-click on and choose Delete Vertex, as shown  
in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
65
2.	 Second solution: Click on Topology Edit Tool, and select edge (1). Select the 
Reshape Edge Tool option, and draw a line between points (2) and (3), as 
shown in the following screenshot. To unselect the edge, click on Reshape 
Edge Tool, and click outside the building feature.
3.	 Third solution: With the building selected, click on Rotate Tool from the 
Editor toolbar, press the A key to set the rotate angle at 4 gons. Type 4, and 
press the Enter key. Click on Edit Vertices from the Edit toolbar, and delete 
the cracking points that were added on both the edges of the building in the 
validation process.

66
As we can see, the last solution seems to be more proper for the building because 
the geometry of the building remains unchanged.
10.	 Unselect the feature with Clear Selected Features from the Standard toolbar. 
Because we edited a feature, let's see the dirty area. Right-click on LandUse_
Topology, and navigate to Properties | Symbology. Check the Dirty Areas option, 
and click on OK. You will see a small blue hatched rectangle. This means that your 
topology needs to be validated on this area. Select Validate Topology in Specified 
Area, and draw a bigger box on your dirty area. Now your area is validated, and the 
error has disappeared from the list.
11.	 Let's continue to correct errors for the LandUse layer. In the Error Inspector window, 
select < LandUse-Must Not Have Gaps> in the Show drop-down list, and click on the 
Search Now button. Select the first error, right-click on the error, and choose Zoom 
To. The error delineates the entire area. This is a false error, which you will declare as 
an exception to the rule. With the Fix Topology Error tool, select the error, right-click 
on the map, and select Mark as Exception. Click on Search Now to refresh the rows.
12.	Select the second error in the Error Inspector window, right-click on the 
error, and choose Zoom To. With Fix Topology Error, right-click on the map, and 
choose Select Features. There are two possible solutions: use a predefined fix or edit 
the vertices, which are explained in detail here:
1.	 First solution: With the Fix Topology Error tool, select the error, right-click on 
the map, and choose the predefined fix: Create Feature. You now have a new 
feature that fills the gap. Select both parcels and use Merge from the Editor 
toolbar to merge polygons (1) and (2) as shown in following screenshot:

Chapter 2
67
2.	 Second solution: Select the parcel, and click on Edit Vertices from the  
Edit toolbar. With the pointer on the vertex, drag the vertex from point (1)  
to point (2).
13.	Use the Validate Topology In Current Extent tool to validate the changes you 
have made.
14.	 In the Error Inspector window, select < LandUse-Must Not Overlap> in the Show 
drop-down list, and click on the Search Now button. Select the first polygon error, 
right-click on the error, and choose Zoom To. With the Fix Topology Error tool, 
select the error, right-click on the map, and select Merge, as shown in the preceding 
screenshot. In the Merge window, select Built-up area (LandUse), and click on 
OK. Click on Search Now to refresh the rows. Correct the second error yourself using 
the same steps. Consider as exceptions the last four errors from the < LandUse-Must 
Not Overlap> list. Select all four errors at once, and right-click on and choose Mark 
as Exception. If you change your mind, just right-click on and choose Mark as Error.
15.	Zoom to Full Extent, validate using the Validate Topology In Current Extent 
tool, and refresh the error list in the Error Inspector window.

How it works...
The validation of spatial data and correction of the topological errors improve the quality of 
our data but do not increase the accuracy of our spatial data.
The small overshoot and undershoot errors can be fixed through the validation process as 
shown in the following screenshot:
Do not increase the value of cluster tolerance to automatically fix this kind of error in your 
spatial dataset.

Editing Data

The topology validation is an iterative process. The simultaneous use of different topological 
rules should be performed moderately. Try to keep the number of topology rules as small  
as possible.
We have noticed that a single mistake in feature geometry might violate multiple rules and 
generate different geometry errors (for example, polygon and polyline errors at the same 
time). The correction of some topological errors might generate new topological errors notified 
by other topological rules applied to the datasets. In order to avoid the recurrent correction 
of the errors on the same vectors, it is recommended that you create, for example, a topology 
only for features from LandUse. After we have corrected all errors between features from the 
same feature class, we should delete the topology. After that, we can create another topology 
between the BuildingsR and LandUse feature classes.
Another good idea is that we should first create a topology, and after that, we should create 
relationships and define relationship rules between the BuildingsR and LandUse feature 
classes (the Creating a relationship class recipe of Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase). 
Otherwise, we have to pay attention to those relationships while correcting the topology errors.
The Must be larger than cluster tolerance rule helps us to identify the small residual 
polygons or polylines resulted in the edit process or from different geoprocessing tasks. As a 
general practice, there is an order of correcting errors from a topology as follows: correct the 
polygon errors, correct the polyline errors, and finally correct the point errors.
There's more...
Some of the topology errors can be considered false errors , which means that involved 
features will not obey the topology rules. Most of the time, those kinds of errors have to be 
identified by the operator and be declared as exceptions to the topological rules.

In ArcCatalog, inspect the properties of WatercourseL_Topology from ...\Data\
EditingData\MyTopologyResults\TOPO5000.gdb\Hydrography. For all 23 errors, 
refer to the Must not have dangle rule that constrains the vectors from being connected to 
other vectors. This significant number of errors could suggest that rivers from the hydrography 
network are disconnected. These point errors are false. Only one error has been really 
identified, the rest of the errors having been declared as exceptions:
In the quality control report, we should mention the number of identified and corrected 
errors. It is also necessary to specify the number of exceptions to prevent the following overall 
assessment: your spatial data has been created with a doubtful quality and significant 
corrections were applied.

Setting a custom coordinate reference system
Introduction
In accordance with the international standard ISO 19111:2007, geographic information spatial 
referencing by coordinates, the following definitions are universally agreed upon:
f
f
A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is a coordinate system that is related to an 
object through a datum. For geodetic and vertical datums, the object is the Earth.
f
f
A datum is a set of parameters that defines the position of the origin, the scale, and 
the orientation of a coordinate system.
f
f
A geodetic datum describes the relationship of a 2D or 3D coordinate system to  
the Earth.

Working with CRS
72
f
f
A geoid is the equipotential surface of the Earth's gravity field that is everywhere 
perpendicular to the direction of gravity. The geoid best fits mean sea level either 
locally or globally. A geoid is considering the true shape of the Earth.
f
f
A projected coordinate reference system is a coordinate reference system derived from 
a two-dimensional geodetic coordinate reference system by applying a map projection.
f
f
A vertical coordinate reference system is a one-dimensional coordinate reference 
system that is based on a vertical datum. A vertical datum describes the relation  
of the gravity-related heights to the Earth. A vertical datum is related to a geoid.
A geocentric coordinate reference system is a geodetic coordinate reference system that 
has the origin in the center of the mass of the Earth (geocenter) and usually is expressed in 
rectangular Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z).
An ellipsoid models the size and shape of the Earth. The ellipsoid (ellipsoid of reference) is 
formed by rotating the meridian ellipse about its minor axis (oblate ellipsoid). The ellipsoid 
generated by rotating the meridian ellipse about its major axis is a prolate ellipsoid. You need 
at least two parameters to define the size and shape of an ellipsoid (one parameter must be 
the semi-axis).
Generally speaking, the difference between the major and minor axes is small, and the shape 
is close to a sphere. Because it approximates the shape of a sphere, we call it a spheroid. For 
example, the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) has the semi-major axis length of 
6,378,137 meters and the semi-minor axis length of 6,356,752.31414 meters. The terms 
ellipsoid and spheroid will be used interchangeably.
An ellipsoidal coordinate system works with geodetic latitude (B or Ï), geodetic longitude  
(L or Î»), and ellipsoidal height (h).
When the Earth is considered a sphere, we use a spherical coordinate system with its origin in 
the center of the sphere (spherical latitude Ï and spherical longitude Î»).
In ArcGIS, you will find both the ellipsoidal and spherical coordinate system in the 
geographic coordinate systems folder. In the ArcGIS context, a geographic coordinate 
system has three components: angular units, prime meridian, and datum (spheroid).

Chapter 3
73
When you are working with Vertical Coordinate Systems, please take into account the 
difference between the ellipsoidal and gravity-related heights. Ellipsoidal heights (h) use the 
ellipsoid as the reference surface and represent the vertical component a of 3D ellipsoidal 
coordinate system. Gravity-related heights (H) use as reference surface the geoid that is the 
component of the one-dimensional vertical coordinate system. The relationship between the 
ellipsoid, geoid, and topographic surfaces is as shown in the following screenshot:

As a final remark, please be aware about the difference between the transformation and 
conversion processes. A transformation involves a change of datum (for example, from GRS80 
to Krassowsky 1940), and a conversion does not involve a change of datum (for example, 
geographic coordinates Ï and Î» to projected coordinates N and E).

f
f
What features preserve (for example, distances: equidistant projection; areas: equal

How to do it...
Follow these steps to study what Europe looks like in different map projections using ArcMap:
1.	 Start ArcMap, and open the existing map document CRS.mxd from:  
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\CRS, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
75
2.	 The Table Of Contents section contains ten Data Frames in Layout View with different 
Coordinate Systems. Every data frame contains the same NUTS_RG_03M_2010 layer 
from the NUTS_2010_03M.mdb personal geodatabase. In Layout View, you can see 
all data frames at once. Data View allows you to view only one data frame at a time. 
You can switch between Data View and Layout View if you click on the small buttons 
from the lower-left part of the map display window (3). Keep Layout View activated. 
In Layout View, use the Zoom In (1), Zoom Out, and Pan (2) tools from the Layout 
toolbar to study the aspect of the graticules for every data frame's projection.

Working with CRS
76
3.	 Let's check the first data frame's coordinate system. Right-click on the first data 
frame ETRS89_EPSG::4258, and navigate to Properties | Coordinate System, as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
77
4.	 Notice that the coordinate system is set to the GCS_ETRS_1989 coordinate system 
with the EPSG geodetic code 4258. This is a 2D geographic coordinate system. To 
read more about it, please check the website http://www.epsg-registry.
org. EPSG is the acronym for European Petroleum Survey Group. As shown in the 
following screenshot, select retrieve by code (1), type 4258 (2), and click on Retrieve 
(3) to find the ETRS89 coordinate reference system characteristics, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Working with CRS
78
5.	 To see more details and the geodetic parameters, click on view (4).
6.	 Let's inspect the second data frame: ETRS89_LAEA_EPSG::3035. To activate the 
data frame, press the Alt key, and select the data frame in the Table Of Contents 
(TOC) section. The name of the activated data frame is indicated in bold letters in TOC. 
You can activate a data frame by right-clicking on ETRS89_LAEA_EPSG::3035 and 
selecting Activate. The activated data frame will have a gray dashed border in the map 
display window.
7.	
It is a Projected Coordinate System named Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area. This 
projection is recommended by the INSPIRE Directive in the Data Specification on 
Coordinate Reference Systems document on page 7.

3.2Â 17.04. 2014.
9.	 Repeat step 5 to see more details on http://www.epsg-registry.org using the 
code 3035.
10.	 Continue to inspect every data frame from CRS.mxd and compare the projections  
(for example, graticules and distortions of the feature shapes).
How it works...
The NUTS_RG_03M_2010 layer is projected on the fly in accordance with the Coordinate 
System option of the Data Frame section. This mean that layer projection is only temporarily 
changed inside the data frame. The on-the-fly transformation does not affect the original 
coordinate values in the feature class.

If you want to change the graticule intervals in Layout View, please refer to Chapter 
7, Exporting Your Maps. In the next Projecting vector data recipe, you will transform a 
geographic coordinate system into a projected coordinate system for  
a feature class in a file geodatabase.

Projecting vector data
In the previous recipe, you saw the same NUTS_RG_03M_2010 feature class that has the 
ETRS89-GRS80 geographic coordinate system in nine data frames that have different 
projected coordinate systems. The projection of the feature class was made on the fly by 
ArcMap based on every data frame's projected coordinate system.
To permanently transform the coordinate reference system of a feature class, use the Project 
tool from ArcToolbox. This will create a new feature class with the new coordinates for the 
features. ArcGIS offers multiple versions of a transformation between different datums. It's 
important to choose the optimal transformation because it will affect the coordinates' accuracy.
At <ARCGISHOME>:\Desktop10.2\Documentation, you will find a PDF file called 
geographic_transformations.pdf that lists all supported datum transformations and 
the areas for which they are suited.

Getting ready
Let's follow the steps to transform the AdministrativeUnits standalone feature class 
from the geographic coordinate system (GCS) ETRS_1989 to the projected coordinate system 
Pulkovo_1942_Adj_58_Stereo_70 using the predefined transformation from ArcGIS:

Working with CRS
80
How to do it...
Follow these steps to transform the coordinates for a feature class in the ArcCatalog application:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In the Catalog Tree section, go to <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\CRS and select Topo5k.gdb.
2.	 The file geodatabase has an empty feature dataset. Right-click on the Boundaries 
feature dataset, and navigate to Properties | XY Coordinate System. To go to the 
current coordinate system, navigate to the Projected Coordinate System | National 
Grids | Europe projected coordinate system named Pulkovo_1942_Adj_58_
Stereo_70 with the EPSG code 3844.
3.	 Let's add some data. Search on Google for Eurostat website with following key words: 
eurostat statistical units. You should find the following link Administrative 
units and Statistical units Eurostat: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/
gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-
units.
4.	 Read carefully the Copyright notice, and download the NUTS 2010 dataset as a 
personal geodatabase: NUTS_2010_3M.zip. Unzip the archive file in <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\CRC\NUTS2010. You now have a personal geodatabase 
with the administrative units for Europe at 1:3,000,000 scale.

Chapter 3
81
5.	 Import the NUTS_RG_03M_2010 feature class into Topo5k.gdb, as a standalone 
feature class:
6.	 In the Catalog Tree section, right-click on Topo5k.gdb and navigate to Import | 
Feature Class (single). Specify Input Feature, Output Location, and Output  
Feature Class (as AdministrativeUnits), and click on OK, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Right-click on the AdministrativeUnits feature class, and navigate to Properties | 
XY Coordinate System. To go back to the current coordinate system, navigate to the 
Geographic Coordinate System | Europe GCS named ETRS 1989 with the EPSG 
code 4258.
8.	 If you want to move the AdministrativeUnits standalone feature class in the 
Boundaries feature dataset, you simply select the feature class and drag and drop 
it into the feature dataset. You will not succeed because the feature datasets have a 
different spatial reference. You will receive the following error message: The spatial 
reference does not match.
9.	 Let's use the Project tool to transform the AdministrativeUnits standalone feature 
class from the geographic coordinate system in a projected coordinate system. 
Open ArcToolbox, and navigate to Data Management Tools | Projections and 
Transformation. Double-click on the Project tool to open the dialog box shown in  
the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
83
10.	 Specify the Input Dataset or Feature Class step (1) of Topo5k.gdb\
AdministrativeUnits. Specify the Output Dataset or Feature Class (step 
2) of Topo5k.gdb\Boundaries, and type the name of the feature class as 
EuropeAdministrativeUnits.
11.	 The Output Coordinate System was automatically added because the newly  
created feature class will inherit the coordinate system of the feature dataset  
of Boundaries.
12.	At step (3) Geographic Transformation, choose the Pulkovo_1942_Adj_1958_
To_ETRS_1989_4 geographic transformation. Click on OK.
13.	This is the best transformation for your feature class, also take into account the input 
and output CRSs and the covered area. To choose a proper datum transformation 
please go through the following steps:
1.	 Open the geographic_transformations.pdf document from 
<ARCGISHOME>:\Desktop10.2\Documentation and go to page 67 to 
read the following row: Pulkovo_1942_Adj_1958_To_ETRS_1989_4 
15994 CF 2.3287 -147.0425 -92.0802 0.3092483 -0.32482185 
-0.49729934 5.68906266. Read the details from page 75 regarding the 
geographic transformation method called CF or Coordinate_Frame that is 
a seven-parameter geocentric transformation.
2.	 Check the parameters of  the transformation EPSG::15994 at http://www.
epsg-registry.org. Using the EPSG::15994 datum transformation the  
accuracy of the horizontal position will range from 1.5 meters to 3 meters.
14.	 Use ArcMap to see the EuropeAdministrativeUnits feature class.

Georeferencing raster data
According to the online ESRI GIS Dictionary, the georeferencing process converts the 
coordinates of a raster to a known coordinate system in order to be viewed, queried, and 
analyzed with other spatial datasets you might have. The raster's Cartesian coordinate system 
is considered as a source (arbitrary) system The known or reference Cartesian coordinate 
system is considered as a destination (fixed) system.
In this recipe, you will follow the general concepts from the following diagram:

in two dimensions and least squares estimation, please refer to:

Chapter 3

Getting ready
You will georeference a raster in the TIF format that is a scanned topographic map 
corresponding to scale 1:5,000. The raster will represent the source coordinate system 
(image system).
As a reference layer, you will have a vector dataset in the dxf format (CAD data file format) 
that contains the grid for 1:5,000 scale maps in oblique stereographic projection with the 
EPSG code 3844 and the name Pulkovo 1942(58) / Stereo70. The reference layer will 
represent the target coordinate system (fixed).
You will use the affine transformation method or six-parameter transformation. The affine 
method assumes the following adjustments: translations on x and y, scale changes on x and 
y, and rotation on x and y (the axes are not orthogonal). The following equations express the 
affine transformation in 2D space:
XT= AxS + ByS + C
YT= DxS + EyS + F
A, B, C, D, E, and F are the parameters of the transformation, xS and yS are the source 
coordinates (image system), and XT and YT are the target coordinates (map reference 
system). To estimate the six parameters using the least squares method, you need at least 
four points of known coordinates in both coordinate systems (source and target).
After you specify at least four links, ArcGIS will calculate the residuals on X and Y as the 
difference between the calculated map coordinates and the known map coordinates. The 
resultant Residuals = SQRT (Residual_X2 + Residual_Y2).RMS Error represents the root 
mean square error of an observed point. RMSE = Â± SQRT(Sum(Residual_X2 + Residual_Y2)/
number of equations-number of parameters)
You should pay attention to the RMSE values. Usually, the values should not be greater than 
0.5 pixels in dimensions. After the affine transformation (scale changes on x and y), you will 
have a pixel value of around 0.4 m. Trying to obtain a RMS value of 0.2 m in this case is not 
quite relevant for the scanned map at the scale 1:5,000.
Taking into account the classical theory of cartography, 1 mm on the map represents 5 m on 
the ground. The planimetric precision for a map should be between 0.1 mm and 0.3 mm.
Following this idea, let's propose for RMSE a value equal or less than 0.5 m corresponding to 
0.1 mm planimetric precision on a map at the scale 1:5,000.

How to do it...
Follow these steps to georeference a scanned map (raster) in ArcMap using the coordinates 
from the following screenshot:
1.	 Start ArcMap, and open an existing map document Georeferencing.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\CRS.
2.	 From the Bookmarks menu, select Raster. Notice the two Overview windows that 
will help you to see the full extent of raster and the control layer in .dxf format. If 
necessary, rearrange the windows on Data View.
3.	 From the Customize menu, navigate to Toolbars | Georeferencing. On the toolbar, 
choose L35_111_Db_2III.tif as the georeferencing layer.
4.	 Click on the View Link Table button, and uncheck Auto Adjust in Link Table.
5.	 In the next steps, you will add four links between the source points and the destination 
points by selecting the Add Control Points button from the Georeferencing toolbar. The 
green pointer indicates where the source point is, and the red pointer indicates where it 
should be.

Chapter 3
91
6.	 From the Bookmarks menu, select RasterNW. In the Snapping toolbar, select Vertex 
to snap to the vertices of lines from the control layer.
7.	
Click on in the first corner of the raster to add the first source point (Source 1). Go to the 
reference layer using the bookmark Grid 1:5000. Click on Point 1 NW (Destination 1) 
to add the corresponding destination point using the following screenshot as a guide:
8.	 Use the bookmarks RasterNE, RasterSE, and RasterSW to repeat step 7 for the next 
three points. To line up the raster to the reference layer, click Auto Adjust, and select 
the Transformation: 1st Order Polynomial (Affine) method in Link Table. You should 
obtain similar values to the ones shown in the following screenshot:

Working with CRS
92
9.	 Notice the estimated resultant residual values and RMS Error. If you make a mistake 
while adding links, select the wrong link by clicking on the row and click on the Delete 
Link tool or press the Delete key. Add the link again by repeating step 6. If you have 
not obtained an RMSE equal to or less than 0.5 meter, you should delete the link with 
larger residual errors and add it again.
10.	 Save the links to a text file using the Save tool from Link Table. Save them in 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\CRS\MyGeoref as L35_111_DB_2III_
EPSG3844.txt. You can see the file using any text editor (for example, WordPad).
11.	 You can remove all points from the Link Table section with the Delete Link tool and 
restore them with the backup file you just created using the Load tool.
Let's go to the last step of the georeferencing process: 
12.	On the Georeferencing toolbar, select the Georeferencing menu, and choose Rectify 
to save the georeferencing adjustments of the raster.
13.	Accept the default values for Cell size, Resample Type, and Format. For Output 
Location go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\CRS and select the MyGeoref 
workspace (folder). For Name, type L35_111_Db_2III. Click on Save.
14.	 Remove the control points from Link Table, and close the window. Add the 
georeferenced raster using the Add Data button from the Standard toolbar.
15.	In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the L35_111_Db_2III raster, 
and select Properties. Select the Source tab, and examine the Spatial Reference 
section. Spatial Reference is Pulkovo_1942_Adj_58_Stereo_70. The spatial 
reference was automatically inherited by the newly created raster from the Data 
Frame coordinate system. To check the coordinate system of the data frame, 
navigate to View | Data Frame Properties | Coordinate System. Click on OK.
16.	 Save the map document at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\CRC as 
MyGeoreferencing.mxd.
How it works...
You have georeferenced a raster using a .dxf file as the reference layer. You can add links 
using the Insert Links button from the Link Table window. You can also modify the existing 
coordinate values directly by editing the fields of the links. The Rectify command has created 
a new raster and a world-file in a separate ASCII file with the same name as that of the raster 
file, with a "w" attached. Open Windows Explorer, go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\
Data\CRS\MyGeoref, and open the file L35_111_DB_2III.tfw with any text editor to see 
the content. This file contains the six parameters of the affine transformation associated to 
the new raster.

For more details regarding the world-file, please refer 
to http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/
main/10.2, and navigate to Geodata | Data types | 
Rasters and images online in ArcGIS Help (10.2).
At step 10, you saved the links in the L35_111_DB_2III_EPSG3844.txt file. If you open 
this file, you see there is no information about the spatial reference or RMS value. It is 
recommended that you save the RMS value, because this information should be specified 
in the Quality and Validity section from Metadata. According to the Infrastructure for Spatial 
Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) directive, metadata is an important 
component of an infrastructure for spatial information. Metadata means information 
describing spatial datasets and spatial data services (INSPIRE Directive 2007/2/EC, Article 3).

Setting a custom coordinate reference 
system
In this recipe, you will define a custom projected coordinate reference system. Your CRS will 
have the following parameters:
f
f
A geodetic datum:
Â
Â
The reference ellipsoid is at Krassowsky 1940 (semi-major axis: 
6378245.000 m and inverse flattening: 298.3)
Â

Projection: A conformal azimuthal perspective projection (stereographic), it is  
also an oblique stereographic projection on a secant projection plane, with the 
following parameters:
Â
Â
Latitude and longitude of origin (projection pole = center of projection) are 
Ï0 = 460 N and Î»0 = 250 E
Â
Â
Scale factor (rectangular coordinates from the tangent plane to the secant 
plane) is 0.999,750,000
Â
Â
False easting = 500,000 and false northing = 500,000 (the origin of the 
rectangular coordinate system is the projected image of the projection pole)

Working with CRS

You will consider that ellipsoidal coordinates are transformed first (conformal transformation) 
into spherical coordinates (considering radius of sphere equal to the mean radius of 
the ellipsoid at projection origin: Î»0 = 250), and then coordinates are projected onto the 
projection plane.
Getting ready
To double-check all the parameters, please go to http://epsg.io, type 3844, and click on 
Search. You will find the following details:
How to do it...
Let's define a custom projected coordinate reference system in ArcCatalog using the 
parameters from epsg.io:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In the Catalog Tree section, navigate to <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\CRS\Topo5k.gdb.

96
4.	 At step (2), you will define the project method. Navigate to Projection | Name, select 
Double_Stereographic. Type the parameters of projection at step (3). For Linear 
Unit, select Meter , and the value 1 for Meters per unit. The following screenshot 
guides you through these steps diagrammatically:
5.	 At step (4) you will choose the datum of projection. Select Change to open the 
Geographic Coordinate System window. Navigate to Geographic Coordinate 
Systems | Europe, and select Pulkovo 1942 Adj 1958. Click on OK.

Chapter 3
97
6.	 In Feature Dataset Properties, there is a new folder, Custom, that contains  
your custom projection. Select the custom projection, and right-click to select  
Add To Favorites.
7.	
Close the window without applying the new projection. Click on Cancel.
8.	 You can see and use the projection from the Favorites folder in the ArcCatalog, 
ArcMap, or ArcToolbox context.
How it works...
When you created the custom projected coordinate reference system, it was created as a 
virtual Custom folder that stores the projection file (.prj). You have chosen to export it to the 
Favorites folder in order to have access at the file content. You can find the newly created file 
at C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\ESRI\Desktop10.2\ArcMap\Coordinate 
Systems, as shown in the following screenshot:

Introduction
According to the online ESRI GIS Dictionary, a geoprocess is a GIS operation used to 
manipulate data. A geoprocess implies creating new data based on existing data. In general, 
this happens in the following circumstances:
f
f
When data is copied, imported, or added from one source to another source (for 
example, a geodatabase)
f
f
During data conversion (for example, loading data in a feature class from a CAD file)
f
f
When analyzing data, that is, combining features or/and attributes from one or more 
dataset to create a new dataset
This chapter has the following scenarios:
f
f
Counseling the local public administration
f
f
Promoting alternative methods of transportation cycling
f
f
Initiating a pilot project named VeloGIS
The goal is to analyze the possibility of creating a cycling infrastructure in our city. We already 
have a file geodatabase model named VeloGIS.gdb, and we received five CAD datasets 
from two departments of municipality.

Spatial joining features
The Spatial Join tool is an overlay geoprocessing tool. This tool will join the attributes coming 
from a feature class to another feature class, based on their spatial relationship. The new 
feature class will have the geometry of the target feature class and the attribute fields of  
both the input feature classes. The spatial join is a classical solution when you want to  
extract data from CAD files.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will add data from the .dxf source datasets to an existing geodatabase 
named VeloGIS.gdb. Your geodatabase contains one feature dataset named Planimetry 
and five empty feature classes: Buildings1, Parcels1, RoadCenterLine, SideWalk, 
and Streets1.
There are five CAD files: Buildings.dxf, Parcels.dxf, RoadCenterLine.dxf, 
SideWalk.dxf, and Streets.dxf.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to populate your VeloGIS geodatabase with features from the .dxf files, 
using ArcCatalog:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. Navigate to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\
Geoprocessing, and select the DXF folder to see the five .dxf files: Buildings, 
Parcels, RoadCenterLine, SideWalk, and Streets.
2.	 Expand the Buildings CAD feature dataset, and preview the features from the 
CAD Polygon feature class. Right-click on the feature dataset, and navigate to 
Properties | General. The Coordinate Systems field is unspecified. Click on the Edit 
button, navigate to Add Coordinate System | Import, and then go to <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\Geoprocessing\VeloGIS.gdb. Select the 
Planimetry feature dataset, and navigate to the Add | OK buttons to return to CAD 
Feature Dataset Properties. Explore by yourself the contents of the Coordinates 
and the Details tab. Click on OK to close the dialog. Repeat the step for Parcels, 
SideWalk, and Streets.

Â
Â
Check Load all of the source data
4.	 Click on Finish to load the features. Preview the Buildings1 feature class in 
ArcCatalog to check if the polygon streets were loaded.
5.	 Repeat step 3 to populate the Parcels1, SideWalk1, and Streets1 feature 
classes with features.
Follow these steps to export the specific attributes as a standalone point feature 
class from the Annotation CAD feature class in ArcCatalog.
6.	 Let's return to ...\Data\Geoprocessing\DXF\Buildings.dxf. Expand the 
Buildings CAD feature dataset. Right-click on the Annotation feature class, and 
navigate to Export | To Geodatabase (single).
7.	
For Output Location, select VeloGIS.gdb, and click on Add. For Output Feature 
Class, type DestinationBuilding. For Expression (optional), select the SQL icon 
from the right-hand side. In the Query Builder dialog, build the following expression: 
"Layer" = '0'. How do you do that? Double-click on "Layer" and select the 
Equal button. Click on the Get Unique Values button, and double-click on the 0 value 
to add it into the expression. Click on OK to return to the Feature Class to Feature 
Class dialog.
8.	 In Field Map (optional), delete all the fields except Text (Text). The Text field contains 
the values for the Destination field in the Building feature class. Click on OK.
9.	 Right-click on the Annotation feature class once again, and navigate to Export | To 
Geodatabase (single).
10.	 For Output Location, select VeloGIS.gdb, and click on Add. For Output Feature 
Class, type StructureBuilding. For Expression (optional), select the SQL icon 
from the right-hand side. In the Query Builder dialog, build the following expression: 
"Layer" = 'Material and State' AND "Height" = 1.5. Click on OK to 
return to the Feature Class to Feature Class dialog. In Field Map (optional), delete 
all the fields except Text (Text). Click on OK.

12.	Open ArcToolbox, and navigate to Analysis Tools | Overlay. Double-click on the 
Spatial Join tool, and follow the steps shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 4
103
13.	For Target Features, select VeloGIS.gdb\Planimetry\Building1, and click on 
Add (step 1). For Join Features, select VeloGIS.gdb\DestinationBuilding, 
and click on Add (step 2). For Output Feature Class, type Building2, and click 
on Save (step 3). For Join Operation (optional), select JOIN_ONE_TO_ONE (step 4). 
Check the Keep All Target Features (optional) option (step 5).
14.	 In the Field Map of Join Features (optional) section, erase the SHAPE_Length and 
SHAPE_Area fields (step 6). Rename the Text (Text) field to DestinationDxf (step 
7). For Match Option (optional), select CONTAINS, and click on OK (step 8).
15.	Again use the Spatial Join tool to add two more fields: the StructureDxf field from  
the StructureBuilding standalone feature class and the StateDxffield field  
from the StateBuilding standalone feature class, as shown in the following  
two screenshots:

Geoprocessing
104
16.	 We have obtained the Building feature class with the field attributes: 
DestinationDxf, StructureBuilding.dxf, and StateBuilding.dxf. We should populate 
the Destination fields (the CDC subtype field), Structure (domain field), and State 
(domain field) with the corresponding fields from the preceding screenshot. Inspect 
by yourself the codes of the subtype field and the valid values for the domains.
Follow these steps to add subtypes and domain values in the Buildings feature 
class using the ArcMap context menu.
17.	 Close the ArcCatalog application. Open ArcMap, and add the Building feature class 
in the Table Of Contents section. Right-click on the Building layer, and select Open 
Attribute Table. Erase the Join_Count and TARGET_FID fields by right-clicking on 
the field and selecting Delete Field. Click on the drop-down arrow next to the Table 
Options button, and select Select by Attributes.
18.	In the Select by Attributes dialog, for Method, select Create a new Selection. 
Double-click on DestinationDxf to add the field in the expression section. Click 
on the IS button, and then click on Get Unique Values to list the unique values for 
DestinationDxf. Double-click on the NULL value. In the expression section, you 
should see the following expression: DestinationDxf IS NULL. Click on Verify to 
check the expression. Click on Apply, and don't close the dialog.
19.	Right-click on the Destination (CDC) name field, and select Field Calculator. In 
the warning message, check Don't warn me again, and select Yes. In the Field 
Calculator dialog, check if you see the CDC= expression above the expression 
section. In the expression section, type 0; this corresponds to the Unknown subtype. 
Click on OK.
20.	Return to the Select by Attributes dialog. In the expression section, build the 
following expression: DestinationDxf = 'dwelling '. Click on Apply, and don't 
close the dialog. Repeat step 18, and type 1; this corresponds to the Dwelling 
subtype. Click on OK.
21.	 Repeat the steps for all values from the DestinationDxf field to populate all rows of 
the Destination column.
22.	Right-click on the Structure field, and select Field Calculator. In the expression 
section, add the StructureDxf field. Click on OK. Right-click on the State of Building 
field, and select Field Calculator. In the expression section, add the StateDxf field. 
Click on OK.
23.	For both fields, select the <Null> values, and with Field Calculator, add the "Unk" 
values that correspond to the Unknown value domain.
24.	 Erase all the three source dxf fields because they contain redundant information now.

Chapter 4
105
25.	In the Catalog window, erase all redundant feature classes, such as 
Buildings1/2/3 and Destination/ Structure/StateBuilding, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
26.	Add features and attributes to the Parcels, SideWalk, and Streets feature 
classes from the corresponding .dxf files.
You can find the VeloGIS file geodatabase and the expressions files (steps 10 and 11) in 
...\Data\Geoprocessing\MySpatialJoinResults.
How it works...
At step 2, we defined the coordinate reference system for every .dxf dataset. ArcCatalog has 
created a projection file (prj) for every CAD feature dataset. Before importing a CAD file into 
the VeloGIS.gdb geodatabase, it is necessary to examine carefully the table of the CAD 
annotation, polygon, or polyline feature class. It's important to identify the relevant attributes 
for our feature class before loading the features and attributes in our geodatabase.
There's more...
Open Windows Explorer, and notice the size of our VeloGIS.gdb file geodatabaseâit's 
around 1.5 MB. In ArcCatalog, right-click on VeloGIS.gdb, and navigate to the Administration 
| Compact Database option. Read carefully what the compact process means. Return to 
Windows Explorer, and notice the size of our VeloGIS.gdbâit's around 500 KB.

Using spatial adjustment
Spatial adjustment allows you to spatially adjust the location of a dataset based on a 
reference dataset through the following processes: transformation, rubbersheet, and edge 
snap. In general, these processes are used to improve the planimetric accuracy of features 
from a feature class. In this recipe, we will learn how to adjust a feature class using an affine 
transformation. The concepts and recommendations from the Georeferencing raster data 
recipe of Chapter 3, Working with CRS, are still valid.
Getting ready
In the previous recipe, we added data from the .dxf source datasets to the VeloGIS 
geodatabase as feature classes. The vectors that came from the RoadCenterLine.
dxf dataset have a local cartesian coordinate system. We will consider that the derivate 
CenterLines feature class has the source coordinate system.
All other dxf datasets are in the right coordinate system, that is, Pulkovo 1942 Adj 58 Stereo 
70 (EPSG:3844). We will consider that the derivate Streets and Parcels feature classes 
have the destination or target coordinate system.
The displacement links are connecting the source location to the destination location. The 
affine transformation needs at least three links in order to perform the transformation. We will 
create those links manually using a control point file named ControlPoints.txt. This text 
file contains a list of five destination coordinates (X, Y).
How to do it...
Follow these steps to perform a spatial adjustment in ArcMap:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. Go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\Geoprocessing, 
and select the DXF folder to see the RoadCenterLine.dxf dataset. Expand 
the RoadCenterLine CAD feature dataset and preview the features from the 
CAD Polyline feature class. Right-click on the feature dataset, and navigate 
to Properties | General. The coordinate system is not specified. Click on the 
Coordinates tab to see CAD Dataset Extends. The coordinate values are very small, 
and this indicates that vectors were created using an ungeoreferenced scanned map 
as background source.

Chapter 4

2.	 Go to ..Geoprocessing\ VeloGIS.gdb\Planimetry. Right-click on the 
CenterLines feature class, and navigate to Load | Load Data. Set the following 
parameters from the panels:

Check Load all of the source data
3.	 Click on Finish to load the features. Preview the Buildings1 feature class in 
ArcCatalog to check if the polygon streets were loaded.
4.	 Preview the CenterLines feature class in ArcCatalog to check whether the polyline 
streets were loaded.
5.	 Close ArcCatalog. Open ArcMap, and add the Streets, Parcels, and 
CenterLines feature classes. In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the 
CenterLines layer, and select Zoom To Layer. Inspect the data.
6.	 Let's add the Spatial Adjustment toolbar by navigating to Customize | Toolbars. On 
the Editor toolbar, navigate to Editor | Start Editing.
7.	
We will declare the layer we want to adjust from the Spatial Adjustment toolbar. 
Navigate to Spatial Adjustment | Set Adjust Data. Click on the All features in these 
layers option, and check only CenterLines. Click on OK.
8.	 We will choose the adjustment method by navigating to Spatial Adjustment | 
Adjustment Methods | Transformation-Affine.
9.	 On the Editor toolbar, go to Editor | Snapping | Snapping Toolbar and check only 
End Snapping.
10.	 Open View Link Table from the Spatial Adjustment toolbar. The table is empty. You 
will add the control points from a text file. Navigate to Spatial Adjustment | Links | 
Open Control Points File. Select the ControlPoints.txt file from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\Geoprocessing. Click on Open.

11.	 There are five destination points, as shown in the following screenshot:
12.	Let's add the source points. Right-click on the first point from the Control Points 
window, and select Add Link. Click on the first point (P1) from the ArcMap display 
area to connect the link with the source point. Use the F5 key from time to time to 
refresh the view and see the links.
13.	Repeat step 10 for all points. Close the Control Points window, and open View Link

To Layer. Inspect the results. Stop the edit session by navigating to Editor | Stop 
Editing.
17.	 Save your map document to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\ Data\
Geoprocessing as MySpatialAdjustment.mxd.
How it works...
It is a useful practice to apply topological rules before and after the spatial adjustment for all 
new feature classes derived from the .dxf datasets. Also, don't forget to save the RMS value; 
it could be mentioned in the history of your dataset (Lineage section) from Metadata.
There's more...
Using the Attribute Transfer tool, we will update the name of the street from the 
CenterLines and Parcels layers based on the attribute values of the Streets layer. 
Follow these steps to add attribute values using the Attribute Transfer tool from the Spatial 
Adjustment toolbar:
1.	 Open MySpatialAdjustment.mxd with ArcMap. In the Table Of Contents section, 
we have Streets, Parcels, and CenterLines layers. Let's add the SideWalk 
features from VeloGIS.gdb\Planimetry.

f
f
Data extraction (for example, clip and select)
f
f
Overlay (for example, intersect and spatial join)
f
f
Proximity (for example, buffer and point distance)
With geoprocessing tools, we can perform geoprocessing operations. The geoprocessing 
operations are used to obtain new feature classes or nonspatial tables for a specific analysis.

How it works...
Because we decided to analyze only Dacia Avenue, at step 2, we used the Definition Query 
option to display only the Dacia features from the CenterLines layer. The Buffer tool will 
create polygon zones just around the drawn features. By choosing LIST for Dissolve Type, and 
the Name field for Dissolve Field(s), we will tell the Buffer tool to create a single polygon zone 
around all features named Dacia. In this way, we worked with the minimum necessary data.
At step 6, we chose the Intersect (Overlay) tool instead of the Clip (Data extraction) tool 
because we want the output feature class to inherit the attributes of both the input feature 
classes. If we explore the attribute table of ExpropriatedParcels, we will notice some 
difference in StreetName of the Parcels layer and Name of the buffer (Dacia). In this way, 
we can make the following identifications:
f
f
The errors in attribute values for the Parcels feature class
f
f
The parcels that belong to the neighboring streets and that will be affected by the 
new cycling infrastructure
Creating models
According to the online ESRI GIS Dictionary, a model is an abstraction of reality used to 
represent objects, processes, and events. In ArcGIS, a geoprocessing model is created with 
the Model Builder built-in application, as shown in the following screenshot:
 

Chapter 4
117
A model contains a process or more connected processes that are automatically executed 
when the model is run. A process consists of three elements: an input dataset (blue element), 
a tool (orange element), and an output dataset (green element). A geoprocessing model 
helps us to use various analysis operations and to create new data in a continuous workflow. 
In this way, the geoprocessing workflow can be reused and shared with other users. In 
ModelBuilder, you can use three basic types of elements:
f
f
Variables (for example, input or derived data, buffer distance value, and  
SQL expression)
f
f
Tools (for example, system tools such as buffer and intersect)
f
f
Connectors (for example, data connector)
Another important aspect of a model is Environment settings. Environment settings refers to 
additional parameters, such as output geodatabase for the results, output coordinate system, 
or if the field domain descriptions should be transferred to the derived data. Environment 
settings has a hierarchical approach and affects the result of the workflow.
For more details about Environment settings, please refer 
the online ArcGIS Help (10.2) by navigating to Desktop | 
Geoprocessing | Environment settings.
Getting ready
In this exercise, we will build a model that will repeat the analysis steps from the previous 
recipe Using common tools.
We will use the following feature classes and tools in the BikeLane model:
Feature classes
Tools (ArcToolbox)
CenterLines
(Model parameter)
Parcels
(Model parameter)
Buildings
(Model parameter)
Buffer (Distance = 12.1 as model parameter)
Select ("Name" = 'Dacia')
Intersect
Summary Statistics (SUM for SHAPE_Area)
Select Layer By Location
Feature Class to Feature

Geoprocessing

The following workflow model provides an overall view of the VeloGIS project:
The preceding diagram shows five geoprocessing tasks:
f
f
Create a buffer of 12.1 meters around the Dacia Avenue center line. The output  
is intermediate data because it is used as an input for the intersect process  
(the Intersect tool).
f
f
Intersect the buffer with the Parcels layer to obtain the parcels that should  
be expropriated. The ExpropriatedParcels output is considered as an 
intermediate result because it is used as an input for the statistic process  
(the Summary Statistics tool).
f
f
Create a file geodatabase table that contains the total area of parcels. The Sum_
Area_Expropiated output table is the final data.
f
f
Select the buildings that intersect with the 12.1-meter buffer. The output is an 
intermediate result, and it is used as an input for the process of creating features (the 
Feature class to Feature tool).
f
f
Create a new feature class based on the selected buildings that should be 
demolished. The DemolishedBuildings output is the final data.

How it works...
From the beginning, we set one of the most important parameters: Workspace. We defined 
the current workspace at the application-level environment (for all tools). The BikeLane 
model will inherit this environment setting parameter, and all intermediate and final data 
results will be stored by default in VeloGIS.gdb. If you want to check and modify the 
current and scratch workspace at the application level, please navigate to Geoprocessing | 
Environments | Workspace.
At step 5, we used relative paths for our model. If we change the folder where we keep the 
VeloGIS.gdb geodatabase, the model will still run properly.
At step 17, we mentioned that the SUM_Area_Expropriated table will be saved at  
the geodatabase level. A nonspatial table cannot be created in a feature dataset. Please 
recall from Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase, that a feature dataset is a collection of  
feature classes that have the same coordinate system. A nonspatial table does not have a 
spatial component.
If we try to run the BikeLane tool from ...\Data\Geoprocessing\MyModelResults\
VeloGIS.gdb, using the ArcCatalog application, an error will occur: ERROR 000732 
Buildings: Dataset Buildings does not exist or is not supported. This is because we have 
used the Select Layer By Location tool to select the buildings from the Buildings layer in 
ArcMap. This tool selects the feature from a layer (input data). A layer is specific to an ArcMap 
environment. In conclusion, our final model will run only in ArcMap. Open MyModelResults.

Introduction
An important aspect of map design is data symbology. For a final cartographic product, 
cartographers must classify, generalize, and symbolize different spatial data. A map reader 
should be able to recognize the symbols used by cartographers, and analyze and understand 
the reality represented in the final map.
Symbols can vary in graphic characteristics in order to express differences, hierarchy, and 
importance of the represented features from a qualitative or quantitative point of view. 
Choosing the right size, color, shape, or position (center or offset) for a symbol is  
crucial for the final message of the map.
In this chapter, you will learn how to create and store a set of customized symbols, and  
draw rules in your maps using Style Manager and Representations. You will also apply  
the proportional symbology according to quantitative values of the attribute value.

Working with Symbology
126
Managing styles
A style is a collection of symbols, colors, and map elements (such as legend, scale, north 
arrow, border, and reference system) used to create a map. A style set organizes symbols and 
map elements in a predefined structure. You can use the system styles or personal styles that 
contain certain elements for specific types of maps. In a system style, the gray folder icons 
indicate that the style set is read-only. In a new style set, the white folder icons indicate that 
they are empty, and the yellow folder icons indicate that they are populated with customized 
elements, as shown in the following screenshot:
A style set is actually a single file with a .style extension that can be read in ArcMap. The 
style file can be accessed with Windows Explorer and saved as a backup or sent to other 
users by e-mail. A personal style is not dependent on the ArcMap document (*.mxd) in which 
it was created and can be used by different map documents.
The system style files are installed at: <ArcGIS_HOME>\Desktop10.2\Styles.
The default personal style is saved at (Windows operating system): <install_drive>:\
Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\ ESRI\Desktop10.2\ArcMap.

Chapter 5
127
Getting ready
You can work with a style in ArcMap using the Style Manager dialog box. The Style Manager 
dialog box lets you create and organize styles and their contents. You can create, cut, copy, 
paste, rename, and modify the style contents in personal styles. You can also copy symbols, 
colors, or other map elements from system styles (read-only) and paste to your personal 
styles, where you can modify them. Before you modify default ArcGIS symbols or create new 
symbol libraries, you should create a new style set in which to keep all of your changes. In the 
next step, you will create a new style set for the purpose of applying standard symbols for a 
topographic map at scale 1:5,000.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a new style set using the Style Manager dialog box:
1.	 Start ArcMap, and open a new blank map document.
2.	 Navigate to Customize menu | Style Manager. The Style Manager dialog box shows 
two style sets. The first one is a default personal style and the second one, named 
ESRI.style, is a default system style.
3.	 Navigate to Styles | Create New Style, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 In the Save As dialog box, navigate to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data, type 
TOPO5k, and click on Save. Click on OK. The structure of TOPO5k.style is empty.

Working with Symbology
128
Now, copy a linear symbol from ESRI.style and paste it into your TOPO5k.style, where 
you can rename and modify the symbol:
1.	 In the Style Manager dialog box on the left-hand side, navigate to ESRI.style | Line 
symbols. In Style Manager, right-click on the symbol named River, Navigable 
and select Copy.
2.	 In Style Manager on the left-hand side, navigate to TOPO5k.style | Line symbols. 
In Style Manager on the right-hand side, in the empty space, right-click and select 
Paste. You should see something similar to the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
129
3.	 The symbol was saved in your personal style set. Notice that the white symbol  
folder icon became yellow. This indicates that the folder is populated with  
customized elements.
4.	 Close the Style Manager dialog box. The TOPO5k.style folder you created is saved 
even if your map document is not. Close ArcMap.
How it works...
The Style References dialog box lists all the system style files and the default personal style. 
The checked styles will be referenced into your map document. Referencing one or more styles 
means that its contents will be displayed in the Symbol Selector window. The Style Manager 
dialog box lets you see the styles you created before. You can add more styles to Style Manager 
by navigating to Styles | Add Style to List, and if you don't want to see one of them anymore, 
uncheck it in Style References. The unchecked style files are still in Style References and 
in your directory too. To erase them from your directory, you should use Windows Explorer or 
ArcCatalog applications.
In ArcCatalog, navigate to Customize | ArcCatalog Options. Select 
the File Types tab. Define the .style type by selecting New 
Type. Fill the File extension and Description of type sections. 
In ArcCatalog navigate to View | Refresh. With those settings, 
ArcCatalog will be able to see the style files.
There's more...
You can change the list of styles displayed in the Style References dialog box by changing  
the style path setting with the ArcMap Advanced Settings Utility parameter located at 
<ArcGIS_HOME>\Desktop10.2\Utilities\AdvancedArcMapSettings.exe.

130
Double-click AdvancedArcMapSettings.exe to open ArcMap Advanced Settings Utility 
and select the System Paths tab. In the All users section, go to Styles path. You can change 
the location of .style files by navigating to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
If ArcMap is open, you must close the session and restart the 
application for your changes to take effect.
When you restart ArcMap, the Style References dialog box will show all your style files  
created in the previous steps. You can also Reset all values to default in ArcMap Advanced 
Settings Utility.

Modifying symbols
The geographic features are graphically represented by symbols. Symbols have characteristics 
that can be varied in order to emphasize the differences, hierarchy, or importance of the 
features on a map.
The graphic characteristics or visual variables are referring to symbol size, color value  
(gray tone), hue (color), texture (pattern), orientation, and shape. These variables are applied 
individually or in combination to point, line, and area symbols depending on the type of data 
to be represented on a map.
For qualitative data, you can vary the following symbol characteristics: hue (color), texture, 
orientation, and shape.
For quantitative data, you can vary the following two symbol characteristics: size and color 
value (gray tone).
Getting ready
In the next step, we will apply standard topographic symbols for a topographic map at  
scale 1:5,000.
Symbolize point and line features and try by yourself to symbolize polygon features. Firstly, 
symbolize one point feature class named Elevation and one polyline feature class named 
WatercourseL, as shown in the following screenshot:
Secondly, add again WatercourseL in your map document, and symbolize it based on the 
field named HIC, which defines the hydrologic category.

Working with Symbology

Follow these steps to symbolize the WatercourseL feature class:
9.	 Click on the Add Data button, and load the WatercourseL feature class from  
...\Data\TOPO5000.gdb\Hidrography.
10.	 In the Table Of Contents section, the WatercourseL layer is symbolized based on 
its subtypes by default (HAT field). Double-click on the WatercourseL layer to open 
the Layer Properties window.
11.	 Uncheck the <All other values> parameter. Double-click on the line symbol of 
subtype with the value 4 Canalized stream. In the Symbol Selector dialog, select 
Color: Cretan Blue (10th column, 3rd row). For Width, select 2, and click on OK.
12.	Symbolize the rest of the subtypes as follows:

21.	 Save the WatercourseL layer as WatercourseL_HIC.lyr to <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data.
22.	Navigate to File | Save as and save your map as MyModifySymbols.mxd at 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\MapDocuments.
You can find the results at ...\Data\MapDocuments\Chapter5\ModifySymbol.mxd.
How it works...
Firstly, you have symbolized a one-point feature class named Elevation. The symbols 
represent qualitative (nominal) data and have the same size with the same hue (color).
Secondly, you symbolized one polyline feature class, WatercourseL based on the field 
named HAT, which classifies the rank of rivers. The symbols represent quantitative (ordinal) 
data and have different sizes with the same hue (color). You created a hierarchy by varying the 
size of symbol. When you use categories to symbolize the data, the <All other values> value 
refers to all other possible field values that are not defined in the list of the unique values 
(unmatched values).

Chapter 5
135
You unchecked the <All other values> value because your layer is symbolized by default 
based on the subtypes and you assume that your data does not contain errors. You can use 
the <All other values> value if you want to visually validate the attribute values of a subtype 
or domain field.
You symbolized once again WatercourseL based on the field named HIC, which defined the 
hydrologic category. The symbols represent qualitative (nominal) data and will have a different 
shape with the same hue (color). You showed differences by varying the shape of symbols. 
You have saved symbolized layers in a separate layer file (.lyr). This file saves the path to the 
physical store of the source data and the way you choose to symbolize the features. Now, try 
by yourself to symbolize by navigating to the TOPO5000.gdb | LandUse | LandUse polygon 
feature class base on the field named CAT, which defines land use categories. The symbols 
will represent qualitative (nominal) data and will have a different texture with the same hue 
(color). You will show the differences by changing the texture of the symbol.
There's more...
Hue refers to the colors from the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (wavelengths 
of the electromagnetic radiation from 0.4Âµm to 0.7Âµm). Hue is defined by mixing the colors 
Red, Green and Blue (RGB) or by mixing the colors Cyan, Magenta and Yellow (CMY). RGB is 
the main color system used for televisions and computer screens. CMYK is the main color 
system used for desktop printing (inkjet or laser) and commercial offset printing. CMYK refers 
to four basic ink colors: cyan, magenta, yellow and black (the K). HSV is a three-dimensional 
color space that link hue with value (lightness or darkness) and saturation (colorfulness or 
purity). When you select color for a printed map, you should use the Color Calibration Chart 
from: <ArcGIS_HOME>\Desktop10.2\plotters\calibrate.mxd.
Creating custom symbology
A symbol is composed of one or more graphic layers. Every symbol layer uses a point, line 
or area symbol, text, and color to represent a geographic feature. A symbol layer has its 
own graphic characteristics, such as size, color value, hue, texture, orientation, and shape. 
Depending on the number, order of drawing, size, form, color, offset, or other graphic 
characteristics, symbol layers overlap to form a single and distinct symbol.

Working with Symbology
136
Getting ready
In the next step, you will create standard topographic symbols for a topographic map at the 
scale 1:5,000. Firstly, you will create a point symbol for the thorny shrub feature, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
Secondly, you will create a pattern for polygon features from LandUse in accordance with the 
subtype classification field (CAT).
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a new point symbol and an area symbol (pattern):
1.	 Start ArcMap and open a new map document.
2.	 Navigate to Customize | Style Manager | Styles | Add Style to List.
3.	 Load the custom style file from <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\TOPO5k.

10.	 Select symbol layer number three, and set Type: Character Marker Symbol and 
Units: Points. In the Character Marker tab, choose Font: ESRI Default Marker, 
Subset: Basic Latin, Unicode: 33, Size: 2.83, OffsetX: -2.55, and OffsetY: 3.11.
11.	 Select layer number four, and set Type: Character Marker Symbol and Units: Points. 
In the Character Marker tab, choose Font: Baskerville Old Face, Subset: Basic 
Latin, Unicode: 33, Size: 14, Angle: 5, OffsetX: 4.5, and OffsetY: 3.5.
12.	Click on OK. Rename the symbol MyThornyShrub, and Category: LAND USE.
Let's create a pattern for the LandUse polygon features, as shown in the following screenshot:

Working with Symbology
138
The following steps will show you how to create LandUse polygon features:
1.	 In Style Manager on the left-hand side, select the TOPO5k.style/Fill Symbols 
folder.
2.	 In Style Manager on the right-hand side, in the empty space, right-click and navigate 
to New | Fill Symbol. In the Symbol Property Editor section, go to the Layers 
section, and use the Plus Sign button to add one more symbol layer.
3.	 For the first symbol layer, set Type: Marker Fill Symbol and Units: Points. In 
the Marker Fill tab, select the Marker button, and choose MyThornyShrub from 
TOPO5k.style. Click on OK. Select the Grid check box.
4.	 In the Fill Properties tab, set SeparationX: 34 and SeparationY: 34.
5.	 Select the second layer, and set Type: Marker Fill Symbol and Units: Points. 
In the Marker Fill tab, select the Marker button, and choose MyThornyShrub from 
TOPO5k.style. Click on OK. Select the Grid check box.
6.	 In the Fill Properties tab, set OffsetX: 17, OffsetY: 17, SeparationX: 34, and 
SeparationY: 34.
7.	
Click on OK. Rename the symbol as MyThornyShrub, and Category as LAND USE. 
Your fill symbol has been automatically saved into TOPO5k.style.
8.	 Click on Close to close the Style Manager dialog. Close ArcMap without saving.
How it works...
There are 10 types of land use in the feature class LandUse: Arable, Pasture, Meadow, 
Vineyard, Fruit orchard, Forest, Hydrography, Transportation, Other terrain 
and Unproductive. In ...\Data\TOPO5000.style, there are already defined patterns 
for every type of land use in the Fill Symbol section. These patterns have been created based 
on the point symbols from the Marker Symbol section. Notice that the Name and Category 
sections are constantly used in the same way for point and fill symbols. This aids in  
easy identification of all graphic characteristics that describe the same custom symbol  
(hue, shape, texture).
There's more...
If you want to apply symbols based on a custom style for a subtype, first you have to check 
whether the Description section for the subtype Code corresponds exactly to Name of 
symbols from the style file. Follow these steps to apply symbols based on a style:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open a new map document. Click on the Add Data button to load 
the LandUse feature class from <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\TOPO5000.
gdb\LandUse.
2.	 In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the LandUse layer, and navigate to 
Properties | Symbology | Categories | Match to symbols in a style.

Chapter 5

3.	 Select the style file named TOPO5000.style from <drive>:\PacktPublishing\
Data folder, and press the Match Symbols button. Click on OK.
4.	 Inspect the results, and save your map document as MyCustomSymbology.mxd to 
...\Data\MapDocuments.
Using proportional symbology
Point symbols represent discrete physical features (for example, triangulation points, 
address locations, fire hydrants, or street signs) or conceptual features (for example, cities by 
population, population by counties, birth rate, or unemployment rate by country, or disease 
outbreaks between 1990 and 2014 by region).
ArcMap offers four tools to represent quantitative data:
f
f
Graduated colors: This varies the hue (color) to symbolize the attribute values 
grouped into a given number of classes.
f
f
Graduated symbols: This varies the size and keeps the hue (color) constant to 
symbolize the attribute values grouped into a given number of classes.
f
f
Dot density: This keeps the size and hue (color) constant to symbolize the data that 
is not classified; the number of dots is tied to a certain attribute value. 
f
f
Proportional symbols: This keeps the hue (color) and shape constant and varies 
the size that is tied to the highest and lowest attribute values and a given number of 
graduated symbols.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will use point symbols to represent the quantitative attributes of the 
Counties polygon feature, as shown in the following screenshot:

Working with Symbology
140
All the point symbols will have the same color, same shape (circle for instance) and will vary in 
size to show the exact attribute values.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to visualize quantitative data using the proportional symbols method:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open a new map document. Load the Counties feature class 
from: <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\TOPO5000.gdb\Boundaries.
2.	 In the Table Of Contents section, double-click on the Counties layer to open 
Symbology in the Layer Properties dialog.
3.	 Navigate to Quantities | Proportional symbols. This will display the Layer Properties 
dialog, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 In the Fields section, for Value, select Population.
5.	 In the Symbol section, click on the background symbol.
6.	 In the Symbol Selector dialog, choose Fill Color: Olivine Yellow (6th column, 1st 
row), and click on OK to return to the Layer Properties dialog.

Chapter 5
141
7.	
Click on the Appearance Compensation (Flannery) check box. This option will slightly 
increase the size of circular symbols in order to avoid the wrong perception of symbol 
sizes on your map.
8.	 Navigate to Min Value | Edit Symbol. In the Symbol Property Editor dialog, for Color, 
choose the Fir Green option (7th column, 7th row).
9.	 For Size choose 6. Select Edit Symbol and uncheck the Use Outline box. Click on the 
Mask tab and select Style Halo with Size: 1.
10.	 Click on the OK button twice to return to the Layer Properties dialog.
11.	 For Number of Symbols to display in the Legend, select 5.
12.	Click on the Exclude button to open the Data exclusion Properties dialog. Select the 
Query tab, and build the following expression: Population = 0.
13.	Select the Legend tab and the check box Show symbol for excluded data. Navigate 
to Symbol | Edit Symbol. In the Layers section, use the Plus Sign button to add a 
new symbol layer.
14.	 Select the new symbol layer. Set Type: Line Fill Symbol and Units: Points. In the  
Line Fill section, choose Color: Mars Red (2nd column, 3rd row), and Angle: 45.
15.	Click on OK twice to return to the Data Exclusion Properties dialog. In the Data 
Exclusion Properties dialog, for Label, type No data.
16.	 Click on OK. Inspect the results and save your Counties layer as Counties.lyr to 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data.
17.	 Save your map as MyProportionalSymbology.mxd at ...\Data\MapDocuments.
You can find the results at ...\Data\MapDocuments\Chapter5\
ProportionalSymbology.mxd.
How it works...
You created a correlation between symbol size and ratio data value (quantitative data) by 
using proportional symbols. After you have gone through steps 7 to 9, you will notice that the 
Max Value symbol has changed proportionally. Since the polygon feature class contains an 
element with the value 0 for population, you have excluded this data from steps 12 to 16.

Working with Symbology
142
There's more...
The position of the circles can fall at the edge or outside of the polygon. This is because the 
circles are positioned at the centroid of their polygons. The centroid of the irregular polygons 
might lie outside the polygon, as shown in the following screenshot:
If you want to edit one of the circles' position, you should convert them into graphics. Right-
click on the Counties layer, and navigate to Convert Features to Graphics | Only draw the 
converted graphics. The Draw toolbar offers the tools to edit graphics. To see the polygons 
from Counties, right-click on the layer and navigate to Properties | Display | Feature 
Exclusion | Restore All. By converting the symbols to graphics, you will remove the link 
between the symbol and the associated attribute values. This means they will no longer  
adjust to changes to the attribute values.
Using the symbol levels
As you saw in the Creating custom symbology recipe, your symbols have one or many layers. 
By default, ArcMap controls the drawing order for symbols. The features are drawn based on 
the order in the Table Of Contents section and based on the order from the attribute table of 
every feature class. The symbol levels allow you to control the order of the feature symbols in 
Data View.
Getting ready
First, you will prepare data for test symbol layers by applying custom symbols to the RoadL 
feature class subtype. The symbols are already created in TOPO5000.style. When 
you visualize the data at scale 1:5,000, you will see a lot of graphic errors. To see the 
errors, use an existing map document named SymbolLevelRoad.mxd from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data. Use the Default View and Advanced View options to control the 
drawing order of the symbol layers.

Chapter 5
143
How to do it...
Follow these steps to use layer symbols to correct all graphic errors:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open an existing map document SymbolLevelRoad.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data.
2.	 In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the RoadL layer and navigate to 
Properties | Symbology | Categories | Match to symbols in a style. Click on the 
Browse button to add the ...\Data TOPO5000.style style file. To match the 
existing symbols with the values of the CND subtype field, press the Match Symbols 
button. Click on Apply and on OK.
3.	 Go to the Bookmarks menu and explore the spatial bookmarks that show you all the 
graphic errors of the linear symbols.
4.	 To resolve the drawing errors shown by the Forest and Forest 2 bookmarks, right-
click on the RoadL layer and click on Use Symbol Levels. Inspect the results.
5.	 In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the RoadL layer and navigate 
to Properties | Symbology. Uncheck the <All other values> value. Click on the 
Advanced button and select Symbol Levels.
6.	 In Default View, change the order of symbols, as shown in the following screenshot:
7.	
Click on OK twice to close the Layer Properties window. Inspect every bookmark to 
see the difference.
8.	 Return to the Symbol Levels dialog box and check the Merge column for Street 
and Field road.

9.	 Click on OK twice to close the Layer Properties window. Inspect every bookmark to 
see the results.
10.	 Return to the Symbol Levels dialog box and change the view mode by clicking on the 
Switch to Advanced View button.
11.	 In the Symbol column, click on the down arrow to the right of every symbol to see the 
number of levels.
12.	For column 1 (black layer), change the value: 0 for all symbols. For column 2 
(colored layer), change the values to Footpath: 1, Field road: 2, Street: 3, 
and Rural road: 4. For column 3 (dashed line), change the value to 5.
13.	Click on OK twice to close the Layer Properties window. Inspect the results.
14.	 Navigate to File | Save as and save your map document as MySymbolLevels.mxd 
at ...\Data\MapDocuments.
You can find the results at ...\Data\MapDocuments\Chapter5\SymbologLevelRoad.
mxd.
How it works...
By selecting Use Symbol Levels, you resolved road intersections of the same type.
In Default View, you saw two options: Join and Merge. Join joined the same symbols that 
were intersecting each other on the map from the same feature class. Merge joined different 
symbols that were intersecting each other on the map.
In Advanced View, you saw the number of symbol layers for every symbol. The number 
indicates the order of drawing layers in ArcMap. Rural road has three symbol layers. The 
black layer has the drawing order 1, the colored layer has the drawing order 2, and the dashed 
line layer has the drawing order 3. This means that the black layer will be drawn first. All the 
other types of roads have only two symbol layers. Also, in Advanced View, there are three 
columns corresponding to the maximum number of layers identified in the feature class. The 
software is assigned by the default number to each symbol layer. These numbers define the 
order of drawing in ArcMap. The layers with the lowest number (0) draw first and the layers with 
highest number draw last (5). You changed the order of drawing at step 12. The Rural road 
will appear at the top of all other roads because it has the last two drawing orders (4 and 5).

select the Symbology tab.
2.	 Open the Symbol Property Editor dialog for the Rural road subtype (click on the 
Edit Symbol button).
3.	 In the Layers panel, select every symbol layer, and for the Line Caps option, check 
Round. Click on OK to close all open dialogs.
4.	 Inspect the results. Save your map documents.
Using representation
In the previous recipes, you worked with traditional symbology. In this recipe, you will use 
advanced techniques to symbolize geographical features on a map. The representation allows 
you to solve different cartographic challenges, such as the overlapping of different symbols. 
With multiple representations for the same feature class, you can obtain different thematic 
maps displayed at different scales while needing only one feature class entry in the Table Of 
Contents section. The representations are the property of the feature class. In the previous 
sections, you depended on the .mxd or .lyr file to keep the symbology for a feature class 
on a map. Both types of files save the path to the physical store of the data and the way you 
choose to symbolize the features. Representations have rules and rules have one or more 
symbol layers. A representation is stored in the feature class and is managed by two fields: 
RuleID and Override. RuleID stores the rules for a representation. Override stores the 
exceptions from the rules. Rules define how it will be symbolized as a feature or a group of 
features (subtypes). Geometry overrides separate symbols to change or move the symbols in 
order to decongest an overfull map area.
Getting ready
You will convert the existing symbology to representation for three feature classes: Bridge, 
RoadL, and LandUse. Also, you will create your own representation marker named Traffic 
Signal and save it in TOPO5000.style.

Working with Symbology
146
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create cartographic representations for Bridge, RoadL, and LandUse:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document Representation.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\Representation. Representation.
mxd uses the TOPO5k.style style file from <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\
Representation.
2.	 In general, a representation of a feature class refers to a given scale. Please 
remember that your product will be a topographic map at the scale 1:5,000. That 
way, Representation.mxd has set 1:5,000 as the reference scale for the size of 
symbols or representations. The reference scale is a property of the data frame.
3.	 To define the reference scale for the data frame and symbols too, first type the scale 
5000 in the Map Scale section. Second, right-click on the Layers data frame and 
navigate to Reference Scale | Set Reference Scale. Use Zoom in or Zoom out to 
see what happens to the size of the symbols. Notice that your symbol size relates  
to the display scale of the data frame. Symbols became smaller at small scales  
(for example, 1:15,000) and bigger at large scales (for example: 1:500).
4.	 To delete the reference scale for the data frame, in the Table Of Contents section, 
right-click on the Layers data frame and navigate to Reference Scale | Clear 
Reference Scale. Use Zoom in or Zoom out to see what happens to the size of the 
symbols without a reference scale for the data frame. Notice that your symbol size 
remains unchanged onscreen at different data frame scales.
5.	 Right-click on the Bridge layer and select Create Symbology to Representation. 
Accept the default parameters and uncheck Add new layer to map symbolized with 
this representation. Click on Convert.
6.	 In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the Bridge layer and navigate to 
Properties | Symbology | Representations.
7.	
There are two sections: Rules and Layers. In the Rules section, there are three rules 
defined by the symbols of subtypes: Examine all the options, You can add or delete 
the rules, and You can modify every rule by adding more layer symbol (point, line, 
and polygon). You can change the graphic characteristics for all the existing layers. 
You can also control the Symbol Levels parameter if you click on the black arrow in 
the bottom-right corner of the Layers section.
8.	 To see the Override field section, select the Fields tab and check the Override 
parameter. Click on OK.
9.	 In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the Bridge layer and select Open 
Attribute Table. Examine all the fields.

Chapter 5
147
10.	 Repeat steps 6 to 8 for RoadL and LandUse layers.
11.	 You will create your own representation marker named My Traffic Signal using 
the Marker Editor tool. The zebra crossing will indicate the pedestrian crossing along 
the Rural road subtype feature.
12.	In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the RoadL layer and navigate to 
Properties | Symbology | Representations. Select the Rural road rule, and in the 
layers section, select the Add new marker Layer button, as shown in the following 
screenshot:
13.	Select the default Marker (a black square), and in Representation Marker Selector, 
select Square from ESRI.style.

Working with Symbology
148
14.	 Select the Properties button and use the Create Line tool from Marker Editor to create 
a triangle with five vertical lines (zebra crossing), as shown in the following screenshot:
15.	After you finish the symbol, click on OK. In Representation Marker Selector, save 
the custom symbol as MyZebraCrossing into TOPO5k.style in the ...\Data\
Representation folder. Select OK to return to the Layer Properties dialog. 
Zebra crossing has already been created in TOPO5k.style\Representation 
Markers.
16.	 Set Size to 8 pt for Zebra crossing marker into the Marker section. In the section 
Along line select black arrow from the right to open the Market Placements dialog. 
Navigate to the option Line input| At extremities and click on OK. For Extremity 
select Just begin. Click OK twice. Inspect the results in Data View.
In the upcoming steps, you will create a geometry effect to the hydrography:
17.	 Double-click on the LandUse layer to open the Layer Properties dialog. Navigate 
to Symbology | Representations and select the Hydrography rule. In the layers 
section select its Line layer and click on the Remove layer button from the bottom of  
the section to remove the line symbol layer.
18.	In the layers section, select the Solid color pattern layer and click on the black plus 
sign to open Geometric Effects. Navigate to Polygon input | Smooth and click on  
OK to return to Layer Properties.
19.	Set Flat tolerance to 2 pt and click on OK twice. Inspect the Hydrography layer to 
see the results.

Chapter 5
149
20.	The Smooth effect doesn't influence the vertices or geometry. To check this, right-
click on the LandUse layer, and navigate to Selection | Make This The Only 
Selectable Layer.
21.	 From the Editor toolbar, start Edit session, and with the Edit tool, select the vector, 
and select the Edit vertices bottom. Visualize the river to see the difference. If you 
want to remove the smooth effect applied to the river feature in Data View, stop the 
Edit session and navigate to Layer Properties | Symbology | Representation. Select 
the Hydrography rule and click on the black arrow from Smooth section to select 
Remove Effect.
22.	In the next steps, you will create overrides for River. Go to Bookmark, select 
Overrides to see the river section. The symbols of the road and river from  
LandUse layer are overlapped.
23.	Start the edit session. Add the Representation toolbar by navigating to Customize | 
Toolbars | Representation. You will use the tools from the Representation toolbar.
24.	 With Direct Select Tool, select the river. All its vertices are selected. With the Shift 
key pressed, click again on the river to unselect all its vertices. With the Shift key 
pressed, select one by one the eight vertices from the overlapping river, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
25.	Select Warp Tool, click on the corner of the road symbol, and drag-and-drop to 
reshape the edge as shown in the preceding screenshot.

Working with Symbology
150
26.	The override doesn't influence the geometry of the feature from LandUse. To check 
this, select the river and click on the Edit Vertices tool to see the vertices of the 
polygon feature.
27.	 Save and stop the edit session. Save your map document as MyRepresentation.
mxd at ...\Data\MapDocuments.
How it works...
Every time you create a representation for a feature class, a domain will be created in your file 
geodatabase. The domain controls representation rules from the RuleID field. The codes of 
the domain have the same values with the defined rules of representation. For example, the 
Bridge feature class uses the domain Bridge_Rep_Rules that has 4 values: 1 for Bridge, 2 
for Small wooden bridge, 3 for Unknown, and -1 for Free Representation.
In ArcMap, you can't convert, create, or modify cartographic representations in the edit mode 
(edit geometry of features). Instead, the overrides can be made during the edit session. When 
you have selected the river edge using Select Tool from the Representation toolbar, you have 
noticed that the selected representations look different than a selected feature using Edit 
Tool from the Edit toolbar. The reshaping of a representation doesn't influence the geometry 
of a feature. The shape or position of representation can be different from the original shape 
of the feature.
You can create, change, or delete the representations of the feature class in the ArcCatalog 
context menu or use the tools by navigating to ArcToolbox | Cartography Tools | 
Representation Management.
There's more...
The trees, thorny shrub, vineyard, and other marker symbols are cut off at the edge of the 
feature in LandUse. Follow these steps to resolve the problem marker symbols:
1.	 In the Table Of Contents section, double-click on the LandUse layer.
2.	 Click on [2] Forest Rule, select the first marker layer, and in the Inside Polygon  
section, go to Clipping, and select Whole markers cross boundary or No markers 
touch boundary.
3.	 Repeat the steps for every rule of the LandUse_Rep representation and see the 
changes in Data View.
However, still there is a problem: the trees symbol overlaps the Footpath subtype 
from RoadL. You will use Free Representation to isolate the marker symbol from 
Forest rule to change the position of each symbol. Follow these steps to use free 
representation to move the trees away from the footpath:
4.	 Start the edit session. From the Representation toolbar, click on Select Tool, and 
select the forest.

Chapter 5
151
5.	 Navigate to Representation | Free Representation | Convert to Free 
Representation. Keep the forest selected. Navigate to Representation | Free 
Representation | Edit Free Representation. Please remember that Forest rule  
has two Marker layers: Coniferous and Deciduous.
6.	 With the Select Part tool from the right-hand side, select the whole forest.
7.	
Select Marker (Coniferous), and with the Select Part tool activated, right-click on 
the selected forest and choose Separate Symbols Layers, as shown in the following 
screenshot:
8.	 Right-click again and choose Convert Effect to Geometry. Right-click again and 
choose Explode Multi-part Geometry. Now, you can select every coniferous tree  
from the forest. You can move or change the size of every tree individually.
9.	 Repeat steps 6 to 8 for the Deciduous tree symbol.
10.	 Click on OK to close the Free Representation Editor window. Save and stop the  
edit session. Save your map document.

Introduction
In map design, a cartographer is not only thinking about the symbol of geographic feature 
but also its attributes. The descriptive text for features can vary in graphic characteristics in 
order to emphasize the differences, hierarchy, and importance of the features. The overall 
appearance and message of the map can be significantly affected by text characteristics, 
such as fonts, style (for example, italic, bold, and so on), character spacing, leading (space 
between lines in a block text), callouts and halos, fields used for labeling size, color, shape, 
position relative to the features, or display scale of the text. You can add descriptive text to 
your map using dynamic labels, annotations, and graphic text.
The dynamic labels are based on attribute values and are stored as a property of a layer  
in a map document, as a part of a map layer (.lyr), layer package (.lpk), or map  
package (.mpk). The dynamic labels are created using the Standard Label Engine or  
the Maplex Label Engine.

Building Better Maps
154
The labels can be converted into annotations. The annotation makes your text editable (for 
example, font, size, position, text string, and so on). The annotation stores the text string, 
position, and display properties of the text. There are two types of annotations:
f
f
Map document annotation (annotation group) stored in the map document (.mxd)  
as a property of the data frame
f
f
Geodatabase annotation: standard annotation (not feature-linked) and  
feature-linked annotation
The graphic text is created for individual features using the Text tools from the Draw toolbar. 
The graphic text can be created based on the feature attribute but is not tied to the attribute 
value (for example, if the attribute is changed, the text is not updated). The graphic text is 
stored as a map annotation group in the map document.
In this chapter, you'll use advanced tools to create labels and annotations. In addition to this, 
you will display the height values with a visual effect for the contour lines. Finally, you will 
learn how to map quantitative data to create a bivariate map.

Getting ready
In this recipe, you will use the Draw toolbar to add a graphic text for the 
TriangulationPoint feature class, and the Labeling toolbar to create dynamic labels for 
the Elevation and ContourLine feature classes, as shown in the following screenshot:
From the Labeling toolbar, you will work with Label Manager in the Standard Label Engine 
mode. The Label Manager dialog has two levels: feature class level and label class level. At 
the Feature Class level, you have two sections: Add label class and Add label classes from 
symbology categories. At the Label Class level, you have three main sections: Text String, 
Text Symbol, and Placement Properties. There are also three important buttons: Scale 
Range, SQL Query, and Label Styles.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to add a graphic text and dynamic labels:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document, Label.mxd, from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\LabelingMaplex.
2.	 Load the Draw and Labeling toolbars. You will add text for a triangulation point 
feature from the TriangulationPoint layer using the Rectangle Text tool from 
the Draw toolbar, as shown in the preceding screenshot.

Building Better Maps
156
3.	 Next to the point feature, draw a small rectangle. With the Select Elements tool from 
the Tools toolbar, right-click on the rectangle, and navigate to Properties | Text. In 
the Text section, type 8, create a new line using the Enter key, and type 242.59  
on the second text line. Navigate to Change Symbol | Style References, add ... 
\Data\TOPO5000.style to the Symbol Selector list. Select the Geodetic Network 
text symbol. At this point, you can modify the symbol properties and save it in 
TOPO5k.style with a different name.
4.	 Click on OK and on Apply to update the changes. Select the Frame tab and set 
Border: None. Click on Apply. Select the Size and Position tabs, and set Width: 90 
and Height: 65. Click on Apply and on OK to return to Data View.
5.	 With the Select Elements tool, select and move the rectangle to the best placement 
from the cartographic point of view (for example, to the right-hand side of the point 
feature and slightly above the point).
In the next steps, you will create dynamic labels for the Elevation and 
ContourLine layers. From the Labeling toolbar, you will work with Label Manager 
in the Standard Label Engine mode, as shown in the following screenshot:

The Label Manager dialog has two levels: feature class level and label class level. 
At the Feature Class level, you have two sections: the Add label class and Add 
label classes from symbology categories. At the Label Class level, you have three 
main sections: Text String, Text Symbol, and Placement Properties. The steps are 
explained as follows:
6.	 Open the Label Manager dialog, check Elevation from the left-hand side of the 
dialog, and select the Default label class. Click on Expression and create the 
following expression: FormatNumber([Elevation],1). Click on Verify to check 
the expression, and click on OK. Click on Apply to update the settings and on OK to 
return to Data View. Inspect the results.
7.	
Return to the Label Manager dialog, check, and select the ContourLine feature 
class. In the Add label classes from the symbology categories section, there are 
five default label classes that correspond to the CNT (Type of contour line) 
subtypes filed. Keep checked only Index contour line and Intermediate 
contour line. Click on the Add button. Read carefully the warning message, and 
select No.
8.	 Every new label class inherits the characteristics of the Default label class. As the 
new label classes are created based on the subtypes, the groups are already defined 
in the SQL Query dialog.
9.	 Select the Default label class, click on SQL Query, and type the following 
expression: CNT <> 1 AND CNT <> 2. Click on Verify to check the expression. 
Click on OK. The Default label class will create labels for all subtypes except Index 
contour line (1) and Intermediate contour line (2).
10.	 Select the Index contour line label class and set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Label Field: Set this to Elevation
Â
Â
Text Symbol: Set this to Arial, 5 and Bold
Â
Â
Symbol: Set this to Elevation
Â
Â
Edit Symbol | Mask | Halo: Set the Size parameter 6 to 0.2 and Fill Color 
to White
Â
Â
Placement Properties | Orientation: Set this to Parallel
Â
Â
Placement Properties | Position: Set this to On the line
Â
Â
Properties | Duplicate Labels: Set this to Place one label per feature part
11.	 Accept the default settings for the remaining parameters. Click on OK.
12.	Select the Intermediate contour line label class and repeat step 9, as shown 
in the preceding screenshot.

13.	Click on Scale Range to define the display range of the scale for the intermediate 
contour labels.
Because the precision of topographic datasets corresponding to the scale  
1:5,000 and the intermediate contour are not labeled on a classical map, you  
will set a minimum and maximum scale to display the labels, as explained in the 
following steps:
14.	 Select Don't show labels when zoomed, and set Out beyond: 4990 and In beyond: 
1000. Click on OK twice to close the dialog windows.
15.	Explore the results. To fix the dimensions of the labels for the scale 1:5,000, select 
1:5,000 on the Standard toolbar and right-click on the Layers data frame and 
navigate to Reference Scale | Set Reference Scale.
16.	 Use the Lock Labels and View Unplaced Labels options from the Labeling toolbar to 
fix the position of dynamic labels and see the unplaced labels.
17.	 Save your map as MyLabel.mxd at ...\Data\MapDocuments.
You can find the results at ...\Data\MapDocuments\Chapter6\LabelFinal.mxd.
How it works...
The graphic text created at step 3 is stored in the annotation default group as a property 
of the Topographic map 1:5,000 data frame by navigating to View | Data Frame 
Properties | Annotation Groups. If you lose or damage the .mxd file, your individual graphic 
text will be lost too. The dynamic labels created are the property of the Elevation and 
ContourLine layers and can be stored in the Label.mxd map document or the .lyr file.
FormatNumber() is a VBScript function that returns a number. This function has one 
required parameter (expression) and four optional parameters. You used only the first  
optional parameter named NumDigAfterDec to define one decimal place for the  
numeric number format.
For the ContourLine layer, you have to use label classes to create three different label styles 
for three different groups of features.
A common mistake is to forget to define the group of features that will be labeled by the  
label classes.
If you want to see the mask of labels, in the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the 
Layers data frame, navigate to Properties | Data Frame | Background, and select a color.

To learn how to better control the dynamic labels using Maplex Label Engine, please 
refer to the next Labeling with Maplex Label Engine recipe
Labeling with Maplex Label Engine
In the previous recipe, you worked with the Standard Label Engine parameter. In this recipe, 
you will use the Maplex Label Engine parameter to create high-quality dynamic labels. The 
dynamic labels will be placed and oriented on the map based on criteria such as best fitting, 
density, or priority and weight rankings for features and labels that are overlapping.
The Maplex Label Engine parameter allows you to control the displayed text of the label using 
the Abbreviation Dictionary tool.
There are three types of abbreviations:
f
f
Translation: The value of the label will be replaced with a custom one; the 
abbreviation is used whether there is space or not to display the label (for example, A 
can be used in place of Arable).
f
f
Keyword: This will return an acronym formed by the first letter of each word from the 
label; the abbreviation is used only if there is not enough space to display the label (for 
example, DA in place of Dwelling Annex or GSG in place of Gibson Square Gardens).
f
f
Ending: This abbreviates the last word from the label; the abbreviation is used only if 
there is not enough space to display the full label (for example, Oldhill St in place of 
Oldhill Street).
For instance, you can use the Abbreviation Dictionary tool to translate the label values into 
another language without changing the structure of the attribute table or field values.

How it works...
You worked with two abbreviation dictionaries that renamed your subtype codes from the 
Buildings and LandUse feature classes without changing the values in attribute fields. 
When you use Label Priority Ranking, you define which label classes have higher priority and 
which have lower priority in displaying on the map. When you use Label Weight Ranking, you 
define the label position relative to other features or labels in order to minimize overlapping in 
displaying on the map.
Priority and weight ranking influences the labeling speed because the ArcMap label engine 
evaluates the location of features before placing the labels, and based on label conflict 
detection and space availability, labels are rearranged every time you use Full Extend, Pan, 
Zoom In, and Zoom Out.
There's more...
As you might have already noticed, some labels are too small to read clearly, especially for 
dwellings. Go to the Windows menu and select Magnifier to see your labels at different 
scales. Explore the results on the map using your magnifier window. You can change the 
zoom, or you can set a specific scale by selecting the black arrow from the right-hand side 
of the Magnifier window. Select Properties and make your own changes. Also, you can add 
more magnifier windows.
Creating and editing annotation
In this recipe, you will convert your high-quality, dynamic labels created with Maplex Label 
Engine into a geodatabase annotation feature class. A geodatabase annotation feature class 
is another type of feature class stored in a feature dataset inside the geodatabase. There are 
two types of annotation feature classes:
f
f
Not feature-linked annotation feature class (standard)
Â
Â
They are stored as independent pieces of text
Â
Â
Only if text has been derived from the attributes of a feature, annotations are 
not tied to the attribute value (if the attribute value is changed, the text is  
not updated)
Â
Â
If you move or erase a feature, the annotation will remain the same
f
f
Feature-linked annotation feature class
Â
Â
They are generated based on feature attributes

Chapter 6
165
Â
Â
It is a composite relationship class with 1-M cardinality between a feature 
class as the origin table and an annotation feature class as the destination 
table, using the OBJECTID field as the primary key and the FeatureID field 
as the foreign key
Â
Â
If you move a feature, the annotation will move with the feature
Â
Â
If you erase a feature, the annotation will be erased too
Â
Â
If you change the attribute value for a feature, the feature-linked annotation 
text will be changed
Getting ready
Firstly, you will improve the position of labels for Elevation and ContourLine using 
Maplex Label Engine. After that, you will create a standard annotation feature class and two 
feature-linked annotation feature classes for the reference scale 1:5,000.
For the Buildings feature class, you will create a feature-linked annotation feature class for 
the reference scale 1:500, as shown in the following screenshot:
In the last part, you will edit the annotation features to correct the position, dimension, and 
other graphic characteristics of the annotation text.

Building Better Maps
166
How to do it...
Follow these steps to convert dynamic labels to geodatabase annotations:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document Annotation.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\Annotation.
2.	 Load the Labeling toolbar and check whether the Use Maplex Label Engine option is 
selected. Open Label Manager and set the Elevation parameter to the Default 
label class for the feature class. In the Placement Properties section, set Position 
as Best Position. Navigate to Properties | Conflict Resolution, and check 
Background Label (placed first) and Never remove (place overlapping).  
Click on OK and on Apply.
3.	 For the ContourLine layer, right-click on the Default label class, and select Delete 
Class. Delete also the Intermediate label class. Select the Index contour 
line label class and navigate to Placement Properties | Contour Placement. 
Navigate to Properties | Label Position | Options, and check Uphill alignment and 
No Laddering. Click on OK.
Using the Uphill alignment option, you will label contour lines in accordance with 
topographic principles about the representation of landforms and terrain features  
by contours.
4.	 For Label Density, check Repeat label, and select its Options. Set Minimum 
Repetition Interval: 1000 Map Units to have a reasonable density of labels per 
contour line for a topographic map at the scale 1:5,000. For Conflict Resolution, 
check Never Remove (place overlapping). Click on OK to return to the Label 
Manager dialog window and click on Apply.
5.	 Inspect the remaining label classes. Click on OK to close the Label Manager option.
6.	 Select the Pan tool and drag the map to redraw the position of labels in the Label 
to Annotation data frame. Even if it slows down the drawing of the dynamic 
labels, set the placement quality to Best (the Labeling toolbar). Check the Label 
Weight Ranking parameter to see that LandUse is set to Transportation and 
Hydrography. Set Feature Weight of 1000 to constrain the labels not to be placed 
on the road or river polygons.
Before converting dynamic labels to annotations, you have to define the reference 
scale for the annotation. An annotation uses the reference scale for the current data 
frame. If the reference scale for the data frame is not defined, the annotation will use 
the display scale of the current data frame by navigating to Standard | Map Scale 
and set it to 5000 before converting labels to annotations. Let's create a standard 
annotation feature class by performing the following steps:

Chapter 6
167
7.	
Set the reference scale for the data frame to the scale 1:5,000. In the Table Of 
Contents section, right-click on the Elevation layer, and select Convert Labels  
to Annotation. Set the parameters, as shown in the following screenshot:
Because of the overlapping conflicts, some labels will be hidden. The Convert 
unplaced labels to unplaced annotation option will transform the unplaced 
labels too. The In the map option means that your annotation will be stored as 
Annotation Group associated to the Elevation layer. The annotation will be 
stored in the map document (.mxd) as a property of  your current data frame.
8.	 Click on Convert. The ElevationAnnotation layer has been automatically added 
in the Table Of Contents section. Notice that dynamic labels of the Elevation layer 
have been deactivated in Label Manager.

168
Let's create three feature-linked annotations for the ContourLine, LandUse, and 
Buildings layers, as shown in the following screenshot:
9.	 For the Buildings layer, set the reference scale to 1:500. After you create  
the 1:500 annotation for the Buildings layer, navigate to Reference Scale |  
Clear Reference Scale.
10.	 Now, you have four annotation feature classes. Explore the results in Data View using 
the Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Pan tools.
In the next steps, you will change the position and the size of one dwelling annotation 
from the BuildingsAnnotation layer:
11.	 Start the editing session. By default, you have the Edit Annotation Tool parameter on 
the Editor toolbar. To add more annotation tools, click on the drop-down arrow from 
the right-hand  side of the Editor toolbar, and select Customize. Select Commands 
and for Show commands containing, type anno. Click and drag the Unplaced 
Annotation and Construct Annotation with A Leader Line tools to the Editor toolbar. 
Click on Close.
12.	Click on the Unplaced Annotation Window tool and in the Show section, select 
BuildingsAnnotation as the Dwelling annotation class.
The Unplaced Annotation window shows three columns: Text, Class (annotation 
class), and FID Linked (the OBJECTID value of the linked dwelling feature that is 
related to the annotation feature). 

Chapter 6
169
13.	Uncheck Visible Extent and check Draw to see the unplaced annotations in a 
red outline rectangular. Click on Search Now and right-click on the first unplaced 
annotation to choose Zoom to Feature. Right-click again on the selected annotation 
and choose Place Annotation to change the annotation status as Placed, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
14.	 Your annotation list can be slightly different. You can set the Placed status for 
unplaced annotations in the BuildingsAnnotation attribute table. The status is 
stored in the Status field that has assigned the AnnotationStatus domain.
In the next steps, you will edit the annotation, as shown in the upcoming screenshot:
15.	Select the previous annotation with the Edit Annotation Tool parameter and click on 
the Attributes button. In the Attributes dialog, click on the Expand All Relationships 
In Branch button. Explore the attribute fields of the annotation feature and the 
related-dwelling feature from the Buildings feature class.
16.	 Select the related building feature and change the Stories value to 10. The text 
from the annotation feature class is immediately updated because the annotation is 
linked to the dwelling feature.

Building Better Maps
170
17.	 Select the annotation feature and click on the Annotation tab. Split the single text 
line into three different lines. Select the Leader button and choose Simple Line 
Callout. Click on OK and on Apply. Select the annotation and move outside the 
polygon boundary to see the leader line.
Let's add a new annotation to your building. To quickly view the OBJECTID value 
from the Buildings layer, navigate to its Layer Properties | Display and set Field: 
OBJECTID and Show MapTips using the display expression.
18.	From the Editor toolbar, select the Create Features tool. Set 
BuildingsAnnotation as the AB Dwelling feature, choose Construction 
Tools, and set it as the Leader tool. In the Annotation Construction window, type 
demolished in 2012. Your mouse pointer has a small cross with the custom text. 
Click your pointer on the building to create the annotation as shown in the following 
screenshot:

Chapter 6
171
19.	To create a feature-linked annotation, you have to edit the FeatureID field with the 
building OBJECTID value. Save the edit by navigating to Editor | Save Edits.
Let's test the relationship between the Buildings and BuildingsAnnotation 
layers, as follows:
20.	With the Edit tool, select and right-click on the related building and choose Delete. 
The buildings and the two related annotations from BuildingsAnnotation will be 
erased too.
21.	 Undo the last action by navigating to the Standard toolbar | Undo Delete Feature 
tool. Select the building and move to a new location. The two related annotations will 
be moved too.
22.	Save your map as MyAnnotations.mxd at ...\Data\MapDocuments.
You can find the results at ...\Data\MapDocuments\Chapter6\AnnotationFinal.mxd.
How it works...
If you have two data frames in a map document and erase one of them, you will lose all map 
annotation groups that are associated with that data frame. If you save the labels in the map 
document as an annotation group, the unplaced dynamic labels will be reported as Overflow 
Annotation. To keep an overflow annotation in a map document, right-click on the annotation, 
and choose Add Annotation.

Building Better Maps
172
While converting labels to the annotation feature class, the annotation is automatically added 
in the Table Of Contents section. Notice that all annotations (standard or feature-linked) have 
annotation classes created from the label classes. These annotation classes are stored in the 
geodatabase as subtypes in the AnnotationClassID subtype field. Examine in ArcCatalog 
the properties of the standard and feature-linked annotation feature classes you just created.
If you made a mistake, you can erase the existing annotation class and create another one. You 
can also create many annotation feature classes for the same feature class. This can be useful 
if you are creating different thematic maps at different scales for the same dataset. If you decide 
to combine all annotation feature classes in one, you will have two options: check Append from 
the Convert Labels to Annotation dialog, or use the Append Annotation Feature Classes tool 
by navigating to ArcToolbox | Data Management Tools | Feature Class.
An annotation created from standard dynamic labels cannot combine with 
an annotation created with Maplex Label Engine. Both annotations must 
use labels that are created with the same label engine. Two feature-linked 
annotation feature classes created for the same feature class can be 
combined in a single one. A new, empty annotation feature class can be 
created with ArcCatalog, at the geodatabase level or the feature dataset 
level and edited in ArcMap.
The annotation feature class is stored as a polygon feature class. The polygon representing 
the outline of the annotation can be resized, rotated, flipped, curved (edit the Base Line 
Sketch parameter), and converted into multiple parts. The curve annotation has vertices that 
can be deleted, added, or moved. To make all these changes, select annotation, and right-
click to choose the edit options.
There's more...
You might have noticed in the Table Of Contents section a new symbol on the left-hand side 
of the annotation classes when you use Zoom In or Zoom Out. This square with a double 
base indicates that the annotation class will not be drawn because it is out of the scale range 
already defined for the dynamic label class and inherited by the annotation class. You can 
change this restriction by right-clicking on the annotation class and selecting the Visible Scale 
Range parameter.

Explore the ContourLineAnnotation layer with the Magnifier tool at the reference 
scale of 1:5,000. There are some values with small segments between the digits. To 
learn how to use annotation in this cartographic issue, please refer to the next Using 
annotation and masking for contours recipe.

Chapter 6
173
Using annotation and masking for contours
According to the commonly used rules in a topographic map, all contour lines should be 
interrupted beneath the elevation information. In this recipe, you will learn how to use the 
geodatabase annotation to display the elevation value with a visual effect for contours.
Getting ready
In this section, you will display on a topographic map at the scale of 1:5,000 the elevation 
value for the contour lines and elevation points as shown in the following screenshot:
Firstly, you will create an annotation feature class that stores the point and index contour line 
elevation. Secondly, you will use the Feature Outline Masks tool by navigating to ArcToolbox 
| Cartography Tools | Masking Tools to obtain an intermediary polygon feature class that 
contains the mask (a polygon created around the text) for the annotations. Finally, based on 
the mask layer, you will create a visual discontinuity for index contour lines in accordance with 
the position of the annotation for contour lines and elevation points.

Building Better Maps
174
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create labels for contour lines and elevation points:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document AnnoMaskAdvancedDraw.mxd 
from <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\Annotation.
2.	 Navigate to the Labeling | Label Manager dialog box. Inspect the label settings for 
the Elevation and ContourLine layers.
3.	 Uncheck the white halo for the ContourLine: Index contour line label class 
by navigating to Text Symbol | Symbol | Edit Symbol | Mask and set it to None. 
Keep clicking on OK until all the dialog windows are closed.
4.	 To analyze the position and dimensions of the labels, navigate to Reference Scale | 
Set Reference Scale, and set it to 1:5,000 for the current data frame. Then  
navigate to the Labeling | Lock Labels tool to hold the convenient position of  
the displayed labels.
Let's create a single standard annotation called ElevationContourAnnotation 
that will store the annotation features for both the Elevation and ContourLine 
layers by performing the following steps:
5.	 Right-click on the Elevation layer and select Convert Labels to Annotation. Set the 
parameters, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 6
175
6.	 Click on Convert. Right-click on the ContourLine layer and select Convert Labels to 
Annotation. Set the parameters, as shown in the following screenshot:
7.	
Check the Append option to store the annotation features in the existing 
ElevationContourAnnotation geodatabase annotation. Click on Convert.
8.	 Check and correct the position of the annotations in Data View if it's necessary.
9.	 Open ArcToolbox and navigate to Cartography Tools | Masking Tools. Double-click 
on the Feature Outline Masks parameter, and set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Input layer: ElevationContourAnnotation
Â
Â
Output Feature Class: TOPO5000.gdb\Relief\Mask
Â
Â
Margin (optional): 2.5 Meters
10.	 Leave unchanged the remaining default options. Click on OK.
11.	 In the Table Of Contents section, turn off the Mask layer. Right-click on the current 
Layers data frame and select Advanced Drawing Options. Check Draw using 
specified masking options. For Masking Layers: Mask, check Masked Layers: 
ContourLine. For Masking Layers: WatercourseA, check Masked Layers: 
WatercourseL. Click on Apply and on OK.
12.	Explore the results. Save your map as MyMaskAnnotations.mxd at ...\Data\
MapDocuments.
You can find the results at ...\Data\MapDocuments\Chapter6\

176
How it works...
When an ElevationContourAnnotation feature annotation is moved, the corresponding 
feature from Mask will not automatically move. You have to move the polygon mask to align 
with the annotation feature. The Advanced Drawing Options parameter is the property of 
data frame, and for this reason, you have to keep the mask layer in the current data frame 
from your map document (.mxd file). Saving the ContourLine as a layer file doesn't 
help to keep the visual effect for contour line features.
Creating a bivariate map
In this recipe, you will display two quantitative attributes of a single feature class. The  
result of displaying two attributes at the same time for a polygon feature class is called  
a bivariate map.
Getting ready
In this section, you will use the Census feature class to create a quantitative bivariate map 
that analyzes two variables from the census data: NoEducation (number of persons with no 
education) and Unemployment (unemployment rate).
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a bivariate map using the Quantity by Category option:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open a new map document. In the Table Of Contents section, right-
click on the data frame called Layers, select New Group Layer, rename it by selecting 
the new group layer, and type Multiple Attributes/Quantity by category.
2.	 Right-click on the group layer and select Add Data. Load the Census2010 feature 
class from ...\Data\TOPO5000.gdb\Boundaries.
3.	 To display only the subset of features that have the census information, right-click 
on the Census layer, and navigate to Properties | Definition Query | Query Builder. 
Build the following expression: PopulationOver10 <> 0. Click on Apply.
4.	 Click on the Symbology tab and navigate to Multiple Attributes | Quantity by 
category. In the Value Fields section, select the first field Unemployment and the 
second field NoEducation. Click on the Add All Values tab and uncheck the  
<All other values> option.

Chapter 6
177
Let's group the Values option in four classes based on the Unemployment  
field values, as follows:
5.	 Select all values 4 (4, 18166; 4, 13173; 4, 13879; 4, 8462), right-click on the 
selected values, and choose Group Values, as shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Repeat step 5 to group values 5, 6 and (7-8). You obtained four new classes. Click on 
Apply. Set Color Scheme: Errors color ramp and click on the Value field to choose 
Reverse Sorting.
7.	
Navigate to Variation by | Color Ramp. Set Value: NoEducation, navigate to 
Classification | Natural Breaks (Jenks) | Classes, and set it to 4. Click on OK. For 
Color Ramp, choose Cyan-Light to Blue-Dark. On the Value field, click on and 
choose Reverse Sorting. On the Symbol field, click on and choose Flip Symbols.
8.	 Click on OK to close the dialog box and on Apply to see the updates in Data View. 
Edit <Heading> Label: Unemployment/NoEducation. Click on Apply and on OK.

10.	 The Legend option generated on your map doesn't look good. Right-click on the 
Legend option, and navigate to Properties | Items tab | Style button | Legend Item 
Selector. Select the Horizontal Single Symbol Description Only parameter, and  
click on OK. Click on Apply to see the legend updates.
11.	 Select the Layout tab and check the Right to left reading option to switch the matrix. 
Click on Apply to see the matrix update. Click on OK to return to Layout View.
12.	You can insert text by navigating to Insert menu | Text to describe the two axes, as 
shown in the following screenshot:

13.	Navigate to Standard toolbar | Select Element to select the text or legend elements. 
Explore the results. Save your map as MyBivariateMap.mxd at ...\Data\
MapDocuments.
You can find the results at ...\Data\MapDocuments\Chapter6\BivariateMap.mxd.
How it works...
You grouped the displayed features in four categories of unemployment rates (7-8 percent, 6 
percent, 5 percent, and 4 percent). Every category of unemployment rate groups the number 
of persons with no education into four quantitative classes based on the natural grouping of 
NoEducation field values. Based on the sixteen groups, you created a legend color matrix 
with four rows and four columns.
The four categories of unemployment rate are symbolized by the Error ramp scheme.
The four quantitative classes representing the number of persons with no education are 
symbolized with the Cyan-Light to Blue-Dark color ramp (step 7).
The Quantity by category classification creates the final symbol, that of colors, by keeping 
the Hue from the first symbology (Error ramp scheme) and adds Saturation and Value from 
the secondary symbology (Cyan-Light to Blue-Dark). You can check this using the Eye 
Dropper tool and the Color Selector tool (RGB and HSV color space).

Creating a map layout
A map layout is a final map product created in Layout View that can be shared with other 
users. A map layout is designed for digital view or print. Layout View is the map design 
environment in ArcGIS.
The main map elements are map body, graticule, scale bar, scale text, north arrow, legend, 
title, and map border. Some details regarding the map projection, contour interval (for a 
topographic map), source of data, name of the organization, and some explanatory notes will 
support the main message of a map.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will design a thematic poster that presents a topographic map at the scale 
1:5,000. Your poster will contain three data frames and a title, scale, legend, and dynamic 
text. The following table describes the shape and size of an old paper map:
Scale

You have the final poster in PDF format at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\
ExportingMaps\FinalMapLayout.pdf. Please use this example while you work with the 
exercise from the next section.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a map layout using ArcMap:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document MapLayout.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\ExportingMaps.
2.	 To prepare the map data for print, you have to create a map layout in Layout View. 
Switch from Data View to Layout View by selecting View | Layout View.
A new toolbar has automatically been added: Layout toolbar. The tools on this toolbar 
can be used only in Layout View. To select, move, and resize the map elements 
on your map layout, you will use the Select Elements tool from the Tools toolbar. A 
selected map element will be outlined in blue and will have eight selection handles. If 
you place the mouse pointer over one blue selection handle, you will be able to resize 
the map element. Right-click on any selected map elements to change its properties.
3.	 Before starting work on your map layout, define the virtual page size. From File | 
Page and Print Setup | Map Page Size, uncheck Use Printer Paper Settings. For 
Page, select Custom as Standard Sizes. For Width, type 80, and for Height, type 
115. For Orientation, select Portrait. Click on OK.
Layout View has two rulers: at the top and on the side of the virtual page. Let's adjust 
them:

tool. Notice that your data frame is resized and moved. Also, the scale box on the 
Standard toolbar and Zoom In / Zoom Out / Full Extent on the Tools toolbar are 
gray. This indicates that the map scale value is locked.
8.	 Let's align the data to the data frame edge. To zoom the map layout, select Zoom In 
on the Layout toolbar (step 1) and draw a box that includes the top left corner of the 
data frame. Use the Pan tool on the Tools toolbar (step 2) to move the data in the 
data frame (step 3). The zoom tools on the Layout toolbar will not change the scale 
and map the extent of your data frame. Repeat the steps until the data is aligned to 
the edge of the data frame.

you change the dimension of the Romania Pulkovo 1942 data frame, the red 
rectangle will be updated to the new extent.
Continue to add more map elements on your map layout to fill the center gap or to 
improve the final poster.
In the next steps, you will save your map and set up the printer:
42.	Save the map document as MyMapLayout.mxd at Data\ExportingMaps.
43.	Go to Page and Print Setup, and for Printer Setup | Name, choose a large format 
printer (plotter).
44.	For Paper Size, select a proper printer paper size in accordance with the size of your 
map layout. Make sure Orientation | Portrait is checked. For Map Page | Size, 
check Use Printer Paper Settings and Show Printer Margins on Layout. Uncheck 
Scale Map Elements. Click on OK. 
45.	Navigate to File | Print, and for Printer Engine, choose Windows Printer. Set Output 
Image Quality to Normal. Click on OK. Before starting to print, go to File | Print 
Preview to check the final details.
How it works...
It is good practice to use a fixed scale for a data frame when you are working on a  
map layout. 
Dragging the data in a map layout will not change the coordinates of your data.
By default, all inserted map elements will appear on the center of the graphic area.
You have noticed that the edges of your extent are curved. This is because the Romania 
Pulkovo 1942 data frame has defined a projected coordinate system and the Europe 
ETRS89 data frame has defined a geographic coordinate system.

Chapter 7
195
If you have the same coordinate system (geographic or projected) for 
both data frames, then the extent will be straight.
The total length of your scale bar should not exceed a third of the width of your data frame. 
The When resizing | Adjust number of divisions option will update the number of divisions 
and will keep the distance represented by each division when you decide to change the length 
of your scale from 1:5,000.
You have already worked with an active data frame in Chapter 3, Working with CRS. If you 
select the data frame in the map layout, the name of the activated data frame is indicated 
with bold letters in the Table Of Contents section. When you work with multiple data frames in 
a map layout, always look at the state of data frames in the Table Of Contents section.
There's more...
A template contains a designed map layout with one or more data frames. A template can 
contain data as basemap layers. Every new map document is based on a normal template 
that contains a single empty data frame. The normal template is the Blank Map saved as 
Normal.mxt at %AppData%\ESRI\Desktop10.2\ArcMap\Templates. A map document 
mxd can be used as a map template. 
You will create your own template to save time when you create another map at the scale 
1:5,000 with the same components. Your custom template will contain Europe.lyr as a 
basemap layer and all map elements from the previous section:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open an existing map document Template.mxd from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\ExportingMaps. The map document contains three 
data frames. Only the Europe ETRS89 data frame contains data. Notice the source 
of data. Close ArcMap.
2.	 In Windows Explorer, right-click on the Template.mxd ArcGIS ArcMap document, 
and choose Copy. Go to %AppData%\Roaming\ESRI\Desktop10.2\ArcMap\
Templates and create a new folder, Custom templates. In this empty folder, 
right-click and choose Paste.
Because your template map contains a basemap layer, save Template.
mxd from %AppData%\Roaming\ESRI\Desktop10.2\ArcMap\
Templates with relative pathnames. Open your template map with 
ArcMap, set the data source, and select File | Map Document | Properties. 
Check the Store relative pathnames to data source option.

3.	 Open ArcMap. In the ArcMap-Getting Started dialog, go to New Maps | My 
Templates | Custom Templates, and choose Template. Click on OK.
4.	 In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the Topographic Map 1:5,000 
data frame, and select Activate. Add the LandUse feature class from ...\Data\
TOPO5000.gdb\LandUse.
5.	 Notice the update from the map layout. Save your map document as MyNewMap.mxd.
If you want all users of system to use a standardized template, copy TemplateAllUsers.
mxd to a new folder named MyOrganization at <ArcGIS_HOME>\Desktop10.2\
MapTemplates.
Next time, when you open ArcMap, you will get the following structure:
Notice that the TemplateAllUsers.mxd template doesn't have data. The template contains 
only three empty data frames and specific map elements.

Exporting your map to the PDF and GeoTIFF 
formats
Even if your colleagues don't have ArcGIS, you still can share your map with them. You can 
export your map in:
f
f
Raster format: This includes bitmap, Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), and Joint 
Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
f
f
Vector format: This includes Enhanced Metafile (EMF), Encapsulated PostScript 
(EPS), Adobe Illustrator (AI), and Portable Document Format (PDF)
Getting ready
PDF is a vector-based file format that supports the information coming for vector and raster 
sources. Use Adobe Reader to view the results of this recipe. You can download the software 
for free from www.adobe.com.
TIFF is a raster-based file format used mainly to store raster images. GeoTIFF is TIFF with the 
coordinate reference system embedded. It is used to store data such as aerial photography, 
satellite images, terrain digital elevation models, or scanned old maps.

How to do it...
Follow these steps to export your map to a PDF format using ArcMap:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open an existing map document FinalMapLayout.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\ ExportingMaps\MyResults.
2.	 Select File | Export Map. For the Save As type, select the PDF (*.pdf) format. For 
File name, type MyTopographicMap300dpi.
3.	 Select the General tab. For Resolution, keep the default resolution: 300 dots per 
inch (dpi). Set Output Image Quality to Normal.

Exporting Your Maps
198
4.	 Select the Format tab. Select RGB for Destination Colorspace because you intend to 
use a laser printer for a quick preview of the results. If you intend to use commercial 
offset printing, you should use CMYK. See the There's more... part of the Modifying 
symbols recipe of Chapter 5, Working with Symbology. Make sure Embed All 
Document Fonts is checked. Accept all other default options.
5.	 Select the Advanced tab. For Layers and Attributes, select Export PDF Layers and 
Feature Attributes. Check Export Map Georeference Information to access the 
georeference information from the PDF file. Click on Save.
6.	 Repeat the steps for a PDF with 72 dpi and save it as MyTopographicMap72dpi.
7.	
Open the files with Adobe Reader. To see the layers and attributes of the features 
from your map, go to View | Show/Hide | Navigation Panel | Layers and Tree View. 
To see the geographic coordinates, go to Tools | Analyze, and select the Geospatial 
Location tool.
To save your map layout to a Layout GeoTIFF (*.tiff) file, you will need the Esri Production 
Mapping extension. This extension will allow you to check the following options: Write World 
File and Write GeoTIFF Tags. You also have a Production tab, where you can choose which 
data frame will define the coordinate reference system of the GeoTIFF file. GeoTIFF supports 
only one CRS at one point of time. Remember that your map layout contains three data 
frames with two different coordinate reference systems. If you don't have the extension, you 
can save as a TIFF, as follows:
1.	 Navigate to File | Export Map. For Save As, select the TIFF (*.pdf) format. For File 
name, type MyTopographicMap72dpi.
2.	 Select the General tab. For Resolution, type 72 dpi. Accept the default number of 
pixels. Accept all other default parameters. Click on Save.
3.	 Repeat the steps for a TIFF file with 300 dpi and save it as 
MyTopographicMap300dpi.
Compare the file size in Windows Explorer of the four files and notice the quality of maps.
How it works...
When you export your map to any format allowed, the Export Map | Clip Output to Graphics 
Extent option eliminates the white empty margin around your map elements.
In relation to the Embed All Document Fonts option from step 4, please be aware about the 
fonts used. Some fonts do not support embedding in a PDF file. Embedding means that PDF 
uses the same fonts as your map layout even if the file is opened on a platform that does not 
have the map's fonts (for example, Esri fonts). You can verify that your font is embeddable at 
Microsoft typography at http://www.microsoft.com/typography.

You can control what layers and their attributes should be transferred to the PDF format. 
In the Table Of Contents section, you can unselect the layers. To reduce the number of 
attributes for the visible layers, uncheck the attributes in Layer properties | Fields. An 
example of a PDF with restricted layers and attributes is RestrictedTopographicMap.

The PDF vector format is used to display web maps. When you use Pan and zoom in your 
software, the displaying is quite fast. This format is not quite the best solution for print 
publishing because PDF could make small changes in font characteristics.
The TIFF format will build the map pixel by pixel. This format is used for print publishing. A 
high resolution will create a high-quality map with a price: a large file size (300 dpi/over 
300 MB). When you use Pan and zoom in your graphics software, the displaying will take 
a while for the MyTopographicMap300dpi map. The labels and line symbols from the 
MyTopographicMap72dpi map are slightly jagged. However, this will not affect the quality  
of a PowerPoint presentation, for example.
Creating an atlas of maps
An atlas of maps is a collection of maps. Those collections of maps use spatial dataset  
series and other additional information. In accordance with INSPIRE Metadata Implementing 
Rules Technical Guidelines, a series is a collection of related datasets that share the same 
product specification.
The Data Driven Pages function allows you to generate a series of maps starting from a map 
layout and an index layer. An index layer is used to specify the dimension and the number of 
pages from the map book. Each feature from the index generates one output map. You can 
use a regular grid, a strip map that follows a linear feature, or any feature layer from the data 
frame as an index layer.
The general steps in generating a series of map pages are:
1.	 Creating a map layout.
2.	 Creating Grid Index Features.
3.	 Setting up the Data Driven Pages function.
4.	 Exporting the pages in PDF format.
When the Data Driven Pages function is enabled in your map layout, there will be a new  
tab in the Export Map window. The Pages tab will allow you to control the Data Driven  
Pages export.

Getting ready
You will create a series of maps at the scale 1:2,000, starting from the map extent of the 
scale 1:5,000. The map layout from the following section will contain two data frames with 
the same coordinate reference system. Every data frame contains the same layer structure. 
The Topographic Map 1:5,000 data frame will be unchanged in every output page. The 
map pages will be generated based on the Topographic Map 1:2,000 data frame content.
Before starting the exercises, please open the Map_L-35-111-D-b-2-III-1.pdf file from 
the ExportingMaps\MyResults folder. This PDF file is one of the final results in this recipe.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a map series at scale 1:2,000 using Data Driven Pages:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open an existing map document DrivenPages.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\ExportingMaps. Make sure that the data 
frame Topographic Map 1:2,000 is your current data frame or active (shown in 
bold in the Table Of Contents section).
Notice the red extent indicator from the Topographic Map 1:5,000 data frame. 
It's indicating the extent of the Topographic Map 1:2,000 data frame.
2.	 Firstly, you will create a grid index in a new feature class. Open ArcToolbox, go 
to Cartographic Tools | Data Driven Pages, and double-click on the Grid Index 
Features tool, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
201
3.	 For the Output Feature Class, go to ExportingMaps\LayerFiles\TOPO5000, 
and type Index2K. For Input Features, select Trapezoid5000. Check Generate 
Polygon Grid and Use Page Unit and Scale. Be sure that Map Scale is 2000. For 
Number of Rows and Number of Columns, type 2. For Starting Page Number, type 
1. Accept the default values for the rest of the parameters. Click on OK.
4.	 Add Index2k in your data frame. For the Index2k layer, change the symbol to 
Hollow with Outline Color: Mars Red. Open the Index2k attribute table. Select 
the PageName field and right-click on it to select Field Calculator. Select the Load 
button, go to ExportingMaps\LayerFiles, and select the Index2000.cal file. 
Click on Open and on OK.

5.	 Select the Data Driven Pages toolbar from the Layout toolbar. A new toolbar has 
been automatically added: the Data Driven Pages toolbar. Navigate to the Data 
Driven Page Setup | Definition tab, and set the parameters, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
6.	 Select the Extent tab and only check the Center And Maintain Current Scale  
option. This option will center every feature from the index layer in the middle of  
the Topographic Map 1:2,000 data frame and will keep the scale of 1:2,000. 
Click on OK.
7.	
In ArcToolbox, go to Cartographic Tools | Data Driven Pages, and double-click on 
the Calculate Adjacent Fields tool. For Input Features, select the Index2k layer. 
For Field Name, select PageName. Click on OK. To inspect the result, use the Open 
Attribute Table tool from the Data Driven Pages toolbar.
Let's add the index name for your maps:

Chapter 7
203
8.	 Navigate to Page Text | Data Driven Page Name. The inserted map element will 
appear at the center of the graphic area. Right-click on the small rectangle selected 
and select Properties | Change Symbol. For Size, type 75, and click on OK twice 
to close the dialog boxes. Drag the index name above the data frame's title. Use the 
blue arrows from the Data Driven Pages toolbar to see how the data frame and the 
index name are being updated.
9.	 Save the map document as MyFinalDrivenPages.mxd at <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\ExportingMaps.
You will save your maps in four different PDF files:
10.	 Navigate to File | Export Map. For the Save As type, select the PDF (*.pdf) 
format. For File name, type TopographicMap. Navigate to Options | General. For 
Resolution, type 100 dpi. Select the Pages tab. Check All (4pages). For Export 
Pages As, choose Multiple PDF Files (page names). Select the Advanced tab. 
For Layers and Attributes, select Export PDF Layers Only. Check Export Map 
Georeference Information. Click on Save.
11.	 With Windows Explorer, explore the results from the four PDF files.
How it works...
If you have multiple data frames in your map layout, you should activate the data frame for 
which you want to create a series of layout pages. The parameters Polygon Width: 63 cm and 
Height: 59 cm from step 3 represent the size of the data frame. Having a fixed scale extent for 
the data frame ensures you do not miss the Map Scale (optional) value.
To generate a correct index for scale 1:2,000:
f
f
You used a reference layer named Trapezoid5000, which represents the extent of a 
map at scale 1:5,000
f
f
You have specified two rows and two columns in the index layer that will cover the 
extent of the reference layer
These are the two final remarks about the previous exercise:
f
f
Take into account that various standards or norms specify that symbols 
characteristics (for example, size) do not remain constant as the scale changes. For 
the Topographic Map 1:2,000 data frame, we used the symbols and annotation 
feature classes from the previous data frame (scale 1:5,000) for ease of work. 
Normally, you should create the symbols and annotation for the scale 1:2,000.
f
f
We assumed that datasets have a positional accuracy corresponding to the scale 
1:2,000. Therefore, we used the same dataset for both data frames.
You can display your data at any scale you want, but don't overlook the positional accuracy of 
the original dataset. It is a right decision to mention this aspect on your final map.

Introduction
Geocoding is the process of converting the address information into spatial data that can 
be displayed on a map using an address locator. In accordance with the online ESRI GIS 
Dictionary, an address locator is a dataset that stores the address attributes, associated 
indexes, and rules that define the process of geocoding.

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
210
As an ArcGIS for Desktop user, you can store the address locator in a .loc file format stored 
in a folder or in an existing geodatabase as Locator. You can also share your address locator 
with everyone in your organization:
f
f
As a locator package (.gpk) format with ArcGIS Online
f
f
As a geocode service with ArcGIS for Server
The ESRI GIS Dictionary defines linear referencing as a method for storing geographic data 
using a relative position along an already existing line feature.
For more details about the geocoding and linear referencing concepts, 
please navigate to Guide Books | Geocoding | Linear referencing 
sections from ArcGIS Help (10.2) online at http://resources.
arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2.
Preparing data for geocoding
The geocoding process requires reference data that has address information stored in fields 
that correspond to the required elements of an address locator style. Reference data can 
contain point, polyline, or polygon geometry. Geocoding also requires a nonspatial table with 
addresses to geocode.
Getting ready
In this section, you will prepare reference data and a nonspatial table with addresses for the 
geocoding process.
Firstly, you will standardize the reference data according to the US Address-Dual Ranges 
address locator style, as shown in the following table:
HouseNum*
PreDir
PreType
StreetName*
SufType
SufDir
68
-
-
Dacia
Ave
-
The standardization process will split an address into standard fields required by a specific 
address locator style and will translate the address information into standard abbreviations. 
The US Address-Dual Ranges style considers that the odd numbers are on one side of a 
street and the even numbers are on the other side.
The dual ranges style works with polyline features as a data reference. Therefore, you will use 
the Street polyline feature class from the VeloGIS.gdb geodatabase.

Chapter 8
211
Secondly, you will prepare a nonspatial table imported into your geodatabase. The table 
contains customer addresses taken from a larger database of an imaginary delivery service 
named Farm Food Delivery. In this table, you should have the address information in one 
field, as shown in the following screenshot:
How to do it...
Follow these steps to examine and standardize the reference data:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open an existing map document PrepareGeocoding.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\Geocoding.
2.	 The reference layer for geocoding is the Streets feature class from ...\Data\
Geocoding\ VeloGIS.gdb\Planimetry.
3.	 Let's examine its attribute table. Right-click on the Street layer and select Open 
Attribute Table. The Left_From, Left_To, Right_From, and Right_To fields 
contain the street number ranges on the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the 
streets. The ZIP_Left and ZIP_Right fields store the ZIP code. The Name field 
contains the name and type of the street.

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
212
4.	 You have to break down the name of the street into two elements required by  
the US Address-Dual Ranges address locator: street name and street type.  
Open ArcToolbox and go to Geocoding Tools. Double-click on the Standardize 
Addresses tool to open the dialog box and set the parameters, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
5.	 For Input Address Data, select the Streets layer. For Input Address Fields, select 
OBJECTID and the Name field. Select US Address-Dual Ranges as Address 
Locator Style. Check only StreetName and SufType. For Output Address 
Data, go to ...\Geocoding\VeloGIS.gdb\Planimetry and type Streets_
StandardizeAddresses for the name of the dataset. Click on OK.

Chapter 8
213
6.	 You have obtained a new layer named Streets_StandardizeAddresses. Open 
its attribute table. The layer has two more fields: ADDR_SN (alias StreetName) and 
ADDR_ST (alias SufType). To toggle between the name and alias of the fields, select 
Table Options, and check or uncheck the Show Field Aliases option. Notice that the 
ADDR_ST field stores the corresponding abbreviations for street type. Your reference 
data is ready for geocoding your customer delivery addresses.
Continue the following steps to examine and prepare the CustomersFarmDelivery 
nonspatial table:
7.	
In the Table Of Contents section, make sure that the List by Source tab is selected. 
Right-click on the CustomersFarmDelivery table and click on Open. The table 
contains the name of customers and their addresses in separate fields. The US 
Address-Dual Ranges address locator requires that all street-related information 
be stored in a single field.
8.	 You will create a new field. Start the edit session to undo the edits in the event of a 
mistake. In the CustomersFarmDelivery table, select Table Options | Add Field. 
For the Name, type Address. For Type, select Text, and accept the default length of 
characters. Click on OK.
9.	 You will populate the values of the Address field by concatenating the following fields: 
StreetNumber, StreetName, TypeStreet, and ZIP. We will consider the street 
number as the house number.
10.	 Right-click on the Address field and select Field Calculator. You will use an existing 
expression. Select Load and select the US Address-Dual Ranges.cal file 
from ...\Data\Geocoding. Click on Open and then on OK to calculate the 
records. Inspect the result. Close the edit session. Your nonspatial table is ready for 
geocoding.
11.	 Save the map document as MyPrepareGeocoding.mxd at ...\Data\
Geocoding.
You can find the results at ...\Data\Geocoding\ PrepareForGeocoding.
How it works...
As reference data, you can use feature classes or shape files. At step 5, you used two fields 
for address: OBJECTID and Name. The OBJECTID field will represent the numeric value for 
house numbers.
In the address table, you should have the entire address stored in one field. In the reference 
data, the address should be mostly in separate fields. The street polylines should connect 
to one another only at their endpoints. Before starting to use the reference data, check the 
connectivity of polylines using the following topological rules: Must not have dangles and 
Must not intersect or touch interior.

left-hand side of the street)
Â
Â
List of standard street components (for example, abbreviations such as 
Boulevard = Blvd)
Â
Â
Snapshot of reference data (for example, centerline streets)
4.	 Geocoding or matching addresses: The following are the details of this step:
Â
Â
Finding individual addresses
Â
Â
Creating point features based on a nonspatial address table
Getting ready
In the next exercise, you will create an address locator named Streets_Locator. Based on 
the address locator, you will geocode the CustomersFarmDelivery address table. Finally, 
you will try to improve the geocoding results by manually fixing the missing address matches.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create an address locator and geocode the address table:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open MyPrepareGeocoding.mxd to continue to work in the 
same geodatabase from <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\Geocoding\
VeloGIS.gdb.
If you did not succeed in finishing the previous step, please open an 
existing map document Geocoding.mxd from ...\Data\Geocoding\

13.	Make sure that Street_Locator is selected in the Select Address Locator 
section from the Geocode toolbar. In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on 
the CustomersFarmDelivery table, and click on Geocode Addresses. Select 
Streets_Locator and click on OK. In the Geocode Addresses: Streets_locator 
window, set the parameters as shown in the following screenshot:
14.	 Save the output as the Customers feature class in VeloGIS.gdb\Planimetry.
By choosing the Create dynamic feature class related to table option, you will 
create a dynamic geocoded output feature class. A composite relationship class 
will be created between the output feature class and the address table. Every 
modification in the address table will be automatically reflected in the address points.
15.	Click on OK to start the geocoding process. You will obtain final statistics of the 
matched and unmatched customer addresses. Click on Close. We will come back 
later to those results. The Customers output layer has been added to the map.  
Open the Customers attribute table and the CustomersFarmDelivery table to 
inspect them.

You have noticed some additional fields in the Customers attribute table. Please 
navigate and refer to the Guide Books | Geocoding | Locating addresses | About 
geocoding a table of addresses section from ArcGIS Help (10.2) online to learn more 
about those new fields. Because your statistic results are not quite perfect, you will 
manually rematch the addresses, as shown in the following screenshot:
16.	 In the Table Of Contents section, select Geocoding Result: Customers. From the 
Geocoding toolbar, select the Review/Rematch Addresses tool. Right-click on the 
Customers.Status field and select Sort Ascending to sort the values.
17.	 In the Geocoding results table, select the row with Customers.ObjectID: 8 and with 
Customers.Status: T. In the Address panel, the address is incomplete because it 
contains only the name of the street. You have four candidates for this address in the 
Candidates section. You should choose one of them to change the Status value.
18.	Select the first candidate and read the candidate details. Click on Match and  
on the Refresh button. Notice that Customers.Status has changed from T (tied) to  
M (matched) and that the Customers.Match type has changed from A to M  
(manually match).

19.	If you want to have a score of 100, firstly, select again the first candidate, and click on 
Unmatch. Secondly, change Full Address from AUREL VLAICU to AUREL VLAICU 
ST. The score for all four candidates has been changed to 100. Select the first 
candidate, and click on Match and Refresh. Right-click on the Customers.Status 
field again and select Sort Ascending to sort the values.
20.	In the table, select the row with Customers.ObjectID: 5 and with Customers.Status: 
U (unmatched). In the Address panel, for Full Address, correct the type of street from 
S T to ST. Click on the empty space of the Candidates section. Select the candidate 
that has appeared and click on the Match button. Notice that Customers.ObjectID: 5 
has Status: M and Score: 100.
21.	 There are two unmatched addresses left. You have two options:
Â
Â
Accept the unmatched status.
Â
Â
The number of the house is wrong. In the table, select the record, and click 
on Pick Address from Map. Drag the Interactive Rematch dialog box to see 
the map. On the map, right-click on the chosen location, and select Pick 
Address. A new point has been added and Customers.Match has been 
changed to PP (Pick by Point). Click on Refresh.
22.	Let's change the 87.22 score for Customers.ObjectID: 2 and control the number 
of candidates by selecting Geocoding Options. Change the following parameters: 
Spelling sensitivity : 95 and Minimum Candidate score : 60.
23.	The goal is to see more candidates for an address but still keep Minimum match 
score higher. Click on OK. Click on Refresh.
24.	 Let's inspect the consequences. Select the row Customers.ObjectID: 2. Notice that 
Full Address has two errors and there is no candidate. This is because you increased 
Spelling sensitivity to 95 and the spelling errors are not accepted by the new 
Spelling sensitivity value.
25.	If you correct the errors by changing DACCIA to DACIA, and ST to AVE, the previous 
candidate will show up. Click on the Unmatch button to unmatch the existing address 
and then click on Refresh. Select the candidate and again click on Match. Notice 
that the Score value has been changed to 100.
26.	Select the row with Customers.ObjectID of 4 and 5. Notice that address has one 
more candidate with a score below 70. Select again Geocoding Options and 
change Minimum Candidate score to 70. Click on OK. By increasing Minimum 
Candidate score, the second candidate for the Customers.ObjectID of 4 and 5 have 
disappeared.
27.	 Close the Interactive Rematch dialog box. The Customers layer has been updated 
according to your last settings.
Let's test the composite relationship between those two tables. 

Chapter 8
221
28.	Start the edit session to change an address from the CustomersFarmDelivery 
table and see the changes in the Customers layer, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
29.	In the CustomersFarmDelivery table, select the record with OBJECTID as 1. In 
the Address field, change the number of the street to 95. Click on the Related Tables 
button and select the Customers_geocode_rel: geocodes relationship. The 
point feature from the Customers layer is now selected, and the Match_addr and 
Full Address values are automatically updated. Press the F5 key to redraw the 
map. The point was moved according to the new address.
30.	Add a new customer in the CustomersFarmDelivery table. Let's suppose that 
Customer 9 will have the following address: 50 Aurel Vlaicu St, 20097. Fill 
the empty cells with the corresponding address information.
31.	 Look at your map while you are selecting View | Refresh. A new point has been 
added. Notice that the Customers attribute table has been updated with a new 
record. Save the edits and stop the editing session.
32.	Save your map document as MyGeocoding.mxd.

created from the address table at step 13 are stored as feature classes in your geodatabase.
Also, at step 13, you chose dynamic geocoding. This option is possible when your address 
table and the geocoded resulted feature class are stored in the same geodatabase. Dynamic 
geocoding refers only to the address table changes.
Later on, if you load more street centerlines in your reference data, the changes will not 
be reflected in the snapshot of the data from your address locator. To update your address 
locator, you have to rebuild it or create a new address locator.
At step 22, by lowering the Spelling sensitivity and Minimum match score values, you 
will obtain more matched addresses after the geocoding process. If you lower Minimum 
candidate score, you will find more potential candidates to match.
A 100 value for Minimum match score is considered a perfect match. A range from 80 to 99 
for the match score is considered to be a good match. Minimum match score lower than 60 
is not recommended. An address with a match score below the minimum value is considered 
to be unmatched.
Geocoding with alternative names
To locate an address, you have two more alternatives:
f
f
Name aliases (for example, the 91 Dacia Ave address is known as  
Elementary School)
f
f
Alternative names (for example, Dacia Avenue is a small section of the road called 
E60; E60 is part of the European Road Network)
The address locator with a name alias needs a supplementary table that must contain two 
required fields: the alias place name and the corresponding address. Your address locator will 
use this input table to search the address of the alias place name.
The address locator with alternative names needs an alternate name table that will contain 
specific fields in accordance with the address locator style (for example, prefix and suffix 
type, street name, and prefix and suffix direction). The alternate name table and the primary 
reference feature attribute table must contain the common Join ID field. Those two tables 
will join in a Many to Many relationship based on the common field.

Getting ready
You will geocode the PointOfInterest address table using a composite address locator, as 
shown in the following screenshot:
The composite locator will combine the functionality of two individual address locators:

The PlaceAlias and AlternativeNameStreets tables are already created in the 
VeloGIS.gdb geodatabase.

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
224
If you worked on all previous exercises in VeloGIS.gdb from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\Geocoding, skip step 1 from the next section, and prepare your 
Street__StandardizeAddresses feature class for geocoding by:
f
f
Adding a Join ID [Short integer] field
f
f
Filling the Join ID field with the following values: 100 for street Aurel Vlaicu; 
101 for street Dacia; and 102 for street Drobeta
Add in your map document the following tables: PointsOfInterest, PlaceAlias, and 
AlternativeNameStreets.
Otherwise, please use the data and map document from <drive>:\PacktPublishing\
Data\Geocoding\Geocoding. The folder contains a duplicate VeloGIS.gdb geodatabase 
that will help you to succeed in the next steps.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to geocode addresses with place aliases and alternate names using a 
composite address locator in the ArcCatalog context menu:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In the Catalog Tree section, go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\
Data\Geocoding\Geocoding.
2.	 Expand the VeloGIS.gdb geodatabase. Right-click on the geodatabase and 
navigate to New | Address Locator. Select US Address-Dual Ranges 
as the address locator style. Choose as reference data the Street_
StandardizeAddresses feature class for Primary Table, and choose as reference 
data the AlternativeNameStreets table for Alternate Name Table. Perform the 
steps shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 8
225
3.	 Most of the fields will match. Be careful about the following fields: for Primary Table/
Alternate Name Table: JoinID, choose the common field JOIN_ID. Save the address 
locator in your geodatabase. Right-click on Streets_AlternateName and navigate 
to the Properties | Geocoding options. Select Yes for the Match without house 
number and Match with no zones options. Click on OK.
4.	 Create a new Address Locator. Select US Address-Single House as the address 
locator style. This address locator style allows you to find an address point using 
polygon features as reference data.

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
226
5.	 Choose as reference data the Parcels feature class for Primary Table and the 
PlaceAlias table for Alias Table. The red X indicates an error. To correct the error, 
match the required fields as shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Change the properties of the new Parcels_PlaceAlias address locator by 
selecting Yes for the Match without house number and Match with no zones 
options. Click on OK.
7.	
Let's create a composite address locator. Right-click on the geodatabase  
and navigate to New | Composite Address Locator. For Address Locator, add 
Parcels_PlaceAlias and Streets_AlternateName address locators. Name 
the Output Composite Address Locator as Composite_ParcelStreet. Click on 
OK. Right-click on Composite_ParcelStreet and click on Properties. Inspect  
the default settings.

Chapter 8
227
8.	 In the Participating Address Locators panel, select Parcels_PlaceAlias to 
activate its individual properties. Navigate to Properties | Geocoding options, and 
select Yes for the previous house and zones matching options. Click on OK. Similarly, 
change the properties of the second address locator.
9.	 Let's geocode the addresses. In ArcCatalog, right-click on the PointOfInterest 
table, and select Geocode Addresses. In the Choose an Address Locator to use pop-
up window, choose Composite_ParcelStreet, and click on OK. Continue to set 
the following parameters:
Â
Â
Address table: PointOfInterest
Â
Â
Address Input Fields: Single Field
Â
Â
Single Line Input: Address
Â
Â
Output feature class: ...VeloGIS.gdb\Planimetry\ Point_
byComposite
10.	 Click on Geocoding Options, and for Intersections | Connectors, type &, and click 
on OK. Your statistic results are not quite perfect and you should manually rematch 
the addresses.
11.	 Try to repeat the last two steps to geocode the PointOfInterest table based on 
the individual address locators:
Output feature class
Point_byParcel
Point_byStreet
Address locator
Parcels_PlaceAlias
Streets_AlternateName
12.	Use ArcMap to see the three-point feature classes. Symbolize the new layers and 
examine the results. Improve the geocoded address results from the Point_
byComposite feature class.
You can find the results of this recipe in the CompositeGeocoding folder at ...\Data\
Geocoding.

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing

How it works...
A composite address locator geocodes an address table using the functionality of multiple 
address locators in one geocoding process. The next table shows the advantages and 
disadvantages of using a simple address locator or a composite one:
Address locator
Advantages
Disadvantages
Streets_AlternateName
This supports 
intersections.
There is a high number 
of matching addresses.
There is low position accuracy.
Parcels_PlaceAlias
There is high position 
accuracy.
This does not support 
intersections: Properties | 
About the locator | Support 
intersections: False
Composite_ParcelStreet
There is high position 
accuracy.
This supports 
intersections.
There is a high number 
of matching addresses.
Trying to have a high number 
of matching addresses, your 
composite locator will use the 
most accurate locator first 
(parcel) and the least accurate 
second (street). In the end, you 
will obtain a low accuracy result. 
By choosing a composite address locator, you can improve the geocoding results, but you 
cannot compensate for the quality of address information from your reference data: garbage 
in, garbage out.
Creating and editing routes
A route is a linear feature that has a measurement system (for example, distance or time) and 
a unique identifier. Routes are stored in a route feature class (standalone feature class or in a 
feature dataset). The vertices of a route contain the x and y coordinates and a measure value 
or m value. Measure units are independent of map units. Measure values do not have to 
begin at zero and should be increased in the same direction. 

Chapter 8
229
Getting ready
In this section, you will create a route feature class that will store three simple routes that 
represent three different bus lines from your town: bus 133, bus 79, and bus 135. Your routes 
will be created from scratch using the Trace tool.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create and edit simple routes in ArcMap:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document Routes.mxd from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\LinearReferencing. Open the Catalog window. 
Expand the VeloGIS.gdb geodatabase.
2.	 You will create a new route feature class. Right-click on the geodatabase and 
navigate to New | Feature class. For Name, type BusRoute_m. For Type, choose 
Line Feature. Under Geometry Properties, check Coordinates include M values. 
Used to store route data. Go to the next panel. Navigate to Add Coordinate System 
| Import, go to VeloGIS.gdb, and select the Street feature class. Accept the 
default settings from the next two panels. In the attribute table panel, add a new field 
that will store the unique identifiers of the routes. For Field Name, type RouteID. For 
Data Type, select Short Integer. Click on Finish. The empty BusRoute_m layer 
has been added in the Table Of Contents section.
That name of the BusRoute_m route feature class suggests the measure units  
(letter m refers to meter). It's good practice to document the measurement system 
and measure units in feature-class metadata.
3.	 In the Catalog window, right-click on BusRoute_m, and select Item Description. 
Select the Edit button, and in the Overview | Item Description | Description 
(Abstract) section, type: Bus routes. The measurement system is 
distance. The measure units are meters.. Click on Save and then on Exit.

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
230
Let's add three routes in the BusRoute_m layer, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
4.	 Start the edit session from the Editor toolbar. Set the editing environment: on the 
Editor toolbar by navigating to Editor | Snapping | Snapping Toolbar; select Point, 
End, Vertex, and Edge. From Snapping | Options, set Tolerance: 5 pixels and 
Show tips. In the Table Of Contents section, select List by Selection, and make 
BusRoute_m the only selectable layer.
5.	 Open the Create Feature window to see the feature templates. Select the 
BusRoute_m layer. Under Construction Tools, select Line. On the Editor toolbar, 
click on the Trace tool. You will digitize the new routes based on the Street 
reference layer. First click on the Start Bus 133 point and digitize the route by tracing 
along the Street layer features until the End Bus 133 point. Press the F2 key to 
finish the sketch. Click on the Attribute button, and for RouteID, type 133. Notice 
that your SHAPE geometry is Polyline M. This M means that your linear feature 
coordinates include measure values.

Chapter 8
231
6.	 Repeat the previous step to create the routes 135 and 79.
7.	
Save the edits and clear the selected features. Turn off the Street layer to better 
see the routes from the BusRoute_m layer. Symbolize the routes based on the 
RouteID field: Layer Properties | Symbology | Categories | Unique values.
At step 3, you already decided to use distance for your measurement system.  
You will assign measures to your new routes:
8.	 On the Editor toolbar, click on the Sketch Properties button. To see the vertices' 
coordinates, select route number 133 with the Select Features tool, and click on  
Edit Vertices.
9.	 Your M values are unknown (NaNâNot a Number). In the Attribute window, you 
already noticed the value of SHAPE_Length: 132.668 for RouteID: 133. You have 
the following two options:
Â
Â
Enter manually in the Edit Sketch Properties window, the start and end 
measures: Point 0: 0.00 and Point 4:132.668. In the map, right-click 
on the selected route and go to Route Measure Editing | Calculate NaN. 
Notice the values in the Edit Sketch Properties window. Close the window. If 
you want to return to the NaN values, choose Drop Measures.
Â
Â
In the map, right-click on the selected route, and go to Route Measure 
Editing | Set From/To. In the second cell, type the value 132.668. Press 
the Enter key to close and calculate the vertices' measure.
For the bus route number 133, you measured with a total station (surveying 
instrument) the 75 meters between the street intersections 1 and 2 (underlined in 
the previous screenshot by two circles). You will use this more accurate distance to 
update the segment measures of the route. This method is known as calibration. 
Firstly, add the Route Editing toolbar from the Editor toolbar by navigating to Editor 
| More Editing Toolbars. On the Route Editing toolbar, add the Calibrate Route tool 
from Customize | Commands | Categories | Linear Referencing.
10.	 Select route number 133. On the Route Editing toolbar, click on the Calibrate tool. 
Move the dialog box to see the map. Select Add Calibration Points Tool. In the map, 
snap the mouse pointer to the first intersection, and click on it once. Snap the  
mouse pointer again to the second intersection. Notice that two records are added 
in your Calibrate Route window. For the first record, type New M: 20.944. For 
the second record, type New M: 95.944. In the Options panel, check Interpolate 
between points, Extrapolate at the end, and Use existing measures. Click on 
Calibrate Route.
11.	 Open the Edit Sketch Properties window to check the results. Notice that the last 
measure value has been changed to 136.783. Now your measures reflect the reality 
from the field.

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
232
12.	Assign measures to the last two routes: 135 and 79. Try to calibrate route number 79 
using the same segment value between the two street intersections. Save the edits 
and stop the editing session.
Let's find a specific section along the route using the Find tool from the  
Standard toolbar:
13.	Click on Find | Linear Referencing. Choose BusRoute_m and click on Load Routes. 
Choose route number 133. For Type, check the Line option. You want to find the 
section of route 133 from 25 meters to 75 meters from the start of the route. Set for 
From: 25 and for To: 75. Click on Find.
14.	 Select the record and right-click to explore the options. You can flash the segment. 
You can also Draw Route Location. You should turn off the BusRoute_m layer to  
see the segment that is a graphic element stored only in your map documents.  
To work with it, use the Select Elements tool from the Drawing toolbar or the  
Standard toolbar.
Let's find the measure value for a point along the route using the Identify Route 
Location Results tool from the Route Editing toolbar:
15.	Click on the Identify Route Location Results tool. In the map, click on the first street 
intersection until you see all three routes in the Identify Route Location Results 
window. Inspect all of them. The Measure field displays the measure units (m value) 
calculated from the start of the route.
16.	 Save your map document as MyRoutes.mxd at ...\Data\LinearReferencing.
You can find the results of this recipe at ...\Data \LinearReferencing\Routes.
How it works...
A route can be edited or updated in an ArcMap Edit session. At step 9, the Use existing 
measures option will constrain the interpolation process to use your measured value for the 
vertices of the calibrated segment (75 meters) instead of the distance value calculated from 
the vertices' x and y coordinates (72.327 meters).
There's more...
If you want to store routes with different measure units, you should separate them into 
different route feature classes. You can also update a route feature by following two steps: 
edit the route geometry (move, add and delete vertices, merge, and add new features) and 
re-measure the route (entire route or a portion of the route) using the Define Line Portion tool 
from the Route Editing toolbar. If the tool is not on your toolbar, you can add it by navigating 
to Customize | Customize mode | Commands | Categories | Linear Referencing.

Chapter 8
233
Creating and editing events
A route event is a point or linear feature that occurs along a route feature. Route events are 
stored in tables called route event tables. A route table contains a route identifier field (for 
example, RouteID) that associates a specific route to the route point or linear event. Based on 
this route identifier field, a route table can store multiple events associated with a single route or 
can reference multiple routes. Also, multiple route events can reference a single route.
In ArcMap, you can create a layer of point or line features based on the information from the 
route event table. When you change a value in the route event table, the shape of the event 
(point or line) is automatically moved.
The features from the event layer are stored in a table and not in a feature class. You can 
export those event features to a feature class, but the dynamic connection between the route 
event table and routes will be lost.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will create two route event tables, as shown in the following screenshot:
 

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
234
Firstly, the BusStop point route event table will have the following special fields: RouteID, 
Loc_M, and Offset. BusStop refers to the bus stops along the bus routes.
Secondly, the MaximumSpeed line route event table will have the following special fields: 
RouteID, From_M, To_M, and Offset. MaximumSpeed refers to the speed restriction 
segments along the bus routes.
The field RouteID (route identifier field) defines the connection between the route and the 
route events. Lo_M, From_M, and To_M are measure location field(s). Offset represents the 
symbol translation from the route in map units.
You can continue to work in your map document MyRoutes.mxd and skip step 1.
If you didn't succeed in finishing the previous exercise, start with step 1.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create events using ArcMap:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document StartEvents.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\LinearReferencing\Routes. Open the 
Catalog window. Expand VeloGIS.gdb from the same location.
2.	 You will create a route event table for point events. Right-click on the geodatabase 
and navigate to New | Table. For Name, type BusStop. Accept the default settings 
from the next panel. Add the following new fields:
Â
Â
RouteID with Data Type: Short Integer. This field will store the unique 
identifiers of the routes.
Â
Â
Loc_M with Data Type: Double.
Â
Â
Offset with Data Type: Short Integer and Default Value: 6.
3.	 Click on Finish. Your table has been added in the Table Of Contents section. To see 
the table, select the List by Source view.
4.	 You will create a new route event table for line events. Right-click on the geodatabase 
and navigate to New | Table. For Name, type SpeedLimit. Accept the default 
settings from the next panel. Add the following new fields:
Â
Â
RouteID with Data Type: Short Integer
Â
Â
From_M with Data Type: Double
Â
Â
To_M with Data Type: Double
Â
Â
Offset with Data Type: Short Integer and Default Value: 1
Â
Â
MaximumSpeed with Data Type: Short Integer and Default Value: 50

Chapter 8
235
5.	 Click on Finish.
You now have two empty tables. Let's populate those tables. Open the YourEvents.
pdf file from ...\Data\LinearReferencing. The file contains all information 
necessary to complete the route event tables:
6.	 Open the table BusStop. Start an edit session. Click inside the first empty cell under 
the RouteID field and type 133. For Loc_M, type 7. The Offset field is already 
populated with the default value 6. Notice also that the ObjectID field value is 
automatically generated. Continue to complete the table with the next 13 records 
using the information from the YourEvents.pdf file. Save the edits.
7.	
Open the SpeedLimits table. Complete the table with nine records. Save the edits 
and stop the edit session.
Let's create the point event layer based on the BusStop route event table:
8.	 In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the BusStop table, and select 
Display Route Events. In the dialog box, set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Route Reference: BusRoutes and Route Identifier: RouteID
Â
Â
For Event Table | BusStop, select Route Identifier: RouteID
Â
Â
Check Point Events: Occur at a precise location along the route
Â
Â
Measure: Loc_M and Offset: Offset; click on OK
9.	 The new layer named BusStop Events has been added in the Table Of Contents 
section. Symbolize the point route event layer: Layer Properties | Symbology | 
Symbol | Style References | Public Sign: Bus.
10.	 Add labels to the event layer: Layer Properties | Labels | Label fields: RouteID. 
Don't forget to check Label features in this layer. Click on OK. Explore the attribute 
table of BusStop Events.

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
236
Let's create the line event layer based on the SpeedLimits table. On the Route 
Editing toolbar, click on the Add Route Events tool, and set the parameters as  
shown in the following screenshot:
11.	 Click on Advanced Options and check Right of the route. The side is determined by 
the digitized direction. Once more, you can see how important the direction of the 
sketch is. Click on OK.
12.	The SpeedLimit Events layer has been added. Symbolize the line route event 
layer based on the MaximumSpeed supplementary field: Layer Properties | 
Symbology | Category: Unique values.
The city speed limit for public transport is 50 km per hour and only a speed 
limit of 30 km per hour is a critical restriction. For this reason, let's update the 
SpeedLimits route event table by erasing the records with a maximum speed of  
50 km per hour:

Chapter 8
237
13.	Start an edit session. A warning message tells you that event layers are not editable. 
Point and line events are temporary layers and are stored only in your map document. 
Click on Continue.
14.	 Open the attribute table of the SpeedLimits event table. With Select by Attributes, 
select all line events with MaximumSpeed as 50. Click on Delete Selected to delete 
the selected records. Notice that line events with MaximumSpeed of 50 were deleted 
from the map. Use the F5 key to refresh the map. Explore the attribute table of the 
SpeedLimits Events layer to see changes. You can use the Undo Database 
Row(s) Deleted and Redo tools to better see again how your line events are updating. 
Rename your layer: SpeedLimits30 Events.
15.	Save your map document as MyEevents.mxd.
You can find the results of this recipe at ...\Data \LinearReferencing\Events.
How it works...
You have stored the point and line events in separate tables. Because an event represents 
an attribute of the route, you can add additional information in your event table. The 
SpeedLimits event table contains the MaximumSpeed field that stores the maximum 
allowed speed for public transportation.
You have already noticed that your event table references multiple routes (for example, 79 bus 
line, 133 bus line) from a single route feature class.
Events with a negative Offset value will be placed on the right-hand side of the route. In this 
way, your bus stops that have the same location along the same route (for example, bus line 
133) will be displayed on the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the route.
At step 13, you have seen that ArcGIS cannot edit the event layers. If you want to make it 
editable, export it as a feature class or a shape file. By exporting the event layer, the dynamic 
association between the event layer and the route event table will be lost.
Working with complex routes
Complex routes obey the simple route rules. Complex routes contain the close loop, self-
intersecting, double-back (overlap), and branching route features.

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
238
Getting ready
In this section, you will create a delivery route for customers of the Farm Food Delivery 
service. Your complex route will be used for:
f
f
Measurement system: time
f
f
Measure unit: minutes
Your complex route will use the street centerlines as reference lines from the Street feature 
class. The complex route will have eight simple routes as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 8
239
In the end, your complex route will form a closed loop by double backing on itself and  
self-intersecting.
You can continue to work in your map document MyEvents.mxd, add the FarmFoodDelivery 
layer, and skip step 1. Open the YourEvents.pdf file from ...\Data\LinearReferencing. 
The file contains all necessary information to complete the complex route.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a complex route in ArcMap:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document StartComplexRoute.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data \LinearReferencing\Events.
2.	 Open the Catalog window and expand VeloGIS.gdb from the same location. Create 
a new route feature class named FarmFoodDelivery_h.
The letter h should indicate the measure unit that will be used by your complex route 
(hours, minutes, seconds). Follow the steps from the Creating and editing routes 
recipe. Document the measurement system and measure units in your feature class 
metadata: Delivery service. The measurement system is time. The measure 
units are minutes.
3.	 Start the edit session. Prepare the editing environment as follows:
Â
Â
For List by Selection | Selectable, set Streets as the only selectable layer
Â
Â
Snapping toolbar | Options | Tolerance: 5 pixels
Â
Â
Snapping toolbar | Snapping: End, Vertex, and Edge
The YourEvents.pdf file contains the measure values for all your simple routes. 
You will create eight simple routes, as shown in the previous screenshot.
4.	 Let's create the first simple route. Click on the Edit tool and select the street feature 
with OBJECTID as 3 that will represent Route 1.
5.	 On the Route Editing toolbar, select the Make Route tool. Move the dialog box to see 
the selected feature.
6.	 From Click on the start point, select the Start Point button.
7.	
On the map, click and snap on the start point: Farm Food Delivery (point 1 on 
the preceding screenshot).
8.	 In the Make Route dialog box, select From/To measure, and type 0 and 7. Click on 
Make Route. Your first simple route starts from 0 minutes and ends at 7 minutes. 
Clear the selected feature with the Clear Selected Feature tool.
9.	 Create the second simple route. Select the second street with OBJECTID as 1 that 
will represent Route 2. Click on Make Route and click on intersection 1 (or point 2 
on the screenshot).

Working with Geocoding and Linear Referencing
240
10.	 Type the values for From/To measure: 7 and 27. Click on Make Route. Your second 
simple route starts from 7 minutes and ends at 27 minutes. Continue to create the 
remaining routes as shown in YourEvents.pdf.
11.	 Save the edits and clear all selected features.
Let's merge all eight simple routes into a complex route:
12.	In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on FarmFoodDelivery_h, and navigate 
to Selection | Select All. From the Editor menu, select Merge, and select the first 
record. Check Preserve Overlapping segments and click on OK.
13.	On the Editor toolbar, select the Attributes tool, and for the RouteID field, 
enter the value 1. Save the edits.
14.	 Set FarmFoodDelivery_h as the selectable layer. Explore your route using 
the Edit Sketch Properties window and the Identify Route Location Results tool.
15.	Stop the edit session. Save your map document as MyComplexRoute.mxd.
You can find the results of this recipe at ...\Data\LinearReferencing\
ComplexRoutes.
How it works...
Generally, the digitized direction of the reference feature (for example, street centerline) 
determines the direction of the simple route. In this recipe, you saw that the direction of the 
increasing measure does not have to coincide with the digitized direction of the reference 
feature. Assign carefully the correct measures to the simple routes that will merge. With the 
Identify Route Location Results tool, click on the double-back segment of the complex route 
(Routes 6 and Route 7 from the screenshot). You will find two route identifiers with the same 
RouteID as 1. Even if it is a single route, Measure will report a value for the going path and 
another value for the return path.
Analyzing events
Events support two overlay operations: union and intersection. The event tables or event 
layers can be used as input in an overlay analysis operation.
To avoid errors, respect the following conditions:
f
f
Use the same measure system
f
f
Measures should be incremented in the same direction and reference the same 
route
f
f
Event layers should cover the same area
The result of an overlay operation is a new event table that contains the attributes from the 
input tables.

Chapter 8
241
Getting ready
In this section, you want to identify the possible traffic jam sections generated by the speed 
restriction and frequent stops of the buses as shown in the following screenshot:
You can use this information to relocate some bus stops or bus lines in order to reduce  
traffic congestion.
You will perform a line-on-point intersection of two event tables: BusStop and SpeedLimits. 
Your SpeedLimits line event table contains only the section with the speed limit of 30

Introduction
The ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension offers a lot of great tools for geoprocessing raster data. 
Most of the Spatial Analyst tools generate a new raster output. Before starting a raster analysis 
session, it's best practice to set the main analysis environment parameters settings (for 
example, scratch the workspace, extent, and cell size of the output raster). In this chapter, you 
will store all raster datasets in file geodatabase as file geodatabase raster datasets.

Working with Spatial Analyst
246
For theoretical aspects about spatial data analysis, please refer to 
Geographic Information Analysis, David O'Sullivan and David Unwin, John 
Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2003.
For more details about the Spatial Analyst toolbox, please refer to ArcGIS 
Help (10.2) at http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/
main/10.2 online.
Analyzing surfaces
In this recipe, you will represent 3D surface data in a two-dimensional environment. To 
represent 3D surface data in the ArcMap 2D environment, you will use hillshades and 
contours. You can use the hillshade raster as a background for other raster or vector  
data in ArcMap.
Using the surface analysis tools, you can derive new surface data, such as slope and aspect 
or locations visibility.
Getting ready
In the surface analysis context:
f
f
The term slope refers to the steepness of raster cells
f
f
Aspect defines the orientation or compass direction of a cell
f
f
Visibility identifies which raster cells are visible from a surface location
In this recipe, you will prepare your data for analysis by creating an elevation surface named 
Elevation from vector data. The two feature classes involved are the PointElevation 
point feature class and the ContourLine polyline feature class. All other output raster 
datasets will derive from the Elevation raster.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to prepare your data for spatial analysis:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document, SurfaceAnalysis.mxd, from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\SpatialAnalyst. Go to Customize | 
Extensions and check the Spatial Analyst extension.

In the next step, you will create a raster of visibility between two geodetic points in 
order to plan some topographic measurements using an electronic theodolite. You 
will use the TriangulationPoint and Elevation layers:
18.	In the Table Of Contents section, turn on the TriangulationPoint layer, and 
open its attribute table to examine the fields.
There are two geodetic points with the following supplementary fields: OffsetA and 
OffsetB. OffsetA is the proposed height of the instrument mounted on its tripod 
above stations 8 and 72.  OffsetB is the proposed height of the reflector (or target) 
above the same points.
19.	Close the table. Expand Spatial Analyst Tools | Interpolation and double-click on the 
Visibility tool to open the dialog box. Click on Show Help to see the meaning of every 
parameter. Set the following parameters:

Outer radius (optional): For this, type 1600
Notice that OffsetA and OffsetB were automatically assigned. The Outer radius 
parameter limits the search distance, and it is the rounded distance between the two 
geodetic points. All other cells beyond the 1,600-meter radius will be excluded from 
the visibility analysis.
20.	Click on OK. Open the attribute table of the Visibility layer to inspect the  
fields and values.
The Value field stores the value of cells. Value 0 means that cells are not visible 
from the two points. Value 1 means that 6,608,948 cells are visible only from point 
8 (first observer OBS1). Value 2 means that 1,813,578 cells are visible only from 
point 72 (second observer OBS2). Value 3 means that 4,351,861 cells are visible 
from both points. In conclusion, there is visibility between the two points if the height 
of the instrument and reflector is 1.5 meters. Close the table.
21.	 Symbolize the Visibility layer, as follows: Show: Unique Values and Value 
Field: Value. Click on Add All Values and choose Color Scheme: Yellow-Green 
Bright. Select <Heading> and change the Label value to Height 1.5 meters. 
Double-click on the symbol for Value as 0, and select No Color. Click on OK. The 
Visibility layer is symbolized as shown in the following screenshot:

How it works...
You have started the exercise by setting the geoprocessing environment. You will override 
those settings in the next recipes. At the application level, you chose to build pyramids. By 
creating pyramids, your raster will be displayed faster when you zoom out. The pyramid levels 
contain the copy of the original raster at a low resolution. The original raster will have a cell 
size of 0.5 meters. The pixel size will double at each level of the pyramid, so the first level 
will have a cell size of 1 meter; the second level will have a cell size of 2 meters; and the third 
level will have a cell size of 4 meters.
Even if the values of cells refer to heights measured above the local mean sea level (zero-level 
surface), you should consider the planimetric accuracy of the dataset. Please remember that 
TOPO5000.gdb refers to a product at the scale 1:5,000. This is the reason why you have 
chosen 0.5 meters for the raster cell size. At step 4, you used the PointElevation layer as 
supplementary data when you created the Elevation raster.
If one of your ArcToolbox tools fails to execute or you have obtained an empty raster output, 
you have some options here:

You used the Visibility tool to check the visibility between two points with 1.5 meters for the 
Observer offset and Surface offset parameters. Try yourself to see what happens if the offset 
value is less than 1.5 meters. To again run the Visibility tool in the Edit mode, right-click on 
the tool, and select Open. For Surface offset and Observer offset, type 0.5 meters and click

Interpolating data
Spatial interpolation is the process of estimating an unknown value between two known 
values taking into account Tobler's First Law:
"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than 
distant things."
This recipe does not undertake to teach you the advanced concept of interpolation because 
it is too complex for this book. Instead, this recipe will guide you to create a terrain surface 
using the following:
f
f
A feature class with sample elevation points
f
f
Two interpolation methods: Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) and Spline
For further research, please refer to: Geographic Information Analysis, 
David O'Sullivan and David Unwin, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2003, 
specifically the 8.3 Spatial interpolation recipe of Chapter 8, Describing 
and Analyzing Fields, pp.220-234.

between interpolated raster layers and the ContourLine vector layer. The IDW 
method works well with a proper density of sample points. Try to create a new surface 
using the IDW tool and the ContourAndPoint layer as sample points.
16.	 Save your map as MyInterpolation.mxd and close ArcMap.
You can find the final results at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\SpatialAnalyst \
Interpolation.
How it works...
The IDW method generated an average surface that will not cross through the known point 
elevation values and will not estimate the values below the minimum or above the maximum 
given point values. The IDW tool allows you to define polyline barriers or limits in searching 
sample points for interpolation. Even if the WatercourseL polyline feature classes do not have 
elevation values, river features can be used to interrupt the continuity of interpolated surfaces.

Working with Spatial Analyst
260
To obtain fewer averaged estimated values (reduce the IDW smoother effect) you have to:
f
f
Reduce the sample size to 6 points
f
f
Choose a variable search radius
f
f
Increase the power to 2
The Power option defines the influence of sample point values. This value increases with the 
distance. There is a disadvantage because around a few sample points, there are small areas 
raised above the surrounding surface or small hollows below the surrounding surface.
The Spline method has generated a surface that crosses through all the known point 
elevation values and estimates the values below the minimum or above the maximum  
sample point values. Because the density of points is quite low, we reduced the sample 
size to 6 points and defined a variable search radius of 500 meters in order to reduce the 
smoothening effect.
The Regularized option estimates the hills or depressions that are not cached by the sample 
point values. The Tension option will force the interpolated values to stay closer to the sample 
point values.
Starting from step 12, we increased the number of sample points in order to better estimate 
the surface. At step 14, notice that the Spline with Barriers tool allows you to use the polygon 
feature class as breaks or barriers in searching sample points for interpolation.
Reclassifying a raster
When you reclassify a raster, you reassign one or more cell values or a range of values to new 
output cell values. You may need to reclassify a raster to:
f
f
Update the cell values with new information from the field
f
f
Simplify raster data
f
f
Add cell values to a common scale
f
f
Exclude values from analysis by setting those values to NoData
f
f
Include NoData cells in analysis by setting values to those cells 
The classification method and the number of classes you define will affect the raster 
displaying and interpreting process.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will add the cell values to a common scale for three thematic raster layers: 
LandUse, SlopeProcent, and Aspect.

Chapter 9
261
How to do it...
Follow these steps to reclassify three raster layers:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open a new map document. Add the following datasets to the map:
Â
Â
The LandUse feature class from ...Data\SpatialAnalyst\ 
TOPO5000.gdb\LandUse
Â
Â
The Elevation, SlopeProcent, and Aspect rasters from 
SpatialAnalyst\ScratchTOPO5000.gdb
2.	 Save your map as ReclassifyRaster.mxd. Load the Spatial Analyst extension 
and set the analysis environment, as you learned in the previous recipe.
Firstly, you will convert the LandUse vector layer in a discrete thematic raster with a 
cell size of 0.5 meters:
3.	 In ArcToolbox, expand Conversion Tools | To Raster, and double-click on the 
Polygon to Raster tool to open the dialog box. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Input Features: LandUse
Â
Â
Value Field: CAT
Â
Â
Output Raster Dataset: ...ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\LandUse
Â
Â
Cell assignment type (optional): MAX_AREA
4.	 Accept the default values for all other parameters. Click on OK. Add the LandUse 
raster to your map.
5.	 Right-click on the LandUse raster layer and select Properties | Symbology. For the 
Unique Values display, change Color Schema to Terra Tones. Select the Black 
color for Display NoData as. Click on OK.
6.	 A discrete raster has associated an attribute table named the Value Attribute Table 
(VAT). Open its Value Attribute Table. The Value field stores the subtype codes from 
the input LandUse vector layer. You worked with that code in the Creating subtypes 
recipe of Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase.

How it works...
This is how these steps work:

At step 5, you saw NoData for the LandUse raster layer. The surface from the 
LandUse feature class follows the trapezoid shape of the scanned map. Your output 
LandUse raster is a grid of square cells (4,967 rows and 4,656 columns).
f
f
At step 8, you set NoData for the Hydrography and Transportation cell values 
in order to exclude them from future analysis.
The reclassification range is common for all three raster layers: from 1 to 5. The value 1 
means the most suitable value, while the value 5 means the least suitable value.
There's more...
Let's suppose we want to find the best places for fruit orchards by overlaying the following 
rasters: ReclassLU, ReclassSlope, and ReclassAspect. In our scenarios, we are 
searching the Pasture, Meadow, or Unproductive surface with slope range value from 7 
percent, to 15 percent and direction range from southeast to southwest.
In the next steps, you will find suitable places for the fruit orchards using weight raster layers:
1.	 Open the last saved map document, ReclassifyRaster.mxd. In ArcToolbox, 
expand Spatial Analyst Tools | Overlay and double-click on the Weighted  
Overlay tool.
2.	 For the Evaluation scale, select 1 to 5 by 1 from the drop-down list.
3.	 Click on the Add raster row button to add ReclassLU, ReclassSlope, and 
ReclassAspect. Field contains the reclassified values of the LandUse raster, and 
Scale Value refers to the ranking of suitability. Be sure those columns have the same 
values.
Define the percent of influence for all raster layers.
4.	 Assign to ReclassLU an influence of 50 percent, to ReclassSlope an influence of 
30 percent, and to ReclassAspect an influence of 20 percent. Set Output raster: 
...ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Fruit_Orchards. Click on OK. Open its Fruit_
Orchards attribute table to inspect the result. There are only three cells with value 
1, which represent the most suitable surface.
5.	 Save your map and close ArcMap.

Thus, we conclude this:

We didn't find the most suitable surface with value 1âappropriate land use, slope, 
and aspect for a fruit orchard

We obtained a reasonable alternative value 2
Working with Map Algebra
Map Algebra is the math for raster datasets. The math-like expressions contain operators (for 
example, Divide, Equal To, And, Over, and InList) and functions (for example, Mean, 
Con, Slope, and Aspect).
Some Map Algebra operators and functions return logical values: True (logical value 1) 
and False (logical value 0). Be aware of NoData cell values because Map Algebra will not 
interpret this nonzero value as a true condition.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will use Map Algebra expressions to identify the suitable sites for fruit 
orchards and reforestation. You will update the LandUse raster dataset with the proposed 
forest and fruit orchard sites using a Map Algebra operator called Over.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to learn how to work with Map Algebra:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document MapAlgebra.mxd from: 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\SpatialAnalyst.
2.	 Add the following rasters created in the Reclassifying a raster recipe: 
ReclassAspect and LandUse. Load the Spatial Analyst extension and set the 
analysis environment. In the Table Of Contents section, turn off all layers except 
SlopePercent.
In the next step, you will convert the floating point slope value to an integer value:

Working with Spatial Analyst
266
3.	 In ArcToolbox, expand Spatial Analyst Tools | Map Algebra and double-click, the 
Raster Calculator tool to open the dialog box, as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Double-click on the Int operator to start building the expression. Move the cursor 
into the brackets and double-click on the SlopePercent layer. Rename the  
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Slope_Integer. Click on OK.
5.	 Explore the value attribute table of the Slope_Integer raster layer.
You will create a new raster with slope percent equal to or greater than 15 percent:
6.	 Reopen the Raster Calculator tool. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Build the following expression: "Slope_Integer">= 15
Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Slope_Forest
7.	
Click on OK. Open its value attribute table to inspect the fields and values. The cells 
with a slope value equal to or greater than 15 percent have the logical value 1 or 
true. Cells with other values have the logical value 0 or false.
8.	 You will create a new raster with slope percent from 7 to 14. Open the Raster 
Calculator tool. Set the following:
Â
Â
Build the following expression:
InList("Slope_Integer",[7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14])
Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Slope_Fruit

Chapter 9
267
9.	 Click on OK. Open its value attribute table to inspect the fields and values. The raster 
cells have values from 7 to 14. All other cells are assigned NoData, which means 
there is no assigned (or recorded) value. Please remember that NoData does not 
mean zero value.
10.	 For Display NoData as, select the Black color to see the cells with NoData.
11.	 You will extract from the LandUse raster only Arable, Pasture, and Meadow land 
use types. Open the Raster Calculator tool. Set the following:
Â
Â
Build the following expression:
InList("LandUse",[11, 12,13])
Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\LandUse_Good
12.	Click on OK. Open the value attribute table to inspect the fields and values. For 
Display NoData as, select the Black color to see the cells with NoData.
You will identify areas suitable for fruit orchards by putting together LandUse_Good 
and Slope_Fruit using the Boolean And tool from Spatial Analyst Tools | Math | 
Logical Toolset.
13.	Open the Boolean And tool and set the parameters, as shown in the  
following screenshot:
14.	 Click on OK. Open the value attribute table to inspect the fields and values. The cells 
with the logical true value 1 refer to the area suitable for a fruit orchard. All other cells 
are assigned NoData.
In the previous recipe, we have identified other important criteria: direction of slope 
and aspect of cells. The ReclassAspect cells already have integer values because 
they were reclassified. Let's use the Combinatorial And tool to add the corresponding 
cell values from the ReclassAspect raster to the value attribute table of Fruit_
Orchard. This will be equivalent to geoprocessing the overlay tool for vector datasets.

Working with Spatial Analyst
268
15.	In ArcToolbox, expand Spatial Analyst Tools | Math | Logical, and double-click on 
the Combinatorial And tool to open the dialog box. Set the following parameters:
16.	  Click on OK. Open the FO_Aspect value attribute table to inspect the fields  
and values.
17.	 You will update the LandUse raster with the proposed fruit orchard sites using a 
conditional if-else function. Open the Raster Calculator tool. Set the following:
Â
Â
Build the following expression:
Con(IsNull("FO_Aspect"),"LandUse", 100)
Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\LandUse_1
18.	Click on OK. Open the value attribute table to inspect the fields and values.
In the next steps, you will identify the suitable sites for reforestation by putting 
together LandUse_Good and Slope_Forest:
19.	Open the Raster Calculator tool. Set the following:
Â
Â
Build the following expression:
"LandUse_Good" & "Slope_Forest"
Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Reforestation
20.	Click on OK. Open the value attribute table to inspect the fields and values. The cells 
with the logical true value 1 refer to the area that should be reforested.
21.	 You should also update the LandUse_1 raster with the proposed forest sites using 
the Over operator. This operator will paste the Reforestation value 1 over 
the corresponding cells in the LandUse_1 raster. The value 0 will be replaced 
by the corresponding cell values in the LandUse_1 raster. The NoData cell from 
Reforestation will be transferred to the LandUse_1 raster. For this reason, we 
don't want to have NoData cells in the Reforestation raster.

Chapter 9
269
22.	Firstly, we have to change the NoData cells to 0. You have two main options:
Â
Â
A shortcut: Open the Reclassify tool and set the following new values:
Input Raster: Reforestation
Reclass field: Value
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Reclass_Forest
Don't check Change missing values to NoData (optional)
Â
Â
Follow the next steps using the Raster Calculator dialog::
Step 1: IsNull("Reforestration") and Output raster: ForestNoData
Step 2: Con("ForestNoData"= =0,"Reforestation",0) and Output 
raster: Forest_Final
Step 3: Con("Forest_Final"= =1,101,0); and Output raster: 
ForestReclass
23.	Open the Raster Calculator tool and build the following expression: 
Over("Reclass_Forest","LandUse_1").
24.	 Change the Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\LandUse_Update. Click on 
OK. You should obtain a raster similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:

Working with Spatial Analyst
270
25.	Symbolize the layer as shown in the following screenshot:
26.	For Label, use the code description of the land use subtypes from the table 
presented in the Reclassifying a raster recipe. Set the layer transparency to 40 
percent. Turn off all layers except the Hillshade and LandUse_Update raster 
layers. Save your map and close ArcMap.
You can find the results at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\SpatialAnalyst\
MapAlgebra.
How it works...
At step 15, you created the FO_Aspect raster that contains the proposed areas for fruit 
orchards. To update the LandUse raster with the proposed fruit orchard sites, you built the 
following expression at step 17: Con(IsNull("FO_Aspect"),"LandUse", 100).
The Con syntax is Con (<condition>, <true_expression>, {false_
expression}).

Chapter 9
271
The expression means if (a cell from FO_Aspect contains NoData), then return the LandUse 
cell value, else return a value of 100.
You used the IsNull function with the Con function to replace the NoData value with  
the value 100.
Starting with step 22, you want to update once again the LandUse raster with the proposed 
forest sites using the Over operator. But first you have to assign the NoData cells a value. 
The first option is quite intuitive if you use the Reclassify tool.
The second option describes the steps when you use the Raster Calculator dialog:
f
f
IsNull("Reforestration")
The IsNull function tests the Reforestration  raster cells for the NoData value 
and returns true (1). All other values from Reforestration  will have the false 
value (0).
f
f
Con("ForestNoData"= =0,"Reforestation",0)
This means that if a cell from ForestNoData is equal to 0, then return the 
Reforestation cell value, else return a value of 0.
f
f
Con("Forest_Final"= =1,101,0)
This means that if a cell from Forest_Final is equal to 1, then return the 101 
value, else return a value of 0. The Con function will return NoData when no value is 
given for the false argument. 
You have used the IsNull function with the Con function to replace the NoData value with 
the LandUse cell values.
Working with Cell Statistics
ArcGIS Spatial Analyst classifies the statistical functions in three basic groups: local, 
neighborhood, and zonal. In this recipe, you will work with the Local Cell Statistics tool.  
The Cell Statistics function compares the corresponding cells in two or more raster 
datasets and calculates descriptive statistics, such as: Majority, Mean, Median, or 
Standard Deviation.
For theoretical aspects about statistical methods, please refer 
to Statistical Methods For Geography, Peter Rogerson, SAGE 
Publications Ltd., Inc., 2001.

Working with Spatial Analyst
272
Getting ready
In the previous recipe, Working with Map Algebra, you have updated the LandUse raster 
dataset with new forest and fruit orchard sites. In this recipe, you will compare the LandUse 
raster created in 2010 with the LandUse_2015 raster created in 2015.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to learn how to work with the Cell Statistics tool:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document Statistics.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\SpatialAnalyst\CellStatistics.
2.	 Open ArcToolbox. Go to Geoprocessing | Environments and set the geoprocessing 
environment as follows:

3.	 To find the logical difference between the LandUse and LandUse_2015 raster 
layers, you will use the Cell Statistics functions.
4.	 In ArcToolbox, expand Spatial Analyst Tools | Local, and double-click on the Cell 
Statistics tool. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Input raster or constant value 1: ScratchTOPO.gdb\LandUse

Check Ignore NoData in calculation (optional)
5.	 Click on OK. The cells with value 2 are representing areas that have changed. Turn 
off all raster layers except the LandUse_Diff layer.
Let's find the land use types that have been changed:

Input conditional raster: ScratchTOPO.gdb\LandUse_Diff
Â
Â
Build the following expression: Value >1

Chapter 9
275
How it works...
Using the Cell Statistics tool is quite simple, but the output raster contains only two values, 1, 
which means no change in land use, and 2, which indicates land use change.
In the previous steps, you answered the following questions:
f
f
Question 1: What are the old land use types that have been changed?
You built the following expression: if a cell from LandUse_Diff is greater than 1, 
then return the LandUse value, else return a value of 0.
Answer: Arable, Pasture, and Meadow land use.
f
f
Question 2: What are the new land use types for the changed areas?
You built the following expression: if a cell from LandUse_Diff is greater than 1, 
then return the LandUse_2015 value, else return a value of 0.
Answer: Fruit orchard and Forest land use.
There's more...
There is a shortcut to obtain the old land use types that have been changed  
(Old_LandUse results):
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the previous map document Statistics.mxd.
2.	 In ArcToolbox, expand Spatial Analyst Tools | Math | Logical and double-click on 
the Diff tool. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Input raster or constant value 1: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\LandUse
Â
Â
Input raster or constant value 2: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\LandUse_
Update
Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Difference
3.	 Click on OK. Save your map and close ArcMap.
You have obtained the old land use for those areas planned for plantation. The cells with 
value 0 represent the cells that have the same values in both rasters. Be aware of the order 
of the input raster because the first raster cell values will be returned if the cell values are 
different in the first raster and the second raster.

Working with Spatial Analyst
276
Generalizing a raster
In the raster dataset, a zone is a class of elements represented by one or more cells that are 
connected or disconnected and that have the same value. The LandUse layer has zones or 
types of parcels, such as Arable, Pasture, Forest, and so on.
The Arable zone with the cell value 11 has a lot of disconnected areas or regions.  
A region is a group of connected cells having the same value. A zone is composed of  
one or more regions.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will generalize the LandUse_2015 raster. The generalization process will 
change the values of the small-region areas to the values of the larger neighbor regions. The 
parcels with area below 625 meters square are not represented in a classic topographic map 
at scale 1:5,000. On the sheet map, this polygon area means a square of 5 millimeters. The 
LandUse_2015 raster has a cell size of 0.5 meters. For this reason, you will dissolve the 
regions smaller than 50 x 50 = 2500 cells.
The roads, rivers, and build-up areas should not be affected by the generalization process (for 
example, edge changed or dissolved). Surface types such as arable, pasture, and vineyard will 
be affected by generalization. Here's how the resultant map looks:

How it works...
This is how these steps work:
f
f
At step 3, you excluded three zones by assigning them a NoData value.
f
f
At step 4, you delimitated the regions for all land use zones. Every region from the 
Regions layer has a unique value and its associated zone value. In this way, you can 
identify the regions with a small number of cells.
f
f
At step 5, you calculated the area of each zone from the raster.
In order to replace all regions smaller than 625 meters, you have to create two 
groups of regions: 1 = regions larger than 625 meters, and NoData = smaller 
region. When you use the Set Null function, you have two options: working with 
the area or the number of cells.
f
f
At step 8, you used the Nibble clean-up function. You replaced the zone value from 
the Con_LandUse layer with the zone values of the nearest neighbor regions based 
on the raster mask built at step 7. The NoData cells from the mask raster indicate 
the cells that should change the zone value.
Your generalized raster does not contain the three zones excluded at step 3. At step 9, you 
assigned the true value 1 to NoData cells. At step 10, you updated the value 1 with the 
corresponding cell values from LandUse_2015.

the output (derived raster) will be saved at ...\SpatialAnalyst\Generalised\TOPO_

Kernel (Kernel Density Estimation or (KDE)âuse a circular search area centered 
on the sample point or polyline feature; the cell value is calculated based on the 
overlapping kernel-density surface values

Working with Spatial Analyst
280
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will prepare data for analysis by representing the built-up area using the 
Buildings polygon feature class. You will use the kernel density function to estimate the 
number of buildings per square kilometer. Using the same function, you will create the density 
surfaces based on the selected features (for example, dwellings and dwellings made of clay) 
and based on an attribute field (for example, the number of families, population, and so on).
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create two density raster surfaces:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open the existing map document DensitySurfaces.mxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\SpatialAnalyst.
2.	 Open ArcToolbox and set the geoprocessing environment, as follows:
Â
Â
Workspace | Current Workspace: Data\SpatialAnalyst\
TOPO5000.gdb and Scratch Workspace: Data\SpatialAnalyst\
ScratchTOPO5000.gdb
Â
Â
Output Coordinates: Same as Input
Â
Â
Cartography | Reference Scale: 5000
Â
Â
Raster Analysis | Cell Size: 0.5
In the next step, you will delineate the built-up area that will define the  
density processing extent:
3.	 Open the Buildings attribute table. Notice the empty field named 
BuiltUp. You will use this field in the next step.
4.	 In ArcToolbox, go to Cartography Tools | Generalization, and double-click on the 
Delineate Built-Up Areas tool. Click on Show Help to see the meaning of every 
parameter. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Input Building Layers: TOPO5000.gdb\Buildings\Buildings
Â
Â
Identifier Field (optional): BuiltUp
Â

Grouping Distance: 1000 with unit as Meters
Â
Â
Minimum Detail Size: 5 with unit as Meters
Â
Â
Edge Features (optional): TOPO5000.gdb\Transportation\Road
Â
Â
Minimum Building Count (optional): 2
5.	 Click on OK. Notice that the BuiltUp field from the Buildings value attribute table 
has been populated with the building status code.

6.	 Symbolize the BuiltUp_Area layer, as follows: Hollow style with Outline: 
Boundary, Township and Outline Width: 1.7. In the Table Of Contents section, 
move the layer below the Buildings and Road layers.
7.	
Let's create a point feature class from the Buildings polygon feature class. In 
ArcToolbox, go to Data Management Tools | Features, and double-click on the 
Feature to Point tool. Set the following parameters:

Input Feature: TOPO5000.gdb\Buildings\Buildings
Â
Â
Output Feature Class: TOPO5000.gdb\Buildings\BuildingsP
Â
Â
Check Inside (optional); click on OK
8.	 Turn off all layers except BuildingsP and BuiltUp_Area. Go to  
Geoprocessing | Environments, and update the following parameter:  
Processing Extent: BuiltUp_Area.
Let's create a population density surface using a 200-meter search radius:
9.	 In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Density, and double-click on the 
Kernel Density tool. Click on Show Help to see the meaning of every parameter. Set 
the following parameters:
Â
Â
Input Building Layers: BuildingsP
Â
Â
Population field: NumberPersons
Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Population_200
Â
Â
Output cell size (optional): 0.5
Â
Â
Search radius (optional): 200
Â
Â
Area units (optional): SQUARE_KILOMETERS; click on OK
Let's create a family's density surface using a 200-meter search radius:
10.	 In ArcToolbox, double-click on the Kernel Density tool. Set the  
following parameters:
Â
Â
Input Building Layers: BuildingsP
Â
Â
Population field: NumberFamilies
Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Families_200
Â
Â
Set the rest of the parameters the same as at step 9; click on OK
Let's create a dwelling density surface using a 200-meters search radius:
11.	 Open the BuildingsP attribute table. Click on Table Options and select the Select 
By Attributes option. Build the following expression for the Use Of Buildings (CDC) 
field: CDC = 1. Click on Apply. The expression will select the Dwelling features. Based 
on the selected features, you will create a density surface.

Working with Spatial Analyst
282
12.	In ArcToolbox, double-click on the Kernel Density tool. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Input Building Layers: BuildingsP
Â
Â
Population field: <none>
Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO5000.gdb\Dwelling_200
Â

Set the rest of the parameters in the same way as in step 9; click on OK.
Let's do an empirical analysis based on the old dwellings made of clay and 
population density. We assume that elderly people have, in general, old dwellings.  
We expect the population density to be quite low in areas with a high density of  
clay houses.
13.	Firstly, select the clay dwelling with the following expression: CMA = 4 AND CDC 
= 1. Secondly, repeat step 12, and create the OldDwellings_200 density 
surface based on the selected features. Explore the results by comparing the 
Population_200 and OldDwellings_200 density surfaces as shown in the 
following screenshot:
14.	 Save your map as MyDensitySurfaces.mxd and close ArcMap.

Chapter 9
283
How it works...
From steps 4 to 8, you prepared your data for density analysis. For the density surface, we 
have used a constant value for the radius of the circular search area around the buildings. 
If you increase the value of the search radius, you will obtain a more generalized surface of 
density. This might help you to identify particular areas of density or hotspots that are not so 
obvious at a 200-meter radius.
Analyzing the least-cost path
A least-cost path analysis uses a cost-weighted distance surface and a cost-weighted direction 
surface to create the smallest cost of travelling path from the source to the destination. The 
cost refers to one or more factors that could affect the travel. Cost factors, such as slopes or 
speed-restriction areas, define the cost surfaces. Those cost surfaces can be combined if the 
cost values use a common scale (for example, from value 1âbest to value 10âworst). A least-
cost path will follow the cells with the smallest accumulated cost.
Getting ready
In the Analyzing surfaces recipe, you studied the visibility between two geodetic points 
in order to plan some topographic surveys. Let's suppose you have two teams for this 
topographic survey campaign. Now, it is time to plan the trip from your office to the field. Your 
best routes will follow the roads with shallow slopes. The following model shows the workflow

8.	 Click on OK. Symbolize the raster layer as follows: Color Schema to Slope. 
For Display NoData as select Black. Click on OK. Open the Reclass_Slope raster 
attribute table to inspect the result.
In the next step, you will create a total-cost raster layer. You are expecting to obtain a 
total-cost raster layer with cell values from 2 to 20:
9.	 Expand Spatial Analyst Tools | Math and double-click on the Plus tool. Set the 
following parameters:

Let's calculate the cost distance and cost direction starting from the MyOffice 
vector layer:
11.	 Expand Spatial Analyst Tools | Distance and double-click on the Cost Distance

12.	 Click on OK. Running the Cost Distance tool will take you around 15 minutes.
Let's identify the least-cost path from the office to points 8 and 72:
13.	Expand Spatial Analyst Tools | Distance and double-click on the Cost Path tool.  
Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Input raster or feature destination data: TriangulationPoint

Â
Â
Output raster: ScratchTOPO.gdb\LeastCostPath

14.	 Click on OK. You should obtain two least-cost paths, as shown in the  
following screenshot:

How it works...
This is how these steps work:
f

At step 3, you reclassified cell values for the LandUse raster layer. The new value 1 
for code 41 means that Transportation is the best land use for our path. We will 
try to avoid crossing the Hydrography and Other Terrains (for example, built-up 
area) land use and value 10 indicates the worst choice.
f
f
At step 6, you reclassified the cell values of the SlopePercent raster layer using the 
same scale values as the LandUse raster layer. The reclass value 1 corresponds to a 
shallow slope between 0 and 2 percent. This slope range is the most suitable for our 
path. Again, value 10 represents the worst slope range for the path.
With the two reclassified layers in a common scale, you created a total cost raster layer at step 
9 using the Plus tool. At step 11, you calculated the input for the least-cost path: cost distance 
and the cost direction as shown in the following screenshots:
   
Cost distance values represent accumulated costs and not distance values. Cost direction 
values range between 1 and 8. The value 0 represents the source cell. The code from 1 to 8 
represents the direction to the least-cost cell back to the source cell.
Going further, you calculated the least-cost path or the shortest path between the MyOffice 
source layer and the TriangulationPoint destination layer using the two cost surfaces. 
The least-cost paths follow the cells with the smallest distance and direction cost, and 
represent the smallest sum of cell cost between the source and two destinations.

Introduction
The 3D Analyst extension allows you to display and analyze your 3D data. 3D data means 
3D features, rasters, and Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs). This 3D data contains 
a z-value. A z-value refers to an attribute other than the horizontal position (for example, 
projected x and y coordinates). In this chapter, your z-value will represent the normal heights 
(gravity-related height) expressed in meters.
The particular term height and the general term elevation are used interchangeably in this 
chapter because some ArcGIS instruments and parameters use the term: elevation. The term 
elevation means the height above a given level. In particular, our height term means the 
height above the local mean sea level.

According to the international standard ISO 19111:2007 on geographic informationâspatial 
referencing by coordinates:

A gravity-related height is a height dependent on Earth's gravity field.
f
f
A normal height (H) is a gravity-related height that approximates the distance of a 
point above the mean sea level.
f
f
A Mean Sea Level (MSL) is the average level of the surface of the sea over all 
stages of tide and seasonal variations. In the local context, MSL is calculated from 
observations at one or more points over a given period of time.
For theory about gravity-related height, please refer to Jonathan Iliffe and 
Roger Lott, Datums and Map Projections 2nd Edition; Whittles Publishing, 
2012, pp.30-35 and pp. 135-140.
In this chapter, you will work in the ArcScene 3D environment.
Creating 3D features from 2D features
A 3D feature is a 2D feature that has elevation (height) values (z-values) stored in its  
geometry. When you are creating a new feature class in your geodatabase, you have from the 
first panel Geometry Properties: Coordinate include Z values. Used to store 3D data. In 
Chapter 1, Designing Geodatabase, you created feature classes that store only 2D features.
In this recipe, you will convert the existing simple features (2D) into 3D features using  
two methods:
f
f
Based on the height values from a raster surface

How to do it...
Follow these steps to convert 2D features into 3D features:
1.	 Start ArcScene and open an existing scene document 3DFeatures.sxd from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\3DAnalyst.
2.	 From the Geoprocessing menu, select Environments. Set the geoprocessing 
environment as follows:
Â
Â

Scratch Workspace: Data\3DAnalyst\ScratchTOPO5000.gdb
Â
Â
Output Coordinates: Same as Input

Processing Extent: Same as the Elevation layer 
Let's set base heights for the layers and vertical exaggeration for the scene:
1.	 In the Table Of Contents section, rightâclick on the Elevation raster layer, and 
navigate to Properties | Base Heights. Check Floating on a custom surface: 
Elevation. Click on Raster Resolution. For Base Surface, set Cellsize X to 2.5 
and Cellsize Y to 2.5. Notice that the number of Rows and Columns is automatically 
updated. By decreasing the display resolution, you will improve the display 
performance. Click on OK.
2.	 Click on the Rendering tab, check Render layer at all times, and type 0.05 seconds 
for Draw simpler level of detail if navigation refresh rate exceeds.
The ArcScene redraws or renders the layers every time you make a navigation 
movement. By decreasing the refresh rate, ArcScene will only have time to draw a 
blue skeleton of your raster layer while you are exploring the scene with the Navigate 
tool. When you stop navigating the scene, the raster layer will render normally.
3.	 In the Effects section, choose 10 for the Select the drawing priority option. The 
Elevation layer will have the lowest drawing priority in comparison with other layers 
from the scene document. The highest priority is value 1. Click on Apply and OK.

Working with 3D Analyst
294
4.	 Set the vertical exaggeration for the scene. From the View menu, navigate to Scene 
Properties | General. Select 2 for Vertical Exaggeration. Click on OK. Try to navigate 
around the scene using the Navigate tool, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 In ArcScene, 2D feature layers have their base height set to 0 by default. The 
PointElevation and Buildings 2D feature layers are displayed below the 
Elevation layer. Repeat step 3 for the PointElevation feature layer using the 
same surface base heights. For Select the drawing priority option, type 1. Set the 
base height for the Buildings feature layer and for the Select the drawing priority 
option, choose 5.
Your 2D feature layers have been added to the Elevation surface. Turn off the  
2D feature layers. Let's convert the PointElevation 2D feature layers to a  
3D feature layer:
6.	 In ArcToolbox, expand 3D Analyst Tools | 3D Features, and double-click on the 
Feature to 3D by Attributes tool. Click on Show Help to see the meaning of every 
parameter. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Input Features: TOPO5000.gdb\Relief\PointElevation

Click on OK. Notice that the PointElevation3D feature layer is directly displayed in 
the 3D space based on the z-value in the point geometry. Open its attribute table. The 
Shape field stores the Point Z geometry.
Let's convert the Building 2D polygon feature layers to a 3D feature layer using the 
Elevation surface raster, as follows:

9.	 Accept the default values for all other parameters. Click on OK.
10.	 Note that the Buildings3D feature layer is directly displayed in the 3D space 
based on the z-value into the polygon geometry. Open the attribute table of the 
Buildings3D feature. The Shape field stores the Polygon Z geometry.
Let's improve the 3D appearance of buildings by extruding the polygon features 
according to the number of levels, as follows:
11.	 In the Table Of Contents section, right-click on the Buildings3D layer, and navigate 
to Properties | Extrusion. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Check Extrude features in layer
Â
Â
Extrusion value or expression: [Stories]*3
Â
Â
Apply extrusion by: adding it to each feature's minimum height
12.	Click on OK and explore the results, as shown in the following screenshot:
13.	Save your scene document as My3DFeatures.sxd and close ArcScene.
You can find the final results at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\
Data\3DAnalyst\3DFeatures.

Working with 3D Analyst
296
How it works...
At step 6, you assigned z-values to point features directly from the Elevation field. The Z from 
the Shape geometry field confirms the 3D feature type.
At step 8, the raster cell values were interpolated to the assigned z-values to every vertex of 
the 3D polygon feature.
For the PointElevation3D and Buildings3D layers, it's not necessary anymore to set the 
base heights (topographic surface). Note also that subtypes and domains were kept in the  
new 3D feature classes.
At step 11, you raised the building from the ground using the number of levels multiplied by 
3. The value 3 could represent the height of one level expressed in meters. From the Tools 
toolbar, use Measure tool | Measure Height to measure the reservoir height above the 
topographic surface, as shown in the following screenshot:

Creating a TIN surface
A Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) is mesh of non-overlapping triangles that represent 
a continuous surface. This surface is built by triangulating a set of points that have z-values 
using the Delaunay triangulation method. This method generates triangles that are as near 
as possible to an equilateral triangle. The set of points represent the primary source of  
height values (mass points) and incorporates point features or vertices of the polyline and 
polygon features.
For theoretical aspects about TIN and Delaunay triangulation, please 
refer to David O'Sullivan and David Unwin, Geographic Information 
Analysis, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2003, page 28 and 215 to 220.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will create a TIN surface using 2D feature classes. You will also update the 
TIN surface with new, upcoming features, such as building footprints and a fish pond.

1.	 Start ArcScene and open an existing scene document TIN.sxd from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\3DAnalyst.
Keep the geoprocessing environment from the previous recipe. From the 
Geoprocessing menu, select Geoprocessing Options. Check whether Background

4.	 Click on OK. In the Table Of Contents section, move the BuildingsFromTIN layer 
above all layers.
Let's update the TIN with buildings from the BuildingsFromTIN layer and with a 
fish pond from the Lake layer.

6.	 Uncheck Constrained Delaunay (optional) and click on OK.
7.	
In the Table Of Contents section, turn off all layers except Topo5k TIN, 
BuildingsFromTIN, and Lake. For the Lake feature layer, set Topo5k TIN as the 
base height, and for Layer offset, type 0.5. For the BuildingsFromTIN feature 
layer, set Extrusion | Extrusion value or expression to [Stories]*2. For the 
Topo5k TIN, go to Layer Properties | Symbology, and uncheck Edge types, and for 
Elevation, choose the Surface color ramp.
8.	 From View | Scene Properties | General, set Vertical Exaggeration to 2. You should 
obtain the following results:
9.	 Inspect the results. Using the Identify tool, click on the fishpond from the 
BuildingsFromTIN layer to get the following  information. Aspect with  
values -1 means a flat area.
10.	 Save your scene document as MyTIN.sxd, and close ArcScene.
You can find the results at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\3DAnalyst\TIN.

Working with 3D Analyst
300
How it works...
The elevation (height) points and vertices of the contour lines will be used as mass 
points to define the TIN surface. You have used scarps, water courses, and roads as hard 
lines; therefore, the TIN triangles will not cross the linear features. Leave unchecked the 
Constrained Delaunay (optional) option; you will allow the Delaunay triangulation process to 
build multiple triangle edges on the hard lines (breaklines).
At step 5, you updated the TIN surface with flat areas with constant height values. The 
fishpond from the Lake 2D feature layer has the value 225 meters stored in the Elevation 
field. The building footprints from the BuildingsFromTIN 3D feature layer have z-values 
incorporated into the polygon geometry or the Shape field.
Creating a terrain dataset
A terrain is a multi-resolution surface stored as a feature class in a feature dataset within a 
geodatabase. A terrain does not actually store the represented surface unlike TINs or rasters, 
which do. A terrain only references the participating feature classes and derives TINs at 
various resolutions on the fly, depending on the display scale. A terrain must be created within 
a feature dataset together with the feature classes that are used in it. That way, the terrain, 
terrain surface, and terrain dataset terms are often used interchangeably. You cannot see 
a terrain surface in the ArcScene environment, but you can use the ArcMap and ArcGlobe 
applications.
The terrain is used for large amounts of data. In this recipe, you will work with Light Detection 
and Ranging (LiDAR) data. LiDAR is an optical remote-sensing technology that provides 
detailed 3D elevation data.
For further research about LiDAR remote-sensing technology, please 
refer to George Vosselman and Hand-Gerd Maas, Airborne and

In this recipe, you will create a terrain using an ASCII text file that stores LiDAR point-cloud 
data. Your point cloud contains 5 million points. Those points represent a Digital Terrain 
Model (DTM) or ground data.
In Windows Explorer, go to the <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\3DAnalyst\LiDAR 
folder. Explore the dtm.xyz ASCII file with the Notepad application.

How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a terrain dataset:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog and go to Customize | Extensions to check the 3D 
Analyst extension. In Catalog Tree, go to <drive>:\PacktPublishing\
Data\3DAnalyst\TOPO5000.gdb.
2.	 Your geodatabase already contains an empty feature dataset named Terrain. 
Right-click on the Terrain feature dataset and choose Properties | XY Coordinate 
System. The current projected coordinate reference system is Pulkovo_1942_
Adj_58_Stereo_70 with the EPSG code as 3844. Click on Z Coordinate System. 
The vertical coordinate reference system is a national gravity-related height system 
called Constanta (Black Sea 1975) with the EPSG code as 5781.
In the next steps, you will calculate the basic statistics of dtm.xyz, and convert mass 
points from the ASCII file to a multipoint feature class:
3.	 In ArcToolbox, expand 3D Analyst Tools | Conversion | From File, and double-click 
on the Point File Information tool. Set the following parameters:

4.	 Accept the default values for all other parameters. Click on OK. You have obtained a 
polygon feature that defines the XY extent of your LiDAR data.
5.	 Open ArcMap. Add the DTMInfo feature class to your map. Save your map document 
as MyTerrain.mxd in the ...Data\3DAnalyst folder. Open the DTMInfo 
attribute table to view the following statistical information: Pt_Count: 5,722,782 
points; Pt_Spacing: 1.005; Z_Min: 214.77, and Z_Max: 250.85. Close the table 
and turn off the DTMInfo layer.

12.	Let's examine the properties of the DTM terrain layer. Right-click on the DTM layer and 
choose Properties | Display. Let's reduce the default number of points used in the 
rendering process. From the Apply point limit value, erase a zero to obtain the point 
80,000. If you want to see the height when you point to the map, check Show Map 
Tips. Click on OK. Display and explore the area of interest at the scale 5,000 and 
2,500. Apparently, there is no difference. But how about a 1:1,000 scale?
13.	Let's display the contour lines for the DTM terrain. Right-click on the DTM layer and 
choose Properties | Symbology. In the Show section, click on the Add button, 
and select Contour with the same symbol. Click on Add and Dismiss. Click on the 
Import button to import the symbol and parameter values from ...\3D Analyst\
Terrain\DTM.lyr. You should obtain the following results:

Chapter 10
305
14.	 Click on OK. Inspect the results. If you add the ContourLine 2D feature class, 
you can explore the difference between the topographic map surface at the scale 
1:5,000 and a new terrain surface, as shown in the following screenshot:
15.	In the Table Of Contents section, note that the Window Size label values is updated 
when you change the display scale. Save your map and close ArcMap.
You can find the results at ...\3DAnalyst\Terrain\Terrain.mxd.
How it works...
Before starting to load your LiDAR data into your geodatabase, you evaluated the point 
density. Because your ACSII file contains around five million records, you grouped the LiDAR 
points into multipoint features. The multipoint geometry reduces the size of the MassPoints 
output feature class and the number of rows in the attribute table.
The Window Size pyramid will divide the data extent into equal windows and will select the 
representative points with Z Mean (a z-value closest to the mean). You choose this option 
because you want to avoid the extreme values. The resultant surface will be integrated in our 
product, which is a topographic map at the scale 1:5,000.

Working with 3D Analyst
306
From steps 9 to 10, you defined the rules for display terrain (scalability). The Moderate 
secondary thinning method will eliminate irrelevant points but will preserve the linear 
discontinuities from your surface. If z-values in the window area are within 0.5 meters, then 
it will be considered a flat area and will result in a more generalized surface. The 0.5 meters 
represents twice the vertical accuracy of the LiDAR dataset. We assume that the vendor 
mentioned a vertical accuracy of 25 centimeters.
At step 10, you defined four pyramid levels. Those levels define the vertical accuracy of the 
terrain, through four ranges of scales. Note that Level 1 of Terrain Pyramid has a Window Size 
of 1 meter, which means that the full surface resolution will be displayed up to scale 1:1,000.
Creating raster and TIN from a terrain 
dataset
A terrain dataset can be converted to rasters or TINs using the geoprocessing tools from the 
3D Analyst toolbar. Why would we need to convert terrain to raster or TIN?
f
f
Starting from large-scale source data, you might want to obtain derivative vector or 
raster surfaces for small-scale (for example 1:25,000) applications.
f
f
You might need a raster surface to use statistical analysis tools from the  
Spatial Analyst extension.
f
f
You might want to refine and update the surface with new polygon or polyline  
features having a precision corresponding to the 1:3,000 scale. You will need a  
TIN with a vertical accuracy corresponding to that scale.
f
f
You might want to visualize your surfaces in ArcScene.
f
f
You might want to store the raster and TIN directly onto disk.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will generate a raster and a TIN based on the DTM terrain surface created in 
the previous recipe.
You can start from your map document MyTerrain.mxd and skip step 1. Otherwise, you will 
use the terrain surface from ...\Data\3DAnalyst\Terrain\TOPO5000.gdb.

Chapter 10
307
How to do it...
Follow these steps to convert a terrain dataset to raster and TIN using ArcMap:
1.	 Start ArcMap and open an existing map document, Terrain_ToRasterTIN.mxd, 
from ...\3DAnalyst\Terrain.
2.	 For the geoprocessing environment, set Current Workspace and Scratch 
Workspace: TOPO5000.gdb\Terrain. For Processing Extent, choose  
Union of Inputs.
3.	 In ArcToolbox, expand 3D Analyst Tools | Conversion | From Terrain, and  
double-click on the Terrain to Raster tool. Set the parameters, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Working with 3D Analyst
308
4.	 Click on OK. In the Table Of Contents section, drag the DTM_Raster.tif surface 
above the DTM terrain surface. Change the symbology from Black to White to 
Elevation#1 Color Ramp. In the Effects toolbar, select DTM_Raster.tif  
as the layer drawing. Inspect the result using the Swipe tool, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
5.	 In ArcToolbox, expand 3D Analyst Tools | Conversion | From Terrain, and  
double-click on the Terrain to TIN tool. Set the parameters, as shown in the  
following screenshot:

Chapter 10
309
6.	 Click on OK. In the Table Of Contents section, drag the DEM_TIN surface above the 
DTM raster surface. Inspect the result in the same manner as the step 4 screenshot.
7.	
Save your map as MyTerrain_ToRasterTIN.mxd and close ArcMap.
You can find the final results at ...\Data\3DAnalyst\Terrain\ ResultsTerrain_
ToRasterTIN.mxd.
How it works...
At step 3, you converted the terrain surface to a raster surface in the TIFF format. You used 
the natural neighbors interpolation method to obtain a smoother raster surface. Notice that 
you have to mention the .tif file extension to create a raster in the TIFF format. To define 
the cell size of your output raster, you mentioned CELLSIZE as 1. You will not improve the 
accuracy having a cell size smaller than the average point spacing of your initial LiDAR data. 
You have kept the full resolution of the input terrain by accepting the value 0 for the Pyramid 
Level Resolution parameter.
At step 5, you converted the terrain surface to a TIN surface. If you keep the value 0 for 
Pyramid Level Resolution, your geoprocessing tool will fail and display the message, The 
TIN will be too big. This is because of the allowed number of mass points in a TINâup to 
5,000,000. You chose Level 1 and accepted the default number of nodes.
Intervisibility
Intervisibility refers to the analysis of a sight line between an observer and a target feature 
through potential obstructions such as 3D surfaces or features.
Getting ready
We continue to plan the topographic survey campaign mentioned in Chapter 9, Working with 
Spatial Analyst, in the Analyzing surfaces and Analyzing the least-cost path recipes. In this 
recipe, you will analyze the visibility between three geodetic points and buildings  
(reservoirs and two churches).
TriangulationPoint3D has an attribute field named SurveyInstruments that stores the 
normal height (H) of the instrument calculated as the sum of the Height Black Sea'75 field 
and a constant value of 1.5 meters (height of the survey instrument).
Buildings3D has a field named H_Buildings that stores the height calculated as the sum 
of the Z_Mean, the normal height (H) field, and the approximate height of the building. The 
Z_Mean field has been calculated using the Add Z Informative tool.
The Buildings3D feature and the Elevation surface will be used as potential 
obstructions.

Working with 3D Analyst
310
How to do it...
Follow these steps to analyze the visibility between the 3D triangulation points and the 
polygon buildings, as shown in the following screenshot:
1.	 Start ArcScene and open the scene document, Intervisibility.sxd, from 
<drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\3DAnalyst\Intervisibility.
2.	 Firstly, you will select the reservoirs and two churches. Open the Buildings3D 
attribute table. Open the Select By Attributes tool and type the expression: CFC = 
319 OR CFC = 27. Click on Apply.
3.	 Only selected features will be used as target polygon features. In ArcToolbox, go to 
3D Analyst Tools | Visibility, and double-click on the Construct Sight Lines tool. Set 
the following parameters:
Â
Â
Observer Points: TriangulationPoint3D
Â
Â
Target Features: Buildings3D

4.	 Click on OK. Open the SightLines attribute table to inspect the fields. Based on 
those 33 sight lines, you will analyze the visibility. In ArcToolbox, go to 3D Analyst 
Tools | Visibility, and double-click on the Intervisibility tool. This tool will modify the 
input SightLines layer. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Sight Lines: SightLines
Â
Â
Obstructions: For this, add the Buildings3D and Elevation layers
5.	 Accept the default values for Visible Field Name (optional). Click on OK. The 
SightLines attribute table has been updated with a new field: VISIBLE.
There are 7 sight lines with VISIBLE value 0, which means they are obstructed by 
the elevation surface or buildings. The remaining 26 sight lines with value 1 are not 
obstructed, and there is visibility between the observer and target features.
6.	 Save your scene as MyIntervisibility.sxd and close ArcScene.
You can find the final results at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\3DAnalyst \
Intervisibility\Results_Intervisibility.sxd.
How it works...
Please note that the result of the Construct Sight Lines tool is a 3D polyline layer. By setting 
the value 100 for Sampling Distance (optional), we kept only one sight line between the 
triangulation points and the first vertex of every selected building feature, as shown in the 
previous image. If you type 0, a sight line will be created for every vertex of a building polygon.
Creating a profile graph
A profile graph shows the height changes along a given line. A profile graph can be  
created from:
f
f
3D line graphics (created with the Steepest path and Line of Sight tools)

How to do it...
Follow these steps to generate profiles using the SightLines3D 3D polyline layers, as shown 
in the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
313
1.	 Start ArcMap and open an existing map document, Profile.mxd, from <drive>:\
PacktPublishing\Data\3DAnalyst\ElevationProfile.
2.	 Load the 3D Analyst extension and add the 3D Analyst toolbar.
3.	 With the Select Feature tool, select a polyline feature from the SightLines3D 
layer. Click on the Profile Graph tool from the 3D Analyst toolbar. The z-value is 
represented along the Y axis and distance is represented along the X axis.
If you select more polyline features, you will obtain more 
profiles in the same graph.
4.	 Right-click on the profile graph, select the Properties option, and select the 
Appearance tab. For General graph properties, edit Title and Footer, and for Axis 
properties, add Title for Left and Bottom, as shown in the preceding screenshot. 
Click on OK.
5.	 Right-click on the profile graph, and select the Save option to save your graph as 
the MyProfile_P73ToReservoir.grf graph file to the ...\3DAnalyst\
ElevationProfile folder.
6.	 Right-click on the profile graph and select the Export option. In the Picture frame, 
select the as PDF format and accept the default parameters. Click on Save and go to 
the previous location. Save the PDF file as MyElevationProfile.pdf.
7.

on Save and repeat the previous step. Inspect the results with the Windows Explorer 
application.
8.	 In ArcMap, close the graph window. Go to View | Graphs and select Manage Graphs. 
If you right-click on ResultsProfile_P73ToReservoir, you will find the same 
options from steps 5 and 6. To reopen your graph, double-click on the selected graph. 
Explore by yourself Advanced Properties.
9.	 Save your map document as MyProfile.mxd and close ArcMap.
You can find the final results at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\3DAnalyst\ 
ElevationProfile\ResultsProfile.mxd. In the ResultsProfile.mxd map 
document, please go to View | Graphs, and explore all five profile graphs.

Working with 3D Analyst
314
How it works...
If you want to use the sight lines features created in the Intervisibility recipe, you have to go 
through the following steps:
1.	 Recreate the SightLines layer using the Construct Sight Lines tool, with Observer 
Height Field (optional) with the value Shape.Z and Target Height Field (optional) 
with the value Shape.Z. You will have a sight line at surface level. Notice that your 
sight lines have only two vertices along the polyline feature. Only two vertices are not 
enough for a profile graph.
2.	 Use the Densify tool with a DISTANCE of 50âunit as Metersâto add more vertices to 
the polyline features.
3.	 Use the Interpolate Shape tool with Interpolate Vertices Only checked. Your new 
vertices will have interpolated Z-values based on the Elevation surface.
The Profile_P73ToReservoir graph reflects the direction of polyline features. To change 
the direction of your path graphic (from point 73 to the reservoir), please follow the next steps: 
start an edit session, select the polyline with the Edit Vertices tool, rightâclick on the selected 
feature to change the polyline direction with Flip, and stop the edit session. Select the polyline 
and generate a new profile graph. Note that the direction of the graphic path has been changed.
There's more...
You can create profiles from a terrain surface, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
315
Open your map document MyProfile.mxd. Add the DTM terrain surface from 
...3DAnalyst\ ElevationProfile\TOPO5000.mdb\Terrain.
To activate the Terrain Point Profile tool, you have to symbolize the terrain surface with one of 
the three Terrain point renders. For the DTM terrain layer, choose the Terrain point 
elevation with graduated color ramp render.
In the 3D Analyst toolbar, choose DTM as the surface layer, select the Terrain Point Profile 
tool, and click on two locationsâthe starting and ending points. Change the width for the black 
selection box, as shown in the preceding image. A new profile graph will be displayed. From 
Properties | Appearance of the profile graph, check the option Graph in 3D view.
Save and export your terrain point profile using the View | Graphs | Manage Graphs  
dialog box.

Introduction
Interoperability means the capability of two or more systems to exchange information and 
use/interpret the information shared without knowledge of the data structure. According to 
the online ESRI GIS Dictionary:
The interoperability is required for a GIS user using software from one vendor to 
study data compiled with GIS software from a different provider.
There are two important aspects of data interoperability in GIS:
f
f
Spatial data type (for example, GIS, CAD, raster, XML, and LiDAR)
f
f
Spatial data format (for example, shapefile, DWG, ECW, GML, and XYZ)
Data standards support you in dealing with data interoperability issues. Standards refer to 
formats, data models, or both.

10.	 In ArcCatalog, inspect the output shapefile in the Preview: Table mode view. Your 
shapefile now has the codes and descriptions for subtypes and domains. 
11.	 Export the remaining feature classes at once by navigating to Export | To Shapefile 
(multiple).
12.	From Results | Current Session, double-click on Feature Class to reopen the tool. 
Change only the Input Features parameter and Output Feature Class. The Output 
Location and the Environment parameter will remain unchanged. Click on OK to run 
the tool again. Explore the results.
How it works...
At step 4, even if you uncheck all feature classes from a feature dataset, the exported XML 
workspace document will keep the empty feature dataset. To see the XML file, you can use the 
Notepad++ free text editor.

For more details about the XML schema of your 
geodatabase, please refer to the Esri white paper, XML 
Schema of the Geodatabase.pdf.
At the feature class level, you can save the data into an XML file using Export XML  
Recordset Document.
When you are sharing your schema, it's good practice to document the XML workspace. You 
should keep the metadata information or create supplementary material (for example, a PDF 
containing summary information about the lineage of data, responsible party, coordinate 
reference system, and spatial resolution).

If you want to see how your colleagues will generate a geodatabase schema from the 
XML workspace document received from you, please go to the next recipe Importing 
data from the XML format
Importing data from the XML format
An XML file can transport and store geodatabase schema and spatial data. Geodatabase  
XML is Esri's XML-based interchange format used to share data (workspace data) and 
geodatabase schema in full or in part (workspace definition) between geodatabases or other 
software systems.

Chapter 11
329
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will create a file geodatabase schema by importing an XML workspace 
document that contains only the workspace definition as shown in the following screenshot:
You will use the TOPO5000.XML file created in the previous exercise.
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a file geodatabase using as a template an ArcGIS XML  
workspace document:
1.	 In Catalog Tree, go to Interoperability\MyResults. Right-click on the 
MyResults folder and navigate to New | New File Geodatabase. Rename New File 
Geodatabase.gdb to MyTOPO.

Working with Data Interoperability

2.	 Right-click on TOPO5000.gdb and navigate to Import | XML Workspace Document. 
Check Schema Only and specify the XML source to import by selecting the 
TOPO5000.XML file you created in the previous recipe. Click on Next and Finish to 
start importing schema as shown in the following screenshots:
3.	 Expand MyTOPO.gdb to explore the contents.
You can find the results at <drive>:\PacktPublishing\Data\ Interoperability\
DataResults\MyTOPO_SchemaOnly.gdb.
How it works...
By importing an XML workspace document that stores a geodatabase schema, you saved a lot 
of time in defining the geodatabase structure. The feature datasets, feature classes, attribute 
domains, and subtypes are now built into the MyTOPO geodatabase.
There are lots of ArcGIS template data models at http://solutions.arcgis.com. Use 
your Esri global account created in Chapter 7, Exporting Your Maps, to download a sample data 
model from ArcGIS for Local Government | Land Records | Aggregate Authoritative Data.

Before starting to load data from any format, it's important to evaluate the existing data. 
By carefully planning the load steps, you will avoid losing data in the field-mapping step, 
generating duplicate/residual data or failing the entire load process. Here, you have some 
supplementary steps:
f
f
Change the data type of the attribute fields for the editable source data format (for 
example, shapefile, feature class)
f
f
Export source data in an intermediary editable format (for example, from the DXF 
format to a file geodatabase feature class, or from an Excel table to a dBASE or file 
geodatabase table)
f
f
Change the geometry of the source data according to the destination feature class
The field-mapping process can be a critical step if the data types of the target and source 
fields do not match properly.
Importing raster data
You can store one or more rasters in a geodatabase as:
f
f
Individual raster datasets
f
f
Mosaic dataset
f
f
Raster catalog
You have already worked with the raster dataset in Chapter 9, Working with Spatial Analyst 
and Chapter 10, Working with 3D Analyst.
In this recipe, you will work with the mosaic dataset and the raster catalog.
A mosaic dataset creates a seamless view of two or more adjacent or non-adjacent images. In 
a mosaic dataset, all rasters have the same cell size, format, and coordinate system. 
A raster catalog is a table that groups two or more raster datasets. In a catalog, rasters may 
have different cell sizes and different formats, but they must have the same coordinate system.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will create a mosaic dataset using four rasters in the Enhanced 
Compression Wavelet (ECW) file format.
For more details about the ECW raster format, refer to http://www.
hexagongeospatial.com/products/data-management-
compression/ecw.
All those four rasters are stored in the ...\Interoperability\SourceData\ECW folder.

Chapter 11
337
How to do it...
Follow these steps to create a raster catalog and a mosaic dataset using the ArcCatalog 
context menu and the ArcToolbox tools:
1.	 Start ArcCatalog. In the Catalog window, go to your Interoperability folder 
connection, and expand the SourceData\ECW folder to explore its contents. Those 
four rasters cover four small adjacent areas.
2.	 Right-click on the orthoimage_1.ecw raster, and select Properties | General. 
Inspect the properties of the raster, such as Number of Bands, Pixel Depth, and 
Pyramids resampling. Click on OK to close the dialog window.
3.	 From the Geoprocessing menu, select Environments. Set the geoprocessing 
environment as follows:
Â
Â
Workspace | Current and Scratch Workspace: ...\Interoperability\
MyResults\MyTopo.gdb
Â
Â
Output Coordinates | As Specified Below: Import from <Feature 
Dataset>
Â
Â
Raster Storage | Pyramid levels: 10
Â
Â
Raster Storage | Compression: LZ77; click on OK.
In the next step, you will learn how to manage your four rasters in a raster catalog:
4.	 In the MyResults folder, right-click on the MyTOPO geodatabase, and navigate to 
New | Raster Catalog. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Output Location: ...\MyResults\MyTopo.gdb
Â
Â
Raster Catalog Name: MyRasters
Â
Â
Raster Management Type (optional): MANAGED
5.	 Accept the default values for all other parameters. Click on OK.
6.	 Let's load four ECW rasters. Right-click on the MyRasters raster catalog and navigate 
to Load | Load from Workspace. For Input Workspace, navigate to the ...\
SourceData\ECW folder. Leave the two remaining options unchecked. Click on OK.

7.	
Explore the raster catalog as shown in the following screenshot:
8.	 Use the Expand Window button (1) to open the raster catalog browser and the  
Show Advanced Tools button (2) to query a raster catalog.
9.	 The Overview panel displays the footprints of rasters, and the Selection panel 
displays the selected raster.
In the next step, you will learn to manage your four rasters in a raster mosaic:
10.	 Let's create first an empty container for rasters. In Catalog Tree, navigate to the 
MyResults folder, and right-click on the MyTOPO geodatabase. Navigate to New | 
Mosaic Dataset and set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Output Location: ..\MyResults\MyTopo.gdb
Â
Â
Mosaic Dataset Name: OrthophotoMap
Â
Â
Coordinate System: Import from MyTopo.gdb\LandUse
Â

11.	 Accept the default values for all other parameters. Click on OK.
12.	Let's add the rasters. In ArcToolbox, expand Data Management Tools | Raster | 
Mosaic Datasets, and double-click on the Add Rasters To Mosaic Dataset tool. Click 
on Show Help to see the meaning of every parameter. Set the following parameters:
Â
Â
Mosaic Dataset: MyTopo.gdb\OrthophotoMap

14.	 In ArcMap, open the MyImportData.mxd map document, and load your 
OrthophotoMap mosaic dataset, as shown in the following screenshots:
15.	Open and inspect the attribute table for the Boundary and Footprint layers.
16.	 Save your map and close ArcMap.

Working with Data Interoperability
340
How it works...
At step 4, we chose Raster Management Type (optional) value as MANAGED. The raster 
catalog will be managed by the geodatabase. This means that your rasters will be stored in 
MyTopo.gdb. Each ECW raster will be stored as a separate raster dataset.
The UNMANAGED option will not convert the rasters, and the catalog will store only the path 
to the source rasters. You will not be able to see those rasters if the geodatabase or the 
referenced rasters are moved to another location.
A mosaic dataset will treat the four raster datasets as a single one. At step 12, the 
Footprint layer represents the extent of each individual raster from mosaic. The Boundary 
layer represents the edge of the combined rasters. If you want to change the display order of 
the rasters, right-click on the Image layer, and navigate to Properties | Mosaic.
Spatial ETL
In the previous recipes, you used the traditional data translation between two data types and 
formats. The ArcGIS Data Interoperability uses the FME functionality to extend the formats you 
can read, transform, and translate.
The transformation process allows you to manipulate the structure and content of your data. 
The transformation process occurs during the format translation process. Translation refers to 
the process of converting a data format into another data format using:
f
f
Workspace: This is a container that stores the translation definition
f
f
Reader and writer: These are the source and destination datasets
f
f
Feature type: This is a feature class, layer, or object class
f
f
Feature: This is the base component of the translation
You have three tools to translate and transform interoperability data:
f
f
Quick Import: This imports any FME-supported format into a new geodatabase
f
f
Quick Export: This exports any feature class and interoperability data to any  
FME-supported format
f
f
Spatial ETL Tool: This restructures and transforms Esri formats or other  
FME-supported formats

Chapter 11
341
A Spatial ETL Tool is created, edited, and run by the user. A Spatial ETL Tool uses a graphic 
application called workbench, as shown in the following screenshot:
In workbench, you can manipulate the geometry and attributes of the datasets using 
transformers. Transformers allow you to restructure and re-project the data source before 
loading it into the destination data format. There are two types of transformers: geometric and 
attribute. When you are using a transformer, you have to set all mandatory parameters.
Getting ready
In this recipe, you will explore three data formats: DWG, GML, and MIF/MID. After you finish 
exploring the interoperability data, you will use the Spatial ETL Tool to translate the GML file 
into a feature class by transforming the data content.

It's time to perform a data content transformation using an attribute transformer:
21.	 In the workbench canvas, select the connection between Reader and Writer. Type 
attri text, select AttributeValueMapper to quickly access the transformers gallery, 
and insert it into the workspace, as shown in the following screenshot:
22.	Double-click on the AttributeValueMapper transformer to open the Parameters 
dialog. For Source Attribute, select the RiverType field. For Destination Attribute, 
type HAT, which classifies the water features.

23.	For Source Value, navigate to Import | Source Value to import the values from the 
RiverType field. Select the WaterBody GML file and click on Next twice. In the 
Select Attributes for "Source Value" panel, select the RiverType field, and click on 
Next and Import, as shown in the following screenshots:
24.	 For the Destination Value, type the corresponding code, as shown in the  
following screenshot:

25.	Click on OK. In the workbench canvas, create the connection between the  
Reader and Writer fields, as shown in the following screenshot:
26.	Let's add some annotations. Right-click on WaterBody and select  
Add Annotation. Explore the results and edit the default text.
27.	 Let's see the setting of the AttributeValueMapper transformer. Right-click on the 
transformer and select Show Summary Annotation. Note that the summary annotation 
cannot be edited and is colored blue to differentiate from the user annotation.
28.	Let's add some bookmarks as shown in the preceding image. With bookmarks, you 
can underline different parts of your workspace, and you have easy access to the 
different parts of your workspace. Right-click on the empty space on the canvas and 
select Insert Bookmarks. The appearance of the default bookmark can be changed: 
text, color, dimension, and position. Explore the options.
29.	Go to the File menu and click on Save.
30.	Run the translation by selecting the Run or Resume Translation tool. Exit the 
workspace. You can modify the Spatial ETL Tool by right-clicking on the tool and  
selecting the Edit option.
31.	 Inspect the WatercourseL feature class in ArcCatalog. Note that subtype 
descriptions were updated for the HAT (Classification) field.
You can find the results at ...\Interoperability\DataResults\SpatialETLTool.

How it works...
The datasets explored in ArcCatalog from steps 2 to 9 can be used in ArcMap like any other 
Esri data. Those datasets are read-only and cannot be edited. Use the Quick Import tool to 
quickly translate the non-Esri formats to a geodatabase. This tool will save the output in a new 
geodatabase.
At step 10, we started to create the Spatial ETL Tool to import a GML file into your existing 
geodatabase. Before running a tool, be sure that Coordinate System for Reader and  
Writer are specified.
From steps 14 to 17, we added Writer by importing an existing feature class from the  
MyTOPO geodatabase.
At step 18, we set the Writer properties. To keep the schema of the existing feature class 
table, we set Drop Table First to No. To make sure that the destination table was empty, we 
set Truncate Table First to Yes. We also mentioned that the WatercourseL output will be a 
feature class in the Hydrography feature dataset.
At step 19, we added the subtype definition for the WatercourseL feature class output.
From steps 21 to 24, we worked with the AttributeValueMapper parameter. It sets up value 
mapping between the RiverType text field (source) and the subtype codes of the feature 
class (destination). Source Values were imported from the WaterBody GML file.
