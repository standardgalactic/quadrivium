KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Winter 2014)
Problem Set Week 7
This problem set focuses on material covered in Week 7 (Lecture 9), so I recommend you to watch the
lecture and attempt Assignment 9 before submitting your answers. The deadline for completing (and
submitting) the problem set is Monday March 24 at 9:00AM US-PST. Note that you can save your entries
as you work through the problems, and can change them at any time prior to submission, but once you
submit your answers no further changes are possible.
1. Say which of the following statements are true. (Leave the box blank to indicate that it is false.)
• 20|300
• 17|35
• 5|0
• 0|5
• 21|(−21)
2. Say whether the following proof is valid or not.
Theorem. The square of any odd number is 1 more than a multiple of 8. (For example, 32 = 9 =
8 + 1, 52 = 25 = 3 · 8 + 1.)
Proof: By the Division Theorem, any number can be expressed in one of the forms 4q, 4q +1, 4q +
2, 4q + 3. So any odd number has one of the forms 4q + 1, 4q + 3. Squaring each of these gives
(4q + 1)2
=
16q2 + 8q + 1
=
8(2q2 + q) + 1
(4q + 3)2
=
16q2 + 24q + 9
=
8(2q2 + 3q + 1) + 1
In both cases the result is one more than a multiple of 8. This proves the theorem.
3. Say whether the following veriﬁcation of the method of induction is valid or not?
Proof: We have to prove that if
• A(1)
• (∀n)[A(n) ⇒A(n + 1)]
then (∀n)A(n).
We argue by contradiction. Suppose the conclusion is false. Then there will be a natural number
n such that ¬A(n). Let m be the least such number. By the ﬁrst condition, m > 1, so m = n + 1
for some n. Since n < m, A(n). Then by the second condition, A(n + 1), i.e., A(m). This is a
contradiction, and that proves the result.
4. Evaluate this purported proof, and grade it according to the course rubric.
The Fibonacci sequence is deﬁned iteratively by setting F1 = F2 = 1 and thereafter letting Fn+2 =
Fn + Fn+1.
This fascinating sequence has been known for at least 1500 years.
It has several
connections to the natural world, some of which are described in the second lecture of Devlin’s

mathematics survey course on iTunes University, listed as recommended supplementary viewing to
this course. It also has a number of pleasing mathematical connections. Here is one:
Theorem For any natural number n,
n
X
k=1
Fk
2 = FnFn+1
Proof: By induction.
For n = 1, the left-hand side is F1
2 = 12 = 1 and the right-hand side is F1F2 = 1.1 = 1, so the
identity is valid for n = 1.
Assume the identity holds for n. Then:
n+1

k=1
Fk

k=1
Fk

=
FnFn+1 + Fn+1
2, by the induction hypothesis
=
Fn+1(Fn + Fn+1), by algebra
=
Fn+1Fn+2, by the deﬁnition of Fn+2
which is the identity for n + 1. The proof is complete.
5. Evaluate this purported proof, and grade it according to the course rubric.
The Fibonacci sequence is deﬁned iteratively by setting F1 = F2 = 1 and thereafter letting Fn+2 =
Fn + Fn+1.

Fk = Fn+2
Proof: By induction.
For n = 1, the left-hand side is F1 = 1 and the right-hand side is F2 = 1, so the identity is valid for
n = 1.
Assume the identity holds for n. Then:
n+1

X
k=1
Fk + Fn+1
=
Fn+2 + Fn+1, by the induction hypothesis
=
Fn+3, by the deﬁnition of Fn+3
which is the identity for n + 1. The proof is complete.

6. Evaluate this purported proof, and grade it according to the course rubric.
The Fibonacci sequence is deﬁned iteratively by setting F1 = F2 = 1 and thereafter letting Fn+2 =
Fn + Fn+1.
Theorem For any natural number n,
Fn ≥

Proof: Proof: We have F1 = 1 ≥2
3 =

and F2 = 1 =

, so the inequality is valid for
n = 1, 2.
Now assume the inequality holds for n, where n ≥2. Then:
Fn+1

Fn + Fn−1
