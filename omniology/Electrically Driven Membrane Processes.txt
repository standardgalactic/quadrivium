production processes in which a separation process is required. The book is written to all chemical 
engineering students who are participating in courses about downstream processing, membrane processes 
and/or membrane technology. And it is written to scientists, chemist and/or engineers working with 
downstream processing and especially electrically driven membrane processes, as well. Membrane 
processes find applications in almost all kinds of industries as one or more downstream purification/
separation processes:
--
Chemical industry
--
Pharmaceutical industry
--
Food industry
--
Dairy industry
--
Wastewater treatment industry
--
Etc‚Ä¶
For reading and understanding this book you are supposed to have basic skills in mathematics, 
engineering and chemistry in general. After introduction of certain equations, the SI-units will be 
thoroughly explained in order to give the reader an overview of the different terms and parameters 
in that particular equation. I have chosen to do so as such approach helped me when I was studying. 
Relevant examples will be included in order to show how the described theory can be applied in practice.
I alone am responsible for any misprints or errors in the book and I will be grateful to receive any critics 
and suggestions for improvement. The book will give you an introduction to basic principles behind 
electrically driven membrane processes. Relevant theory and models will be presented together with key

Introduction
1	 Introduction
A membrane process is capable of performing a certain separation by use of a membrane. The core in a 
membrane process is a membrane that allows certain components to pass while retaining others. Initially 
some key terms used in membrane technology are shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Membrane process 
Sketch of a membrane process. The core a membrane through which a driving force induces a flux from the bulk 
to the permeate side.
The feed side is often called the bulk solution. The components in the bulk solution that are retained 
can also be referred to at the retentate. When a driving force is established across the membrane a flux 
will go through the membrane from the bulk solution to the permeate side. The flux is referred to with 
the letter ‚ÄúJ‚Ää‚Ää‚Äù.

Introduction
A particular separation is accomplished by use of a membrane with the ability of transporting one 
component more readily than another. In other words, the membrane is more permeable to certain 
components than other components because of differences in physical or chemical properties between 
the membrane and the components that are transported through the membrane. As seen in Figure 1, a 
driving force across the membrane induces a flux from the bulk solution to the permeate side. Different 
driving forces are used in different membrane processes (listed in Table 1).

Table 1: Different membrane processes 
Different driving forces, different membrane processes.
In this book we will focus on membrane processes in which the driving force is an electrical voltage 
difference. Electrically driven membrane processes are widely used to remove charged components 
from a feed solution or suspension. In contrast to pressure driven membrane processes where you have 
a volume flux through the membrane, you have a flux of ions through the membrane in electrically 
driven membrane processes. In order to establish an electrical driving force you need an electrical field. 
Therefore two electrodes are required; a cathode and an anode. The positive ions (cations) in a solution 
will migrate to the negative electrode (cathode), the negative ions (anions) will migrate to the positive 
electrode (anode) and the uncharged molecules will not be affected by the electrical field. One of the 
greatest applications of electrically driven membrane processes is the desalination of saline water in the 
production of potable water. The membranes used for this purpose are ion exchange membranes which 
only allow transport of certain ions.
--
Cation exchange membranes: Cation exchange membranes are incorporated with negatively 
charged groups (for example sulfonic or carboxylic acid groups) which will repel anions and 
only allow transport of cations.
--
Anion exchange membranes: Anion exchange membranes are incorporated with positively 
charged groups (for example those derived from quartenary ammonium salts) which will repel 
cations and only allow transport of anions.

Introduction
Various types of ion exchange membranes can be distinguished. You can either have heterogeneous or 
homogeneous ion exchange membranes:
--
Heterogeneous ion exchange membranes: Heterogeneous ion exchange membranes are prepared 
from ion exchange resins and a film-forming polymer. These materials are combined and made 
into a film by dry-molding for example. The mechanical strength is relatively poor especially at 
high swelling degrees and the electrical resistance is relatively high which of course is unwanted.
--
Homogeneous ion exchange membranes: In homogeneous ion exchange membranes the charged 
groups are attached directly to the polymer chains. The charge is thus distributed uniformly 
within the whole membrane structure. The swelling of these membranes can be reduced by 
crosslinking the polymers.
In order to have a good ion exchange membrane, the membrane has to fulfill certain criteria:
--
High selectivity
--
High electrical conductivity
--
High mechanical strength
--
High chemical strength
--
High ion permeability
--
Low electrical resistance

Introduction
The separation principle when using ion exchange membranes is based on Donnan exclusion which is 
sketched in Figure 2. The figure shows the case with anions being excluded by cations at the surface of 
a cation exchange membrane.
Figure 2: Donnan exclusion at membrane surface 
The separation principle associated with ion exchange membranes is based on Donnan exclusion. The cation 
exchange membrane is incorporated with negative charges and thus a layer of oppositely charges cations occupy 
the region close the membrane surface in the boundary layer (1). Beyond the boundary layer the concentration of 
cations and anions is equal (2).
Donnan exclusion is named after the British chemist Frederick George Donnan, and as sketched in 
Figure 2 ions which the same charge as the membrane are excluded because a layer of oppositely charged 
ions are located closest to the membrane surface in the boundary layer. The chemical potential of the 
cations in the membrane (phase 1, Figure 2) and outside the boundary layer (phase 2, Figure 2) can be 
expressed as follows:

Introduction
At equilibrium the chemical potential of the cations in the membrane and in the bulk solution must 
equal according to thermodynamic considerations. The Donnan potential Edon is defined at the difference 
between the potential in the membrane y1 and in the bulk solution y2. If the chemical potential at 
reference state ¬µ0 is assumed to be equal the following expression for the Donnan potential can be 
derived from equation (1):

The Donnan potential is thus determined from the activities of the cations. A similar expression can 
be written for the anions. It is seen from equation (2) that the Donnan potential is proportional to the 
natural logarithmic ratio between the activity of the ions in the membrane (phase 1) and the activity of 
the ions in the bulk solution (phase 2). Thus it is the higher concentration of one of the ions inside the 
membrane that induces the Donnan potential. The Donnan exclusion can also be depicted in another way 
that might explain the situation better. In Figure 3 a cross sectional cut of a cation exchange membrane 
is sketched. You can see a pore through the membrane and the walls are incorporated with negatively 
charges just as the membrane surface sketched in Figure 2.
Figure 3: Donnan exclusion inside membrane pore 
The walls of a cation exchange membrane pore are covered with negative charges. Thus cations will cover the walls 
because of electrostatic interactions. In the rest of the pore volume both cations and anions can in principle be found. 
When a voltage difference is applied the anions will migrate towards the anode and the cation toward the cathode.

Introduction
In Figure 3 it is seen that because of the negatively charges incorporated in the cation exchange membrane 
there are much more cations present inside the membrane than anions. When an electrical voltage is 
applied across the membrane the cations will migrate towards the cathode and the anions towards the 
anode. Because there are much more cations present inside the membrane than anions, much more 
cations will be transported through the membrane than anions. The same is the case in anion exchange 
membranes where much more anions are transported through because much more anions are present 
inside anion exchange membranes. This is the principle behind the separation of differently charged ions 
in ion exchange membranes. Some anions are able to pass through a cation exchange membrane but 
compared to the number of cations that pass through the cation exchange membrane this amount of 
transported anions is very low. This gives the ion selectivity. Ions are transported through ion exchange 
membranes as sketched in Figure 3 but also water molecules can convectively be dragged in the same 
direction as the ions. This is called electroosmotic water transport. In the situation sketched in Figure 3 
we will thus have an electroosmotic transport of water molecules toward the cathode (water molecules 
are convectively dragged along with cations) that is very much larger that the small electroosmotic water 
transport towards the anode (water molecules are convectively dragged along with the anions). Thus the 
overall electroosmotic water transport will be in the direction of the cathode in the situation sketched 
in Figure 3. In anion exchange membranes the overall electroosmotic water transport will of course be 
in the direction of the anode.

Introduction
If the concentration of negatively incorporated charges in the cation exchange membrane is known (or 
concentration of positively incorporated charges in the anion exchange membrane) the concentration 
of co-ions inside the membrane can be calculated. We are looking at the case with a cation exchange 
membrane as sketched in Figure 2 and Figure 3; when the Donnan equilibrium is established there is a 
connection between the concentrations of negative charges in the bulk solution, in the membrane pores 
and the negative charges incorporated into the membrane. If we are looking at an example with sodium 
chloride in solution in equilibrium with sodium chloride in a cation exchange membrane an expression 
for the Donnan equilibrium can be derived since there has to be electrical neutrality overall:

cation exchange membrane is denoted

. This expression can be used to determine the concentration 
of anions inside a cation exchange membrane. This can be useful in the calculation of so-called transport 
numbers which we will see later.
Since we are dealing with an electrical field and the flow of current we first have to introduce the difference 
between two important terms:

As one can see the current is the total flow of charges in a given cross sectional area (wire, membrane 
area etc.) and can be obtained by multiplying the current density with the cross sectional area of the flow 
of charges. We denote the current with a capital ‚ÄúI‚Äù and the current density with a small ‚Äúi‚Äù.
If we are looking at cations, the transport through a bulk solution and through a cation exchange 
membrane can be written based on phenomenological equations:

Introduction
The flux is proportional to the current density i and z+ is the valence of the cations (eq. pr. mole) and 
F is the Faraday constant (96485 C/eq.). The flux is a flux of moles pr. time pr. area (moles of charges). 
This is in contrast to pressure driven membrane processes where we have a volume flux (volume pr. time 
pr. area). The proportionally constants in equation (4) are transport numbers.

Here m is the mobility of the ions. The mobility of cations and anions respectively is almost the same 
in the membrane and in the solutions which is also visualized in Figure 3 where anions and cations are 
equally mobile. Thus it is the concentrations that roughly determine the size of the transport number. 
Sodium chloride (NaCl) can be used as an example. In a solution sodium ions and chloride ions are 
transported almost equally since they are equal in concentration and in mobility. Thus t+ and t- are almost 
the same according to equation (6), but in a cation exchange membrane almost only sodium ions are 
present (see again Figure 3). Thus the cation concentration in the membrane is much larger than the 
anion concentration which according to equation (6) gives a transport number of almost 1. The sum of 
transport numbers of the cations and anions in solutions and in membrane respectively equals 1 (can be 
derived from equation (6)), and thus the following can be stated for solutions containing sodium chloride:

Thus in a solution both sodium and chloride ions have transport numbers of ~¬Ω. In cation exchange 
membranes the transport number of anions almost equals zero and thus the transport number of cations 
in a cation exchange membrane almost equal 1. In anion exchange membrane on the other hand the 
transport number of cations almost equals zero leading to a transport number of anions close to 1. As 
seen in equation (5), (6) and (7) a ‚Äúbar‚Äù is placed on top of the ‚Äút‚Äù in order to show that the corresponding 
transport number refers to the transport number in the membrane.

Introduction
We have now seen in equation (7) that for sodium chloride the transport numbers almost equal ¬Ω 
and 1 in solution and in the membrane respectively. This is also true when we are dealing with dilute 
solutions when the concentration of co-ions inside the membrane is very low. Of course this co-ion 
concentration will increase if the bulk concentration increases and thus according to equation (6) the 
co-ion concentration can no longer be neglected when the transport numbers inside the membrane is 
to be calculated. We will look more into that scenario in the following example:
Example A: Transport numbers
The transport number of sodium ions inside a cation exchange membrane is to be calculated when the membrane is 
in equilibrium with a solution of 0.1 M and 1.0 M respectively. The producer of the membrane informs that the fixed 
negative charge concentration inside the cation exchange membrane is 

5
F
 = 1.54 M. The transport number of cations 
inside the cation exchange membrane can be calculated according to equation (6). We assume that the mobility of 
cations and anions respectively are equal:

The concentration of sodium ions inside the membrane must equal the sum of chloride ions and fixed negative charges 
because of electrical neutrality. This means the transport number can be calculated as follows:

The concentration of chloride inside the membrane can be calculated from the Donnan equilibrium expression given 
in equation (3). For the two bulk concentrations of 0.1 M and 1.0 M this give the following chloride concentrations 
inside the membrane:

It is thus seen that the transport numbers inside the ion exchange membranes are relatively dependent on the bulk 
concentrations. At low concentrations the transport number of cations is close to 1 which is also stated in equation (7) 
but when the bulk concentration is increased the transport number decreases.
The concepts mentioned and explained in this introduction section are all important terms concerning

Electrodialysis is an electrically driven membrane process in which electrically charged membranes 
(ion exchange membranes) are used to remove ions from aqueous solutions by use of an electrical field. 
Electrodialysis finds applications such as:

Electrodialysis
2.1	
Basic concept
The basic principle in electrodialysis is that two electrodes are separated by cation exchange membranes 
and anion exchange membrane placed in an alternating way. A sketch of an electrodialysis system is 
shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4: Electrodialysis system 
Schematic representation of the principle behind electrodialysis. A: Anion exchange membrane, C: Cation exchange 
membrane. Two electrodes (anode and cathode) are separated between cation exchange membranes and anion exchange 
membranes placed in an alternating way. In the electrical field, anions will migrate towards the anode and cations towards 
the cathode.
The feed solution (saline water for example) is pumped into the chambers between the ion exchange 
membranes. When a voltage difference is established between the anode and the cathode, the anions 
will start to migrate towards the anode and the cations will start to migrate towards the cathode. The 
anions are only able to pass anion exchange membranes and cations are only able to pass cation exchange 
membranes. Thus an anion is only able to pass one anion exchange membrane whereas it is rejected by 
cation exchange membranes. On the other hand cations are only able to pass cation exchange membranes 
and are rejected by anion exchange membranes. This means that when you are looking at Figure 4 every 
second chamber will increase in concentration (concentrate) and every second chamber will decrease 
in concentration (diluate). The two chambers closest to the electrodes are called electrode chambers. In 
these electrode chambers the following electrode reactions take place when sodium chloride solutions 
are used as feed solution:

Electrodialysis
It is thus seen that when electrodialysis is done on sodium chloride solutions, chlorine and oxygen gas 
is produced at the anode and hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode. This is not wanted and this is 
the reason (among other aspects) that electrodialysis systems often consists of up to several hundreds 
of cell pair placed in parallel in order to minimize the irreversible energy consumption associated with 
producing gasses at the electrodes. By definition one cell pair consists of the following:

In commercial electrodialysis systems up to 500 cell pairs (n = 500) are placed in parallel in a so-called 
membrane stack. The maximum number of cell pairs is determined by practical considerations such as 
maximum allowed voltage over the whole stack, stability of the stack and the ability of the system to 
supply the individual chamber equally with feed solution. By using such a membrane stack the applied 
driving force is utilized very efficiently. The net result of an electrodialysis process is that at the outlet from 
the membrane stack diluted and concentrated solutions can be collected from the alternating chambers. 
The ion exchange membranes are separated by spacers. The flow channels in these spacers can have 
different geometries that can be optimized in order to minimize the concentration polarization in the 
boundary layer and thus increase the mass transfer coefficient. We will go more into details about that 
later. Normally two types of spacers can be distinguished: Sheet-flow spacers and tortuous-path spacers. 
In the sheet flow spacers the velocity is relative low and the residence time is low as well, whereas the 
residence time in tortuous-path spacers is much larger. The velocity in the tortuous-path spacers is also 
much larger (which decreases the concentration polarization problems) since the flow channel constitutes 
a long flow path with many turns. On the other hand the pressure drop is generally larger in a tortuous-
path spacer than in a sheet-flow spacer. This gives a larger pump energy consumption (this will be 
explained in section 2.5.1 Pump energy). In electrodialysis systems three pumps are normally required:
--
Pump for electrode solution
--
Pump for concentrate solution
--
Pump for diluate solution
Thus in energy calculation those three pumps normally have to be taken into consideration when the 
total energy consumption is to be calculated and evaluated. This will be described in more details in 
section 2.5 Energy requirement.

Critical current and critical current density
When a voltage different is applied between the two electrodes, current flows between the two electrodes 
in the form of ions. Below a certain critical current the voltage difference is proportional to the current 
according to Ohm‚Äôs law which can be written as follows:

In the general form of Ohm‚Äôs law we see proportionality between the current (C/s) and the voltage (J/C). 
The term ‚ÄúR‚Äù is the electrical resistance (J‚ãÖs/C2 = W, Ohm). Ohm‚Äôs law can also be written in a ‚Äúflux 
form‚Äù by dividing the current with the area (of the membrane). By doing this you get the current density 
(Coulomb/sec/area = C/(s‚ãÖm2)) i and then the term ‚ÄúœÉ‚Äù is the electrical conductance (C2/(J‚ãÖs‚ãÖm)). The 
current density is then proportional to the voltage gradient (J/(C‚ãÖm)).

Electrodialysis
If an ion exchange membrane is completely selective, one equivalent of ions will be transported through 
the ion exchange membrane pr. Faraday used electrical current. The Faraday number is 96485 Coulomb 
pr. equivalent. This means that one mole of salt (NaCl) is removed pr. Faraday electrical current because 
sodium and chloride ions both have valences z of 1 eq./mole. If the electrodialysis membrane stack then 
consists of n cell pairs, n moles of NaCl will be removed pr. Faraday electrical current. In general, n 
equivalents of salt are removed pr. Faraday electrical current.
Ohm‚Äôs law is only valid below a certain critical current. A critical current exists because of concentration 
polarization phenomena in the laminar boundary layer at the membrane surfaces. The polarization 
phenomenon is explained in Figure 5. The description here concerns the polarization phenomenon at 
cation exchange membranes.
Figure 5: Concentration polarization 
Concentration polarization of cations in electrodialysis in the boundary layers at both sides of a cation exchange membrane at 
steady state. This phenomenon results in the existence of a critical current.

Electrodialysis
In Figure 5 a cation exchange membrane is sketched and the concentration levels shown concerns the 
concentration of cations. The flow of anions is also sketched in Figure 5 in order to show the full picture. 
It is seen that the flow of anions inside the cation exchange membrane is almost zero which is explained 
by the fact that the transport number of anions inside the cation exchange membrane is almost zero 
according to equation (7). The cations will migrate through the cation exchange membrane toward the 
cathode. On the right side of the membrane we have a concentration chamber and on the left side we have 
a dilution chamber. In the solutions both cations and anions (Na+ and Cl-) have almost equal transport 
numbers (value ~ ¬Ω) according to equation (7). This means that they are transported in almost the same 
amount at constant applied voltage. Cations and anions are thus transported in the bulk solution and in 
the boundary layer with a transport number of ~¬Ω. In the membrane cations are transported in a much 
larger amount than anions (see also Figure 3) because of the negative incorporated charges which means 
that they are transported with transport number of almost 1. The ions are transported by diffusion and 
by the applied electrical driving force. This means that in the laminar boundary layer at both sides of 
the membrane at steady state there will be a linear concentration gradient as sketched in Figure 5. This 
is because the cations are transported in a much larger amount than anion inside the membrane than 
in the boundary layer. If we look at the left side of the membrane the ions are removed away from the 
left surface through the membrane faster than they are supplied by diffusion in the boundary layer. Thus 
a decreasing cation concentration is established in the left side boundary layer. At the right side of the 
membrane an accumulation of cations will initially take place because the cations are transported in 
a much less amount in solution that in the membrane and thus they will be a concentration increase 
when leaving the membrane. When steady state is reached the cation concentration profile sketched in 
Figure 5 will be established.
Why is the concentration polarization a problem? In order the run an economically rentable electrodialysis 
process the overall electrical resistance of the membrane stack must not be too high. The electrical 
resistance of a single cell pair can be divided into four sub resistances which are all sketched in Figure 6.

Figure 6: Electrical sub resistances in a cell pair 
The overall electrical resistance of a cell pair can be divided into four sub resistances. A: Anion exchange 
membrane, C: Cation exchange membrane, Ram: Resistance of anion exchange membrane, Rcm: Resistance of 
cation exchange membrane, Rd: Resistance of diluate solution, Rc: Resistance of concentrate solution, Rcell:  
Total resistance of cell pair.
From Figure 6 it is seen that the electrical resistance of a single cell pair can be divided into the four 
following sub resistances:
--
Resistance of anion exchange membrane, Ram
--
Resistance of diluate chamber, Rd
--
Resistance of cation exchange membrane, Rcm
--
Resistance of concentrate chamber, Rc
The overall resist of a single cell pair (Rcell) is the sum of the four sub-resistances. The resistance of the 
whole membrane stack consisting of n cell pair is thus given in equation (9)

Electrodialysis
The electrical resistance is very dependent on the ease of which the ions are transported and on the 
presence of ions since the ions constitute the electrical current. The electrical resistance of the ion exchange 
membranes is relatively low whereas the resistance in the diluate can become quite high because of low 
ion concentration. A large polarization on the left side of the membrane (Figure 5) gives a very low ion 
concentration resulting in large electrical resistance. The polarization on right side of the membrane 
(Figure 5) is not of great importance since it results in higher ion concentration which will not result in 
an enhanced electrical resistance1. Thus it is often the resistance in the diluate chambers that determines 
the overall resistance of the membrane stack because of low ion concentration at the membrane surface 
(low c ¬¥d) due to concentration polarization. Therefore the concentration polarization is a problem that 
has to be minimized in order to keep the overall electrical resistance and the energy requirement low. 
When the current reaches a certain level the concentration polarization on the diluate side of the 
membrane (see Figure 5) reaches a level where the cation concentration at the membrane surface c ¬¥d 
reaches zero2. At that point the critical current is reached and Ohm‚Äôs law (equation (8)) can no longer 
describe the association between current and voltage). When the concentration of cations is zero, water 
splitting at the membrane surface will occur:

Electrodialysis
The water splitting occurs in order to generate ions that can constitute an electrical current. When water 
starts to split, the OH- ions can pass through the anion exchange membranes and the H+ ions can pass 
through the cation exchange membranes. This will affect the pH in the different chambers. When the 
current through a membrane stack is measured at increasing values of the voltage, the Current-Voltage 
plot will typically look as sketched in Figure 7.
Figure 7: Typically Current-Voltage profile plot 
The current at increasing values of voltage. Three regions can normally be observed. I) Ohmic region, II) Region of limiting 
current and III) Region of overlimiting current (water splitting).
The initial region is described by Ohm‚Äôs law and is thus called the Ohmic region. At a certain voltage 
there are not enough ions to transfer the charges which mean that the critical current is reached and 
the cation concentration at the cation exchange membrane surface on the diluate side is close to zero. 
Thus the current can not increase anymore even though the voltage is increased. This is the region of 
limiting current. When the voltage is further increased water molecules start to split at the membrane 
surface and thus ‚Äúnew‚Äù ions are generated (H+ and OH-) that are able to increase the current. Thus at 
this point the current increases again at increasing voltage. This is the region of overlimiting current.
By setting up mathematical models for the cation transport through the cation exchange membrane 
sketched in Figure 5, an expression for calculation of the critical current can be derived. First we can 
look at Figure 8 in which the cation concentration profile between the dilute stream and the cation 
exchange membrane is sketched. It is in this area the concentration decrease towards zero leads to the 
existence of a critical current.

Figure 8: Cation concentration profile 
The concentration profile of cations in the laminar boundary layer between the diluate stream and the cation exchange membrane. 
Two types of cation transport is sketched: Electrical transport due to the electrical field (E-field) and diffusive transport due to the 
concentration gradient.
In Figure 8, electrical and diffusive transport of salt ions (only cations in this case) is shown3. We are 
looking at the situation in steady state where a linear concentration decrease in the laminar boundary 
layer exists. When the current density (flux of charges) through the system is denoted i, the flux of cations 
in the membrane and in the boundary layer can be expressed as follows:

The fluxes J1 and J2 are caused by the electrical field (E-field) according to equation (4). The flux J3 is 
caused by the concentration gradient of cations in the boundary layer according to Darcy‚Äôs law. At steady 
state a mole balance for the cations can be set up at the membrane surface which gives the following first 
order differential equation with the following boundary conditions (BC). The direction of x is defined

As mentioned earlier the critical current density is reached when the concentration of cations at the 
membrane surface (c ¬¥d) at the diluate side reaches zero. At this point water molecules start to split in 
order to generate ions to conduct the current. An expression for the calculation the critical current 
density (icrit) can thus be derived by letting c ¬¥d go to zero:

Again it is seen that the current is just the current density multiplied by the cross sectional area, which 
in this case is the area of one of the ion exchange membranes. The ratio between the diffusion coefficient 
and the boundary layer thickness can be replaced by k which is the mass transfer coefficient (k = D/Œ¥). 
It is thus seen that the critical current density is a function of the concentration of cations in the bulk 
(diluate stream) and the boundary layer thickness (mass transfer coefficient). Therefore the critical current 
density is highly dependent of the hydrodynamic conditions and can be increased by decreasing the 
boundary layer thickness (increasing the mass transfer coefficient) for example by increasing the flow 
rate along the membrane surface in the diluate chambers. The critical current density will also increase 
with increased ion concentration in the diluate since more ions will then be present to constitute the 
flow of charges (the current)4. Equation (11) can be used to calculate the critical current for a given 
electrodialysis system but often you don‚Äôt know the mass transfer coefficient. Therefore you can do two 
things to determine the critical current for a given electrodialysis system:
--
Experimental determination of critical current
--
Determination of critical current from literature correlations

Electrodialysis
In the experimental determination you don‚Äôt need to know the mass transfer coefficient. On the other 
hand, by estimation of the critical current from literature correlation you actually calculate the mass 
transfer coefficient (diffusion coefficient divided with the boundary layer thickness) and insert it into 
equation (11). It can often be a good idea to do both things in order to get a more accurate picture of 
the level of the critical current and to check whether your flow and mass transfer in the system can be 
described by the well known correlation from the literature. In the following two sections we shall see 
how the critical current can be determined from experiments and from literature correlations.
2.2.1	
Experimental determination of critical current
In an electrodialysis system the critical current can be determined by measuring the current (with an 
ampere meter) through the membrane stack as a function to the voltage. Then you can plot the current 
vs. the voltage and determine the critical current as the point where the curve flattens as in Figure 7. 
This can however often be quite uncertain because the curve often does not flatten so much. Another 
approach can sometimes be more accurate. The resistance can be plotted vs. the reciprocal value of the 
current. By doing this, the level of the current (reciprocal value of the current) where the resistance is 
constant (the Ohm‚Äôs law region) and the level of the current where the resistance starts to increase (the 
region of limiting current) can be determined more accurate. The resistance is calculated as E/I according 
to Ohm‚Äôs law (equation (8)). In the following example the critical current will be determined from actual 
smaller scale electrodialysis data according to these two approaches.

Example B: Experimental determination of critical current
For an electrodialysis system consisting of 20 cell pairs the current is measured at different values of the voltage between 
0 and 50 volts. The data are plotted in an ‚ÄúI vs. E plot‚Äù and an ‚ÄúE/I vs. 1/I plot‚Äù which is shown in Figure 9. Sodium chloride 
solutions are used as feed solutions.
Figure 9: Experimental determination of critical current 
(a)The current through the membrane stack as a function of the voltage. (b) The resistance (E/I) as a function of 1/I.  
The critical current in this case is most easily identified on the right plot indicated by the blue arrow. Constant flow rate.
It is seen that the curve (Figure 9a) has the same sequence as the initial sequence of the typical current-voltage plot 
shown in Figure 7 page 23. Up to around 15 volt linear relationship between the current and voltage exists according to 
Ohm‚Äôs law. Above ~ 15 volt the curve is flattened but identification of an actual critical current is from this plot difficult. 
By plotting the resistance of the membrane stack (voltage divided by the current) as a function of the reciprocal value 
of the current, the critical current can be identified as the point where the resistance starts to increase when going 
from the right to the left on the curve in Figure 9b. Ohm‚Äôs law assumes a constant resistance which is seen on the right 
part of the curve. At high values of the current (low values of 1/I) the resistance starts to increase indicating that the 
Ohmic region is exceeded and the region of limiting current is entered. The point where the curve breaks is identified 
as the critical current, which in this case can be estimated to:

This value of 0.78 A would have be more uncertain determined if only Figure 9a have been used.
The critical current density can then be calculated by dividing the critical current with the area of one 
of the ion exchange membranes in the membrane stack.
2.2.2	
Determination of critical current from literature correlations
As mentioned earlier the critical current can experimentally be determined by plotting data of the 
current as a function of the voltage. On the other hand in order to calculate the critical current by use 
of equation (11) you need to have a value for the mass transfer coefficient.

One way to get a value for the mass transfer coefficient is to use different flow correlations from the 
literature that combines different dimensionless numbers concerning flow and mass transfer. These 
dimensionless numbers are:

The hydraulic diameter of the flow channel is denoted dh. The Reynolds number includes the flow velocity 
u and thus tells whether the flow is in the laminar or turbulent region. The Schmidt number is the ratio 
between the kinematic viscosity ŒΩ and the diffusion coefficient D and thus the Schmidt number tells how 
fast velocity is propagated through the fluid compared to how fast mass propagates (diffuses) through the 
fluid. The Sherwood number includes the mass transfer coefficient k and by using correlations combining 
these three dimensionless number given in equation (12) you can estimate the mass transfer coefficient. 
Such correlations are shown in Table 2.

How can these correlations be used to find the mass transfer coefficient and how can we then afterward 
calculate the critical current? These questions are answered through the following example:
Example C: Determination of critical current from literature correlations
We are looking at a lab scale electrodialysis system at which an experiment with NaCl solution is conducted. From 
current and voltage data a critical current of 5.55 A has been determined by the method sketched in Example B. Relevant 
experimental parameters are given in Table 3.

Electrodialysis
First of all we have to know whether we are in the turbulent or laminar region. For this purpose we have to calculate 
the Reynolds number according to equation (12). We have to know the kinematic viscosity, the diluate flow velocity and 
the hydraulic diameter of the diluate flow spacer channel. The kinematic viscosity of water at 20oC is used (0.01 cm2/s) 
since the solution is very dilute. The total flow in the 20 diluate channels Qd (we have 20 diluate channels since there are 
a total of 20 cell pairs) is 11.72 g/s. Since the solution is quite diluted we use the density of water. The flow qd in each 
of the 20 channels is there

The flow velocity u can be calculated by dividing the flow qd with the cross sectional area of the flow channel. The cross 
sectional area is product of the channel height and width in the spacer (0.10 cm √ó 0.61 cm = 0.061 cm2):

Since the Reynolds number is relatively low we assume that we are in the laminar region. In order to calculate the 
Sherwood number according to the laminar ‚Äúchannel flow‚Äù correlation in Table 2, we first have to calculate the Schmidt

With this value of the mass transfer coefficient the critical current can be calculated according to equation (11) with a

It is seen that this value is close to the experimentally determined critical current of 5.55 ampere, and thus the flow 
correlations in this case apparently gives a good approximation for the mass transfer coefficient and thus for the 
calculation of the critical current. Of course there are uncertainties. For example the diffusion coefficient is concentration 
dependent and the linear length of the flow channel is also not so easy to define since the channels are equipped 
with insert and it is a question if you can talk about a linear flow channel length at all. But anyway the use of literature 
correlations can lead you to get an idea of level of the mass transfer coefficient and thus the critical current.
2.2.3	
Influence of hydrodynamic conditions on the critical current
As mentioned earlier and according to equation (11) the critical current is proportional to the mass 
transfer coefficient. Since the mass transfer coefficient is very dependent on the hydrodynamic conditions 
in the membrane stack the critical current can be varied by changing for example the flow velocity in 
the diluate chambers. Experimental values of the critical current at different flow velocities in the diluate 
chambers can be compared with the literature flow correlations. This can be useful if you want to see 
whether your flow and mass transfer in your electrodialysis system follow the well-known literature 
correlations. The mass transfer coefficient can be expressed by the flow correlation for channel geometry 
given in Table 2:

The natural logarithm of these expressions is plotted together with the data from Table 4 in Figure 10 in order to give 
straight lines. 
Figure 10: Hydrodynamic influence on the critical current 
Influence of hydrodynamic conditions (flow velocity) on the critical current visualized by plotting ln(Icr/cd) vs. ln(u). Icr: 
Critical current, cd: diluate concentration (mean logarithmic value), u: flow velocity. Experimental data are plotted 
together with expressions from literature correlations for mass transfer at turbulent or laminar flow.
In the plot one sees that the slope of the experimental values is close to the slope predicted by the turbulent correlation. 
This can be explained by the presence of turbulence promoters in the flow channels even though the Reynolds number 
is low. Overall the hydrodynamic influence (flow velocity) on the critical current seems to be well predicted by the 
literature correlations. One has to remember that many uncertainties are associated with using the flow correlations. 
The length of the flow channel for example is difficult to measure / estimate since many spacers have flow channels 
with many turns (tortuous-path spacers). Whether the flow is to be considered laminar or turbulent is also a question 
since many spacers are equipped with different insert in order to reduce the laminar boundary layer thickness and thus 
enhance the mass transfer coefficient. As mentioned earlier the diffusion coefficient is also concentration dependent 
and not totally constant. Finally the used flow equation from Table 2 arejust a few of many different flow equations 
for many different flow geometries so there might be correlation in the literature that fits this particular electrodialysis 
system more accurate.
But overall the experimental values of critical current, diluate concentrations and flow velocities seem to fit the literature 
correlations concerning flow and mass transfer quite well in this case.

Desalination degree
An import factor concerning the performance of an electrodialysis system is the desalination degree. 
The desalination degree indicates how large an amount of the salt in the diluate stream that is removed 
during one passage through the membrane stack. The desalination degree S can be calculated from the 
following equation:

Electrodialysis
The concentration in the diluate is denoted cd and from equation (15) is can be seen that the desalination 
degree can be determined from the diluate concentration that enters the dilution chambers and the diluate 
concentration that exits the dilution chambers. From the equation it is seen that a total desalination 
corresponds to a desalination degree of 1 (100%). The desalination degree is (among different factors) 
influenced by the flow rate of the feed stream. This will be shown in the following example:
Example E: Desalination degree
In an electrodialysis system consisting of 20 cell pairs, the outlet concentrations from the diluate chambers are measured 
for experiments conducted at different flow rates at constant inlet concentration of 0.2 M. The concentrations are 
measured at a voltage difference over the membrane stack of 10 volts and the feed consists of sodium chloride solutions. 
Data from the experiments are shown in Table 5.

Electrodialysis
It is seen that when the feed flow rate is increased the desalination degree decreases. The desalination degree vs. the 
total feed flow rate is plotted in Figure 11.
Figure 11: Desalination degree vs. feed flow rate 
Desalination degree (S) at different feed flow rates at a constant feed concentration (0.2 M).  
Voltage = 10 V.
The decreasing effect on the desalination degree at increasing feed flow rate is clearly seen in Figure 11. An increased 
feed flow rate decrease the time the salt ‚Äúspend‚Äù in the diluate chamber in one passage and thus the ‚Äúpossibility‚Äù of 
desalination decreases.

Current efficiency
The current efficiency is a relevant term to consider. The current efficiency tells how many equivalents of 
salt that has been removed from the diluate to the concentrate pr. transferred current equivalents. In the 
ideal case the current efficiency equals 1 which corresponds to the case where one current equivalent is 
able to remove one salt equivalent. The following equation can be used to calculate the current efficiency Œ∑:

Electrodialysis
The total flow rate in the dilution chambers is denoted Qd, the number of cell pairs n, I is the current, z 
is the valence of the salt ions (eq./mole, z = 1 if we are dealing with NaCl solutions) and F is the Faraday 
number (96485 C/eq.). The number of salt equivalents removed from the diluate to the concentrate can 
thus be calculated as the difference between ‚Äúin-‚Äú and ‚Äúout-concentration‚Äù multiplied by the flow rate and 
the valence of the ions. The number of used current equivalents is calculated as the current divided by 
the Faraday number. The number of cell pairs also has to be multiplied since every cell pair each transfers 
the same amount of current equivalents. From the SI-Units in equation (16) one sees that the current 
efficiency is a dimensionless term (just as the desalination degree described in section 2.3 Desalination 
degree). In the following example we will see an application of equation (16) for calculating the current 
efficiency from real electrodialysis data.
Example F: Current efficiency
An electrodialysis experiment is conducted on a small scale apparatus consisting of 20 cell pairs. A sodium chloride 
solution is used as feed stream and the in- and outlet concentration and the current is measured for an experiment 
conducted with a total diluate flow rate of 11.72 g/s and a voltage difference of 50 volts. Relevant parameters and 
experimental data are shown in Table 6.

It is thus seen that the number of transferred salt equivalents are calculated from diluate inlet and outlet concentrations 
and the total diluate volume flow rate whereas the total number of current equivalents are determined from the current 
and the number of cell pairs. In this case it is thus seen that 0.91 equivalents of salt is removed pr. transferred equivalent 
of current.

Electrodialysis
2.5	
Energy requirements
Evaluation of the energy consumption when running an electrodialysis system is of very great importance. 
Generally the energy consumption in electrodialysis can be divided into two parts:
--
Pump energy: Energy to pump the solutions through the electrodialysis system
--
Electrical energy: Electrical energy to transfer ions through the ion exchange membranes
The overall energy requirement is often dominated by one of these two terms depending on different 
process parameters and operation conditions.
2.5.1	
Pump energy
In chemical engineering it is well know that the energy consumption associated with pumping liquids 
through a given system is dependent on the volume flow rate Q, the pressure drop in the system Dp and 
the efficiency of the pump Œ∑pump. The pump energy can thus be calculated by use of the following equation:

Electrodialysis
Normally in an electrodialysis system three pumps are required as mentioned earlier:
--
One pump to pump the solutions through the dilution chambers
--
One pump to pump the solutions through the concentration chambers
--
One pump to pump electrode solutions through the two electrode chambers
Thus the energy consumption to pump the solutions through an electrodialysis system can be calculated 
from knowledge of the pressure drops in the dilution-, concentration and electrode chambers, efficiencies 
of dilution-, concentration and electrode pumps and the volume flow rates in the three different types 
of chambers:

The sup-scripts d, c and e refer to the diluate, concentrate and electrode solutions, respectively. The 
volume flow rates are normally easy to measure but determining the actual pressure drop in the three 
circuits can be more uncertain and difficult to measure.
2.5.2	
Electrical energy
The energy consumption associated with removing ions from the diluate to the concentrate through 
the ion exchange membranes is proportional to the current I flowing through the membrane stack 
and the total voltage drop E between the two electrodes over the whole membrane stack. This energy 
consumption can be expressed as follows:

As for the pump energy in equation (17) the unit of the electrical energy in equation(19) is given in 
‚Äúenergy pr. time‚Äù (Joules pr. second). If one knows the resistance of one single cell pair Rcell the total 
resistance of the membrane stack consisting of n cell pairs can be calculated by multiplying the number 
of cell pairs with the resistance of one single cell pair (according to equation (9)). Thus equation (19) 
can be rewritten when the voltage drop over the whole membrane stack E is replaced by product of the 
total resistance of the membrane stack and the current flowing through the membrane stack according 
to Ohm‚Äôs law:

Electrodialysis
The amount of salt that is removed from the diluate to the concentrate is directly proportional to the 
amount of current flowing through the membrane stack (in the Ohmic region). The amount of current 
flowing through the membrane stack, the diluate volume flow rate Qd and the current utilization x 
determines the difference between the inlet and outlet concentrations of the diluate Dcd (the level of 
desalination). The current utilization is the product of the current efficiency Œ∑ (from equation (16)) and 
the number of cell pairs n (x = Œ∑√ón). This can be gathered in the following equation:

Again the term z is the valence of the ions and F is the Faraday number. The different equations presented 
in this sub section can be used to calculate the energy requirements needed to remove a certain amount 
of ions from the diluate to the concentrate. Thus the electrical energy together with the energy required 
to pump the solutions through the system determines the overall energy consumption.
2.5.3	
Thermodynamic least amount of energy
The energy consumption given in the previous section (2.5.2 Electrical energy) gives the actual energy 
consumption associated with ion transfer for a given electrodialysis system and this amount of energy 
is often much larger that the least amount of energy required just by looking at the ‚Äúthermodynamic 
least amount of energy required‚Äù. The thermodynamic least amount of energy can be considered as the 
numerical value of the amount of energy that is released when a given amount of diluate and concentrate 
are mixed together. The thermodynamic least amount of energy required can be calculated by use of 
the following equation:

In this equation it should be mentioned that ‚ÄúRgas‚Äù is the gas constant, Qd is the total volume flow rate 
of the diluate and T is the absolute temperature. As mentioned above, this thermodynamic least amount 
of energy is often much less that the actual electrical energy requirement for transferring ion through 
the membranes (equation (19) for example). This is due to the influence of different factors such as:
--
The current efficiency Œ∑ (equation (16)) is less than 1. 
--
The Ohmic resistance in the concentrate, diluate and electrode solutions and in the anion and 
cation exchange membranes causes generation of heat and thus loss of energy.

The thermodynamic efficiency is plotted as a function of the voltage for the experiment in Figure 12.
Figure 12: Thermodynamic efficiency vs. voltage 
The thermodynamic efficiency vs. the voltage for an electrodialysis experiments conducted at a 
constant diluate flow rate of 6.6 g/s and a sodium chloride feed solution of 0.16 mole/l.
It is seen in Figure 12 that the thermodynamic efficiency throughout the whole experiment is very low and in all cases 
below 4%. It is also seen that at low voltage the thermodynamic is higher than at large voltage. An explanation could 
be that at these conditions the irreversible processes at the electrodes do not play as large a role at when the voltage 
is increased. Therefore the efficiency at low voltage is ‚Äúcloser‚Äù the thermodynamic least amount of required energy than 
at larger voltage.

Electrodialysis

Anti-fouling mechanism
When electrodialysis is applied commercially to desalt seawater, fouling of the ion exchange membranes 
can be a severe problem as in every other membrane separation process. Particle material, colloids, 
macromolecules and other charged or uncharged components can block the membrane pores or 
membrane surface and thus increase the resistance of the membrane. This will increase the operation 
costs. In electrodialysis in which a current flows in one direction, especially larger charged components 
can be transferred to the membrane surface but because of their size they are not able to pass through the 
membrane. Scaling on the membrane surface at high concentrations can also create problems. Because 
most of the colloids and macromolecules that appear in the water are negatively charged, it is mostly the 
anion exchange membranes that are affected by the fouling problems. In some commercial electrodialysis 
system this is avoided by changing the direction of the current every 30 minutes for example. Of course 
this leads to changes of the chambers every 30 minutes:
--
Diluate chambers √† Concentrate chambers
--
Concentrate chambers √† Diluate chambers
This means that the outlet from the chambers in the first short period after changing the direction of the 
current can not be used as concentrate and diluate. But after this period the concentrate and diluate can 
again be collected from the outlet of the membrane stack. By doing this changing of current direction 
the charged larger particles and components that eventually will stick to the membrane surfaces will 
every 30 minutes be removed and moved to the other side the chamber and thus a build up of a large 
fouling layer over a longer period is partly avoided. Thus the overall resistance of the membrane stack 
will by average be kept constant and the running costs will be kept constant.

Summary
3	 Summary
In this book we have learned about basic terms in electrically driven membrane processes. The core in 
electrically driven membrane processes are membranes incorporated with fixed charges:
--
Anion exchange membranes and
--
Cation exchange membranes.
We have been looking at the fluxes of ions through these membranes and we have seen that these fluxes 
depend on the transport numbers of the ions. The membranes achieve their selectivity because these 
transport numbers for the oppositely charged ions are very different inside the membrane whereas the 
transport numbers in the solution for the oppositely charged ions are almost equal for equal valences. 
It is also explained that the separation principle in electrical driven membrane processes is based on 
Donnan exclusion.

Electrically Driven Membrane Processes:

Summary
One major part of the electrical driven membrane processes is electrodialysis. Electrodialysis has many 
applications and one of the greatest is the desalination of saline water into potable water. The basic 
concepts of electrodialysis are explained as well as the existence of a critical current. Examples are 
included in order to show ways to determine this critical current experimentally and from literature 
correlations based on dimensionless numbers concerning flow and mass transfer. The influence of the 
hydrodynamic conditions on the critical current is also explained and discussed. Other relevant terms 
used in the evaluation of electrodialysis systems such as the desalination degree and the current efficiency 
are also described and discussed through relevant examples. The energy required to run electrodialysis 
systems can be divided into the energy required to pump the solutions through the system and the energy 
required to transfer ions through the ion exchange membranes. Relevant equations are given in order 
to calculate these energy requirements and the thermodynamic efficiency is also defined. Finally some 
fouling problems are briefly mentioned together with an approach for avoiding these fouling problems.
Other electrically driven membrane processes such at the REED process, Donnan dialysis, Membrane 
electrolysis, the use of bipolar membranes and finally fuel cells can also be mentioned. Some of these 
processes can have the potential to grow in the future.

It shall however be mentioned that the enhanced concentration in the boundary layer on the concentrate 
side can lead to scaling of ionic solids at the membrane surface on the concentrate side for example if the 
concentrate contains calcium ions.
2.	
This happens at the cation exchange membrane before it happens at the anion exchange membrane. This is 
due to fact that the electrical mobility of the cations is generally a bit lower than for the anions. In the case 
of sodium chloride the transport number of sodium ions is approximately 0.4 and the transport number for 
chloride ions is approximately 0.6 (and actually not equal which is stated in equation (7). This is because the 
friction between the water molecules and the ions is largest for cations. This means that at a given current 
the concentration at the membrane surface on the diluate side (c ¬¥d) will reach zero at the cation exchange 
membrane before is reaches zero at the anion exchange membrane. Thus the limiting current will be attained 
faster at the cation exchange membrane than at the anion exchange membrane.

Other kinds of transport concerning the transport of water molecules through the ion exchange membranes 
are also observed in electrodialysis. Osmotic transport of water from the diluate to the concentrate can be 
observed because of the concentration difference. Electroosmotic water transport can also be observed as 
sketched in Figure 3. where water molecules are dragged along with the electrically transported ions.

When, however, the feed solution ion concentration is increased and reaches a level of concentration as the 
fixed charges in the ion exchange membrane, some co-ions may also enter the membrane which of course 
is unwanted since the membrane then looses it selectivity. That way the current efficiency becomes very low 
and the electrical energy consumption increases.
