About the Author
Tony Bove is crazy about iPods, iPhones, and iTunes, and not only provides 
free tips on his Web site (www.tonybove.com) but also took the plunge 
to develop an iPhone application (Tony’s Tips for iPhone Users). Tony has 
written more than two dozen books on computing, desktop publishing, and 
multimedia, including iPod touch For Dummies (Wiley), iLife ’04 All-In-One 
Desk Reference For Dummies (Wiley), The GarageBand Book (Wiley), The Art 
of Desktop Publishing (Bantam), and a series of books about Macromedia 
Director, Adobe Illustrator, and PageMaker. Tony also founded Desktop 
Publishing/Publish magazine and the Inside Report on New Media newslet-
ter, and he wrote the weekly Macintosh column for Computer Currents for 
a decade, as well as articles for NeXTWORLD, the Chicago Tribune Sunday 
Technology Section, and NewMedia. Tracing the personal computer revolu-
tion back to the 1960s counterculture, Tony produced a CD-ROM interactive 
documentary in 1996, Haight-Ashbury in the Sixties (featuring music from 
the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, and Jefferson Airplane). He also developed 
the Rockument music site, www.rockument.com, with commentary and 
podcasts focused on rock music history. As a founding member of the Flying 
Other Brothers, which toured professionally and released three commercial 
CDs (52-Week High, San Francisco Sounds, and Estimated Charges), Tony per-
formed with Hall of Fame rock musicians. Tony has also worked as a director 
of enterprise marketing for leading-edge software companies, and as a com-
munications director and technical publications manager.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my sons, nieces, nephews, their cousins, and all 
their children . . . the iPod generation.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I want to thank Jimi Eric Bove for providing technical expertise and per-
forming valuable testing on his iPod touch, and John Paul Bove for iTunes, 
Windows, and iPhone expertise. I also want to thank Rich Tennant for his 
wonderful cartoons, and Dennis Cohen for technical expertise beyond the 
call of duty. And let me not forget my Wiley editors Paul Levesque and John 
Edwards for ongoing assistance that made my job so much easier. A book this 
timely places a considerable burden on a publisher’s production team, and I 
thank the production crew at Wiley for diligence beyond the call of reason.
I owe thanks and a happy hour or three to Carole McLendon at Waterside, 
my agent. And fi nally, I have Executive Editor Bob Woerner at Wiley to thank 
for coming up with the idea for this book and helping me to become a profes-
sional dummy — that is, a Dummies author.

Introduction
You don’t need much imagination to see why so many people are so 
happy with their iPods and iPhones. Imagine no longer needing to take 
CDs or DVDs with you when you travel — your favorite music and videos 
fit right in your pocket and you can leave your precious content library at 
home.
What’s more, this library is stored in electronic form (and easily backed up to 
other media), so it never deteriorates — unlike CDs, DVDs, and other physical 
media that may last only a few decades.
When I first encountered the iPod, it came very close to fulfilling my dream 
as a road warrior — in particular, the dream of filling up a car with music as 
easily as filling it up with fuel. For example, I use a fully loaded iPod classic 
with my car, using a custom in-vehicle interface adapter that offers an iPod 
connector. I use a cassette adapter, or even FM radio transmitter, in a rental 
car or boat (see Chapter 5). Whether you want to be On the Road with Jack 
Kerouac (in audio book form) or “Drivin’ South” with Jimi Hendrix, just fill up 
your iPod or iPhone and go!
But first, find out about the iTunes application, which is the center of my 
media universe and the software that manages content on my iPods, my 
iPhone, and my Apple TV. I bring all my content into iTunes — from CDs, the 
online iTunes Store, and other sources — and then parcel it out to various 
iPods, iPhones, and Apple TV for playback. Even though I buy content and 
apps directly with my iPhone and iPod touch, and occasionally use Apple TV 
rather than my computer to enter the iTunes Store to rent or buy movies, 
everything I obtain is automatically synchronized with my main iTunes 
library. Everything is stored in my main iTunes library on my computer and 
backed up to another hard drive. I can even burn audio CDs and data DVDs. 
You can manage all these activities with iTunes.
iTunes was originally developed by Jeff Robbin and Bill Kincaid as an MP3 
player called SoundJam MP, and released by Casady & Greene in 1999. It was 
purchased by Apple in 2000 and redesigned and released as iTunes. Since 
then, Apple has released numerous updates of iTunes to support new iPods, 
fix bugs, and add new features to improve your content library and your iPod 
or iPhone experience. All the important features are covered in this book. 
iTunes is getting better all the time, and this book gets you started.

iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 7th Edition 
About This Book
The publishers are wise about book matters, and they helped me design iPod 
& iTunes For Dummies, 7th Edition, as a reference. With this book, you can 
easily find the information you need when you need it. I wrote it so that you 
can read from beginning to end to find out how to use iTunes and your iPod, 
iPhone, or from scratch. But this book is also organized so that you can dive 
in anywhere and begin reading the info you need to know for each task.
I didn’t have enough pages to cover every detail of every function, and I 
intentionally left out some detail so that you won’t be befuddled with 
technospeak when it’s not necessary. I wrote brief but comprehensive 
descriptions and included lots of cool tips on how to get the best results from 
using iTunes and your iPod or iPhone.
At the time I wrote this book, I covered every iPod and iPhone model avail-
able and the latest version of iTunes. Although I did my best to keep up for 
this print edition, Apple occasionally slips in a new model or new version of 
iTunes between book editions. If you’ve bought a new iPod, iPhone, that’s 
not covered in the book, or if your version of iTunes looks a little different, 
be sure to check out the book’s companion Web site for updates on the latest 
releases from Apple, as well as the Tips section of my Web site (www.tony
bove.com) for free tips.
Conventions Used in This Book
Like any book that covers computers and information technology, this book 
uses certain conventions:
 
✓ Choosing from a menu: When I write “Choose iTunes➪Preferences in 
iTunes,” you click iTunes on the toolbar and then choose Preferences 
from the iTunes menu.
 
 With an iPod classic or iPod nano, when you see “Choose Settings➪
Brightness from the iPod main menu,” you scroll (rotate your finger 
clockwise around) the click wheel to highlight Settings on the main 
menu, press the Select button (the center button) to choose Settings, 
and then highlight and choose Brightness from the Settings menu.
 
 With an iPod touch or iPhone, when you see “Choose Settings➪
Brightness from the Home screen,” tap Settings on the Home screen and 
then tap Brightness.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Sliding, scrolling, and flicking on an iPod touch or iPhone: When you 
see “Slide the screen” or “Flick the screen,” I mean that you need to use 
your finger to slide the screen. When I write “Scroll the list on the iPod 
touch Settings screen,” I mean that you should use your finger to slide 
the list so that it scrolls.
 
✓ Clicking and dragging: When you see “Drag the song over the name 
of the playlist,” I mean that you need to click the song name, hold the 
mouse button down, and then drag the song with the mouse over to the 
name of the playlist before lifting your finger off the mouse button.
 
✓ Keyboard shortcuts: When you see Ô-I, press the Ô key on a Mac 
keyboard along with the I key. (In this case, Ô-I opens the Song 
Information window in iTunes.) In Windows, the same keyboard shortcut 
is Ctrl-I (which means press the Ctrl key along with the I key). Don’t 
worry — I always tell you what the equivalent Windows keys are.
 
✓ Step lists: When you come across steps that you need to do in iTunes or 
on the iPod or iPhone, the action is in bold, and the explanatory part 
follows. If you know what to do, read the action and skip the explanation. 
But if you need a little help along the way, check out the explanation.
 
✓ Pop-up menus: I use the term pop-up menu for menus on the Mac that 
literally pop up from dialogs and windows; in Windows, the same type 
of menu actually drops down and is called a drop-down menu. I use the 
term pop-up menu for both.
And Just Who Are You?
You don’t need to know anything about music or audio technology to discover 
how to make the most of your iPod, iPhone, and iTunes. Although a course 
in music appreciation can’t hurt, these devices and iTunes are designed to 
be useful even for air-guitar players who barely know the difference between 
downloadable music and System of a Down. You don’t need any specialized 
knowledge to have a lot of fun while building your digital music library.
However, I do make some honest assumptions about your computer skills:
 
✓ You know how to use the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer. I assume 
that you already know how to locate files and folders and that you can 
copy files and folders from one hard drive to another on the computer of 
your choice: a Mac or a Windows PC.
 
✓ You know how to select menus and applications on a Mac or a 
Windows PC. I assume that you already know how to choose an option 
from a menu, how to find the Dock on a Mac to launch a Dock application 
(or use the Start menu in Windows to launch an application), and how to 
launch an application directly by double-clicking its icon.

iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 7th Edition 
For more information on these topics, see these excellent books, all published 
by Wiley: Mac OS X Snow Leopard All-in-One For Dummies (Mark L. 
Chambers), Windows Vista All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies (Woody 
Leonhard), or Windows XP Gigabook For Dummies (Peter Weverka).
A Quick Peek Ahead
This book is organized into six parts, and each part covers a different aspect 
of using your iPod or iPhone and iTunes. Here’s a quick preview of what you 
can find in each part.
Part I: Touching All the Basics
This part gets you started with your iPod or iPhone: powering it up, 
recharging its battery, and connecting it to your computer. You install and 
set up iTunes on your Mac or your Windows PC. You also find out all the 
techniques of an iPod or iPhone road warrior: setting your alarm and multiple 
clocks for time zones, keeping time with your stopwatch, changing your 
display settings, setting the passcode to lock up the device so that others 
can’t use it, and setting restrictions on content and the use of applications. 
I also describe how to connect an iPod touch or iPhone wirelessly to the 
Internet with Wi-Fi, how to use your iPod or iPhone on the road with car 
stereos and portable speakers, and what types of accessories are available.
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup
This part shows you what you can do with iTunes. To acquire music, you can 
download it from the iTunes Store or other online services (such as Amazon), 
record it directly into your computer (using recording software such as 
GarageBand) and import it into iTunes, or rip audio CDs into iTunes. You can 
also download podcasts, audio books, movies, TV shows, and music videos 
from the iTunes Store or import them into iTunes from other sources. You 
find out how to download applications for the iPod touch or iPhone from the 
App Store, and how to download music, podcasts, videos, and applications 
directly to your iPod touch or iPhone. I also show you how to synchronize 
your iPod or iPhone with your iTunes library on your computer, and with 
your personal contacts, e-mail accounts, Web bookmarks, and calendars.

5
 Introduction
Part III: Managing Your Library
This part shows you how to sort the content in your iTunes library by artist, 
album, duration, date, and other items. You find out how to add and edit 
iTunes song information, and even fine-tune the sound of each song. You also 
discover how to arrange songs and albums into iTunes playlists that you can 
transfer to your iPod or iPhone and burn onto audio CDs. This part also contains 
crucial information about locating and backing up your iTunes library.
Part IV: Playing It Back 
on Your iPod or iPhone
I show you how to locate and play all types of content — music, audio books, 
podcasts, movies, TV shows, and videos — on your iPod, and on the iPod 
section of your iPhone. You discover how to control playback, adjust the 
volume, and equalize the sound. I also describe how to synchronize photo 
albums with your iPod or iPhone and display photo slide shows, as well as 
how to share images by e-mail and play YouTube videos with your iPod touch 
or iPhone.
Part V: Touching the Online World
This part describes how to use your iPod touch or iPhone and the Safari 
application to surf the Web. You also find out how to check and send e-mail, 
look at your stock portfolio, check the weather in your city and other cities, 
and display maps and driving directions. I also show how to use your iPod 
touch or iPhone to locate and communicate with friends on Facebook, 
MySpace, Twitter, and other social networks and instantly chat with people. 
You also discover how to enter and edit calendar entries in the Calendar 
application, and enter and sort contacts in the Contacts application.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this book’s Part of Tens chapters, I provide initial troubleshooting steps 
and details about updating and restoring your iPod or iPhone. I also provide 
useful tips that can help make your iPod, iPhone, and iTunes experience a 
completely satisfying one.

Chapter 1
Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
In This Chapter
▶ Comparing iPod and iPhone models
▶ Powering up your iPod or iPhone
▶ Using and recharging your battery 
iPods and iPhones have completely changed the way people play music, 
audio books, and videos, and new models are changing the way people use 
computer applications, shoot photos and videos, play games, and use the 
Internet.
But don’t just take my word for it. “It’s hard to remember what I did before 
the iPod,” said Grammy Award–winner Mary J. Blige in an Apple press 
release. “iPod is more than just a music player; it’s an extension of your 
personality and a great way to take your favorite music with you everywhere 
you go.” Lance Armstrong, seven-time Tour de France champion, takes his 
running shoes and iPod with him everywhere. “I listen to music when I run. 
Having my music with me is really motivating.”
The iPod even plays an important role in Western culture. Pope Benedict XVI 
has an iPod engraved with his coat of arms. President Barack Obama gave 
the U.K.’s Queen Elizabeth II an iPod preloaded to play rare songs by Richard 
Rodgers. And when Bono of U2 gave an iPod shuffle to George H.W. Bush, the 
former President remarked, “I get the shuffle and then I shuffle the shuffle.”
The iPod was first invented for playing music, and you can download entire 
albums from the iTunes Store and play them on any iPod or iPhone. You can 
also download movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store and play them 
on an iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod touch, or iPhone. With an Internet con-
nection, you can download tunes, podcasts (which download automatically 
when you subscribe to them), and games directly to an iPod touch or iPhone, 
and also select from a library of over 75,000 applications (known as apps) 
that offer everything from soup to nuts.

10
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
This chapter introduces iPods and iPhones and tells you what to expect 
when you open the box. I describe how to power up your iPod or iPhone and 
connect it to your computer, both of which are essential tasks that you need 
to know how to do — your iPod or iPhone needs power, and it needs audio 
and video, which it gets from your computer.
Introducing the iPod and iPhone
The convenience of carrying music on an iPod or iPhone is phenomenal. For 
example, the 2GB iPod shuffle can hold 500 songs, which is plenty for getting 
around town, while the new 160GB iPod classic can hold around 40,000 songs — 
that’s more than eight weeks of nonstop music played around the clock. 
A common misconception is that your iPod or iPhone becomes your music 
and video library. Actually, your iPod or iPhone is simply another player 
for your content library, which is safely stored on your computer. One 
considerable benefit of using your computer to organize your content is that 
you can make perfect-quality copies of music, videos, movies, podcasts, and 
audio books. You can then copy as much of the content as you want, in a 
more compressed format, onto your iPod or iPhone and take it on the road. 
Meanwhile, your perfect copies are stored safely on your computer in digital 
files. These digital files can be copied over and over forever, just like the 
rest of your information, and they never lose their quality. If you save your 
content in digital format, you’ll never see your songs or videos degrade, and 
you’ll never have to buy the content again.
The iPod and iPhone experience includes iTunes (for Mac or Windows), 
which lets you synchronize content with your iPod and other devices, such 
as the Apple TV player for your home TV and stereo. Just as importantly, 
iTunes is the portal to the online iTunes Store, where you can purchase 
and download content. You also use iTunes to organize your content, make 
copies, burn CDs, and play disc jockey without discs. I introduce iTunes in 
Chapter 2.
An iPod is also a data player, and in the case of the iPod touch and iPhone, a 
complete personal computer that lets you enter data and run applications as 
well as play content. The current model iPod nano and the iPhone 3GS can 
also shoot videos, while the iPhone and iPhone 3G can shoot still pictures. 
You can keep track of your calendar and contacts with an iPod or iPhone, 
and with an iPod touch or iPhone, you can check and send e-mail, visit your 
favorite Web sites, get maps, obtain driving directions, check the current 
weather, and even check your stock portfolio, to name just a few things.

 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
Comparing iPod Models
Introduced way back in the Stone Age of digital music (2001), the iPod family 
has grown by eight generations as of this writing (see Figure 1-1), including 
the popular iPod touch, the high-capacity iPod classic, the ultra-slim iPod 
nano that now includes a video camera, and the tiny iPod shuffle — the iPod 
you can clip to your belt or wear on your sleeve.
 
Figure 1-1: 
The iPod 
family 
includes 
(left to right) 
the iPod 
touch, iPod 
classic, iPod 
nano, and 
iPod shuffle.
 
Here’s a rundown on today’s iPod models: 
 
✓ The iPod touch: The iPod touch shares the design characteristics 
and many of the features of its more famous cousin, the iPhone, with 
the same multi-touch-sensitive screen (a.k.a. Touchscreen) and Wi-Fi 
Internet connectivity. (Wi-Fi, which is short for wireless fidelity, is a 
popular connection method for local area networks that I describe in 
detail in Chapter 4.)
 
✓ The iPod classic: The original iPod design offers a higher capacity 
(160GB) than other models.
 
✓ The iPod nano: The iPod nano comes in a variety of colors and includes 
a video camera for shooting videos and a motion sensor; you can shake 
the iPod nano to shuffle your songs!
 
✓ The iPod shuffle: You can clip the tiniest iPod to your sleeve, and its 
voice tells you the song title and artist.

Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
To find out more about previous generations of iPods, including detailed 
information about cables and connections, visit this book’s companion Web 
site. For a nifty chart that shows the differences among iPod models, see the 
Identifying Different iPod Models page on the Apple iPod Web site (http://
support.apple.com/kb/HT1353).
Fingering the iPod touch
The iPod touch is much more than a media player. Less than a third of an 
inch thick and weighing only 4 ounces, the iPod touch is really a pocket 
computer — it uses a flash memory drive and an operating system that can 
run applications. Just like the iPhone, it offers the same Touchscreen with 
icons for launching apps, the same on-screen keyboard for entering informa-
tion, the same Home button on the front, and the same built-in speaker and 
volume controls on the left side.
Apple offers the following sizes of iPod touch models as of this writing, and 
they all use the same battery that offers up to 36 hours of music playback, or 
6 hours of video playback:
 
✓ The 8GB model holds about 1,750 songs, 10,000 photos, or about 10 
hours of video.
 
✓ The 32GB model holds about 7,000 songs, 40,000 photos, or about 40 
hours of video. (With 7,000 songs, you would have more than a week of 
nonstop music played around the clock.)
 
✓ The 64GB model holds about 14,000 songs, 90,000 photos, or about 80 
hours of video. 
Like the iPhone, the iPod touch lets you access the Web over a Wi-Fi Internet 
connection. After it finds one or more networks, the iPod touch lets you 
choose one to connect to the Internet, and it can remember the settings for 
that network so that it can automatically choose the same network again.
After you’re on Wi-Fi, you can then use the Safari app to browse the Web 
and interact with Web services, and the Mail app to send and receive e-mail. 
Stocks, Maps, and Weather are apps that show information from the Internet. 
You can also use the YouTube app to play YouTube videos on the Web. All 
these apps are supplied with your iPod touch, and you can download more 
apps by connecting to Wi-Fi and the Internet as I describe in Chapter 4, and 
touching the App Store icon, as I describe in Chapter 7.
You also use apps to connect to the Internet in other ways than browsing. 
For example, popular social networks such as Facebook and MySpace offer 

13
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
apps to connect you with your friends on those services. Google offers an 
array of services through the Google Mobile app, including the ability to edit 
documents and spreadsheets, use the Gmail service, and share calendars 
and photos. The Twitterific app lets you post tweets on Twitter, and the 
WhosHere and Loopt apps can connect you directly to other iPod touch and 
iPhone users for chatting.
Many of the apps you’ll find listed at the App store are especially designed 
to take advantage of three distinct features of the iPod touch: its multi-touch 
display; its accelerometer (which detects acceleration, rotation, motion 
gestures, and tilt); and its capability to detect its physical location.
For example, Motion X Poker — actually a dice game — uses the accelerometer 
to let you roll the dice by shaking the iPod touch. The Flick Fishing app senses 
motion so that you can cast a fishing line with a flick of the wrist. And for really 
precise motion, try rolling a steel ball over a wooden labyrinth of holes in the 
free Labyrinth Lite app.
Sensing your iPod touch’s location is a very useful feature. The Showtimes 
app uses your iPod touch’s location to show the closest movie theaters to 
you. The Eventful app uses your location to display local events and venues, 
and the Lethal app can tell you the dangers that could surround you — the 
hostile animals, the likelihood of crimes, the prevalence of disease, and the 
potential for accidents and disasters.
In short, an iPod touch can do nearly everything an iPhone can do, except 
make cellular-service phone calls, use the 3G data network, shoot pictures, 
and pinpoint its exact location with the Global Positioning System. Even so, 
the iPod touch can pinpoint its approximate location with Internet-based 
Location Services, and you can make phone calls using the Skype app, a Wi-Fi 
connection, and an external microphone.
Twirling the iPod classic
The eighth-generation iPod classic model uses the same click wheel and but-
tons as the seventh-, sixth-, and fifth-generation models, combining the scroll 
wheel with pressure-sensitive buttons underneath the top, bottom, left, and 
right areas of the circular pad of the wheel. As of this writing, Apple provides 
a slim, 4.9-ounce 160GB model in black or gray.
The eighth-generation 160GB model holds about 40,000 songs, 25,000 photos, 
or about 200 hours of video, and its battery offers up to 36 hours of music 
playback, or 6 hours of video playback. The seventh-generation 120GB model 
holds about 20,000 songs or about 150 hours of video.

14
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Mano a mano with iPod nano
The iPod nano, pencil thin and only 1.5 inches wide by 3.5 inches high, 
weighs only 1.3 ounces. Its curved, all-aluminum design and fine array of 
colors make it the most fashionable iPod.
This mini marvel (see Figure 1-2) offers a 2-inch color LCD that crisply 
shows iPod menus, album artwork, and video in either vertical or horizontal 
orientation, and includes a motion sensor so that you can rotate it quickly to 
change orientation and shake it to shuffle songs. Apple offers an 8GB model 
that holds about 2,000 songs or up to 8 hours of video (or 7,000 photos) and 
a 16GB model that holds about 4,000 songs or up to 16 hours of video (or 
14,000 photos).
As part of the eighth-generation of the iPod family, the fifth-generation iPod 
nano includes a video camera and a built-in microphone, as well as an FM 
tuner for listening to radio and a pedometer to keep track of your footsteps.
 
Figure 1-2: 
iPod nano 
can shoot 
videos as 
well as play 
audio and 
video 
content.
 
Each model offers a battery that can play up to 24 hours of music — all day 
and all of the night — or 4 hours of video.
The earlier-generation iPod nano models are the smallest that can serve up 
videos, podcasts, photos, and musical slide shows as well as your personal 
calendar and contacts. Each model uses the same style of click wheel and but-
tons as the iPod classic. Unlike the smaller iPod shuffle, the iPod nano models 
are full-featured iPods with loads of accessories tailored specifically for it.

15
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
Doing the iPod shuffle
If the regular iPod models aren’t small enough to fit into your lifestyle, try the 
ultra-tiny 2GB or 4GB iPod shuffle (see Figure 1-3), which is only 1.8 inches 
tall and 0.3 inches thin. Its built-in clip lets you attach it to almost anything. It 
has no display, but that’s actually a good thing because this design keeps the 
size and weight to a minimum.
 
Figure 1-3: 
An iPod 
shuffle is so 
small that its 
controls 
are on the 
earbud 
cable.
 
For the third-generation of this tiny iPod, Apple moved its controls to the 
right earbud cord (refer to Figure 1-3) so that you can navigate through your 
songs easily without looking at the controls. A single button click starts 
music playing, and a single click pauses the music that’s already playing. 
Click twice to go to the next track or three times to go to the previous track. 
You can use the earbud control while running, driving, skiing, snowboarding, 
or even skydiving.
Another cool feature makes it even easier to use these earbud controls: 
The iPod shuffle talks to you with the VoiceOver feature. Press and hold the 
center button to hear the title and artist of the song, or hold it longer until 
you hear a tone, and then release to hear the names of playlists. After 
hearing the playlist you want, click once to select it (if you copied over 
multiple playlists, as I describe in Chapter 9). VoiceOver even tells you 
whether your battery needs charging.

16
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
The 2GB iPod shuffle holds about 500 songs, and the 4GB iPod shuffle holds 
about 1,000 songs, assuming an average of 4 minutes per song, using the AAC 
format at the High Quality setting for adding music (as described in Chapter 8). 
The battery is the same for both models, offering up to 12 hours of power 
between charges.
 
Unlike other iPods, iPod shuffle can’t play tunes in the highest-quality Audio 
Interchange File Format (AIFF) or Apple Lossless formats, which consume a 
lot of storage space. See Chapter 8 for details on adding music to your iTunes 
library.

The Innovative iPhone
The iPhone, which includes all the features of an iPod touch, can not only 
phone home, but also monitor all your e-mail and browse the Internet with a 
full-page display, using a Wi-Fi network when it senses one. The Touchscreen 
(see Figure 1-4) provides a rich set of icons for launching apps, and includes 
a full on-screen keyboard for entering text, numbers, and special symbols. 
And the iPhone is no slouch when it comes to acting like an iPod: It can 
play music, audio books, videos (such as TV shows, music videos, and even 
feature-length movies), and even podcasts. You can also display photos and 
slide shows set to music.
The 8GB iPhone 3G, (introduced in July 2008), is slimmer and more powerful 
than the original iPhone, adding fast 3G data wireless technology, GPS map-
ping, and the capability for enterprises to push virtual private network (VPN) 
and Wi-Fi configurations out to all their iPhones in the field. The iPhone 3GS, 
introduced in June 2009 in 16GB and 32GB models, offers faster 3G data service, 
a higher-resolution camera for photos that also shoots videos, as well as 
voice control and longer battery life. Both incorporate flash memory just like 
an iPod touch, iPod shuffle, or iPod nano. The iPhone 3.5-inch, widescreen, 
multi-touch display offers 480-x-320–pixel resolution at 160 dots per inch for 
crisp video pictures, and it can display multiple languages and characters 
simultaneously.
The iPhone 3GS built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery offers up to 12 
hours of talk time using 2G or 5 hours using 3G (with 300 hours on standby); 
the iPhone 3G offers the same except only 10 hours of talk time using 2G. 
The iPhone 3GS also offers up to 9 hours browsing the Internet on Wi-Fi or 
5 hours using 3G, up to 10 hours playing video, and up to 30 hours playing 
music. The iPhone 3G offers 6 hours of Wi-Fi, 5 hours of 3G, 7 hours of video, 
and 24 hours of music. Both offer Bluetooth for using wireless headphones 
and microphones when making phone calls.

Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Thinking Inside the Box
Don’t destroy the elegantly designed box while opening it. Before going any 
further, check the box and make sure that all the correct parts came with 
your iPod or iPhone. Keep the box in case, heaven forbid, you need to return 
the iPod or iPhone to Apple — the box ensures that you can safely return it 
for a new battery or replacement.
The iPod touch, iPod classic, iPod nano, and iPhone are each supplied with
 
✓ Stereo headphones (often called earbuds)
 
✓ A dock adapter fitted for the optional Apple Universal Dock (not 
included)
 
✓ A Dock Connector–to–USB cable
The cable connects your iPod or iPhone (or its dock) to your computer or to 
the AC power adapter using a USB (Universal Serial Bus) connection — a way 
of attaching things to computers and bussing data around while providing 
power. The cable has a USB connector on one end and a flat dock connector 
on the other end to connect either to a dock or directly to an iPod or iPhone.
The iPod shuffle comes with earbuds and a special cable to connect to a 
power adapter or your computer. Older iPod shuffle models come with 
earbuds and a special smaller dock to connect to a power adapter or your 
computer.
The iPhone also comes with a power adapter for recharging the battery. 
You will want to get a power adapter for your iPod (not in the box but 
available from the Apple Store) if you want to use AC power, rather than 
your computer, to supply power to recharge your iPod.
Outside the box
There are a few things you may want to have around that are not in the box. 
For example, even though you don’t really need an AC power adapter or 
dock — you can connect the iPod or iPhone directly to your computer to 
recharge your battery — a power adapter or dock is useful for keeping the 
battery charged without having to connect the iPod or iPhone to your computer.
 
The earbuds supplied with your iPod or iPhone may not suit your tastes, but 
you can find a hundred other headphone products that might. You can get all 
kinds of accessories, including headphones, speakers, the Apple Universal 
Dock, other docks, and AC power adapters, from the online Apple Store 
(www.apple.com/store), the physical Apple Store, or other stores such as 
Amazon.com and Fry’s. Docks of various sizes, shapes, and functions are also 
available from vendors such as Belkin, Monster, and Griffin.

19
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
Computer and software not included
You still need a computer and iTunes to manage the content on your iPod or 
iPhone. These things are not in the box, obviously.
You’ve seen requirements before — lots of jargon about MB (megabytes), GB 
(gigabytes), GHz (gigahertz), and RAM (random access memory), sprinkled 
with names like Intel, AMD, and Mac OS X. Skip this section if you already 
know that your iPod or iPhone works with your computer and you already 
have iTunes. But if you don’t know whether it will work, and you don’t have 
iTunes yet, read on.
You need the following:
 
✓ A PC or Mac to run iTunes: On a PC, iTunes version 9 requires Windows 
XP (with Service Pack 2) or a 32-bit edition of Windows Vista, running 
on a 1-GHz Intel or AMD processor with a QuickTime-compatible audio 
card and a minimum of 512MB of RAM; 1GB is required to play HD-quality 
videos, an iTunes LP, or iTunes Extras from the iTunes Store. You need a 
DirectX 9.0–compatible video card with 32MB of video RAM (64MB 
recommended) to watch video, and a 2-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster 
processor to play HD-quality videos, an iTunes LP, or iTunes Extras. 
64-bit editions of Windows Vista require the iTunes 9 64-bit installer, 
available for downloading from the iTunes download page.
 
 With a Mac, iTunes version 9 runs on all versions of Mac OS X Leopard 
and Snow Leopard or newer versions, and on the older Mac OS X Tiger 
version 10.4.11 or newer version. You need a 500-MHz processor or 
better (Intel or PowerPC) and at least 512MB of RAM; 1GB of RAM is 
required to play HD-quality videos, an iTunes LP, or iTunes Extras from 
the iTunes Store. You also need an Intel PowerPC G5 or a 1-GHz PowerPC 
G4 or faster processor, with 16MB of video RAM, to play videos, and a 
2-GHz Intel Core 2 Duo or faster processor to play HD-quality videos, an 
iTunes LP, or iTunes Extras.
 
✓ USB connection: You need support for USB 2.0 (also called a high-powered 
USB) for iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod shuffle, iPod touch, iPhone, and 
sixth- and fifth-generation iPods. However, you can use FireWire (IEEE 
1394) with older iPod models. 
 
 For details about using USB or FireWire cables, visit this book’s companion 
Web site.
 
✓ iTunes: Make sure that you have the current version of iTunes — use the 
Automatic Update feature, which I describe in Chapter 2, to keep your 
iTunes software up to date. You can also download iTunes for Windows 
or the Mac from the Apple site (www.apple.com/itunes/download); 
it’s free. See Chapter 2 for instructions.
 
 Older iPod models, still available in stores and online, might include 
versions of iTunes on CD-ROM as old as version 4.5, which is fine 

20
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
because version 4.5 works. (It just doesn’t have all the features of the 
current version.) You can download a newer version at any time to 
replace it.
 
✓ QuickTime: QuickTime comes with iTunes. The iTunes installer for the 
PC installs the newest version of QuickTime for Windows (version 7.6.2 
as of this writing), replacing any older version you might have. Macs 
have QuickTime preinstalled (version 7.6.2 as of this writing), and Mac 
OS X automatically updates QuickTime if you use the Software Update 
feature of System Preferences on the Apple menu.
 
✓ Internet connection: Apple recommends a broadband Internet 
connection to buy content and stream previews from the iTunes Store, 
although it is possible with a dialup connection. At a minimum, you need 
some kind of Internet connection to download iTunes itself.
 
✓ CD-R or DVD-R drive: Without a disc burner, you can’t burn your own 
discs. On a PC, you need a CD-R or DVD-R drive. On a Mac, you need a 
Combo or Super Drive to burn your own discs.
Applying Power
All iPod and iPhone models come with essentially the same requirement: 
power. You can supply power to your iPod or iPhone (and charge your 
battery at the same time) by using the provided cable and your computer, or 
you can use an optional AC power adapter that works with voltages in North 
America and many parts of Europe and Asia. (See Chapter 5 for information 
about plugging into power in other countries.)
Connecting your iPod or iPhone
On the bottom of the iPod touch, iPod classic, iPod nano, or iPhone, you find 
a large connection called the Dock Connector. The Dock Connector mirrors 
the connection on the end of a dock — your iPod or iPhone fits snugly in a 
dock, and the dock offers the Dock Connector for your computer.
To connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer, plug the flat connector of 
the cable into the iPod or iPhone Dock Connector (or the connector on the 
dock holding your iPod or iPhone) and then plug the USB connector on the 
other end of the cable into the USB port on your computer. 
The iPod shuffle is supplied with a special USB cable that plugs into the 
headphone connection of the iPod shuffle and draws power from the USB 
connection on the computer or from a USB power adapter. Plug one end of 
the included cable into the headphone connection of iPod shuffle and the 
other end into a USB 2.0 connection on your computer or power adapter. 

21
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
Older iPod shuffle models are supplied with a mini-dock with a USB cable 
attached — insert your iPod shuffle into the mini-dock, and connect the 
unattached end of the cable to a USB 2.0 connection on your computer or 
power adapter.
 
Do you want your iPod or iPhone to stand upright? Just connect it to an Apple 
or a third-party dock and then use the cable supplied with your iPod or 
iPhone to connect the dock to your computer or power adapter. The dock 
keeps your iPod or iPhone in an upright position while connected and also 
provides connections for a home stereo or headphones. Some docks offer 
built-in speakers. A dock can be convenient as a base station when you’re 
not traveling with your iPod or iPhone because you can slip it into the dock 
without connecting cables. You can pick up a dock at an Apple Store, order 
one online, or take advantage of third-party dock offerings.
You can connect the USB end of the supplied cable to either the Apple (or 
third-party USB) power adapter for power, or to the computer’s USB 2.0 
port for power. As soon as you connect it to the computer, iTunes starts up 
and begins syncing the iPod or iPhone (see Chapter 9). After syncing, the 
computer continues to provide power through the USB 2.0 port to the iPod 
or iPhone.
Why USB 2.0? What happened to 1.0? Most PCs and all current Macs already 
have USB 2.0, which is all you need to provide power and to sync an iPod or 
iPhone with your computer. Although you can use a low-speed USB 1.0 or 
1.1 connection to sync your iPod or iPhone, it’s slower than molasses on a 
subzero morning for syncing.
 
To find out more about previous generations of iPods, including detailed 
information about USB and FireWire cables and connections, visit this book’s 
companion Web site.
 
Don’t use another USB device in a chain, and don’t use a USB hub to connect 
your iPod or iPhone unless the hub is a powered hub — a hub with a separate 
power source, in other words. Note that many USB keyboards (such as current 
Apple keyboards) that offer USB connections don’t provide power to the iPod 
or iPhone.
Turning it on and off
Touch any button to turn on an iPod nano or iPod classic. To turn off an iPod 
nano or iPod classic, press and hold the Play/Pause button. To keep an iPod 
nano or iPod classic from turning on by accident, you can lock it with the 
Hold switch on the top (or on the bottom next to the dock connection on 
early iPod nano models). The Hold switch locks the iPod buttons so that you 
don’t accidentally activate them — slide the Hold switch so that it exposes an 

22
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
orange layer underneath. To unlock the buttons, slide the Hold switch so that 
it hides the orange layer underneath.
To turn on an iPod shuffle, slide the three-way switch to expose the green 
layer underneath. To turn it off, slide the three-way switch to hide the green 
layer. Older iPod shuffle models provide an On/Off switch, located on top 
next to the word OFF. Slide this switch away from OFF to turn it on, or toward 
OFF to turn it off. With the three-way switch or On/Off switch, iPod shuffle 
models don’t need a Hold switch.
To turn on the iPod touch or iPhone, press the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button 
on top, or the Home button on the front. The screen shows the message 
Slide to unlock — slide your finger across this message to unlock your 
iPod touch or iPhone.
To put an iPod touch or iPhone to sleep, press the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) 
button. This reduces the power consumption to a tiny trickle (just enough to 
allow the software to respond to a quick touch, and in the case of the iPhone, 
to respond to phone calls). Putting the iPod touch or iPhone to sleep also 
locks its controls just like a Hold switch.
To awaken the iPod touch or iPhone again, press the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) 
button or Home button. 
You can turn the iPod touch or iPhone completely off by holding down the 
Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button for about two seconds, until you see the Slide 
to Power Off slider; then slide your finger across the slider to turn it off. You 
can then turn it back on by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) 
button. To save battery power, you should plug the iPod touch or iPhone into 
AC power or your computer before turning it back on from a completely off 
state. (For battery details, see the next section in this chapter.)
 
If your iPod nano or iPod classic shows a display but doesn’t respond to your 
button-pressing, don’t panic. Just check the Hold switch and make sure that 
it’s set to one side so that the orange layer underneath disappears (the normal 
position).
You might notice that an iPod classic or iPod nano display turns iridescent 
when it gets too hot or too cold, but this effect disappears when its temperature 
returns to normal. iPods can function in temperatures as cold as 50 degrees 
and as warm as 95° F (Fahrenheit), but they work best at room temperature 
(closer to 68° F).
If you leave your iPod or iPhone out in the cold all night, it might have 
trouble waking from Sleep mode, and it might even display a low-battery 
message. Plug the iPod or iPhone into a power source, wait until it warms up, 
and try it again. If it still doesn’t wake up or respond properly, try resetting 
the iPod or iPhone, as I describe in Chapter 22.

23
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
Facing Charges of Battery
You can take a six-hour flight from New York City to California and listen to 
your iPod the entire time — and, with some models, listen all the way back 
on the return flight — without recharging. All current iPod models use the 
same type of built-in, rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery with the 
following power specs:
 
✓ The iPod shuffle offers 10 hours of music-playing time.
 
✓ The iPod nano offers 24 hours of music-playing time or 4 hours of video 
or photo display with music.
 
✓ The iPod classic offers 36 hours of music playback or 6 hours of video or 
photo display with music.
 
✓ The iPod touch offers 36 hours of music-playing time, or 6 hours of 
video, browsing the Internet using Wi-Fi, or displaying photo slide shows 
with music.
 
✓ The iPhone models offer up to 30 hours of music-playing time, 10 hours 
of video-playing time, or 6 hours of photo display with music. However, 
depending on your network settings, practical battery time can vary 
widely. The iPhone models can operate for 300 hours on standby 
(waiting for calls) if you do nothing else with them. You also find different 
power requirements for different networks:
 
• All iPhone models offer the AT&T 2G network in the United States 
for calling and data transfer, and give you about 10 hours of talk 
time (12 hours on an iPhone 3GS).
 
 Note that the iPhone 3G offers both 2G and 3G modes for calling 
and data transfer, and gives you about 5 hours of talk time 
in 3G mode. You can turn off 3G to use 2G by choosing 
Settings➪General➪Network and tapping the On button for the 
Enable 3G option.
 
• The iPhone 3GS offers 9 hours of browsing the Internet using Wi-Fi 
(the iPhone 3G offers 6 hours), and both the iPhone 3G and 3GS 
offer 5 hours of browsing using 3G.
 
To find out more about the batteries in previous generations of iPods, visit 
this book’s companion Web site.
Keep in mind that playback battery time varies depending on how you use 
your iPod or iPhone — if you mix Web browsing and picture-taking with video 
playback on an iPod touch or iPhone, you’ll have less battery time than if you 
just played music.

24
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Recharging your battery
The iPod or iPhone battery recharges automatically when you connect it to a 
power source. For example, it starts charging immediately when you insert it 
into a dock that’s connected to a power source (or to a computer with a 
powered USB connection). It takes only four hours to recharge the battery 
fully for all models, and only three hours for an iPod nano or iPod shuffle.
 
Need power when you’re on the run? Look for a power outlet in the airport 
terminal or hotel lobby and plug in your iPod with your AC power adapter — 
the iPod nano battery fast-charges to 80 percent capacity in 1.5 hours, and 
the other models and iPhone fast-charge in 2 hours. After the fast-charge, the 
battery receives a trickle charge until fully charged.
 
Don’t fry your iPod or iPhone with some generic power adapter. Use only 
the power adapter from Apple or a certified iPod adapter, such as the power 
accessories from Belkin, Griffin, Monster, XtremeMac, and other vendors.
A battery icon with a progress bar in the upper-right corner of the iPod or 
iPhone display indicates how much power is left. When you charge the battery, 
the battery icon displays a lightning bolt. The battery icon is completely 
filled in when the battery is fully charged, and it slowly empties into just an 
outline as the battery is used up.
 
You can use your iPod or iPhone while the battery is charging, or you can 
disconnect it and use it before the battery is fully charged.
You can check the battery status of an iPod shuffle by turning it on or by 
connecting it to your computer. You can check the battery status without 
interrupting playback by quickly turning the iPod shuffle off and then on 
again. The tiny battery status light next to the headphone connector tells you 
how much charge you have:
 
✓ Green: The iPod shuffle is fully charged (if connected to a computer) or 
charged at least 50 percent.
 
✓ Orange: The iPod shuffle battery is still charging (if connected to a 
computer) or is as low as 25 percent. If the iPod shuffle is connected 
to your computer and blinking orange, this means that iTunes is 
synchronizing it — don’t disconnect the iPod shuffle until it stops 
blinking.
 
✓ Red: Very little charge is left, and you need to recharge it.
If no light is visible, the iPod shuffle is completely out of power, and you need 
to recharge it to use it.

25
 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
On the newest iPod shuffle models, you can click and hold the center button 
to hear the VoiceOver feature tell you your battery status: “full,” “75 percent,” 
“50 percent,” “25 percent,” or “low.”
In iTunes, the battery icon next to your iPod shuffle’s name in the Devices 
section of the Source list shows the battery status. The icon displays a 
lightning bolt when the battery is charging and a plug when the battery is 
fully charged.
 
The iPod’s or iPhone’s built-in, rechargeable battery is, essentially, a life-or-
death proposition. After it’s dead, it can be replaced, but Apple charges a 
replacement fee plus shipping. If your warranty is still active, you should have 
Apple replace it under the warranty program (which may cost nothing except 
perhaps shipping). Don’t try to replace it yourself unless you don’t mind 
invalidating the warranty.
Keeping an iPod or iPhone in a snug carrying case when charging is tempting 
but also potentially disastrous. An iPod or iPhone needs to dissipate its 
heat, and you could damage the unit by overheating it and frying its circuits, 
rendering it as useful as a paperweight. To get around this problem, you can 
purchase one of the heat-dissipating carrying cases available in the Apple 
Store. Alternatively, MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers a variety of 
sporty cases for about $30 to $40. See Chapter 5 for more on accessories.
 
If you don’t use your iPod or iPhone for a month, even if it is connected to 
power and retaining a charge, it can still become catatonic. Perhaps it gets 
depressed from being left alone too long. At that point, it may not start — 
you have to completely drain and recharge the battery. To drain the battery, 
disconnect your iPod or iPhone from power for 24 hours. Then, to fully 
recharge the battery, connect it to power for at least 4 hours without using it 
(or longer if you are using it).
Saving power
The iPod classic and older models include a hard drive, and whatever causes 
the hard drive to spin causes a drain on power. iPod nano, iPod shuffle, iPod 
touch, and iPhone models use a flash drive, which uses less power but still 
uses power when playing content. The iPod touch and iPhone also use power 
accessing the Internet, running applications, and in the case of the iPhone, 
making and receiving calls and using Bluetooth devices. Keeping these 
activities to a minimum can help you save power.

26
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
If you use the AIFF or WAV formats for adding music to your iTunes library, 
don’t use them with your iPod or iPhone. AIFF and WAV take up way too much 
space on the iPod or iPhone and fill the cache too quickly, causing skips when 
you play them and using too much battery power because the hard drive or 
flash drive is accessed more often. (See Chapter 8 for details on adding 
music.)
 
To find out more about audio encoding formats and about converting music 
from one format to another, visit the Tips section of the author’s Web site at 
www.tonybove.com.
The following are tips on saving power while using your iPod or iPhone:
 
✓ Pause. Pause playback when you’re not listening to music or watching 
video. Pausing (stopping) playback is the easiest way to conserve 
power, especially with an iPod shuffle.
Maintaining battery mojo
You have several ways to keep your battery 
healthy. I recommend a lean diet of topping 
off your iPod or iPhone battery whenever it is 
convenient.
Using and recharging 100 percent of battery 
capacity is called a charge cycle. You can 
charge the battery many times, but there is a 
limit to how many full-charge cycles you can do 
before needing to replace the battery.
Each time you complete a charge cycle (100 
percent recharge), it diminishes battery capacity 
slightly. Apple estimates that the battery loses 
20 percent of its capacity (meaning it holds 80 
percent of the charge) after 400 full-charge 
cycles. Recharging your battery when it’s only 
half empty does not count as a full-charge 
cycle, but as half a charge cycle. That means 
you can use half its power one day and then 
recharge it fully, and then use half the next day 
and recharge it fully again; this would count as 
one charge cycle, not two.
It’s a good idea to calibrate the battery once 
soon after you get your iPod or iPhone. That is, 
run it all the way down (a full discharge) and 
then charge it all the way up (which takes four 
hours for an iPod touch, iPhone, or iPod classic, 
or three hours for an iPod nano or iPod shuffle). 
Although this doesn’t actually change battery 
performance, it does improve the battery gauge 
so that the gauge displays a more accurate 
reading. This calibration occurs anyway if you 
fully recharge the battery, but if you’ve never 
done that, you can calibrate it by disconnecting 
the iPod or iPhone from power for 24 hours to 
make sure that the battery is empty, and then 
fully recharging the battery.
Lithium-ion batteries typically last three years or 
more and are vulnerable to high temperatures, 
which decrease their life spans considerably. 
Don’t leave your iPod or iPhone in a hot place, 
such as on a sunny car dashboard, for very 
long.
For a complete description of how Apple’s 
batteries work, see the Apple Lithium-Ion 
Batteries page at www.apple.com/

 Chapter 1: Firing Up Your iPod and iPhone
 
✓ Lock it (with the iPod touch or iPhone). Press the Sleep/Wake 
button on top of the iPod touch or iPhone to immediately put it 
to sleep and lock its controls to save battery power. You can set 
your iPod touch or iPhone to automatically go to sleep by choosing 
Settings➪General➪Auto-Lock from the Home menu, and choosing 1 
Minute, 2 Minutes, 3 Minutes, 4 Minutes, or 5 Minutes (or Never, to 
prevent automatic sleep).
 
✓ Hold it (with the iPod classic or iPod nano). Flip the Hold switch on 
iPod classic and iPod nano models to the locked position (with the 
orange layer showing underneath) to make sure that controls aren’t 
accidentally activated. You don’t want your iPod playing music in your 
pocket and draining the battery when you’re not listening.
 
✓ Back away from the light. Turn down the brightness on an iPod touch 
or iPhone by choosing Settings➪Brightness and dragging the brightness 
slider to the left. Use the backlight sparingly on iPod classic and iPod 
nano models. Select Backlight Timer from the iPod Settings menu to 
limit backlighting to a number of seconds, or set it to Off. (Choose 
Settings from the main menu.) Don’t use the backlight in daylight if you 
don’t need it.
 
✓ Forget where you are (with an iPod touch or iPhone). Turn off 
Location Services if you aren’t using apps that need it. Choose 
Settings➪General from the Home screen, and touch On for the Location 
Services option to turn it Off. See Chapter 4 for details.
 
✓ Let the postman ring twice (with an iPod touch or iPhone). Check 
e-mail less frequently. You may want to change Push and Fetch settings 
to be less frequent. See Chapter 20 for details.
 
✓ Turn off 3G (with an iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS). Turn off 3G in any 
areas that don’t offer a strong 3G signal: Choose Settings➪General➪
Network and tap the On button for the Enable 3G option to turn it off. 
You can still make and receive calls with the 2G network, but the iPhone 
will stop using so much power continually searching for 3G.
 
✓ Tune out Bluetooth (with an iPhone). Turn off Bluetooth (choose 
Settings➪General➪Bluetooth and touch the On button to turn it off) if 
you’re not using a Bluetooth device.
 
✓ Drop in from the Internet (with an iPod touch or iPhone). Turn off 
Wi-Fi when not browsing the Internet: Choose Settings➪Wi-Fi and touch 
the On button to turn it off.
 
✓ Turn it off completely. To turn an iPod nano or iPod classic completely 
off, press and hold the Play/Pause button. To turn off an iPod shuffle, 
slide the switch to the off position, hiding the green layer underneath 
the switch. You can turn the iPod touch or iPhone completely off by 
holding down the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button for about two seconds, 
until you see the Slide to Power Off slider; then slide your finger across 
the slider to turn it off. You can then turn it back on by pressing and 
holding the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button. 

28
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
 Keep in mind that starting up an iPod touch or iPhone that was 
completely turned off takes quite a bit of power — more than if it woke 
from sleep. If you do turn it off, plug it into AC power or your computer 
before turning it back on.
 
✓ You may continue. Play songs continuously without using the iPod or 
iPhone controls. Selecting songs and using Previous/Rewind and Next/
Fast Forward require more energy. Also, turn off your iPod or iPhone 
equalizer (EQ) if you don’t need it (see Chapter 16).
Always use the latest iPod and iPhone software, and update your software 
when updates come out. Apple constantly tries to improve how your iPod 
and iPhone models work, and many of these advancements relate to power 
usage.

Setting Up iTunes and 
Your iPod and iPhone
In This Chapter
▶ Installing iTunes on a Windows PC
▶ Installing iTunes on a Mac
▶ Setting up your iPod and iPhone
A
n iPod or iPhone without iTunes is like a CD player without CDs. Sure, 
you can use utility programs from sources other than Apple to put 
music, podcasts, and videos on an iPod. But iTunes gives you access to the 
vast online iTunes Store and App Store, and it’s excellent for managing content 
on your computer and synchronizing your content library and personal 
information with your iPod or iPhone.
This chapter explains how to set up your iPod or iPhone with iTunes on a 
Mac or for Windows. iTunes includes the iPod and iPhone software, which 
provides the intelligence inside the device. iTunes is no slouch in the 
intelligence department either because it immediately recognizes the type 
of iPod or iPhone you have and installs the correct software.
Installing iTunes on a Windows PC
Setting up iTunes is a quick and easy process. The most up-to-date version of 
iTunes as of this writing is version 9. However, software updates occur very 
rapidly, so you may end up installing a newer version by the time you read 
this. (If you already have iTunes installed, see Chapter 22 for instructions on 
updating it.)
 
The CD-ROMs supplied with older iPods offer older versions of iTunes and 
iPod software. You should visit the Apple Web site to download the most 
up-to-date version of iTunes, which recognizes all iPod and iPhone models.

Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Before installing iTunes, make sure that you’re logged on as a Windows 
administrator user. Quit all other applications before installing, and be sure 
to disable any antivirus software.
 
The iTunes installer also installs the newest version of QuickTime, replacing any 
older version you might have. QuickTime is the Apple multimedia development, 
storage, and playback technology. Although Windows users aren’t required to 
use QuickTime beyond its use by iTunes, QuickTime is a bonus for Windows 
users because it offers digital video playback.
To install iTunes for Windows, follow these steps:
 
1. Download the iTunes installer from the Apple site.
 
 Browse the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes), and click the 
Download iTunes Free button, as shown in Figure 2-1. Follow the 
instructions to download the installer to your hard drive. (A crucial step 
here is picking a location on your hard drive to save the installer and 
remembering that location.)

2. Run the iTunes installer.
 
 Double-click the iTunesSetup.exe file to install iTunes. At the Welcome 
screen, click the Next button. Apple’s license agreement appears in the 
installer window. Feel free to scroll down to read the agreement if that’s 
something you tend to do. You must select the option to accept the 
agreement, or the installer goes no further.
 
3. Select the option to accept the terms of the license agreement and 
then click the Next button.
 
 After clicking Next (which is active only if you accept), the installer 
displays the iTunes installation options, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Choose 
iTunes 
installation 
options.
 
 
4. Choose your iTunes installation options.
 
 You can turn the following options on or off (as shown in Figure 2-2):
 
• Add iTunes and QuickTime Shortcuts to My Desktop: You can install 
shortcuts for your Windows desktop for iTunes and the QuickTime 
player.
 
• Use iTunes as the Default Player for Audio Files: I suggest turning 
this option on, allowing iTunes to be the default audio content 
player for all audio files it recognizes. If you’re happy with your 
audio player, you can deselect this option, leaving your default 
player setting unaffected.

32
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
5. Choose the default language for iTunes.
 
 The installer assumes that you want English (U.S.), so if you want to use 
a different language, you need to select it from the drop-down menu.
 
6. Choose the destination folder for iTunes.
 
 By default, the installer assumes that you want to store the program in 
the Program Files folder of your C: drive. If you want to use a different 
folder, click the Change button to use Windows Explorer to locate the 
desired folder.
 
7. Click the Install button to finish.
 
 After you click Install, the installer finishes the installation and displays 
the Complete dialog.
 
8. Click the Finish button.
 
 Restarting your Windows PC after installing software is always a good 
idea.
iTunes and QuickTime are now installed on your PC. To start using iTunes, 
double-click the iTunes desktop shortcut or use your Start menu to locate 
iTunes and launch it.
The first time you launch iTunes, yet another Apple license agreement appears. 
You must click the Agree button to continue (or cancel). After clicking Agree, 
iTunes displays the iTunes Setup Assistant — to get started, click the Next 
button.
The Setup Assistant displays two options: Add MP3 and AAC Files, and Add 
WMA Files (this applies only to non-copyright protected WMA files). Select 
either or both options to copy music files to the iTunes library. WMA file 
copies are converted to the AAC format (see Chapter 8 for descriptions of 
these formats). The original files are left intact and in place (you can delete 
them later if you don’t need them as backup copies). After selecting (or not 
selecting) these options, click the Next button to continue.
The Setup Assistant then asks whether you want to keep your music folder 
organized. Choose Yes to keep the iTunes Music Folder organized, and click 
the Next button to continue. (For more information on how the iTunes Music 
Folder works, see Chapter 15.) The Setup Assistant then displays a screen 
that explains how album artwork is downloaded (you need an iTunes Store 
account — see Chapter 7); click the Next button to continue. Finally the 
Setup Assistant asks whether you want to go directly to the iTunes Store. 
Choose Yes to go directly to the store or No to go directly to your iTunes 
library, and click the Finish button.

 Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod and iPhone
Installing iTunes on a Mac
As a Mac user, you should already have iTunes installed because all Macs 
sold since 2003 come preinstalled with iTunes and Mac OS X. The most up-to-
date version of iTunes as of this writing is version 9.
The version of iTunes that’s provided with the Mac might be the newest 
version; then again, it might not be. If iTunes displays a dialog with the 
message that a new version of iTunes is available and asks whether you 
would like to download it now, choose Yes to download the new version. 
Mac OS X not only downloads iTunes but also installs it automatically — 
after asking you for the administrator’s password, of course.
 
You can set your Mac to automatically download the latest version of iTunes 
when it becomes available. Choose Preferences from the iTunes menu, click 
the General tab, and select the Check for Updates Automatically check box 
at the bottom of the General preferences to turn it on.
 
You can also set your Mac to check for all system software and Apple 
applications (including iTunes). Choose System Preferences from the Apple 
menu, and then choose Software Update from the System Preferences window. 
Select the Check for Updates check box to turn it on, and select Daily, Weekly, 
or Monthly from the pop-up menu. You can also click the Check Now button 
to check for a new version immediately. If one exists, it appears in a window 
for you to select. Click the check mark to select it, and then click the Install 
button to download and install it.
If you want to manually install iTunes on your Mac or manually upgrade the 
version you have, browse the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes) to 
get it. You can download iTunes for free. Follow these steps:
 
1. Download the iTunes installer from the Apple site.
 
 Browse the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes), select the Mac 
OS X version you have installed on your computer, and then click the 
Download iTunes button. Your browser downloads the iTunes installer 
disk image file iTunes.dmg to your hard drive. After your browser 
downloads the file, locate the file in the Finder.
 
2. Open the iTunes installer disk image.
 
 Double-click the iTunes.dmg file to mount the iTunes installation drive.
 
3. Double-click the iTunes.mpkg file to unpack the installer package.
 
 The iTunes.mpkg file is a package that contains all the elements of the 
iTunes software and the installation program. After double-clicking this 
package file, a dialog appears that asks whether the installer can run a 
special program to check your computer.

34
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
4. Click the Continue button to run the special program.
 
 The installer needs to run a program to check your computer and make 
sure that it’s capable of running iTunes. After it runs the program, the 
installer displays the Introduction page.
 
5. Click the Continue button, read the Read Me page, and click Continue 
again.
 
 The installer displays important Read Me information about the latest 
iTunes features. If you like, click the Save button to save the page as 
a document or click Print to print it. Click Continue to continue to the 
license agreement.
 
6. Read the license agreement, and click the Continue button to go to the 
second page. Click the Agree button and then click Continue again.
 
 To read the entire agreement, you’ll need to scroll down. You must 
choose to accept the agreement by clicking the Agree button, or the 
installer goes no further. After clicking Agree, the installer displays the 
Select a Destination page.
 
7. (Optional) Before you click the Agree button, you can click the Save 
button to save the license agreement as a document or click Print to 
print it.
 
8. Select the Mac OS X startup drive as the destination volume and then 
click the Continue button.
 
 The installer asks for the destination volume (hard drive), which must be 
a Mac OS X startup drive. Any other drive is marked by a red exclamation 
point, indicating that you can’t install the software there. iTunes is 
installed in the Applications folder on the Mac OS X startup drive, and 
the iPod Software Updater is installed in the Utilities folder inside the 
Applications folder.
 
9. Click the Install (or Upgrade) button to proceed with the installation.
 
 After clicking Install, Mac OS X asks for the system administrator 
password. Supply your password, and click the OK button.
 
10. Click the Close button when the installer finishes.
You can now launch iTunes by double-clicking the iTunes application or 
clicking the iTunes icon on the Dock.
The first time you launch iTunes, yet another Apple license agreement appears. 
You must click the Agree button to continue (or cancel). After clicking Agree, 
iTunes displays the iTunes Setup Assistant — to get started, click the Next 
button.
The Setup Assistant displays the option to Add MP3 and AAC Files; select this 
option to copy music files to the iTunes library. (See Chapter 8 for descriptions 
of these formats.) The original files are left intact and in place; feel free to 

35
 Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod and iPhone
delete them if you don’t need them as backup copies. After selecting (or not 
selecting) this option, click the Next button to continue. The Setup Assistant 
then asks whether you want to keep your music folder organized. Choose 
Yes to keep the iTunes Music Folder organized, and click the Next button 
to continue. (For more information on how the iTunes Music Folder works, 
see Chapter 15.) The Setup Assistant then displays a screen that explains 
how album artwork is downloaded (you need an iTunes Store account — see 
Chapter 7); click the Next button to continue. Finally the Setup Assistant 
asks whether you want to go directly to the iTunes Store. Choose Yes to go 
directly to the store or No to go directly to your iTunes library, and click the 
Finish button.
Setting Up Your iPod or iPhone
When you connect a new iPod or iPhone for the first time, iTunes displays 
the Register and Set Up screen. Follow these steps to set up your iPod or 
iPhone:
 
1. With iTunes open, connect your iPod or iPhone to the computer with 
a USB cable.
 
 iTunes recognizes your iPod or iPhone and opens the Register and Set 
Up screen to get you started. 
 
2. Click the Continue button (or click the Register Later button to skip 
the registration process).
 
 iTunes displays the software license agreement. You can scroll down 
to read it if you want. You must choose to accept the agreement, or the 
installer goes no further.
 
3. Select the option to accept the terms at the end of the license 
agreement and then click the Continue button.
 
 After clicking Continue (which is active only if you accept), iTunes lets 
you register your iPod or iPhone with Apple online so that you can take 
advantage of Apple support. iTunes displays a screen for entering your 
Apple ID; a membership ID for the MobileMe (formerly .Mac) service is 
also valid. If you purchased your iPod or iPhone directly from Apple or 
have an Apple iTunes Store account, you already have an Apple ID. Enter 
that ID and password and then click the Continue button to swiftly move 
through the registration process — Apple automatically recognizes your 
purchase. If you bought your iPod or iPhone elsewhere or you don’t 
have an Apple ID or MobileMe ID, select the I Do Not Have an Apple ID 
radio button and then click the Continue button to get to the page for 
entering your iPod or iPhone serial number and your personal information. 
Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required, such as your name and 
e-mail address.

36
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
 If you don’t already have an iTunes Store account, the Setup Assistant is 
going to ask you to set up such an account now, as part of your iPod or 
iPhone setup. Chapter 7 has all the details on setting up an iTunes Store 
account.
  
4. Click the Continue button to advance through each screen in the 
registration process and then click the Submit button at the end to 
submit your information.
 
 After clicking Submit, iTunes checks to see if you have ever backed 
up an iPod touch or iPhone before. If you’ve synced an iPod touch or 
iPhone previously as I describe in Chapter 9 (and you haven’t deleted its 
backup as I describe in Chapter 22), iTunes displays a dialog that gives 
you the choice of restoring the settings from the previously backed-up 
iPod touch or iPhone, or setting up the iPod touch or iPhone as new. If 
appropriate, choose the option to restore the settings and then click the 
Continue button to finish setting up your iPod touch or iPhone. If you 
choose to set it up as new, continue following these steps.
 
5. (iPod touch or iPhone only) If you’ve synced an iPod touch or iPhone 
previously on the same computer, iTunes asks if you want to use its 
settings.
 
6. Enter a new name for your iPod or iPhone.
 
 iTunes displays a screen that lets you enter a name for your iPod or 
iPhone, as shown in Figure 2-3 for an iPod touch, and Figure 2-4 for 
an iPod nano.
 
Figure 2-3:

7. Set the automatic options, and then click the Done button (on a Mac) 
or the Finish button (in Windows).
 
 When it comes to setting automatic options, here’s the deal: 
 
• Automatically Sync Songs and Videos: If you want to copy your 
entire iTunes music and video library to your iPod or iPhone, leave 
the Automatically Sync Songs and Videos option selected. This 
option creates a mirror image of your music and video library on 
the iPod or iPhone, including all playlists and audio files. (You 
can always change this setting later; see Chapter 9.) If your iPod 
or iPhone can’t hold your entire library, iTunes chooses songs for 
you, based on your ratings and how often you’ve played the songs. 
(To find out how to add ratings, see Chapter 12.) If you want tocon-
trol which portion of your library to copy to the iPod or iPhone, 
deselect this option and turn to Chapter 9 for synchronization 
details.
 
• Automatically Choose Songs for an iPod Shuffle: If you leave the 
Automatically Choose Songs for My iPod option selected, iTunes 
copies a random selection of songs to your iPod shuffle. You can 
always choose to sync your iPod shuffle with a different selection 
as I describe in Chapter 9.

38
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
• Automatically Add Photos: Select this option (all iPods and iPhones 
except the iPod shuffle) to copy all the photos in your photo 
library to your iPod or iPhone. (See Chapter 18 for information 
about synchronizing and playing photo libraries.) Leave it dese-
lected if you want to transfer photos later. On a Windows PC you 
can choose the Pictures folder or choose another folder in the 
Sync Photos From pop-up menu (refer to Figure 2-3).
 
• Automatically Sync Applications: Select this option (iPod touch and 
iPhone only) to copy all applications in your iTunes library to your 
iPod touch or iPhone.
 
• Enable VoiceOver: Select this option to enable the VoiceOver kit, 
which is supplied with the iPod nano and iPod shuffle. VoiceOver 
tells you the name of the song you’re playing (as well as your bat-
tery status) and lets you choose from a spoken menu of playlists. 
See Chapter 16 for details.
After finishing setup, your iPod or iPhone name appears in the iTunes Source 
pane (the left column) under the Devices subheading (refer to Figure 2-3).
If you chose the option to automatically synchronize your songs and videos, 
your iPod or iPhone quickly fills up with music and videos from your iTunes 
music library.
Don’t want to add songs or videos now? If you deselect the automatically 
synchronize option, you can still add songs and videos later, along with 
podcasts and audio books — either manually or automatically, as I describe 
in Chapter 9.
After setting up your iPod or iPhone (and syncing if you chose the sync 
options), disconnect the iPod or iPhone from your computer by ejecting it. To 
eject your iPod or iPhone, click the Eject button next to the iPod or iPhone 
name (refer to Figure 2-3) in the Devices section of the Source pane. You can 
then connect the iPod or iPhone to its dock or power adapter to continue 
recharging its battery.
 
Although you can leave your iPod or iPhone connected to the computer, using 
the computer as a source of power, I don’t recommend doing that because it 
will synchronize whenever you start iTunes. Also, if you use a laptop running 
on a battery, the iPod or iPhone quickly drains the laptop battery.
 
After ejecting the iPod or iPhone, wait for its display to show the main menu 
or the OK to disconnect message. You can then disconnect the iPod or 
iPhone from the computer. Never disconnect an iPod or iPhone before ejecting 
it because such bad behavior might cause it to freeze and require a reset. (If 
that happens, see Chapter 22 for instructions.)

Putting Your Finger on It
In This Chapter
▶ Touching and gesturing on an iPod touch or iPhone
▶ Typing on the iPod touch or iPhone
▶ Thumbing through iPod menus
T
he iPod is all about convenience. Apple designed the iPod classic and 
iPod nano models to be held in one hand so that you can perform simple 
operations by thumb. Even if you’re all thumbs when pressing small buttons 
on tiny devices, you can still thumb your way to iPod heaven.
With the iPod shuffle, Apple took convenience a step further — the controls 
are on the earbud cord so that you can tuck the tiny device somewhere 
on your clothing and control it without looking at it. Its VoiceOver feature 
complements this arrangement by announcing each song, so you can quickly 
jump around.
With an iPod touch or iPhone, your fingers do the walking. You can make 
gestures, such as flicking a finger to scroll a list quickly, sliding your finger to 
scroll slowly or drag a slider (such as the volume slider), pinching with two 
fingers to zoom out of a Web page in Safari, or pulling apart with two fingers 
(also known as unpinching) to zoom in to the page to see it more clearly.
This chapter gives you a quick tour of the iPod and iPhone models, including 
the menus of an iPod classic or iPod nano, the iPod shuffle controls, and all 
the touch-and-gesture tricks to make your iPod touch or iPhone dance and 
sing. I also give you a complete tour of the most unique feature of the iPod 
touch and iPhone: the on-screen keyboard.
Tapping Your iPod touch or iPhone
The iPod touch or iPhone responds to tapping, flicking, and sliding your 
finger(s), among other gestures (such as shaking, tilting, two-finger tapping, and 
so on). One tap is all you need to run an app or select something, but sometimes 
you have to slide your finger to scroll the display and see more selections.

40
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
Sticky fingers are not recommended. To clean your iPod touch or iPhone, 
make sure to unplug all cables and turn it off. (See Chapter 1.) Use a soft, 
slightly damp, lint-free cloth to wipe your iPod touch or iPhone clean. — see 
Chapter 23 for cleaning tips.
Sliding to the Home screen
The first message you see on an iPod touch or iPhone display (besides the 
time of day and the date) is Slide to unlock — to get started, you have 
to unlock the iPod touch or iPhone by sliding your finger across the message. 
After the unit is unlocked, your Home screen appears in all its glory. (See 
Figure 3-1.)
There’s no place like Home — it’s the screen where you start. Everything is 
available from the Home screen at the touch of a finger:
 
✓ To access your music on an iPod touch, tap the Music icon in the 
bottom row; on an iPhone, tap the iPod icon in the bottom row (which 
offers music and videos).
 
✓ To access your videos on an iPod touch, tap the Videos icon in the 
bottom row; on an iPhone, tap the iPod icon in the bottom row.
 
✓ Tap the Photos icon to view your photos on an iPod touch or iPhone.
 
✓ Tap the Calendar icon to view your calendars on an iPod touch or iPhone.
 
✓ Tap the Contacts icon to view your contacts on an iPod touch or iPhone.
 
✓ Tap the iTunes icon to access the iTunes Store on an iPod touch or iPhone.
 
✓ Tap the App Store icon to access the App Store on an iPod touch or iPhone.
After tapping an icon, a new screen appears with selections and icons. 
(Tapping Music on an iPod touch, for example, brings up Artists, Songs, 
Albums, and so on.) The multitouch interface changes for each app. Press 
the physical Home button below the screen at any time to go to back to the 
Home screen.
Apps you download from the App Store (as I describe in Chapter 7) show 
up as icons on your Home screen. You can also save Web “clips” (page 
references) to your Home screen as icons that take you directly to those 
Web pages (as I describe in Chapter 19). When you add enough apps and 
Web clips so that they no longer all fit on the first page of the Home screen, 
the iPod touch or iPhone automatically creates more Home screen pages to 
accommodate them. (See the section “Rearranging your Home screen pages,” 
later in this chapter, to find out how to customize your icons and Home 
screen pages.)

The bottom row of the Home screen (refer to Figure 3-1) is called the dock. 
The number of dots above the dock shows the number of Home screen pages 
you have, and also indicates which page you’re viewing. To switch to another 
Home screen page, flick with your finger left or right, or tap to the left or right 
of the row of dots.
Searching for anything
A tiny magnifying glass icon for searching (introduced with the iPhone 3.0 
software) appears to the left of the dots above the dock on the Home screen. 
Tap this icon, or flick with your finger to the right, to show the Search screen 
(see Figure 3-2). The Search function is similar to the Spotlight universal 
search feature available in Mac OS X. You can then type in a search term and 
immediately see suggestions.

Search looks through contacts, calendars, e-mail (the To, From, and Subject 
fields, but not the message content), the content (songs, videos, podcasts, 
and audio books), the text in the Notes app, and text messages on an iPhone. 
Tap a contact, calendar entry, e-mail, note, or text message suggestion to 
open it, or tap the song, video, podcast, or audio book suggestion to play it.

Checking the status bar
The iPod touch or iPhone shows its current state in the status bar at the top 
of the screen (refer to Figure 3-1). The icons mean the following:
 
✓ iPod: Just in case you forgot you had an iPod touch in your hands (very 
existential). On an iPhone, you see the cascading bars of cell-phone 
service coverage.
 
✓ Wi-Fi: This icon says that the iPod touch or iPhone is connected to a 
Wi-Fi network. If the network offers Internet access (all commercial ones 
do), you’re on the Internet (or at least on it as far as the commercial 
service’s log-in screen — you may have to purchase access and log 
into the service). The more arcs you see in the icon, the stronger the 
connection to the network. To find out more about setting up Wi-Fi with 
Internet in your home, see Chapter 4.
 
✓ Network activity: This icon twirls to show that data is traveling from 
the network to your iPod touch or iPhone (or vice versa). (Not visible in 
Figure 3-1.)
 
✓ VPN: If you have special network settings that access a virtual private 
network (VPN), this icon shows up to tell you that you are connected to 
it. See Chapter 4 for details. (Not visible in Figure 3-1.)
 
✓ Lock: You see this icon whenever the iPod touch or iPhone is locked. 
(The Slide to unlock message also appears on the screen.) (Not 
visible in Figure 3-1.)
 
✓ Play: This icon tells you that a song, audio book, or podcast is playing 
(in case you didn’t know — maybe you took your headphones off). (Not 
visible in Figure 3-1.)
 
✓ Alarm: This icon appears if you set an alarm. See Chapter 4 for details. 
(Not visible in Figure 3-1.)
 
✓ Battery: The Battery icon shows the battery level or charging status. 
It’s completely filled in when the battery is fully charged, and it slowly 
empties into just an outline as the battery is used up. A lightning bolt 
appears inside the icon when the device is recharging, and a plug appears 
inside it when the iPod touch or iPhone is connected to power.
Tons of icons and what do you get?
You get flexible apps and a key to the Net! The iPod touch or iPhone Home 
screen (refer to Figure 3-1) offers the following icons:

the iPod touch or iPhone horizontally, it becomes a scientific calculator.
 
✓ Notes: Add text notes.
 
✓ Settings: Adjust settings for Wi-Fi, sounds, brightness, Safari, and other 
apps, as well as apply other settings for the iPod touch or iPhone itself.
 
✓ Music (iPod touch): Select playlists, artists, songs, albums, and more 
(including podcasts, genres, composers, audio books, and compilations). 
The Music icon also offers Cover Flow browsing, as I describe in Chapter 16.
 
✓ Videos (iPod touch): Select videos by type (movies, music videos, TV 
shows, or video podcasts).
 
✓ iPod (iPhone): Select playlists, artists, songs, videos, and more (including 
podcasts, genres, composers, audio books, and compilations). The iPod 
icon also offers Cover Flow browsing, as I describe in Chapter 16.
 
✓ Photos: Select photos by photo album or select individual photos in the 
Photo Library.
 
✓ Camera: Snap a photo (iPhone only), or shoot video (iPhone 3GS only).
 
✓ Voice Memos: Record using the built-in microphone (iPhone only) or the 
Apple earbud microphones (iPhone or iPod touch).
 
✓ App Store: Go to Apple’s online App Store to download other Apple and 
third-party apps.
 
✓ iTunes: Go to the iTunes Store to purchase content.
You find one more icon for an app that you can activate in Settings, if you 
have the appropriate Nike shoes and the Nike+ iPod Sport Kit, sold sepa-
rately. See Chapter 23 for details.

 Chapter 3: Putting Your Finger on It
Touching and gesturing
With the iPhone or iPod touch, it’s touch and go. These models respond to 
gestures you make with your fingers:
 
✓ Drag with your finger: Scroll up or down lists slowly.
 
✓ Flick up or down: Swipe your finger quickly across the surface to scroll 
up or down lists quickly.
 
✓ Touch and hold: While scrolling, touch and hold to stop the moving list.
 
✓ Flick from left to right or right to left: Quickly swipe your finger across 
the screen to change screens or application panes (Home screens, Cover 
Flow when browsing music, Weather, and other apps). 
 
✓ Single tap: Select an item.
 
✓ Double tap: Zoom in or out with Safari, Maps, and other applications.
 
✓ Two-finger single tap: Zoom out in Maps.
 
✓ Pinch: Zoom out.
 
✓ Unpinch: Zoom in.
 
Need to practice your tapping? Try Tap Tap Revenge, a rhythm game that 
plays music while requiring you to tap each of the colored balls when they 
reach the line at the bottom of the screen. If you tap the ball on the beat, you 
gain points; if not, it counts as a miss. You can also activate a revenge mode to 
score more points by shaking the iPod touch or iPhone after setting a winning 
streak of 50 beats.
Rearranging your Home screen pages
You can rearrange your iPod touch or iPhone app icons, create additional 
Home screen pages, and customize these pages. Touch and hold any icon 
until all the icons begin to wiggle. (That’s right; it looks like they’re doing the 
Cha-cha-cha.) Then drag a wiggling icon to the right edge of the screen until 
a new page appears. You can flick to return to the original Home screen page 
and drag more wiggling icons to the new page. You can create up to nine 
Home screen pages.
 
Press the Home button under the screen to go to back to the first Home 
screen page. To go to any other Home screen page, tap one of the dots above 
the dock on any Home screen page — for example, to go to Home screen page 
4, tap the fourth dot.
While the wiggling icons are doing their show, you can also rearrange them. 
Drag the wiggling icons into new positions, and the other icons move to 
accommodate, creating a new arrangement.

You can also delete apps you downloaded from the App Store by tapping the 
circled X that appears inside the icon as it wiggles.
To stop all that wiggling, press the Home button, which saves your new 
arrangement and pages.
To reset your Home screen to the default arrangement, thereby cleaning up 
any mess you may have made on your Home screens, tap Settings on the 
Home screen and then tap General. On the General screen, drag your finger 
to scroll the list to Reset and then tap Reset. On the Reset screen, tap Reset 
Home Screen Layout. (In the future, I make it easier for you by abbreviating 
instructions like these to the more manageable Settings➪General➪Reset➪
Reset Home Screen Layout.)
Shake, rattle, and roll
Your iPod touch or iPhone can sense motion 
using a built-in accelerometer. When you rotate 
it from a vertical view (portrait) to a horizontal 
view (landscape), the accelerometer detects 
the movement and changes the display accord-
ingly. This happens so quickly that you can con-
trol a game with these movements.
For example, Pass the Pigs is a dice game in 
which you shake three times to roll your pigs to 
gain points. In the Labyrinth game, you tilt your 
iPod touch or iPhone to roll a ball through a 
wooden maze without falling through the holes. 
And you can shake, rattle, and roll your way 
around the world in Yahtzee Adventures as you 
rack up high scores.
And if that’s too tame for you, try Chopper, a 
helicopter game in which you need to complete 
your mission and return to base while avoiding 
enemy fire from tanks and bazooka-wielding 
madmen. You tilt the iPod touch or iPhone to fly, 
and you touch the screen to drop bombs or fire 
the machine gun.
Xhake Shake lets you shake, flip, rub, and tap 
your iPod touch or iPhone to challenge your 
hand-eye responses. And for scrolling prac-
tice, try Light Bike (loosely based on the Disney 
movie Tron) in which you scroll to maneuver 
a light bike from a third-person perspective 
against three computer-controlled light bikes. 
And infants can join the fun: Silver Rattle shows 
a screen that changes color and rattles with 
every shake. Big Joe Turner would be proud.

 Chapter 3: Putting Your Finger on It
Tickling the Keyboard on 
an iPod touch or iPhone
One trick that’s sure to amaze your friends is the ability to whip out your 
iPod touch or iPhone and type notes, contact information, calendar entries, 
map locations, stock symbols, e-mail messages, and Web site addresses (and 
even cell-phone text messages on an iPhone). You can also make selections 
for pop-up menus that appear on Web pages. You can do all this with the 
on-screen keyboard.
You may want to start practicing on the keyboard with just one finger, and 
as you get used to it, try also using your thumb. Tap a text entry field, such 
as the URL field for a Web page in Safari (as I describe in Chapter 19) or the 
text of an e-mail message (as I describe in Chapter 20), and the on-screen 
keyboard appears.
Typing into Notes
You can practice your technique using the Notes app. Tap Notes on the Home 
screen and the on-screen keyboard appears, as shown in Figure 3-3. (If you’ve 
already saved notes, a list of notes appears — tap the + button in the upper-
right corner to type a new note.)
 
Figure 3-3: 
The on-
screen 
keyboard for 
typing.
 

48
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Tap the keys, and as you type, each letter appears above your thumb or 
finger. If you tap the wrong key, slide your finger to the correct key. The letter 
isn’t entered until you lift your finger from the key.
 
You can start a new sentence quickly by double-tapping the spacebar to insert 
a period followed by a space. The keyboard automatically capitalizes the next 
word after you type a period, a question mark, or an exclamation point.
To enable caps lock (locking the keyboard to uppercase letters), choose 
Settings➪General➪Keyboard and then tap the Off button next to Enable Caps 
Lock to turn it on. (Tap it again to turn it off.) You can then double-tap the 
Shift key to turn on caps lock (uppercase letters). The Shift key turns blue, 
and all letters you type are uppercase. Tap the Shift key again to turn caps 
lock off.
To save your note, tap Done in the upper-right corner. A list of Notes appears 
with a date attached to each note. You can also delete a note by choosing 
the note and tapping the Trash icon at the bottom of the note. Notes can be 
synchronized back to your computer’s e-mail program — see Chapter 10.
 
You can e-mail notes to others (and also transfer notes to your computer by 
e-mailing them to an e-mail address you receive e-mail with on your computer). 
Choose the note from the Notes screen and tap the letter icon at the bottom 
of the note to display a ready-made e-mail message that contains the text of 
your note — all you need to do is enter the e-mail address. See Chapter 20 for 
details on sending the message.
Typing numbers and symbols
To enter numbers, symbols, or punctuation, tap the .?123 key at the lower-left 
corner of the keyboard (refer to Figure 3-3). This changes the keyboard 
layout to numbers, as shown in Figure 3-4 (left side). To return to the 
alphabetical keys, tap the ABC key.
To enter symbols with the keyboard, tap the .?123 key for the number layout 
(refer to Figure 3-3) and then tap the #+= key (refer to Figure 3-4, left side) to 
change the layout to symbols, as shown in Figure 3-4 (right side). 
 
Here’s a trick you can use to switch to the numeric keyboard layout and back 
to alphabetical layout automatically to type a number and continue typing 
letters: Touch and hold down the .?123 key and then slide your finger over the 
keyboard to the number you want. Release your finger to select the number. 
The keyboard immediately reverts back to alphabetical keys so that you can 
continue typing letters.

Need to use an accent mark? For instance, the word café should really have 
an accent mark over the e, and there may even come a day when you need to 
include a foreign word or two in a note — lycée or Autowäsche or también, 
for example. Although you can switch the language for the keyboard (as I 
describe in Chapter 23), you can also include an accent mark over a vowel by 
using the English keyboard. Hold your finger on a vowel (such as e) to show a 
row of keys that offer variations on the letter. Slide your finger over the row to 
highlight the variation you want and then release your finger to select it.
Editing text and handling 
word suggestions
Yes, you can edit your mistakes. To edit text in an entry field, touch and hold 
to see the circular magnifier, which magnifies portions of the text view as 
shown in Figure 3-5.
Before releasing your finger, slide the magnifier to the position for inserting 
text. You can then tap keys to insert text, or you can use the backspace key — 
the key sporting the X — to remove text.
The intelligent keyboard automatically suggests corrections as you type, 
as shown in Figure 3-6 (some languages only). You don’t need to accept the 
suggested word — just continue typing. If you do want to accept it, tap the 
spacebar, a punctuation mark, or the Return key. Your iPhone or iPod touch 
fills in the rest of the word.

Figure 3-6:

keyboard 
suggests 
the correct 
word for a 
typo.
 
To reject the suggested word, finish typing the word or tap the x next to the 
suggestion to dismiss it. Each time you reject a suggestion for the same word, 
your iPod touch keeps track and eventually adds the word you’ve been using 
all along to its dictionary. The iPod touch includes dictionaries for English, 
English (UK), French, French (Canada), German, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, 
and Dutch. The appropriate dictionary is activated automatically when you 
select a particular international keyboard. (See Chapter 23 for details about 
international keyboards.)

51
 Chapter 3: Putting Your Finger on It
You can turn off suggestions by choosing Settings➪General➪Keyboard from 
the Home screen and tapping On for Auto-Correction. (On changes to Off 
when you tap it.)
 
You don’t have to turn suggestions off if you just want to temporarily make 
them go away. To keep suggestions from appearing, start by typing a special 
symbol (such as $ or &), a numeral (such as 0). Then touch and hold to see 
the magnifier for inserting text, and drag the insertion point to be right before 
this symbol or numeral, so that you’ll be inserting text before it. Release and 
start typing. The keyboard won’t suggest anything because it won’t know 
what you mean — there are no words in its dictionary that end with these 
symbols or numerals. Don’t use punctuation symbols such as a period, 
comma, parentheses or quotes, or even the @ symbol because the keyboard 
knows that they’re used after words.
Copying (or cutting) and pasting
If you’ve upgraded your iPod touch or iPhone to version 3.0 of the software 
or newer, you can copy or cut a chunk of text and paste it into another app — 
for example, you can copy a paragraph from a note in Notes and paste it into 
an e-mail message in Mail.
Double-tap a word to select it for copying or cutting. The word appears 
selected with handles on either end of the selection and a Cut/Copy/Paste 
bubble above it, as shown in Figure 3-7 (left side). You can then tap Cut (to 
cut the text) or Copy (to copy the text) in preparation for pasting it elsewhere. 
You can also select the nearest word, or the entire text, by touching an 
insertion point. The Select/Select All/Paste bubble appears (refer to Figure 3-7, 
center). Tap Select to select the nearest word (left or right of the insertion 
point) or Select All to select all the text, and the Cut/Copy/Paste bubble 
appears (refer to Figure 3-7, right side).
To make a more precise selection, double-tap a word as previously described 
and then drag one of the handles by sliding your finger. A rectangular magnifier 
appears, as shown in Figure 3-8 (left side), which magnifies portions of the 
text view so that you can drag the handle more precisely. When you remove 
your finger to stop dragging, the Cut/Copy/Paste bubble appears (refer to 
Figure 3-8, right side). You can then tap Cut or Copy.
To paste the text you just cut or copied, open a note (or create a new note) 
in Notes, create a new e-mail message, or open any app that lets you enter 
text. (For details on creating a new e-mail message, see Chapter 20.) Touch an 
insertion point for pasting the text. The circular magnifier appears (as shown 
in Figure 3-9, left side), which magnifies portions of the text view so that 
you can mark the insertion point precisely. When you remove your finger, 

52
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
the Cut/Copy/Paste bubble appears (refer to Figure 3-9, center), or if text is 
already in the message, the Select/Select All/Paste bubble appears. Either 
way, you can then tap Paste to paste the text at that point (refer to Figure 3-9, 
right side).

Setting keyboard options
To set keyboard options, choose Settings➪General➪Keyboard from the 
Home screen. The Keyboard settings screen appears, with options for Auto-
Correction, Auto-Capitalization, Enable Caps Lock, and the Shortcut for 
inserting a period, as shown in Figure 3-10.

Tap On to turn off Auto-Correction if you don’t want the keyboard to suggest 
typing corrections.
Auto-Capitalization automatically capitalizes the next word after you type a 
period, question mark, or exclamation point (punctuation that ends a sentence). 
It also automatically capitalizes after you tap the Return key. The assumption 
is that you’re starting a new sentence or new line of text that should begin 
with a capital letter. Tap On to turn this feature off if you want; tap Off to turn 
it back on.
To turn on caps lock (locking the keyboard to uppercase letters), tap the Off 
button next to Enable Caps Lock. (Tap it again to turn it off.) You can then 
double-tap the Shift key to turn on caps lock (uppercase letters). The Shift 
key turns blue, and all letters you type are uppercase. Tap the Shift key again 
to turn caps lock off.
The shortcut for inserting a period is to double-tap the spacebar, which 
inserts a period followed by a space. The assumption is that you want to 
finish a sentence and start the next one. Tap On to turn this feature off if you 
want; tap Off to turn it back on.
To find out how to turn on and use multiple international keyboards, see 
Chapter 23.
Thumbing through iPod nano

Choosing Essential Settings 
For Daily Operation
In This Chapter
▶ Setting the time, date, clock, alarm, timer, and stopwatch
▶ Changing the brightness, wallpaper, sound effects, and other settings
▶ Locking your iPod or iPhone with a combination passcode
▶ Connecting your iPod touch or iPhone with Wi-Fi networks
You may think Apple designed the iPod just for listening to music or 
watching videos, but those thoughtful engineers crammed a lot more 
features into their invention. You can use your iPod or iPhone as a timekeeper 
to help you keep track of your personal life — setting an alarm, using the 
stopwatch, and displaying clocks of different time zones for traveling. And if 
you worry that your iPod or iPhone might fall into the wrong hands, consider 
setting a combination lock.
This chapter shows you how to do all this and more with your iPod, including 
setting the backlight, the click sound, and even the display font. I show you 
how to check your calendar and your contacts on an iPod classic or iPod nano.
I also cover settings that are specific to the iPod touch and iPhone: setting the 
brightness of the display, choosing the wallpaper (a stylin’ background when 
it’s locked), knowing your location, and placing restrictions on downloading 
and playing content. You also find out how to connect an iPod touch or iPhone 
to a Wi-Fi network for Internet access.

Rock Around the Clocks
You can always know what time it is — just look at the time on the Home 
screen of an iPod touch or iPhone, or on the main menu title bar of an iPod 
classic or iPod nano. But you can also know what time it is in other time 
zones by displaying multiple clocks. Your iPod and iPhone even let you set an 
alarm and run a stopwatch.
Checking the time in Paris and Bangkok
You can display clocks with different time zones, which is useful for traveling 
halfway around the world (or calling someone who lives halfway around the 
world).
To create clocks on an iPod touch or iPhone, tap the Clock icon on the Home 
screen and then tap the World Clock icon along the bottom of the display. It 
takes only two steps to add a clock:
 
1. Touch the plus (+) button in the upper-right corner of the display.
 
 The on-screen keyboard appears with a text entry field.
 
2. Type a city name on the keyboard, and tap Return (or tap Cancel next 
to the text entry field to cancel).
 
 The iPod touch or iPhone looks up the city’s time zone to display the 
clock. (For details on how to use the on-screen keyboard, see Chapter 3.)
The initial clock and any clocks you add sport a daytime face (white background 
and black hands) from 6 a.m. to 5:59 p.m., as shown in Figure 4-2, and a nighttime 
face (black background with white hands) from 6 p.m. to 5:59 a.m.
To remove a clock, tap the Edit button in the upper-left corner of the display 
(refer to Figure 4-2) and then tap the circled minus (–) button next to the 
clock to delete it.

Time is on your side with your iPod or iPhone. You can set multiple alarms 
to go off on different days and set a variety of tones and sounds for your 
alarms that play through its speaker. On an iPod nano or iPod classic, you 
can even assign a playlist to an alarm to play through external speakers or 
headphones.
To set alarms on an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Clock icon on the Home screen, and tap the Alarm icon along 
the bottom of the display.
 
2. To add an alarm, tap the plus (+) button in the upper-right corner of 
the display.
 
 The Add Alarm screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-3, with options and 
a slot-machine-style wheel for setting the alarm time.
 
Figure 4-3: 
Add an 
alarm.
 
 
3. Slide your finger over the wheel to set the hour and minute, and AM 
or PM. 
 
 Slide until the selection you want appears in the gray window on the 
slot-machine wheel.
 
 Now you can set some optional features, or you can skip to Step 8 and 
be done with it.

4. (Optional) Tap the Repeat option to set the alarm to repeat on other 
days.
 
 You can set it to repeat every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
Friday, Saturday, and/or Sunday. (You can select multiple days.)
 
5. (Optional) Tap the Sound option to select a sound for the alarm.
 
 A list of sounds appears; touch a sound to set it for the alarm.
 
6. (Optional) Tap the On button to turn off the Snooze option, or tap it 
again to turn it back on.
 
 With the Snooze option, the iPod or iPhone displays a Snooze button 
when the alarm goes off, and you tap Snooze to stop the alarm and have 
it repeat in 10 minutes (so that you can snooze for 10 minutes).
 
7. (Optional) Tap the Label option to enter a text label for the alarm.
 
 The label helps you identify the alarm in the Alarm list.
 
8. Tap the Save button in the upper-right corner to save the alarm.
When the alarm goes off, your iPod or iPhone displays the message You 
have an alarm (and the date and time), along with the Snooze button if the 
Snooze option is turned on (refer to Step 6). Slide your finger to unlock the 
iPod touch or iPhone to stop the alarm’s sound, or tap the Snooze button to 
stop the alarm temporarily and let it repeat 10 minutes later. (When it goes 
off again, slide the unlock slider to turn it off — don’t tap the Snooze button 
again; you’re late for work!)
To delete an alarm on an iPod touch or iPhone, tap the Clock icon on the 
Home screen and tap the Alarm icon along the bottom of the display. In the 
Alarm list, tap the alarm you want to trash and then tap the Edit button in 
the upper-left corner of the display. The alarm appears with a circled minus 
(–) button next to it; tap this button and then tap the red Delete button that 
appears to delete the alarm.
An iPod nano or iPod classic can do more than play a beep sound for the 
alarm — you can set a playlist, which you can hear by connecting the iPod to 
speakers or a stereo (or headphones, if you sleep with headphones on). To 
set an alarm on an iPod classic or iPod nano, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Extras➪Alarms from the main menu.

 After finishing the AM/PM field, the Alarms submenu appears again.
 
12. Choose Repeat from the Alarms submenu, and choose a repeat multiple.
 
 You can choose to set the alarm to go off once, every day, weekdays, 
weekends, every week, every month, or every year. After choosing a 
repeat multiple, the Alarms submenu appears again.
 
13. Choose Sounds from the Alarms submenu and choose a tone or a 
playlist.
 
 The Tones and Playlists options appear. Choose Tones to select a beep, 
or set Tones to none (no sound) if you want the iPod to display the 
alarm without making a sound. Choose Playlists to select a playlist. After 
choosing a tone or a playlist, the Alarms submenu appears again.
 
14. Choose Label from the Alarms submenu to set a label to identify this 
alarm.
 
 You can set labels for your alarms so that you can identify them easily 
in the Alarms main menu. Select a label from the prepared list, which 
includes labels such as Wake Up, Work, Class, Appointment, and so on. 
After choosing a label, the Alarms submenu appears again.
 
15. Press Menu to return to the Alarms main menu, which now includes 
your new alarm with its label in a list of alarms under the Sleep Timer 
heading.

66
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
You can create as many alarms, at different dates and times, as you need. To 
delete an alarm, select the alarm from the list on the Alarms main menu. The 
Alarms submenu appears with a list of options. Choose Delete.
When the alarm goes off, your iPod classic or iPod nano displays an alarm 
message along with the Dismiss and Snooze buttons. Choose Dismiss or 
Snooze by scrolling the click wheel and then select it by pressing the Select 
button. Dismiss stops the alarm’s sound, whereas Snooze stops the sound 
temporarily and repeats it 10 minutes later.
Timing your steps (iPod touch 
and iPhone)
You can set an hour-and-minute timer for anything — baking cookies, baking 
CDs, or baking in the sun on the beach. The timer built into the Clock app on 
your iPod touch or iPhone will continue running even when playing music or 
videos or running other apps. You might want to use a timer to see whether 
a set of activities — playing songs, playing videos, selecting from menus, and 
running apps — occurs within a specific time. (If you need to use seconds as 
well as minutes and hours, try using the stopwatch, which I describe in the 
next section.)
To use the timer, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Clock icon on the Home screen.
 
 The Clock display appears.
 
2. Tap the Timer icon along the bottom of the Clock display.
 
 The timer wheel for minutes and hours appears, along with the Start 
button.
 
3. Flick the timer wheel to set the timer in hours and minutes.
 
4. Tap the When Timer Ends button and then tap a sound to use when 
the timer is up.
 
5. Tap Set in the upper-right corner of the display to set the sound (or 
Cancel in the upper-left corner to cancel the sound).
 
6. Tap Start to start the timer.
The timer runs backward. You can touch Cancel to cancel the timer or wait 
until it runs out. When it runs out, the iPod touch plays the sound (if a sound 
is set) and presents an OK button. Tap OK to stop the sound.

 Chapter 4: Choosing Essential Settings for Daily Operation
Using the stopwatch
You can use a stopwatch with a lap timer for timing exercises, jogging, 
racing laps, seeing how long it takes the bus to travel across town, or finding 
out how long your friend takes to recognize the song you’re playing. 
Whatever you want to measure with accurate time to the tenth of a second, 
the stopwatch is ready for you.
 
Even while you’re running the stopwatch, you can still use the iPod or iPhone 
to play music, videos, audio books, and podcasts. When you play a video, 
the stopwatch continues to count as usual; when you switch back to the 
stopwatch display, the video automatically pauses.
To use the stopwatch on an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the Clock icon on the Home screen, and tap the Stopwatch icon 
along the bottom of the display.
 
 A stopwatch appears with Start and Reset buttons and 00:00.00 
(minutes, seconds, and fractions of seconds) as the stopwatch counter.
 
2. Tap the Start button to start counting.
 
 The stopwatch starts counting immediately; the left button changes to 
Stop and the right button changes to Lap, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
Figure 4-4: 
After tap-
ping Start 
(left) and 
after tap-
ping Lap 
(right).

Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
3. (Optional) Tap the Lap button to mark each lap.
 
 Tap the Lap button to record each lap. Repeat this step for each lap — 
Clock creates a list of lap times.
 
4. Tap the Stop button to stop counting.
 
 The counter stops counting. The left button changes to Start, and the 
right button changes to Reset. You can resume the count from where 
you left off by tapping Start, or you can start the count again from zero 
by tapping Reset.
To use the stopwatch on an iPod classic or iPod nano, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Extras➪Stopwatch from the main menu.
 
 A stopwatch appears with the Play/Pause icon.
 
2. Press the Select button to start counting.
 
 The stopwatch starts counting immediately.
 
3. (Optional) Press the Select button to mark each lap.
 
 Press the Select button to record the current lap time while counting 
resumes accurately for the next lap. Repeat this step for each lap.
 
4. Press the Play/Pause button to stop counting, and then press the 
menu button.
 
 The Stopwatch menu appears. The menu now includes the Current Log 
option to show the lap timings for the stopwatch session. Also included are 
previous stopwatch session logs. The iPod saves the stopwatch results in a 
session log for convenience, so you don’t have to write them down.
 
5. Select Resume to resume counting or New Timer to start a new 
stopwatch session.
 
 You can resume the stopwatch session from where you left off, or you 
can start a new stopwatch session.
 
6. (Optional) Read your stopwatch logs by choosing Current Log or the 
date of a previous log on the Stopwatch menu.
 
7. (Optional) Delete your stopwatch logs by choosing Clear Logs on the 
Stopwatch menu.
Setting the sleep timer
As you can with a clock radio sleep timer, you can set your iPod or iPhone to 
play music or videos for a while before going to sleep.
To set the timer on the iPhone or iPod touch as a sleep timer, first follow 
the instructions in the section “Timing your steps (iPod touch and iPhone)” 
earlier in this chapter. Then touch the When Timer Ends button, and touch 
Sleep iPod at the top of the list to put the iPod touch or iPhone to sleep when 

69
 Chapter 4: Choosing Essential Settings for Daily Operation
the timer ends. Touch Set in the upper-right corner of the display to set the 
Sleep iPod option (or Cancel in the upper-left corner to cancel). Finally, touch 
Start to start the timer. You can then play music or videos until the timer 
ends and the iPod touch or iPhone automatically goes to sleep.
To set the sleep timer on an iPod classic or iPod nano, choose Extras from the 
main menu; then choose Alarms➪Sleep Timer. A list of intervals appears, from 0 
(Off) to 120 minutes (2 hours). You can select a time amount or the Off setting (at 
the top of the list) to turn off the sleep timer. After the iPod shuts itself off or you 
turn it off, the preference for the Sleep Timer is reset to the default status, Off.
Using the iPod nano pedometer
A pedometer counts each step you take by detecting the motion, measuring 
your progress and motivating you to exercise more. The iPod nano offers a 
pedometer that uses the built-in accelerometer to keep track of your steps. 
For more accurate results, keep the iPod nano in your pocket or in the iPod 
nano Armband while using the pedometer. Even so, pedometers also record 
movements other than walking, such as bending to tie one’s shoes, or shakin’ 
your booty, so don’t expect complete accuracy.
To use the pedometer for the first time, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Extras➪Fitness➪Settings➪Weight from the iPod nano main menu.
 
 Before using the pedometer, you should set it to your correct weight. 
The Choose Weight screen appears with the weight in large numbers on 
the display.
 
2. Set your correct weight.
 
 Scroll the click wheel to set the correct weight. Then press the Select 
(center) button. The Settings menu appears.
 
3. Select Pedometer and press the Select button to change it to either 
Manual or Always On.
 
 You can turn on the pedometer whenever  you want to (Manual), or set 
the pedometer to Always On so that the pedometer counts all the steps 
you take all the time.
 
4. Select Daily Step Goal in the Settings menu, and choose the number of 
steps.
 
 You can create a daily step goal, None (for no goal), or a Custom goal (to 
set your own number of steps).
 
5. Choose the screen orientation for the pedometer.
 
Choose Screen Orientation in the Settings menu, and then choose 
Vertical, Left (left side of the screen in horizontal orientation), or Right 
(right side of the screen in horizontal orientation). Then press Menu to 
go back to the Fitness menu.

70
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
That’s it. Now you are ready to use the pedometer. Choose Extras➪>Fitness➪
Pedometer to turn it on, unless you have already set it to be always on (in Step 3 
above). The Pedometer menu item appears in the main menu when the pedom-
eter is on, so you can easily choose it to turn it off. The preview panel below the 
main menu shows your step count when you scroll the click wheel to highlight 
Pedometer in the menu.
To view your workout history, choose Extras➪Fitness➪History, and scroll 
the click wheel and press Select to select a date from the calendar, or press 
Next/Fast-forward or Previous/Rewind to go forward or backward by month 
in the calendar and then select a date. After pressing the Select button, your 
workout history appears. If you have more than one workout session on the 
selected date, scroll the click wheel and press Select to choose a session. The 
iPod nano pedometer displays your step goal, workout duration, start and 
end times, calories burned, and totals for the week and month. You can even 
view a bar graph by rotating the iPod nano to landscape mode.
 Setting the Passcode for Your Lock
You can set a four-digit combination passcode for the iPod nano, iPod classic, 
iPod touch, or iPhone to lock it and thereby prevent others from navigating 
through your content. Note: The lockup works only when your iPod or 
iPhone is not attached to a computer.
An iPod touch or iPhone locks itself when it goes to sleep, and as you already 
know, you have to slide your finger over the unlock message to wake it up. 
But you can also set this passcode to keep the iPod touch or iPhone protected 
from access after waking up — so that you need to supply the passcode.
If you’re playing music when your iPod nano or iPod classic is locked, the 
music continues playing — and you can even use the Play/Pause button to 
pause and resume playback — but if you set a passcode, no one can navigate 
the iPod nano or iPod classic or even change the volume without providing 
the passcode.
 
To conserve power, you can force your iPod touch or iPhone to go to sleep by 
pressing the Sleep/Wake (On/Off) button — but you’ll still need the passcode 
(if you set one) to use it after waking it up. Similarly, you can force an iPod 
classic or iPod nano to go to sleep by pressing the Play/Pause button, but 
you’ll still need the passcode to unlock it. When the iPod or iPhone awakens, 
it remembers everything — including its passcode.
 
Don’t bother to call Apple to see whether the company can unlock your iPod 
or iPhone for you. If you can’t enter the correct passcode, or attach it to the 
computer you set it up on, your only recourse is to restore the iPod or iPhone 
to its factory conditions — see Chapter 22.

71
 Chapter 4: Choosing Essential Settings for Daily Operation
 
Dont forget this passcode! Use a four-digit number that’s easy to commit to 
memory.
To set a passcode for your iPhone or iPod touch, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings➪General➪Passcode Lock from the Home screen.
 
 The Set Passcode display appears.
 
2. Enter a four-digit passcode by tapping numbers on the calculator-style.
 
3. Enter the same passcode number again to confirm the passcode.
 
 After reentering the passcode, the Passcode Lock menu appears with 
the Turn Passcode Off, Change Passcode, and Require Passcode options.
 
4. Select the Passcode option you want to use.
 
 You can turn off the passcode, change it, or set the Require Passcode 
option to Immediately, After 1 Minute, After 5 Minutes, After 15 Minutes, 
After 1 Hour, or After 4 Hours.
 
5. When you’re done, tap General to return to the General menu.
To unlock a passcode-locjed iPod touch of iPhone, you must enter the same 
passcode, or restore the iPod touch or iPhone to its original factory set-
tings, as I describe in Chapter22. (Restoreing erases everthing — this is, of 
course, a measure of last resort.) The passcode screen with four spaces and 
a numeric keypad appears immediately after you slide the “Slide to unlock” 
message After correctly entering the combination of numbers for the numeric 
keypad, the iPod touch of iPhone unlocks.
To set a passcode (a.k.a. combination lock) for your iPod classic or iPod 
nano, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Extras➪Screen Lock➪Lock.
 
 The Screen Lock icon appears with your combination lock set to zeros.
 
2. Select the first number of the passcode by scrolling the click wheel.
 
 While you scroll with your iPod, the first digit of the passcode changes. 
You can also press the Previous/Rewind or Next/Fast Forward button to 
scroll through numbers.
 
3. Press the Select button to pick a number.
 
 This sets your choice for the first number and moves on to the next number 
of the passcode. Repeat this step for each number of the passcode. When 
you pick the last number, the message Confirm Combination appears.
 
4. Confirm the passcode
 
 Repeat Step 2 and 3 for each number of the passcode to confirm. After 
confirming, your iPod is locked.

72
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
On a locked iPod nano or iPod classic, the lock icon appears if you press any 
key. To unlock the iPod after locking it, press any button and then repeat 
Steps 2 and 3 to enter each number of the passcode. After correctly entering 
the passcode, the iPod nano or iPod classic unlocks and returns to the last 
viewed screen.
To reset the passcode, first unlock the iPod, and then choose Extras➪
Screen ➪Reset Combination, and then repeat Steps 2 through 4. To turn 
off the lock, reset the combination to all zeroes.
If you don’t know the passcode, attach the iPod nano or iPod classic to the 
computer you used to set it up and synchronize it with iTunes. When you 
disconnect it after synchronizing with iTunes, the iPod nano or iPod classic is 
no longer locked with a passcode.
Getting Personal
Your future might be so bright that you gotta wear shades, but your iPod or 
iPhone display might not be bright enough. From the Settings menu, you can 
change the timer for the backlight on iPod classic and iPod nano models, and 
set the brightness of the display on all models, as well as set the contrast of 
the black-and-white displays of older models. Choose the Settings menu from 
the main menu of an iPod classic, nano, or older model, or from the Home 
screen of an iPod touch or iPhone.
You have plenty of other settings to consider to give your iPod or iPhone 
a personal touch. Besides wallpapering the display of your iPod touch or 
iPhone, you can set keyboard clicks and alert sounds to indicate that e-mail 
has arrived, that something in your calendar needs attention, and so on.
If you share your iPod touch or iPhone with children or adults that act like 
children, you may want to place restrictions that prevent explicit music from 
the iTunes Store from being displayed in playlists, prevent the use of apps 
such as YouTube, or stop any access to the iTunes Store or App Store. Your 
iPod touch or iPhone can let you do that, too.
Adjusting the backlight of your 
iPod nano or iPod classic
The iPod classic, iPod nano, and older iPods use a display backlight that 
turns on when you press a button or use the click wheel and then turns 
off after a short amount of time. You can set the backlight on iPod clas-
sic and iPod nano models to remain on for a certain interval of time. From 
the main menu, choose Settings➪General➪Backlight on an iPod nano, or 

73
 Chapter 4: Choosing Essential Settings for Daily Operation
Settings➪Backlight on an iPod classic. A menu appears, giving you the 
options of 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 
seconds, and Always On. Select one by scrolling to highlight the selection 
and then press the Select button.
 
Using the backlight drains an iPod battery; the longer you set the interval, the 
more frequently you need to recharge the battery.
To set the backlight to always be on, choose Always On. If you want the 
backlight to always be off, choose Always Off. If you set it to always be off, 
the backlight doesn’t turn on automatically when you press any button or 
use the click wheel — and the display is much darker, of course.
To adjust the brightness of an iPod classic or nano, choose 
Settings➪Brightness from the main menu. The Brightness screen appears 
with a slider that shows the brightness setting, which ranges from low (a 
quarter-moon icon) to high (a bright sun icon). Scroll clockwise to increase 
the brightness (toward the bright sun) and counterclockwise to decrease the 
brightness (toward the moon).
Brightening and wallpapering 
your iPod or iPhone
To adjust the brightness of an iPod touch or iPhone, first tap the Settings 
icon on the Home screen and then tap Brightness, which is near the top of 
the Settings screen. The Brightness screen appears with a slider that shows 
the brightness setting, which ranges from low (a dim sun icon) to high (a 
bright sun icon). Slide the brightness slider’s knob with your finger to the 
right to increase the brightness (toward the bright sun) and to the left to 
decrease the brightness (toward the dim sun). Of course, the brighter the 
screen, the more power is drawn from the battery.
While you’re at it, why not wallpaper your display? You can make your iPod 
touch or iPhone display a stylish background when it’s locked. You can also 
put up photos or other images from your photo library as your wallpaper.
It’s not like you’ll see it often — the iPod touch or iPhone displays the 
wallpaper image only when you first press the Sleep/Wake button or Home 
button to wake it up. After you swipe with your finger to unlock your iPod 
touch or iPhone, the wallpaper is replaced by the Home screen or whatever 
app you were last running.
To set the wallpaper, choose Settings➪General➪Wallpaper from the Home 
screen. You can then choose from among stylish built-in wallpaper images by 
tapping the Wallpaper button.

74
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
You can also choose from the photo library you synchronized with your iPod 
touch or iPhone by tapping Photo Library, or you can choose photos saved 
on your iPod touch or iPhone by tapping Saved Photos. (For more about 
photos, see Chapter 18.)
Tap a thumbnail to select the image for your wallpaper, or tap the Wallpaper 
button in the upper-left corner to return to the Wallpaper menu. After tapping 
an image, your iPod touch or iPhone displays the Move and Scale screen, which 
lets you optionally pan the image by dragging your finger, and optionally zoom 
in or out of the image by pinching and unpinching with your fingers. Tap the Set 
Wallpaper button to set the image as your wallpaper or tap Cancel to cancel.
To set the brightness level on an iPod nano, choose Settings➪General➪
Brightness; on an iPod classic, choose Settings➪ Brightness. You can then 
scroll the click wheel clockwise to increase brightness, or counter-clockwise 
to decrease brightness.
Sound effects and fonts
Don’t want to hear the iPod touch or iPhone keyboard click as you type, or 
the snap noise as you swipe your finger over the “unlock” message? You can 
set which events can trigger sound effects as well as the volume of the sound 
effect. Choose Settings➪General➪Sounds from the Home screen. You can 
then turn the alert on or off and click sounds for new mail, sent mail, calendar 
alerts, locking and unlocking, and using the on-screen keyboard. Tap On to 
turn off each option or vice versa.
The click wheel of an iPod nano makes a clicking sound you can hear through 
headphones or the tiny speaker. On an iPod classic, you can hear the click 
wheel sound only through the tiny speaker.
You can turn the click wheel sound off with an iPod classic by choosing Settings 
from the main menu, or in an iPod nano by choosing Settings➪General, and then 
selecting Clicker once so that Off appears next to it on the right. Selecting Clicker 
again turns it back on.
You can change the click wheel sound with an iPod nano so that you can 
hear it on your headphones only, on the tiny speaker only, both, or not at all. 
Choose Settings➪General and then select Clicker once to cycle through its 
settings one at a time: Off, Speaker, Headphones, or Both.
The iPod nano can display its menu text in two different font sizes: standard 
and large. To set the font size, choose Settings➪General➪Font Size and then 
select Standard or Large.

75
 Chapter 4: Choosing Essential Settings for Daily Operation
 
You can set the minimum font size for Mail messages with an iPod touch or 
iPhone to increase readability — for details on Mail message settings, see 
Chapter 20.
Location, location, location
Perhaps nothing is more personal than your physical location. With Location 
Services, iPod touch and iPhone apps like Maps (and lots of third-party apps 
like Showtimes, Eventful, WhosHere, Loopt, and various travel apps) can grab 
this physical location information and use it to help you find things closer to 
you. For example, the Maps app can find your location on the map, which is 
very useful for getting directions (see Chapter 21).
An iPhone can tell you where you are in the physical world with the utmost 
precision. The iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS offer the Global Positioning System 
(GPS), which uses orbiting satellites to pinpoint your location in a range of 10 
to 100 meters. The earlier-model iPhone and the iPod touch can triangulate 
their location with scary precision as well, even though these models don’t 
offer GPS — they leverage the most extensive Wi-Fi reference database in the 
world. You need to be connected to Wi-Fi to use Location Services on an iPod 
touch (see the section “Going Online with your iPod touch or iPhone,” later in 
this chapter).
You can turn Location Services on or off by choosing Settings➪General from 
the Home screen and then tapping the Off button for Location Services to 
turn it on, or the On button to turn it off.
After turning it off, your iPod touch or iPhone prompts you to turn it back on 
if you run an app that makes use of Location Services (such as Maps).
 
To conserve battery power, turn off Location Services if you aren’t using 
applications that make use of it.
Setting restrictions on an 
iPod touch or iPhone
If you need to, you can set restrictions for an iPod touch or iPhone that
 
✓ Prevent explicit music from the iTunes Store from being displayed in 
playlists
 
✓ Prevent the use of apps such as YouTube
 
✓ Stop access to the iTunes Store or App Store

76
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Choose Settings➪General from the Home screen and then tap Restrictions to 
see the Restrictions screen. Tap Enable Restrictions and then set up a restric-
tions passcode (which is separate from your Passcode Lock passcode). Enter 
a four-number passcode by touching numbers on the calculator-style keypad. 
(If you change your mind, tap the Cancel button to cancel the operation.) 
Then enter the same passcode number again to confirm the passcode, and 
the restrictions are enabled and appear ready for you to change.
Set the restrictions you want by tapping each control’s On switch to turn it 
off. By default, all controls are on, which means that usage is allowed (not 
restricted). Turn off a control to restrict its use.
If you restrict access to Safari, YouTube, the Camera (on an iPhone), the 
iTunes Store, and/or the App Store (for installing apps), those icons are 
removed from the Home screen so that they can’t be accessed. If you turn 
off Location, location data is no longer provided to applications. Restricted 
content does not appear when accessing the iTunes Store. To access the 
icons and the restricted content, you need to turn off the restrictions first 
(or turn off all restrictions).
To turn off all restrictions, choose Settings➪General➪Restrictions and then 
enter the passcode. Tap Disable Restrictions and then reenter the passcode. 
Your iPod touch or iPhone is now free. Be careful out there!
Going Online with your 
iPod touch or iPhone
To surf the Web, check e-mail, or use the iTunes Store or App Store (or any 
other app that uses the Internet) on your iPod touch or iPhone — or to use 
Location Services on your iPod touch or earlier-model iPhone — you must 
first join a Wi-Fi network that’s connected to the Internet.
An iPod touch or iPhone can join Wi-Fi networks at home, at work, or at 
Wi-Fi hotspots around the world. Although some public Wi-Fi networks are 
free, others require logging in first, and still others require logging in and 
supplying a credit card number. Still others are detected but locked — if you 
select a locked network, a dialog appears asking for a password.
If you don’t have Wi-Fi at home but you do have a broadband Internet con-
nection (such as cable or DSL), I recommend buying an AirPort Express or 
AirPort Extreme, available in the Apple Store — you can then connect your 
Internet connection to the AirPort to extend Internet access over Wi-Fi.

tions, and it even plays music from your iTunes library through speakers con-

nected to it. AirPort Extreme offers a stronger antenna for greater range, and 
lets up to 50 users connect to Wi-Fi at once, with shared printing and storage 
and Ethernet connections — perfect for a large family or small business. You 
can give your network a unique name, which appears in the list of networks 
on your iPod touch or iPhone when it is in range of the network.
Turning Wi-Fi on or off
To turn Wi-Fi on, choose Settings➪Wi-Fi from the Home screen to display the 
Wi-Fi Networks screen. Tap the Off button for the Wi-Fi setting to turn it on 
(tap it again to turn it off).
When Wi-Fi is turned on, your iPod touch or iPhone detects and automatically 
acquires a Wi-Fi signal you’ve used before, or it can detect one or more signals 
in the area and present them in a list for you to choose. The list of available 
Wi-Fi networks appears below the Wi-Fi setting, as shown in Figure 4-5.
 
If your iPod touch or iPhone isn’t already connected to Wi-Fi, it’s set by 
default to look for networks and ask whether you want to join them when-
ever you use something that requires the network (such as Safari, Weather, 
YouTube, Mail, and so on). You can stop your iPod touch or iPhone from 
looking and asking: Scroll down to the end of the list of Wi-Fi networks on 
the Wi-Fi Networks screen and then tap the On button for the Ask to Join 
Networks option to turn it off. You can still join networks manually, but you 
won’t be interrupted with requests to join networks.
 
You should turn off Wi-Fi if you’re not using it to save battery power and to 
keep your iPhone or iPod touch from automatically receiving e-mail. Choose 
Settings➪Wi-Fi and then tap the On button for the Wi-Fi setting to turn it off.
Choosing a Wi-Fi network
You can scroll the list of networks on the Wi-Fi Networks screen to choose 
one. (Refer to Figure 4-5.) You can scroll quickly by flicking your finger or 
scroll slowly by dragging up or down, but however you scroll, you choose a 
Wi-Fi network by tapping its name. Networks are named by their administrators. 
(If you set up your own home Wi-Fi, you get to name yours whatever you 
want.)
 
When connected to a Wi-Fi network, your iPod touch or iPhone displays the 
Wi-Fi icon in the status bar at the top of the display. This also indicates the 
connection strength — the more arcs you see in the icon, the stronger the 
connection.

and then 
choose a 
Wi-Fi

If a Lock icon appears next to the Wi-Fi network name (refer to Figure 4-5), it 
means that the network is locked and you need a password. When you select 
a locked network, the iPod touch or iPhone displays an Enter Password 
screen and the on-screen keyboard. Tap out the password using the keyboard. 
(For details on how to use the on-screen keyboard, see Chapter 3.) Tap Join 
to join the network or tap Cancel in the upper-right corner to cancel joining.
 
To join a Wi-Fi network that requires either a credit card or an account for you 
to log into, select the network and then use Safari to open the network’s Web 
page. (For more on using Safari, see Chapter 19.) The first Web page you see is 
typically the login page for the service (for example, a commercial Wi-Fi service 
or a hotel service). Follow the instructions in Chapter 19 for interacting with 
Web pages.
Your iPod touch or iPhone remembers your Wi-Fi connections and automatically 
uses one when it detects it within your range. If you’ve used multiple Wi-Fi 
networks in the same location, it picks the last one you used.
 
You can also stop your iPod touch or iPhone from automatically joining a 
Wi-Fi network — such as a paid or closed Wi-Fi service that somehow got hold 
of your iPod touch or iPhone and won’t let you move on to other Web pages 
without typing a password. See Chapter 23 for this tip.

feet. Watch the “Lust for Life” music video by Iggy Pop on a bus heading 
out of Detroit. Ride the rails listening to “All Aboard” by Muddy Waters, 
followed by “Peavine” by John Lee Hooker. Or cruise on the autobahn in 
Germany with Kraftwerk. When you go mobile with your iPod or iPhone, it 
provides high-quality sound and excellent picture quality no matter how 
turbulent the environment.
If you can’t plug your iPod or iPhone into a power source while it’s playing, 
you can use the battery for quite a while before having to recharge. You can 
find all the accessories that you need to travel with an iPod or iPhone in the 
Apple Store at www.apple.com. This chapter is all about using your iPod or 
iPhone on the road with accessories.
Connecting Headphones 
and Portable Speakers
Apple designed the iPod and iPhone to provide excellent sound through 
headphones. From the headphone/line-out connection, though, the iPod or 
iPhone can also play music through portable speaker systems. The speaker 
systems must be self-powered or able to work with very little power (just like 
headphones do) and allow audio to be input via a 3.5mm, stereo mini-plug 
connection.

80
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Looking at specs, you’ll notice that iPod and iPhone models include a 
small amplifier that’s plenty powerful enough to deliver audio through the 
headphone/line-out connection. All current models, including the iPod 
shuffle, have a frequency response of 20 to 20,000 Hz (hertz), which provides 
distortion-free music at the lowest or highest pitches. (In this case, hertz 
has nothing to do with rental cars. A hertz is a unit of frequency equal to 
one cycle per second.) At pitches that produce frequencies of 20 cycles per 
second or 20,000 cycles per second (and everything in between), the iPod or 
iPhone responds with distortion-free sound.
 
If headphones aren’t your thing, you can even wear an iPod shuffle inside a 
headband (and keep it relatively dry no matter how much you, um, create 
your own moisture). Thanko (http://thanko.jp/voniasports) offers 
the Vonia sports headband that uses bone conduction — a hearing aid 
technology that conducts “Good Vibrations” through the bones of your skull, 
directly into your inner ear. The sound can be surprisingly clear and crisp, 
although it won’t be in stereo because the sound seems to come from inside 
your head.
Portable speaker systems typically include built-in amplifiers and a volume 
control, and they usually offer a stereo mini-plug that you can attach directly 
to the iPod or iPhone headphone/line-out connection or to a dock headphone/
line-out connection. Some portable speaker systems, such as the DLO 
Portable Speakers from DLO (www.dlo.com), or the Bose SoundDock 
Portable digital music system (www.bose.com, see Figure 5-1), provide a 
convenient dock connection for playing audio. To place the external speakers 
farther away from the iPod or iPhone, use a stereo mini-plug extension cable, 
which is available at most consumer electronics stores. These cables have a 
stereo mini-plug on one end and a stereo mini-socket on the other.

81
 Chapter 5: Going Mobile 
 
When using a portable speaker system equipped with volume controls, set 
your iPod or iPhone volume to about half or three-quarters and then raise or 
lower the volume of your speaker system.
When you travel, take an extra pair of headphones (or earbuds) and a splitter 
cable, which are available in any consumer electronics store. The Monster 
iSplitter is available in the Apple Store. That way, you can share music with 
someone on the road.
 
For a portable stereo system that offers big sound on a rechargeable battery and 
is perfect for environments like the beach or a boat, check out the i-P23 speaker 
systems from Sonic Impact (www.si5.com). It includes universal adapters for all 
dockable iPod and iPhone models, and an audio input connection for connecting 
your computer or an audio player. The double-duty case is a durable cover that 
acts as a speaker cabinet for both speakers, to give the speakers better bass 
response.
Playing Car Tunes
I always wanted to be able to fill up a car with music just as easily as filling 
it up with fuel, without having to carry dozens of cassettes or CDs. With an 
iPod or iPhone, an auto-charger to save on battery power, and a way to 
connect the iPod or iPhone to your car’s stereo system, you’re ready to pump 
music. (Start your engine and queue up “Getting in Tune” and then “Going 
Mobile” by The Who.) You can even go one step further and get a new BMW, 
Toyota, or similarly equipped car that offers an iPod or iPhone dock cable 
installed and integrated into the car’s stereo system so that you can control 
the iPod or iPhone from your car stereo — including handy controls on the 
steering wheel.
Here are your options when it comes to linking your iPod or iPhone to a car 
stereo:
 
✓ Use your cassette player. Use a standard cassette adapter and an iPod 
power adapter for your car’s lighter socket. This method works even 
with rental cars (as long as they’re supplied with cassette players). For a 
semipermanent installation, you can add a car mount to keep your iPod 
or iPhone secure. Cassette adapters offer medium quality that’s usually 
better than wireless adapters.
 
✓ Buy or lease a car that offers an iPod-ready stereo or AUX input. 
BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Honda, and many other auto companies 
offer models that are iPod-ready, and you can use your iPhone with 
them and control the iPod or iPhone from your car stereo’s head unit. 

82
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
This method offers the best sound quality. Some offer a connector 
for the iPod or iPhone that uses the dock connection, whereas others 
offer AUX (auxiliary) line-in audio input — you can connect a mini-plug 
cable directly to the iPod or iPhone headphone connection and then to 
the AUX input. You can then get a power adapter for your car’s lighter 
socket, or plug directly into a 110-volt socket if your vehicle offers one.
 
✓ Use your radio and a wireless adapter. Use a wireless adapter that 
plays your iPod or iPhone as if it were a station on your FM radio dial. 
Some car mounts offer built-in wireless adapters. This might be your 
only inexpensive choice if you don’t have a cassette deck. Note: Wireless 
adapters might not work well in cities where FM stations crowd the 
radio dial.
 
✓ Install an iPod/iPhone interface. Install an iPod or iPhone interface for 
your car stereo that offers high-quality, line-in audio input and power. 
After you install this interface, thread the iPod/iPhone dock cable into 
the glove box so that you can plug the cable into your iPod or iPhone, 
hide the iPod or iPhone in the glove box, and control the iPod or iPhone 
from your car stereo’s head unit. Toyota offers an integration kit for 
plugging an iPod into the car glove box and using either the steering 
wheel or usual audio system controls.
Using cassette and power 
adapters for your car
Until you get an iPod-ready car, a car stereo with a mini-socket for AUX 
(auxiliary) line-in audio input (also called a stereo-in connection), or an iPod 
connection — or get one installed — you can use a cassette-player adapter 
to connect with your car stereo. (I describe wireless connectivity later, in the 
section “Connecting by Wireless Radio.”) These wireless connectivity solutions 
provide lower sound quality than iPod interface installations or stereo-in 
connections but are inexpensive and work with most cars.
Many car stereos have a cassette player, and you can buy a cassette adapter — 
the Sony CPA-9C Car Cassette Adapter, for example — from most consumer 
electronics stores. The cassette-player adapter looks like a tape cassette with 
a mini-plug cable (which sticks out through the slot when you’re using the 
adapter). Adapters work with most front-loading and side-loading cassette 
decks — it’s the same shape as a cassette — as long as the cable doesn’t 
prevent its loading.
First connect the mini-plug cable directly to the iPod or iPhone headphone 
connection. Then insert the adapter into the cassette player, being careful 
not to get the cable tangled inside the player.

83
 Chapter 5: Going Mobile 
One inherent problem with this approach is that the cable that dangles from 
your cassette player looks unsightly. You also might have some trouble 
ejecting the adapter if the cable gets wedged in the cassette-player door. 
Overall, though, this method is the best for most cars because it provides 
better sound quality than most wireless methods.
Although some new vehicles (particularly SUVs and cars such as the Toyota 
Matrix mini–station wagon) offer 110-volt power outlets you can use with 
your Apple-supplied battery charger, most cars offer only a lighter/power 
socket that requires a power adapter to use with your iPod or iPhone. Be 
careful to pick the right type of power adapter for your car’s lighter/power 
socket.
Belkin (www.belkin.com) offers the Auto Kit for $39.99, and it includes 
a car power adapter with a convenient socket for a stereo mini-plug cable 
(which can connect directly to a car stereo if the stereo has a mini-socket for 
audio input). The adapter includes a volume-adjustable amplifier to boost 
the sound coming from the iPod or iPhone before it goes into the cassette 
adapter or car stereo. If you don’t need the extra volume control, you can 
get a less expensive car power adapter, the Mobile Power Cord for iPod, for 
$19.99 from Belkin.
Even with a cassette adapter and power adapter, you have at best a clumsy 
solution that uses one cable (power) from a power adapter to the iPod 
or iPhone, and another cable (audio) to your car stereo cassette adapter. 
Attached to these wires, your iPod or iPhone needs a secure place to sit 
while your car moves because you don’t want it bouncing around.
You can fit your iPod or iPhone securely in position in a car without getting a 
custom installation. The TuneDok ($29.99) from Belkin (www.belkin.com) 
holds your iPod or iPhone securely and fits into your car’s cup holder. The 
TuneDok ratcheting neck and height-adjustment feature lets you reposition the 
iPod or iPhone to your liking. The cable-management clip eliminates loose 
and tangled cables, and the large and small rubber base and cup fit most cup 
holders.
MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers an inexpensive solution for both car 
use and personal use. The $6 Car Holder attaches to the dashboard of your 
car and lets you attach an iPod or iPhone that’s wearing one of the MARWARE 
Sportsuit covering cases. (See the section “Dressing Up Your iPod and iPhone 
for Travel,” later in this chapter.) The clip on the back attaches to the Car 
Holder.
ProClip (www.proclipusa.com) offers mounting brackets for clip-on 
devices. The brackets attach to the dashboard, and you can install them in 
seconds. After you install the bracket, you can use different custom holders 
for the iPod or iPhone models or for cell phones and other portable devices.

Part I: Touching All the Basics 
Integrating an iPod or iPhone 
with your car stereo
Premium car manufacturers are introducing cars that are iPod-ready, including 
an iPod interface for the car stereo system that uses the dock connector 
cable that’s compatible with all iPod and iPhone models. For example, BMW 
offers such a model with audio controls on the steering wheel. Mercedes-
Benz, Volvo, MINI Cooper, Nissan, Alfa Romeo, and Ferrari all also offer 
iPod-ready models. In addition, car stereo manufacturers (such as Alpine 
and Clarion) offer car audio systems with integrated iPod interfaces; see 
Figure 5-2.
 
Figure 5-2:

If you can’t afford an iPod-ready car, you can opt for a custom installation of 
an iPod interface for your existing car stereo and car power (such as using a 
custom cable interface for a CD changer, which a skilled car audio specialist 
can install in your dashboard). For example, Dension (www.dension.com) 
offers the Gateway series of products for controlling iPod and iPhone models 
and auxiliary devices in a car.

85
 Chapter 5: Going Mobile 
Connecting by Wireless Radio
A wireless music adapter lets you play music from your iPod or iPhone on 
an FM radio with no connection or cable. However, the sound quality might 
suffer a bit from radio interference. I always take a wireless adapter with 
me whenever I rent a car because even if a rental car has no cassette player 
(ruling out the use of my cassette adapter), it probably has an FM radio.
 
You can use a wireless adapter in a car, on a boat, or even on the beach with a 
portable radio. I even use it in hotel rooms with a clock radio.
To use a wireless adapter, follow these steps:
 
1. Set the wireless adapter to an unused FM radio frequency.
 
 Some adapters offer only one frequency (typically 87.9 MHz). Others 
offer you a choice of several frequencies: typically 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, and 
88.7 MHz. Some even let you pick any FM frequency. If given a choice, 
choose the frequency and set the adapter according to its instructions. 
Be sure to pick an unused frequency — a frequency that’s being used by 
an FM station in range of your radio is sure to interfere with your iPod 
signal.
 
2. Connect the wireless adapter to the iPod or iPhone headphone/line-
out connector or to the line-out connector on an iPod car dock.
 
 The wireless adapter acts like a miniature radio station, broadcasting to 
a nearby FM radio. (Sorry, you can’t go much farther than a few feet, so 
no one else can hear your Wolfman Jack impersonation.)
 
3. Tune to the appropriate frequency on the FM dial.
 
 Tune any nearby radio to the same FM frequency that you chose in Step 1.
 
You need to set the adapter close enough to the radio’s antenna to work, 
making it impractical for home stereos. You can get better-quality sound by 
connecting to a home stereo with a cable.
 
Don’t be surprised if the wireless adapter doesn’t work as well in cities — 
other radio stations might cause too much interference.
Here are a few wireless adapters I have no trouble recommending:
 
✓ TRAFFICJamz ($19.99) from Newer Technology (www.newertech.com) 
is both a charger and a transmitter that works with all model iPods.
 
✓ iTrip family of FM transmitters, including iTrip Auto SmartScan ($59.99) 
from Griffin Technology (www.griffintechnology.com), which 
automatically finds the three clearest frequencies wherever you are and 
saves them for you as presets.

86
Part I: Touching All the Basics 
 
✓ TuneCast Auto with ClearScan for iPhone and iPod ($79.99) from 
Belkin (www.belkin.com) quickly scans and finds the best FM frequency 
with one push of a button.
 
✓ Monster iCarPlay Wireless ($79.95) from Monster Cable (www.monster
cable.com) offers a power adapter as well as excellent-quality playback 
for a wireless radio unit. You can select radio frequencies of 88.1, 88.3, 
88.5, 88.7, 88.9, 89.1, 89.3, or 89.5 MHz. Although a bit more expensive, I 
prefer it for its sound quality.
 
✓ TransDock micro with IntelliTune ($69.99) from Digital Lifestyle 
Outfitters (www.dlo.com) scans for open FM frequencies automatically 
and sports a cool dial for adjusting your settings and manually tuning 
the frequency.
Dressing Up Your iPod 
and iPhone for Travel
The simple protective carrying cases supplied with some iPod and iPhone 
models just aren’t as stylin’ as the myriad accessories that you can get for 
dressing up your iPods and iPhones for travel. You can find different types of 
protective gear — from leather jackets to aluminum cases — in many different 
styles and colors. Apple offers access to hundreds of products from other 
suppliers on its Accessories page (www.apple.com/ipod/accessories.
html) — follow the “Shop” links to go directly to Apple’s online store to 
view product details and make purchases. Some are designed primarily for 
protecting your iPod or iPhone from harm; others are designed to provide 
some measure of protection while also providing access to controls.
On the extreme end of the spectrum are hardened cases that are ready for 
battlefields in deserts or jungles — the Humvees of iPod protective gear, if 
you will. Matias Corporation (http://matias.ca/armor) offers versions 
of the sturdy Matias Armor case ($29.95) for each iPod and iPhone model, 
which offers possibly the best protection against physical trauma on the 
market. Your iPod or iPhone rests within a hard, resilient metal exoskeleton 
that can withstand the abuse of bouncing down a flight of metal stairs 
without letting your iPod or iPhone pop out.
Business travelers can combine personal items into one carrying case. The 
Leather Folio ($29.99) cases from Belkin (www.belkin.com) for iPod classic 
and iPod touch models are made from fine-grain leather that even Ricardo 
Montalban would rave about. The cases can also hold personal essentials, 
such as business and credit cards. The HipCase cases ($29.99) from DLO 
(www.dlo.com) let you stash credit cards and other essentials along with 
your iPod, and the HipCase includes a sturdy, leather-covered belt clip.

87
 Chapter 5: Going Mobile 
On the sporty side, MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers the Sportsuit 
Convertible cases ($12.99) for iPod and iPhone models, with a patented belt-
clip system, offering interchangeable clip options for use with the MARWARE 
Car Holder or with an armband or belt. The neoprene case has vulcanized 
rubber grips on each side and bottom for a no-slip grip as well as plastic 
inserts for impact protection, offering full access to all the device’s controls 
and connections while it’s in the case.
Using Power Accessories
If you want to charge your iPod or iPhone battery when you travel abroad, 
you can’t count on finding the same voltage that exists in your home country. 
However, you still need to use your Apple power adapter, or your computer, 
to recharge your iPod or iPhone — basically, you need to plug something into 
some outlet somewhere. Fortunately, power converters for different voltages 
and plugs for different outlets are available in most airport gift shops, but the 
worldly traveler might want to consider saving time and money by getting a 
travel kit of power accessories from the Apple Store or from a consumer 
electronics store.
I found several varieties of power converter kits for world travel in my local 
international airport, but they were pricey — check your local Radio Shack or 
consumer electronics store first, or try Amazon.com. Most kits include a set of 
AC plugs with prongs that fit different electrical outlets around the world. You 
can connect the Apple power adapter for iPod and iPhone to these adapters. 
The AC plugs typically support outlets in North America, Japan, China, the 
United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Korea, Australia, and Hong Kong. You 
should also include at least one power accessory for use with a standard car 
lighter, such as car chargers from Belkin (www.belkin.com), Kensington 
(www.kensington.com), or Newer Technology (www.newertech.com).
One way to mitigate the battery blues is to get an accessory that lets you 
use replaceable alkaline batteries — the kind that you can find in any 
convenience store — in a pinch. The TunePower Rechargeable Battery Pack 
for iPod ($79.99) from Belkin (www.belkin.com) lets you power an iPod 
Classic or older-model iPod with standard AA alkaline replaceable batteries 
even when your internal iPod battery is drained.
The mophie Juice Pack Air Case and Rechargeable Battery for iPhone 3G 
($79.95, available in the Apple Store) is a unique power accessory that 
doubles as an iPhone hard-shell case. With its rechargeable external battery 
concealed inside the protective form-fitting case, it drains its own battery 
before it moves on to the one in your iPhone, conserving your iPhone battery 
power.

M
ore than half a century ago, jukeboxes were the primary and most 
convenient way for people to select the music they wanted to hear 
and share with others, especially newly released music. Juke joints were 
hopping with the newest hits every night. You could pick any song to play at 
any time, but you had to insert a coin and pay for each play. Radio eventually 
supplanted the jukebox as the primary means of releasing new music to the 
public, and the music was free to hear — but you couldn’t choose to play any 
song you wanted at any time.
Today, using iTunes, you not only have a digital jukebox and a radio in your 
computer, but you also have online access to millions of songs, with most 
songs available for download for 99 cents each and entire albums available 
for download at less than the list price of a CD.
Connect your computer to a stereo amplifier in your home (through wires 
or Apple TV), or connect speakers to your computer, and suddenly your 
computer is the best jukebox in the neighborhood. Connect your computer 
to a television, and you have a full multimedia environment in your home, all 
controlled by iTunes. And after you’ve organized your content in iTunes, you 
can put it all on your iPod or iPhone to carry your jukebox with you.
This chapter gives you an overview of what you can do with iTunes, and you 
get started in the simplest way possible: using iTunes to play music tracks on 
a CD. You can use iTunes just like a jukebox, only better — you don’t have to 
pay for each song you play, and you can play some of or all the songs on an 
album in any order.

92
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
What You Can Do with iTunes
You can download songs or entire albums, audio books, TV shows, movies, 
and other videos from the iTunes Store directly into your iTunes library (as 
I describe in Chapter 7), or you can copy these items from other sources 
(including audio CDs) into your iTunes library (as I describe in Chapter 8). 
You can also subscribe to podcasts that transfer audio or audio/video episodes, 
such as weekly broadcasts, automatically to your iTunes library from the 
Internet or through the iTunes Store. You can even use iTunes to listen to 
Web radio stations and add your favorite stations to your music library. After 
you store the content in your iTunes library, you can play it on your computer 
and transfer it to iPod, Apple TV, and iPhone models. You can also use your 
computer to burn the audio content onto an audio CD or copy audio and 
video files onto other hard drives or DVD data discs as backups.
Transferring songs from a CD to your computer is referred to as ripping a CD 
(to the chagrin of the music industry old-timers who think that users intend 
to rip off music without paying for it). Ripping an entire CD’s worth of songs 
is quick and easy, and track information, such as artist name and title, arrives 
automatically over the Internet for most commercial CDs. (You can add the 
information yourself for rare CDs, custom-mix CDs, live CDs, and others that 
are unknown to the database.)
You can also add video files to your iTunes library in a couple of ways: by 
choosing content from the iTunes Store (such as TV shows, feature-length 
high-definition movies, music videos, and even free movie trailers) or by 
downloading standard video files in the MPEG-4 format from other sources 
on the Internet. You can also create your own videos with a digital camcorder 
(or cameras built into computers, such as the iSight camera included with 
MacBooks) and copy them to iTunes.
 
Although you can’t use iTunes to transfer video content from a DVD, you can 
use other software to convert DVDs to digital video files, and you can transfer 
video content from older VHS players. Visit the Tips section of the author’s 
Web site at www.tonybove.com for more info.
As if that weren’t enough, iTunes gives you the power to organize content 
into playlists, as I describe in Chapter 14. (You can even set up dynamic, 
smart playlists that reflect your preferences and listening habits.) iTunes 
even has a built-in equalizer with preset settings for all kinds of music and 
listening environments, with the added bonus of being able to customize and 
save your own personalized settings with each item of content.
The Mac and Windows versions of iTunes are virtually identical, with the 
exception that dialogs and icons look a bit different between the two 
operating systems. You also find a few other differences, mostly related to 
the different operating environments. The Windows version lets you import 

93
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with iTunes 
unprotected Windows Media (WMA) songs; the Mac version, like most 
Mac applications, can be controlled by AppleScript programs and Automator 
workflows. Nevertheless, as Apple continues to improve iTunes, the company 
releases upgrades to both versions at the same time, and the versions are 
free to download.
Opening the iTunes Window
You can run iTunes anytime (with or without an iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV) 
to build and manage your library of music, audio books, podcasts, Web radio 
stations, TV shows, and other videos. You don’t have to connect your iPod or 
iPhone until you’re ready to transfer content to it (as I describe in Chapter 9).
When you launch iTunes, your library and other sources of content appear. 
Figure 6-1 shows the iTunes window on a PC running Windows, showing the 
Column Browser (to browse by artist) and the Artwork Column (to show 
album covers). You can also click the column headings in the List pane to 
sort your library by artist, album title, or any of the other view options.
The Mac and Windows versions of iTunes offer the same functions and 
viewing options, including the cover browser (also known as Cover Flow). 
Figure 6-2 shows the iTunes window on the Mac with the cover browser open, 
displaying the cover art for albums. Both versions also offer the Genius Sidebar 
(shown in Figure 6-1, but hidden in Figure 6-2) and the Speakers pop-up menu 
for choosing a speaker system. 
iTunes offers multiple views of your library and your sources for content, as 
well as controls for organizing, importing, and playing content, as follows:
 
✓ Source pane: Displays the source of your content, handily divided into 
the following sections:
 
• Library: Includes your music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, audio 
books, applications and games, ringtones, and all available radio 
stations.
 
• Store: Includes the iTunes Store and your Purchased or Downloads 
list (if you’ve purchased items or have recently downloaded items).
 
• Devices: Includes audio CDs and any iPods (such as Mojo iTouch  in 
Figure 6-1), iPhones, and Apple TV devices (such as TB’s Apple TV 
in Figure 6-2) that are connected to your computer.
 
• Eject button: This button appears next to the name of an audio 
CD, iPod, or iPhone in the Source pane. Clicking the Eject button, 
um, ejects a CD or an iPod or iPhone. However, whereas a CD 
actually pops out of some computers, iPods and iPhones act like 
hard drives, and ejecting them simply removes (unmounts) the 
drives from the system so that you can disconnect them.

Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
• Shared: Includes iTunes libraries on your home network that you 
can share iTunes Store content with, as I describe in Chapter 7.
 
• Genius: Includes Genius mixes and your Genius playlists, which I 
describe in Chapter 14.
 
• Playlists: Includes the automatic tune-selector iTunes DJ (see 
Chapter 13 for details) and the Genius and your own playlists 
(see Chapter 14 for more info).

✓ Cover browser: Also called Cover Flow, the cover browser lets you flip 
through your cover art to choose songs. (Refer to Figure 6-2.) You can 
use the slider to move swiftly through your library, or you can click to 
the right or left of the cover in the foreground to step forward or back-
ward in your library.
 
✓ List pane:  Depending on the source that’s selected in the Source pane 
under Library, Store, Devices, Shared, Genius, or Playlists, the List pane 
(refer to Figure 6-1) displays the content from that source. For example, 
choosing an iPod in the Devices section displays the iPod content in 
the List pane, while choosing Music in the Library section displays the 
music in your iTunes library.

96
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
✓  Column Browser and Artwork Column: To see these views, click the 
leftmost View button for List view (refer to Figure 6-1) and then choose 
either View➪Show Column Browser or View➪Show Artwork Column. 
To hide the Artwork Column, click the tiny left arrow to the left of the 
Artwork Column heading or choose View➪Hide Artwork Column; to hide 
the Column Browser, choose View➪>Hide Column Browser.
 
✓ View buttons: The three buttons near the upper-right corner change 
your view of the List pane to show items in a list, cover art thumbnail 
images in a grid, or the cover browser.
 
✓ Search field: Type in this field to search your library. You can also use 
the Search field to peruse a playlist or to look within the iTunes Store.
 
✓ Status pane: When content is playing, you can see the artist name, piece 
title (if known), and the elapsed time displayed in this pane. When syn-
chronizing, you see a progress bar. If more than one operation is happening 
at the same time (such as playing music and synchronizing), you can see 
either status display by clicking the tiny right arrow in the status pane.
 
✓ Player buttons — Forward/Next, Play/Pause, and Previous/Rewind: 
Use these buttons to control the playback of content in iTunes.
 
✓ Volume control: You can change the volume level in iTunes by dragging 
the volume control slider in the upper-left section of the iTunes window 
to the right to increase the volume or to the left to decrease it. The 
maximum volume of the iTunes volume slider is the maximum set for the 
computer’s sound, which you set separately. See Chapter 13 for more 
about setting volume levels on your computer.
 
✓ Playlist buttons — Add, Shuffle, Repeat: Use these buttons to add 
playlists, and randomly shuffle or repeat playback of playlists.
 
✓ Show/Hide Artwork button: Use this button to display or hide artwork 
(either your own or the artwork supplied with purchased songs and 
videos).
 
✓ Speakers pop-up menu: Use this pop-up menu near the lower-right 
corner of the iTunes window to select a different speaker system than 
the computer’s speakers (see Chapter 6). This pop-up menu appears 
only if you choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac or the 
Edit menu in Windows), click the Devices tab, and turn on the Look for 
Remote Speakers Connected with AirTunes option. If iTunes locates 
such speakers, the pop-up menu appears.
 
✓ Genius button: The Genius button, located in the lower-right corner of 
the iTunes window to the left of the Show/Hide Genius Sidebar button, 
generates a Genius playlist of songs from your library that go great with 
the song you selected. The Genius button appears gray unless you have 
selected a song — see Chapter 14 for details. After clicking the Genius 
button, the Genius playlist appears and is automatically selected in the 
Source pane in the Playlists section. 

97
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with iTunes 
 
✓ Show/Hide Genius Sidebar button: Use this button to display or hide 
the Genius Sidebar.
 
✓ Genius Sidebar: The Genius Sidebar (refer to Figure 6-1) makes suggestions 
for what to get from the iTunes Store based on what you’ve selected. 
You have obligation to buy anything, and you can dispense with it if it 
bothers you — you can open or close the Genius Sidebar by clicking 
the boxed-arrow Show/Hide Genius Sidebar button in the lower-right 
corner of the iTunes window. (See the section “Using the iTunes Genius 
Sidebar,” later in this chapter, for details.)
If you don’t like the width of the Source pane, you can adjust it by dragging 
the vertical bar between the Source and List panes. You can also adjust the 
horizontal bar between the song listing in the List pane and the Column 
Browser. To resize the iTunes window on a Mac, drag diagonally from the 
lower-right corner. In Windows, drag the edges of the window horizontally or 
vertically.
Playing CD Tracks in iTunes
iTunes needs content. You can get started right away by ripping music from 
CDs into your library, as I describe in Chapter 8. For more instant gratification, 
though, you can play music right off the CD without importing it. Maybe you 
don’t want to put the music into your library. Maybe you just want to hear it 
first, as part of your Play First, Rip Later plan.
To play a CD, insert any music CD — or even a CD-R that someone burned for 
you — into your computer. After you insert the CD, iTunes displays a dialog 
that asks whether you want to import the CD into your library right now — 
you can click the Yes button to import now or the No button to do nothing 
yet. Click No for now. 
If you’re connected to the Internet, iTunes accesses the Gracenote CDDB for 
song information while you are answering the import question so that after 
you click Yes or No, iTunes presents the track information for each song 
automatically, as shown in Figure 6-3. (Gracenote CDDB is a song database 
on the Internet that knows the track names of most commercial CDs but not 
those of homemade mix CDs. You can read about Gracenote CDDB and editing 
song information in Chapter 12.)
When you play a CD in iTunes, it’s just like using a CD player. To play a CD 
from the first track, click the Play button. (If you clicked somewhere else after 
inserting the disc, you might have to click the first track to select it before 
clicking the Play button.) The Play button then turns into a Pause button, and 
the song plays.

98
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
Figure 6-3: 
CD track 
info appears 
after iTunes 
consults the 
Internet.
 
When the song finishes, iTunes continues playing the songs in the list in 
sequence until you click the Pause button (which then toggles back into the 
Play button) or until the song list ends. You can skip to the next or previous 
song by using the arrow keys on your keyboard or by clicking the Forward 
button or the Back button (next to the Play button). You can also double-click 
another song in the list to start playing it.
 
You can press the spacebar to perform the same function as clicking the Play 
button; pressing it again is just like clicking the Pause button.
The Status pane above the list of songs tells you the name of the artist and 
the song title as well as the elapsed time of the track. When you click the 
artist name, the artist name is replaced by the album name. The time on the 
left of the slider is the elapsed time; the time on the right is the duration of 
the song. When you click the duration, it changes to the remaining time; click 
it again to return to the song’s duration.
 
Eject a CD by clicking the Eject icon next to the CD name in the Source pane 
or by choosing Controls➪Eject Disc. You can also right-click the CD name and 
choose Eject from the contextual menu that appears.
Rearranging tracks
You can rearrange the order of the tracks to automatically play them in any 
sequence you want, similar to programming a CD player. When you click the 
up arrow at the top of the first column in the List pane (refer to Figure 6-3), it 
changes to a down arrow, and the tracks appear in reverse order.

99
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with iTunes 
To change the order of tracks that you’re playing in sequence, just click and 
hold the track number in the leftmost column for the song; then drag it up or 
down in the list. You can set up the tracks to play in a completely different 
sequence.
Skipping tracks
To skip tracks so that they don’t play in sequence, deselect the check box 
next to the song names. iTunes skips deselected songs when you play the 
entire sequence.
 
To remove all check marks from a list, press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows 
while clicking a check mark. Select an empty check box while pressing Ô or 
Ctrl to add check marks to the entire list.
Repeating an entire CD
 
 You can repeat an entire CD by clicking the Repeat button, which you can 
find below the Source pane on the left side of the iTunes window (or by 
choosing Controls➪Repeat All). When it’s selected, the Repeat button shows 
blue highlighting. Click the Repeat button again to repeat the current song 
(or choose Controls➪Repeat One). The button changes to include a blue-
highlighted numeral 1. Click it once more to return to normal playback (or 
choose Controls➪Repeat Off).
 
The Shuffle button, located to the left of the Repeat button, plays the songs on 
the CD in random order, which can be fun. You can then press the arrow keys 
on your keyboard or click the Back and Forward buttons to jump around in 
random order.
Displaying visuals
The visual effects in iTunes can turn your iTunes window into a light show 
that’s synchronized to the music in your library. You can watch a cool display 
of eye candy while the music plays — or leave it on like a lava lamp.
Choose View➪Show Visualizer to display visual effects (or press Ô-T on a 
Mac or Ctrl-T in Windows). An animation appears in the iTunes window and 
synchronizes with the music. Choose View➪Hide Visualizer (or press Ô-T on 
a Mac or Ctrl-T in Windows) to turn off the visual effects.

100
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
iTunes offers two visualizers: The iTunes Visualizer has a simulated 3D 
look that includes spheres, ribbons, and lights that pulsate to the beat and 
tempo of the song you’re playing. The Classic Visualizer, with a 2D look, 
has been part of the application since the beginning. To switch from the 
iTunes Visualizer to the Classic Visualizer, choose View➪Visualizer➪Classic 
Visualizer. To switch back to the new one, choose View➪Visualizer➪iTunes 
Visualizer.
 
You can tweak the Classic Visualizer a bit by changing the Visualizer options. 
Choose View➪Visualizer➪Classic Visualizer and then choose View➪
Visualizer➪Options to open the Visualizer Options dialog, as shown in 
Figure 6-4.
 
Figure 6-4: 
Set options 
for visual 
effects.
 
The Visualizer Options dialog offers the following options that affect the 
animation (but not the performance of iTunes when it’s playing music):
 
✓ Display Frame Rate: Choosing this option displays the frame rate of the 
animation along with the animation so that you can tell whether it is 
going faster or slower than normal video (30 fps).
 
✓ Cap Frame Rate at 30 fps: Choosing this option keeps the frame rate at 
30 fps (frames per second) or lower to keep animation from moving too 
fast.
 
✓ Always Display Song Info: Choosing this option displays the song name, 
artist, and album for the song currently playing, along with the animation.
 
✓ Use DirectX (Windows only) or Use OpenGL (Mac only): You can 
choose to use DirectX on a Windows PC or OpenGL on a Mac to display 
very cool animation with faster performance. These are the most widely 
used standards for three-dimensional graphics programming.
 
✓ Faster but Rougher Display: When you use this option, animation plays 
faster but with rougher graphics. Select this option if your animation 
plays too slowly.
Choosing View➪Full Screen (or pressing Ô-F on a Mac or Ctrl-F in Windows) 
while showing the visualizer sets the visual effects to fill the entire screen. 
When displaying the full-screen visual effects, you can click the mouse button 
or press Escape (Esc) to stop the display and return to iTunes.

101
 Chapter 6: Getting Started with iTunes 
 
The Preferences dialog in iTunes lets you set the visualizer to always display 
full-screen. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences in 
Windows, click the Advanced tab (in Windows), and select the Display 
Visualizer Full Screen option, as shown in Figure 6-5, to always display the 
visualizer in full-screen mode.
 
Figure 6-5: 
Set the 
visualizer 
to always 
display full-
screen.
 
While the animated visual effects play, press Shift-/ (as if you’re typing a 
question mark) to see a list of keyboard functions. Depending on the visual 
effect, you might see more choices of keyboard functions by pressing Shift-/ 
again.
 
You can enhance iTunes with plug-ins that provide even better visuals. For 
example, SpectroGraph from Dr. Lex displays a spectrogram of the music, and 
Cover Version from imagomat displays the album cover artwork. You can find 
them — and many other enhancements — at Apple’s software download site 
(www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/ipod_itunes).
After installing an iTunes plug-in, you can switch from one plug-in to another 
by choosing View➪Visualizer to see the submenu of plug-ins (including 
iTunes Visualizer and Classic Visualizer, supplied with iTunes).

102
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
Using the iTunes Genius Sidebar
If you display the iTunes Genius Sidebar (refer to Figure 6-1), which shows up 
next to the List pane, it makes suggestions on what to buy from the iTunes 
Store based on the song or video you’ve selected. (This is not the same guy 
as the Genius button that creates a playlist from your library based on the 
song you select, or the Genius Mixes that iTunes creates automatically for 
you — see Chapter 14 for details on these geniuses.
The Genius Sidebar will try to skip songs or videos that are already in your 
library to show you content you might want to buy. But it’s not perfect — 
sometimes it doesn’t recognize that you already have the song or video 
(especially if you ripped the song from a CD).
iTunes informs the online store about the songs and videos you select 
whenever the Genius Sidebar is open. It then shows you content that other 
iTunes users purchased when they purchased the content you’re playing. You 
can click any item in the Genius Sidebar to go right to the iTunes Store page 
for that item. See Chapter 7 for details about using the iTunes Store.
The Genius Sidebar operates only if you give it permission and if you already 
have an iTunes Store account. (To open an account, see Chapter 7.) When 
you first start iTunes, the sidebar is not yet turned on. (Refer to Figure 6-1.) 
To turn it on, click the Turn On Genius button, enter your Apple ID and 
password for your iTunes Store account, and click the Continue button. If 
you don’t have an account yet, select the Create a New iTunes Store Account 
option, and choose your country from the country pop-up menu. Then click 
Continue. See Chapter 7 for further instructions on creating an account.
If the Genius Sidebar can’t find the content you’re playing, it offers choices 
that are simply in the same genre. If you don’t have an iTunes Store available 
for your country, you see the U.S. store, just as Chuck Berry once sang, 
“Anything you want, we got right here in the U.S.A.”

W
hen Apple announced its online music service, Steve Jobs remarked 
that other services put forward by the music industry tend to 
treat consumers like criminals. The Apple CEO had a point. Record labels 
dragged their feet for years, experimenting with online sales and taking legal 
action against online sites that allowed free downloads and music copying. 
Consumers and the industry both needed a solution. Apple did the research 
on how to make a service that worked better and was easier to use, and the 
company forged ahead with the iTunes Store.
By all accounts, Apple has succeeded in offering the easiest, fastest, and 
most cost-effective service for buying content online. You can purchase or 
rent movies, including HD movies, and you can purchase TV shows, music 
videos, applications, and games to play on your iPod or iPhone.
The iTunes Store includes the App Store, which offers free and commercial 
iPod touch and iPhone applications by the thousands. You can find apps in 
just about every category you can think of, including gaming, social networking, 
sports, business, and more. The store also includes games for the iPod nano 
and iPod classic.
You can also download free or commercial content and apps directly to an iPod 
touch or iPhone. The music and podcast sections of the iTunes Store and the 
entire App Store are available right at your fingertips. This chapter shows you 
how to sign in and take advantage of what the iTunes Store has to offer.
 
The iTunes Store also offers parental controls that let you disable various 
sections as well as limit the purchase of various content based on MPAA/TV 
ratings. To learn more about managing your iTunes Store account, visit this 
book’s companion Web site. 

104
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup   
Visiting the iTunes Store
You can visit the iTunes Store on your computer by connecting to the 
Internet and using iTunes. You can also click an iTunes Store link on Apple’s 
Web site, or a similar link on any other Web sites that are iTunes affiliates 
with songs for sale (such as www.rockument.com). The link automatically 
launches of iTunes and opens the iTunes Store.
As of this writing, the iTunes Store offers millions of songs you can freely 
copy and play on other devices for 69 cents, 99 cents, or $1.29. Until recently, 
many of the songs were copy-protected — you could only play them on up to 
five different authorized computers and use them on iPods, iPhones, or Apple 
TVs. Now, all songs and albums are provided in the “iTunes Plus” format that 
offers higher sound quality without copy protection. You can play iTunes 
Plus songs on any player that supports the AAC format and on an unlimited 
number of computers, and you can burn an unlimited number of CDs with 
them. The copy-protected songs you purchased before can now be updated 
to the iTunes Plus format (for a fee).
 
To learn more about updating your songs to the iTunes Plus format, visit this 
book’s companion Web site.
You can buy audio books as well as episodes and entire seasons of TV shows, 
and you can purchase them in advance, so you see them immediately. First-
run movies are available for rent or purchase. iTunes also offers tons of free 
content in the form of podcasts, which are similar to syndicated radio and TV 
shows, but you can download and play them at your convenience on your 
computer and on your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV. iTunes even offers free 
lectures, language lessons, and audio books with educational content in its 
iTunes U section.
 
To learn more about renting movies from the iTunes Store, visit this book’s 
companion Web site.
Like with most online services, the music that you buy online isn’t as high in 
audio quality as music on a commercial CD, although most people can’t tell 
the difference when playing the music on car stereos or at low volume. The 
quality of the music sold in the iTunes Store is comparable with the quality 
you get when ripping CDs or importing songs using the MP3 or AAC format. 
You also get song information, such as artist, song titles, the album title, and 

105
 Chapter 7: Shopping at the iTunes Store
cover artwork. The iTunes Store also offers albums with an immersive visual 
experience  (referred to as iTunes LP) ) that includes liner notes, pictures, 
video, animation, and lyrics. Some albums are provided with the electronic 
equivalent of a complete jewel case booklet that you can print yourself.
 
To find out more about audio encoding formats, and why iTunes uses them 
to reduce the space the music occupies on the hard drive or flash memory of 
your iPod or iPhone, visit this book’s companion Web site.
 
The iTunes Store is part of iTunes version 4 and newer, but you should be 
using the newest version of iTunes; I describe how to get it in Chapter 2.
If you already have your iTunes program open, you have at least three 
choices when it comes to opening the iTunes Store:
 
✓ Click iTunes Store in the Store section of the Source pane. The iTunes 
Store home page opens, as shown in Figure 7-1.
 
✓ Click any link in the Genius Sidebar. The iTunes Store home page 
opens and automatically switches your Source pane selection to iTunes 
Store. The Genius Sidebar offers suggestions based on the music you 
select in your library; see Chapter 6 for details.
 
✓ Follow a content link in iTunes. Click the content link (the gray-circled 
arrow next to a song or video title, an artist name, or an album title) to 
go to an iTunes Store page related to the song or video, artist, or album. 
iTunes searches the iTunes Store based on the item you selected. If 
nothing closely related turns up, at least you end up in the iTunes Store, 
and you might even find music you like that you didn’t know about.
The iTunes Store uses the iTunes List pane to display its wares. You can 
check out content to your heart’s content, although you can’t buy content, 
download free content, or rent movies unless you have an iTunes Store 
account set up.
The iTunes Store also provides tabs and buttons on a black bar above the List 
pane. The left and right triangle buttons work just like the Back and Forward 
buttons of a Web browser, moving back a page or forward a page, respec-
tively. The button with the Home icon takes you to the iTunes Store home 
page. (Refer to Figure 7-1.)

Setting Up an Account
One important task that you must do in iTunes on your computer is set 
up your iTunes Store account. You need an account to download free or 
commercial content and apps to your computer as well as to use the iTunes 
Store and App Store apps on your iPod touch or iPhone. To create an 
iTunes Store account, follow these steps:
 
1. In iTunes, click the iTunes Store option in the Store section of the 
Source pane, or click a music link or Genius Sidebar link.
 
 The iTunes Store home page appears (refer to Figure 7-1), replacing the 
List pane.
 
2. Click the Sign In tab in the upper-right area of the window to either 
create an account or sign in to an existing account.
 
 When you’re logged in to an iTunes account, the account name appears 
in place of the Sign In tab.
 
 After you click the Sign In tab, iTunes displays the account sign-in dialog, 
as shown in Figure 7-2.

107
 Chapter 7: Shopping at the iTunes Store
 
 If you already set up an account with the iTunes Store with the 
MobileMe (formerly .Mac) service or with other Apple services (such as 
the Apple Developer Connection), you’re halfway there. Type your ID 
and password and then click the Sign In button. Apple remembers the 
personal information that you put in previously, so you don’t have to 
reenter it every time you visit the iTunes Store. If you forgot your password, 
click the Forgot Password button, and iTunes provides a dialog so that 
you can answer your test question. If you answer correctly, iTunes 
e-mails your password to you.

3. Click the Create New Account button.
 
 iTunes displays a new page that welcomes you to the iTunes Store.
 
4. Click the Continue button on the iTunes Store welcome page.
 
 After you click Continue, the terms of use appear with the option at 
the end to agree to the terms. If you don’t select the option to agree, 
iTunes continues to display the terms until you agree or click the Cancel 
button.
 
5. Select I Have Read and Agree to the iTunes Terms and Conditions and 
click the Continue button.
 
 iTunes displays the personal account information page of the setup 
procedure, with text fields to enter your e-mail address, password, and 
other information.
 
6. Fill in your personal account information.
 
 Type your e-mail address into the Email Address field. Make up a password, 
and enter it twice — in the Password field and in the Verify field. Then 
enter a question and answer that you can easily remember (in case you 
forget your password). Finally, enter your birth date and options for 
receiving e-mail from Apple. Don’t forget the password you made up — 
you need it to access the store from your iPod touch or iPhone as well 
as from your computer or another computer.

7. Click the Continue button and then enter your credit card information.
 
 The entire procedure is secure, so you don’t have to worry. The iTunes 
Store keeps your personal information (including your credit card 
information) on file, and you don’t have to type it again.
 
8. Click the Continue button to finish the procedure.
 
 The account setup finishes and returns you to the iTunes Store home 
page. You can now use the iTunes Store to purchase and download 
content to play in iTunes and use on any iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV.
 
Select a country from the My Store pop-up menu at the bottom of the iTunes 
Store page to choose online stores in other countries. For example, the iTunes 
Store in France displays menus in French and features hit songs and TV shows 
for the French market. If you’ve set up your account in only one country (such 
as the United States), you have to set an account up again for the country 
you’re switching to, in order to purchase content in that country’s store. You 
can set up multiple accounts in multiple countries, and Apple takes care of 
credit card transactions and currency conversions
Cruising the Multimedia Mall
The iTunes Store home page is loaded with specials and advertisements to 
peruse. You can preview any song in the iTunes Store for up to 30 seconds. 
Some movies offer one-minute previews and movie trailers you can view for 
free, and TV shows and audio books can offer up to 90 seconds. If you have 
an account set up, you can buy and download content immediately, including 
movies for rent. I don’t know of a faster way to purchase or rent content from 
the comfort of your home.
Browsing songs and albums
To look at music in more depth, choose the Music tab in the black bar above the 
List pane. (Refer to Figure 7-1.) You can also pick a music genre by clicking the 
down-arrow button that appears next to the Music tab when you click it. iTunes 
displays more panels of advertisements and specials for music lovers, including 
iTunes LP albums that include liner notes, lyrics, videos, and other features.
After selecting an advertisement for an iTunes LP album, for example, the 
album’s page appears with a description and other links, as shown in Figure 7-3.

or entire pages), Copy Link (so that you can Paste it in a text file or message), 
Share on Facebook, or Share on Twitter.
What if you’re looking for particular music in a particular genre? You can 
browse the iTunes Store by genre and artist name in a method similar to 
browsing your iTunes library.
To browse the iTunes Store, choose View➪Show Column Browser, or click the 
Browse link in the Quick Links Column on the right side of the iTunes Store 
home page. iTunes displays the store’s offerings categorized by type of content 
(such as Music), and it displays music by genre and subgenre — and within 
each subgenre, by artist and album. Select a genre in the Genre column, then 
a subgenre in the Subgenre column, then an artist in the Artist column, and 
finally an album in the Album column, which takes you to the list of songs from 
that album that are available to preview or purchase, as shown in Figure 7-4.

Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup   
To see more information about the album that it came from, click the content 
link (one of the gray-circled arrow buttons in the List pane):
 
✓ Clicking the arrow in the Artist column takes you to the artist’s page of 
albums.
 
✓ Clicking the arrow in the Album column takes you to the album page.
 
✓ Clicking the arrow in the Name column takes you to album page with the 
song highlighted.
 
Figure 7-4: 
Browse the 
iTunes Store 
for music by 
genre, artist, 
and album.
 
 
My only complaint about browsing by artist is that artists are listed alphabetically 
by first name. For example, you have to look up Lou Reed under Lou and not 
Reed.
To preview a song, click the song title in the List pane and then click the Play 
button (or press the spacebar) or double-click the song.
By default, the previews play on your computer off the Internet in a stream, 
so you might hear a few hiccups in the playback. Each preview lasts about 30 
seconds. Just when you start really getting into the song, it ends. If the song 
is irresistible, though, you can buy it on the spot — for details, see the 
section “Buying and Downloading Media,” later in this chapter.

 Chapter 7: Shopping at the iTunes Store
Power searching
If you’re looking for DMB’s “That Song That Jane Likes” or know specifically 
what to search for, type it into the Search field in the upper-right corner 
of the iTunes window; this lets you search the iTunes Store for just about 
anything. You can type part of a song title or artist name to quickly display 
results from the iTunes Store in the List pane.
If you’re serious about your content, and you truly desire the power to 
search for exactly what you want, click the Power Search link in the Quick 
Links column on the right side of the iTunes Store home page (or choose 
Store➪Search). 
The Power Search page appears, as shown in Figure 7-5. You can choose the 
type of content to search through by choosing from a pop-up menu under the 
page title at the top: All Results (search all types), Music, Movies, TV Shows, 
Applications, Audiobooks, Podcasts, or iTunes U (part of the iTunes Store 
that offers free lectures, language lessons, and audio books).
For example, choose Music to power-search only for music and music videos 
(refer to Figure 7-5). The entry fields for Artist, Composer, Song, Album, and 
Genre appear. You can fill in some of or all these fields, or just fill in part of 
any field if that’s all you know.
Celebrities tell all (and so can you)
Do you want to be influenced? Do you want to 
know what influenced some of today’s celebri-
ties and buy what they have in their record col-
lections? Choose the Music tab at the top of the 
iTunes Store page in the List pane to go to the 
Music page. Scroll down the Music page, and 
click a celebrity name in the Celebrity Playlists 
section of the More in Music column on the 
right — to go to that celebrity’s page. A typical 
celebrity playlist offers about an album’s worth 
of songs from different artists. You can preview 
or buy any song in the list, or follow the music 
links to the artist or album page.
The Music page advertises some of the celebrity 
playlists, but a lot more are available. To see all 
the celebrity playlists, go to the More in Music 
pane column on the right side of the Music page 
and click the Celebrity Playlists link. You arrive 
at the Celebrity Playlists page. You can use the 
Sort By pop-up menu in the upper-right corner 
to sort the list by Most Recent or by Title.
You can also be influenced by other buyers 
and do a little influencing yourself. Go to the 
Music page, and click the iMix link in the More 
to Explore column at the bottom right corner of 
the page to check out playlists that have been 
contributed by other consumers and published 
in the iTunes Store. iMixes offer 30-second pre-
views of any songs in the iMix playlists.
To find out how to publish your own iMix play-
list, visit this book’s companion Web site.

Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup   
After you fill in as much as you know, click the Search button in the top right 
corner. Albums, movies, music videos, and other items found appear in the 
upper part of the page, while songs appear below in a list.

Browsing movies, TV shows, music videos, 
and audio books
The uncool thing about video stores — besides the weird people who hang 
out in them — is the lack of a comfortable way to preview videos before you 
buy them. Instead, go to the iTunes Store online to preview movies and TV 
shows before you buy them (and before you rent a movie) — and then go 
ahead and buy or rent them from the iTunes Store. Most shows offer 30 sec-
onds of previewing time, and many movies offer trailers that are even longer.
To find TV shows, movies, music videos, or audio books, do one of the 
following:
 
✓ Click the TV Shows, Movies, or Audiobooks tab in the black bar at the 
top of iTunes Store page in the List pane. You can also click the down-
arrow button next to each tab to browse by genre. The iTunes Store dis-
plays advertisements for the most popular items. Click an item, such as 
an audio book or movie, to go to its page.

113
 Chapter 7: Shopping at the iTunes Store
 
✓ Click the Music tab, and then click the down-arrow button next to the 
Music tab and then select Music Videos from the pop-up menu.
 
✓ Browse the iTunes Store by clicking the Browse link in the Quick Links 
column on the right side of the iTunes Store home page (or by choos-
ing View➪Show Column Browser). Select Audiobooks, Movies, Music 
Videos, or TV Shows from the iTunes Store column and then do one of 
the following to display the item’s page and list of contents:
 
• For an audio book, pick a genre from the Genre column and then 
pick an author from the Author/Narrator column.
 
• For a movie, pick a genre from the Genre column.
 
• For a music video, pick a genre from the Genre column and then 
pick an artist from the Artist column.
 
• For a TV show, pick a genre in the Genre column, then a TV show 
in the TV Shows column, and finally a season of episodes in the 
Season column.
To preview a TV show, movie, or music video, click the title in the List pane and 
then click the Play button (or press the spacebar). (Movies, music videos, and TV 
shows are all just videos on the computer, so I use the term videos from now on.)
The video plays in the iTunes window, in the Artwork pane in the lower-left 
corner of the iTunes window, in a separate window, or full-screen, depending on 
your playback settings. (See Chapter 13 for details.) If the Artwork pane isn’t 
visible, click the Show/Hide Artwork button to display it. Click the iTunes 
Play/Pause, Forward/Next, and Previous/Rewind buttons to control playback, 
and use the iTunes volume slider to control the volume, just like with songs. 
For more details about playing videos in iTunes, see Chapter 13.
Most movie pages offer a View Trailer button to view the theatrical trailer for the 
movie (as shown in Figure 7-6), as well as the Buy HD Movie button for the high-
definition (HD) version, if available, and the Buy Movie button for the non-HD 
version (or the Pre-Order button to pre-order the movie before release). Many 
(but not all) offer a Rent Movie button to rent the movie.
 
To learn more about renting movies from the iTunes Store, visit this book’s 
companion Web site.
 
Clicking the View Trailer button does the obvious — it plays the movie trailer. 
At any time, though, you can return to the movie page by clicking Close 
Preview under the lower-right corner of the trailer picture.
Audio books can be even more entertaining than movies and certainly easier to 
consume while driving or walking. The Audiobooks tab at the top of the iTunes 
Store page takes you to the Audiobooks page. Click an advertisement, thumb-
nail, or title, or click the circled arrow next to the title in a list of titles, to go to 
the specific audio book’s page. Then click the Preview button to preview the 
audio book. Use the Play/Pause button to pause and resume playback.

You can double-click the iTunes Store option in the Store section of the Source 
pane to open the iTunes Store in a separate window. With two windows, you 
can use the first window to search for and play content in your library while 
using the second to browse the iTunes Store and purchase and download 
a video. The first window stops playing content when you use the second 
window to preview a song or video.
Browsing and subscribing to podcasts
Podcasting is a popular method of publishing audio and video shows to the 
Internet, enabling people to subscribe to a feed and receive the shows 
automatically. Similar to a tape of a radio broadcast, you can save a podcast 
episode and play it back at your convenience, both in iTunes on your computer 
and on your iPod. You can also burn an audio podcast episode to an audio 
CD or MP3 CD. A podcast episode can be anything from a single song to a 
commentary-hosted radio show; a podcaster, like a broadcaster, provides a 
stream of episodes over time. Thousands of professional and amateur radio 
and video shows are offered as podcast episodes. Video podcasts are also 
called videocasts or vodcasts.
The iTunes Podcast page in the iTunes Store lets you browse, find, preview, 
and subscribe to podcasts, many of which are free. You don’t need an 
account to browse the iTunes Store and subscribe to free podcasts.

115
 Chapter 7: Shopping at the iTunes Store
To find podcasts in the iTunes Store, do one of the following:
 
✓ Click the Podcasts tab in the black bar at the top of the iTunes Store 
page in the List pane. The iTunes Store displays the Podcast page, with 
advertisements for popular podcasts and a list of Top Podcasts in 
the far-right column. You can click the down-arrow button next to the 
Podcasts tab to choose specific categories.
 
 You can also get to the Podcast page by clicking Podcasts in the iTunes 
Source pane and then clicking Podcast Directory at the bottom of the 
List view.
 
✓ Browse all podcasts in a particular category. Click the Browse link in 
the Quick Links column on the right side of the iTunes Store home page 
(or choose View➪Show Column Browser) and then select Podcasts in 
the iTunes Store column. Select options from the Category column and 
Subcategory column.
 
✓ Search for a podcast by name or keyword. You can type a search term 
into the Search iTunes Store field in the upper-right corner of the iTunes 
window to find any podcasts or other content items that match. You can 
also use the Power Search feature, described earlier in this chapter in 
the section “Power searching.”
After you select a podcast, the iTunes Store displays the podcast’s specific 
page in the iTunes Store, as shown in Figure 7-7, with all available podcast 
episodes in the List pane.

116
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup   
To select, play, and subscribe to a podcast, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a podcast in the iTunes Store.
 
 The iTunes Store offers a description, a Subscribe button to receive new 
podcasts, and a link to the podcast’s Web site for more information. The 
page also lists the most recent podcast episodes, with a Get Episode 
button next to each one. You can click the i icon on the far-right listing 
margin to display separate information about each podcast episode.
 
2. To preview the podcast, click an episode title and then click the Play 
button or press the spacebar.
 
 You can play a preview of any episode in the list. iTunes plays the 
episode for about 90 seconds, just like a Web radio station streaming to 
your computer. To jump ahead or play the entire episode, you must 
first subscribe to the podcast. By subscribing, you enable automatic 
downloading of episodes to your computer.
 
3. Click the Subscribe button on the podcast page to subscribe to the 
podcast.
 
 In typical Apple fashion, iTunes first displays an alert to confirm that 
you want to subscribe to the podcast.
 
4. Click the OK button to confirm.
 
 iTunes downloads the podcast to your computer and switches to 
Podcasts in the Library section of the Source pane. iTunes displays your 
newly subscribed podcast in the List pane. See Chapter 13 for details on 
playing podcasts in iTunes.
 
5. (Optional) Get more episodes of the podcast.
 
 When you subscribe to a podcast, you get the current episode. However, 
a podcast probably has past episodes still available. To download 
previous episodes, click the Get Episode button next to each episode 
(refer to Figure 7-7) to download it.
You can play the podcast, incorporate it into playlists, and make copies and 
burn CDs as much as you like. See Chapter 8 for details on subscribing to, 
deleting, and updating podcasts.
Buying and Downloading Media
As you select multimedia content, you can purchase the items and down-
load them to your computer immediately. All you need to do is click the Buy 
button, whether the item is a song, an album, a TV show episode, or an audio 
book.

117
 Chapter 7: Shopping at the iTunes Store
For example, if you select a song in the List pane, click the Buy Song button in 
the far-right column for the song. (You might have to scroll your iTunes Store 
window to see the far-right column.) When you select a TV show episode, 
click the Buy Episode button in the far-right column. You can also click the 
Buy Album button.
The iTunes Store may prompt you to log in to your account after you click 
the Buy button (unless you just recently logged in). It then displays a 
warning dialog to make sure that you want to buy the item, and you can then 
complete your purchase by clicking the Buy button, or cancel. After click-
ing the Buy button, iTunes downloads the item and, after downloading, it 
appears in your iTunes library. You can continue buying items while down-
loading, and since you’ve already logged in, the iTunes Store complies imme-
diately without asking again for a password. The iTunes Store keeps track of 
your purchases over a 24-hour period and charges you for a total sum rather 
than for each single purchase.
You can see the list of all the items that you purchased by selecting the 
Purchased playlist under the iTunes Store option in the Source pane. The List 
pane changes to show the items you purchased.
 
Each time you buy content, you get an e-mail from the iTunes Store with the 
purchase information. It’s nice to know right away what you bought.
Changing other iTunes Store preferences
You can change iTunes Store preference settings by choosing iTunes➪
Preferences on the Mac or by choosing Edit➪Preferences in Windows. In 
the Preferences window, click the Store button. The Store Preferences pane 
appears as shown in Figure 7-8. You can set the following features:
 
✓ Automatically check for available downloads from the iTunes Store, 
such as downloads that were not completed and new episodes for a 
podcast subscription.
 
✓ Automatically download prepurchased content, such as an iTunes Pass 
for TV show episodes. As the episodes become available, iTunes automati-
cally downloads them.
 
✓ Automatically download missing album artwork from the iTunes Store for 
albums and songs you’ve imported from other sources (such as audio CDs).
 
✓ Use the full iTunes window for the iTunes Store (rather than just the List 
pane) so that you can see more of the store choices.

Resuming interrupted downloads
All sales are final; you can’t return the digital merchandise. However, the 
download must be successful — you have to receive it all — before the 
iTunes Store charges you for the purchase. If for any reason the download is 
interrupted or fails to complete, your order remains active until you connect 
to the iTunes Store again.
iTunes remembers to continue the download when you return to iTunes and 
connect to the Internet. If, for some reason, the download doesn’t continue, 
choose Store➪Check for Available Downloads to continue the interrupted 
download. You can also use this command to check for any purchased 
content that hasn’t downloaded yet.
While downloading from the iTunes Store, you can select Downloads in the 
Store section of the Source pane, as shown in Figure 7-9, to see the progress 
of your downloads, and to pause and resume (or cancel) any particular 
download. You can also prioritize the order of downloading by dragging 
items into a different order.
For the impatient viewers, the iTunes Store lets you start watching a video or 
movie before it finishes downloading. Click Downloads in the Store section of 
the Source pane as you’re downloading and double-click the item to watch it. 
The download continues as you watch from the beginning.
 
If your computer’s hard drive crashes and you lose your information, you also 
lose all your digital content — you have to purchase and download that 
content again. However, you can mitigate this kind of disaster by backing up 
your iTunes library. You can also burn your songs, including purchased songs, 
to an audio CD, an MP3 CD, or a data DVD, as I describe in Chapter 15.

Redeeming gift certificates 
and prepaid cards
If you’re the fortunate recipient of an iTunes Store gift certificate, all you need 
to do is use iTunes to go to the iTunes Store and set up a new account — if 
you don’t already have one. Recipients of gift certificates can set up new 
accounts without having to provide a credit card number. As a recipient of a 
gift, you can simply choose None for the credit card option and use the gift 
certificate as the sole payment method.
You can receive gift certificates on paper (delivered by snail mail) or by 
e-mail. You can also receive a prepaid card with a fixed balance. To redeem 
a certificate, go to the Quick Links column on the right side of the iTunes 
Store home page and click the Redeem link to go to the Redeem page. In the 
Redeem Code section of the Redeem page, type the number printed on the 
certificate or supplied in the e-mail and click the Redeem button to credit 
your account. If you haven’t signed in to your account yet or you have no 
account, iTunes displays the sign-in dialog; for information about setting up 
an account, see the “Setting Up an Account” section, earlier in this chapter.

120
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup   
If you use Apple’s Mail program or access your MobileMe (formerly .Mac) 
e-mail through the Safari Web browser, you can redeem a gift certificate that 
was sent by e-mail by clicking the Redeem Now button at the bottom of the 
e-mail message. This button launches iTunes with the iTunes Store option 
selected in the Source pane and displays the Redeem page with the certificate’s 
number automatically filled in. Click the Redeem button to credit your 
account.
 
The balance of your gift certificate (how much you have left to spend) appears 
right next to your account name in the iTunes Store window and is updated as 
you make purchases.
Appearing at the App Store
Got an iPod touch or iPhone? You can get loads of free and commercial 
applications (called apps) that run on your iPod touch or iPhone just like 
the built-in Maps and Weather apps. Click the App Store tab in the black bar 
at the top of the iTunes Store page (refer to Figure 7-1) to find the apps. The 
App Store page appears, as shown in Figure 7-10.
 
Figure 7-10: 
iPod touch 
and iPhone

121
 Chapter 7: Shopping at the iTunes Store
Click an app’s icon to go to the information page for that app, which may 
also contain reviews and a slide show depicting the app in all its glory. The 
information page offers the Buy App button (to purchase and download a 
commercial app) or the Get App button (to download a free app). Click the 
Buy App or Get App button to download the app to your iTunes library.
Downloaded apps appear in the Applications section of your iTunes 
library — click Applications in the Library section of the Source pane 
to see their icons. If you don’t see Applications in the Source pane, choose 
iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows), click the 
General tab at the top of the Preferences window, select the Applications 
option from the list of options for the Show heading, and click the OK 
button. The Applications item then appears in the Source pane in the 
Library section.
When an app you downloaded is updated, iTunes informs you — the message 
Update Available appears at the bottom of the Applications section with 
an arrow link that takes you to the My Apps Update page in the iTunes Store, 
with icons of the apps to update. Click the Get Update button next to each 
app to download the update, which automatically replaces the previous 
version of the app.
The iTunes Store also offers colorful “click wheel” games to play on your iPod 
classic or nano (or seventh-, sixth-, or fifth-generation iPods) — all kinds of 
games, from Mini Golf, Monopoly, and Mahjong to the classic Tetris and Cubis 2. 
You can even play the wildly popular Japanese puzzle Sudoku. The games play 
on iPods that can play videos — not in iTunes itself. However, you can see a pre-
view of the game while browsing the iTunes Store.
To find the iPod games, click the the App Store tab in the black bar at the 
top of the iTunes Store page, and then click the down-arrow button next 
to the App Store tab to see the pop-up menu; choose iPod Games from 
the menu. iTunes displays the iPod Games page with thumbnail icons 
for each game. Click the game’s icon to go to the game’s page. Click the 
Preview button on the game’s page to see a preview of the game. Use 
the iTunes Play button, just as you would for a song, to play the game pre-
view. At any time, click the Close Preview button to return to the game’s 
page.

122
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup   
Shopping with your iPod touch or iPhone
The music and podcast sections of the iTunes Store, and the entire App Store, 
are both available right at your fingertips on your iPod touch or iPhone. You 
can search for, browse, and preview songs and albums; make purchases; and 
download music and apps directly to your iPod touch or iPhone. Whatever 
you buy on your iPod touch or iPhone is automatically copied to your iTunes 
library the next time you synchronize it with your computer, as I describe in 
Chapter 9.
Be sure to use iTunes to set up an iTunes Store account first if you don’t 
already have one, and then sign in to the account, as I describe in the section 
“Setting Up an Account,” earlier in this chapter — and you’ll need to 
remember your password. Then sync your iPod touch or iPhone to iTunes 
as I describe in Chapter 9. After syncing your iPod touch or iPhone so that 
it has your account information, you shouldn’t have to bother with it again, 
and you’ll be able to download items from the iTunes Store and App Store on 
your iPod touch or iPhone from then on.
To use the iTunes Store and App Store on your iPod touch, you must first 
join a Wi-Fi network that’s connected to the Internet (see Chapter 4 for 
details). As for the iPhone, you can use either the 3G network or Wi-Fi. Be 
sure you have an iTunes Store account set up (see the section “Setting Up an 
Account,” earlier in this chapter).
Browsing and downloading songs
To go to the iTunes Store on an iPod touch or iPhone, tap the iTunes icon 
on the Home screen. The store screen appears with Music, Videos, Podcasts 
(see the next section), Search, and More icons along the bottom, as shown in 
Figure 7-11 (left side). Tap any song to hear a preview.
Here’s the lowdown on the icons:
 
✓ Tap the Music icon to see featured music, as shown in Figure 7-11 (left 
side). The screen displays New Releases, Top Tens, and Genres buttons 
along the top. To search through genres, tap the Genres button and 
choose a genre.

the store.
To buy a song, tap the price and then tap Buy Now. Enter your password, and 
tap OK.
Purchased songs are added to a Purchased playlist on your iPod touch or 
iPhone, and they’re included in your Purchased playlist in iTunes. iTunes 
automatically syncs songs and albums purchased on your iPod touch or 
iPhone to your iTunes library when you connect it to your computer so that 
you have a backup if you manage to delete purchases from the iPod touch or 
iPhone.
Some albums offer bonus content, such as liner notes, which are downloaded 
to your iTunes library on your computer, but not to your iPod touch or 

124
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup   
iPhone. An alert appears on your iPod touch or iPhone if you’ve previously 
purchased one or more songs from an album. Tap Buy if you want to purchase 
the entire album, or tap Cancel if you want to buy the remaining songs on the 
album individually.
 
If you lose your network connection or turn off your iPod touch or iPhone 
while downloading, the download pauses and then resumes when you 
reestablish connection with the Internet. If you go back to your computer, 
iTunes can complete the download operation to your iTunes library. To make 
sure that you received all your downloads from purchases on your iPod touch 
or iPhone, use iTunes on your computer and choose Store➪Check for 
Available Downloads.
Browsing and downloading podcasts
If you’ll recall, podcasts are audio and video episodes designed to be 
downloaded to your iPod touch or iPhone. Most podcast episodes are free. 
On the store screen, tap the Podcasts icon to see podcasts available for 
downloading from the iTunes Store directly to your iPod touch or iPhone.
You can also view categories of podcasts by tapping Categories in the 
upper-right corner of the Podcasts screen, or you can see the top ten in each 
category by tapping Top Tens at the top of the screen.
After selecting a podcast, a list of episodes appears. Tap the Free button 
(or Buy button for paid podcasts) next to an episode, enter your password, 
and then tap OK to start downloading the podcast episode. To return to the 
iTunes Store music screen, tap Music in the upper-left corner of the screen 
that lists the podcast episodes.
Browsing and downloading apps
To use the App Store, tap the App Store icon on the Home screen. The Store 
screen appears with Featured, Categories, Top 25, Search, and Updates icons 
along the bottom (refer to Figure 7-11, right side). The following list tells you 
what’s what when it comes to the icons:
 
✓ Tap the Featured icon and then tap the What’s Hot button at the top to 
see the most popular apps based on downloads, or tap the New button 
to see featured new apps.
 
✓ To browse by category, tap the Categories icon on the bottom menu 
and then tap a category, such as Games, to see a list of all games by 
popularity.

125

✓ Tap the Top 25 icon on the bottom menu and then tap Top Paid to see 
the top 25 paid apps by popularity, or tap Top Free to see the top 25 free 
apps.
 
✓ Tap the Search icon to search the store, and tap the entry field to bring 
up the on-screen keyboard. (See Chapter 3 for details on how to type.) 
Type the search term and tap Search to search the store. Suggestions 
pop up right away; for example, if you search for Tony in the App Store, 
my app “Tony’s Tips for iPhone Users Manual” appears in the list of 
suggestions.
 
✓ Tap the Updates icon . . . wait, forget I said that. I cover that icon in the 
next section, so check that out if you want details.
To view information and to purchase and download an app, tap the app in 
the list that appears after tapping the Featured, Categories, Top 25, or Search 
icon. You can then scroll the display to see more information about the app, 
or you can tap the Featured, Categories, Top 25, or Search icon in the upper-
left corner to return to those lists.
 
You can also tap the Tell a Friend button at the bottom of the app’s information 
screen to send the app information in an e-mail. See Chapter 20 for details on 
how to send the e-mail.
To download an app, tap the Price button (for a paid app) or Free button (for

and then enter your password and tap OK.
Your iPod touch or iPhone displays the Home screen with the icon for the 
new app as it loads. As soon as the Loading message is replaced by the name 
of the app, the app is ready to be tapped.
Updating apps you’ve downloaded
The App Store on your iPod touch or iPhone notifies you if any of your 
apps have been updated — a number appears in the Updates icon along the 
bottom row of icons. You should update an app when an update is available 
because updates fix bugs and introduce new features you may want.
Tap the Updates icon to see the list of updated apps. To update an app, 
tap the app in the list to see the app’s information screen and then tap the 
Update button. The Update button changes to the Install button. Tap Install 
and then enter your password and tap OK.
The update replaces the previous version of the app as it loads into your 
iPod touch or iPhone. As soon as the Loading message is replaced by the 
name of the app, the icon is ready to be tapped.

Sharing iTunes Purchases 
in Your Home Network
A family member in your home just bought an album from the iTunes Store 
that you would like to have in your computer’s iTunes library as well, so that 
you can sync it to your iPod. Rather than painstakingly copying the music 
files from computer to computer or changing your sync options, you can 
use the Home Sharing feature to share the purchased content. With Home 
Sharing, you can browse the iTunes libraries of up to five authorized comput-
ers in your house, copy over from those libraries anything you want, and 
automatically add new purchases made on any of the computers to your own 
library.
Home Sharing is linked to a single iTunes Store account, which is perfect if 
you use one account for family purchases. In order to share purchased con-
tent that is copy-protected, such as movies and TV shows, you must first 
choose Store➪Authorize Computer, and enter your account and password 
for each computer’s iTunes library whose purchased content you want to 
share (up to five computers can be authorized at once). You can share non-
protected content without authorizing the computers. (To deauthorize a 
computer, choose Store➪Deauthorize Computer.)
 
To learn more about managing your iTunes account, including authorizing and 
deauthorizing computers, visit this book’s companion Web site.
To turn on Home Sharing, click Home Sharing in the Source pane, and sign 
into your iTunes account. Do the same for each computer’s iTunes library 
that you want to share.
After signing into your account in Home Sharing, and after signing into your 
account on another computer’s iTunes library in Home Sharing, the other 
computer’s library appears below Home Sharing in the Shared section the 
Source pane, as shown in Figure 7-12. Click the other computer’s shared 
library (“Tony’s PC Library” in Figure 7-12) to view the other library in the 
List pane.
You can show all the items in the shared library, or just the items that are not 
in your library so that you can see what you’re missing — choose All Items 
or Items Not in My Library from the Show pop-up menu in the bottom left 
corner of the List pane (refer to Figure 7-12). 
To import an item from the shared library to your library, select the item 
in the shared library, and then click the Import button in the bottom right 
corner of the List pane (refer to Figure 7-12). You can also drag items, albums, 
and artists directly over the Library section of the Source pane to copy them 
to your library.

You can set up Home Sharing so that purchases made with the shared iTunes 
library on other computers are automatically copied to your iTunes library. 
Click Settings in the lower right corner of the List pane (refer to Figure 7-12), 
and then select the content categories for automatic transfer: Music, Movies, 
TV Shows, Audiobooks, and Applications.
To stop sharing a library on another computer, click the Eject button next to 
the library name (“Tony’s PC Library” in Figure 7-12), or choose Controls➪

Bringing Content into iTunes
In This Chapter
▶ Setting your music importing preferences
▶ Ripping music from CDs and adding music files
▶ Subscribing to podcasts on Web sites
▶ Adding video files to your library
I
f iPods and iPhones were spaceships, iTunes would be the space station 
they dock with to get supplies. iTunes is the central repository of all 
content. You can bring your music from audio CDs into iTunes to preserve 
the music forever in digital format and play the music on your iPod, iPhone, 
or Apple TV without having to fumble for discs. You can import sound and 
video files downloaded from the Internet into iTunes to keep all your content 
organized and to take it with you in your iPod or iPhone.
In this chapter, I show you not only how to import music from audio CDs, 
but also how to import music, videos, and podcasts from Web sites into your 
iTunes library.
Adding Music
Bringing music tracks from a CD into iTunes is called ripping a CD (audio 
programmers do have a sense of humor). Ripping, in technical terms, is 
extracting the song’s digital information from an audio CD. In common terms, 
ripping includes compressing the song’s digital information and encoding it 
in a particular sound file format (such as AAC or MP3, explained later in this 
chapter).
How easy is it to rip a CD? Pop an audio CD into your CD-ROM/DVD drive, 
and unless you’ve changed your preferences (as described in the following 
section), you’ll see the message in Figure 8-1. Click the Yes button to rip your 
CD into iTunes and, without further ado, your CD tracks are absorbed into 
your iTunes library.

130
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
Figure 8-1: 
Click Yes to 
rip your CD 
into iTunes 
automati-
cally or No 
to set 
preferences 
or edit song 
information 
first.
 
Before ripping, you may want to edit the song information, as I describe in 
Chapter 12 or set the Gapless Album option, which I describe in “Don’t fall 
into the gaps” in this chapter. If this is your first time ripping a CD, you may 
want to set your import settings more precisely to improve sound quality or 
to reduce the amount of disk space occupied by songs. If you want to edit the 
song information, set the Gapless Album option, or change import settings, 
click the No button to stop the import operation and make your changes 
first. Then start the rip, as I describe in the section “Ripping music from 
CDs,” later in this chapter.
The import settings affect sound quality as well as hard drive space on both 
the computer and the iPod or iPhone, and compatibility with other types 
of players and computers. After setting them, your import settings stay the 
same until you change them again. Read on to find out about changing your 
import preferences and settings before ripping.
Changing import preferences and settings
To change your import preferences and settings or change the way iTunes 
rips — whether it rips right away, asks first, or automatically ejects 
afterward — follow these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences➪General on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪
General in Windows.
 
 The iTunes Preferences dialog opens, showing the General preferences, 
including the When You Insert a CD pop-up menu and the Import 
Settings button.

131
 Chapter 8: Bringing Content into iTunes
 
2. Choose what action iTunes should take for the When You Insert a CD 
option in the General preferences.
 
 Choose one of the following actions on the pop-up menu for when you 
insert an audio CD, as shown in Figure 8-2:
 
• Show CD: iTunes does nothing else. This setting is ideal if you 
regularly edit the song information first, as I describe in Chapter 12.
 
• Begin Playing: See Chapter 6 for details on playing CDs.
 
• Ask to Import CD: iTunes displays the dialog that asks whether you 
want to import the CD (refer to Figure 8-1).
 
• Import CD: iTunes uses the current import settings and automatically 
imports the CD. Don’t use this setting unless you’re sure that the 
import settings are already set to your liking.
 
• Import CD and Eject: iTunes automatically imports and then ejects 
the CD, making way for the next one. This option is useful for 
importing a batch of CDs. Don’t use this setting unless you’re sure 
that the import settings are already set to your liking.

3. Select the Automatically Retrieve CD Track Names from Internet 
check box.
 
 This option is selected by default, but make sure that the box is checked. 
iTunes automatically grabs the song titles, artist names, album titles, 
and so on directly from the Internet database of songs, as I describe in 
Chapter 12. If you don’t want to use an Internet connection at this time, 
you can grab this information later, as I explain in Chapter 12.
 
4. Click the Import Settings button in the General preferences.
 
 The Import Settings dialog appears, as shown in Figure 8-3.
 
5. Make your changes, guided by my suggestions that follow, and then 
click the OK button.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Change 
your import 
settings for 
ripping CDs.
 
The Import Settings dialog offers the following choices:
 
✓ Import Using: Set this pop-up menu to choose the import encoder. This 
choice is perhaps the most important, and I describe it in more detail 
later in this section.
 
✓ Setting: This offers different settings depending on your choice of 
encoder. For example, in Figure 8-4, the AAC Encoder is already selected, 
and I’m in the process of choosing the iTunes Plus setting, which is the 
quality setting for music available in the iTunes Store. Set this pop-up 
menu to the iTunes Plus or High Quality setting for most music, or 
choose Custom to choose a custom setting. The Spoken Podcast setting 
is for lower-quality voice recordings. See below for more information 
about encoders and settings and how they affect quality and file size.
 
✓ Use Error Correction When Reading Audio CDs: Although you’ll reduce 
importing speed, select this check box to use error correction if you 
have problems with audio quality or if the CD skips. (Not every skipping 
CD can be imported even with error correction, but it might help.)

133
 Chapter 8: Bringing Content into iTunes
 
Figure 8-4: 
Change the 
quality 
setting 
for the 
encoder you 
chose for 
importing.
 
For a quick and pain-free ripping session, choose from among the following 
encoders in the Import Using pop-up menu, based on how you plan to use the 
music:
 
✓ AAC Encoder: I recommend AAC for almost all music. (However, AIFF, 
Apple Lossless, or WAV is better if you plan to burn another audio CD 
at the highest quality with the songs you ripped, and MP3 is the only 
format to use for MP3 CDs and other MP3 players.) For music, choose 
the High Quality or iTunes Plus settings from the Setting pop-up menu.
 
✓ AIFF Encoder: Use AIFF if you plan to burn the song to an audio CD 
using a Mac (use WAV for Windows), or use it with a DVD project. AIFF 
offers the highest possible quality, but it takes up a lot of space (about 
10MB per minute). Choose the Automatic option from the Setting pop-up 
menu for best results. Don’t use the AIFF format for songs that you 
intend to transfer to your iPod or iPhone, or to an MP3 CD; convert them 
first to AAC or MP3.
 
 You can rip a CD as many times as you want, and use a different encoder 
each time, as long as you modify the album name or song title to identify 
each version. For example, you might rip Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club 
Band with the AAC encoder for use in your iPod or iPhone. You might 
then rip it again after changing the encoder to the higher-quality Apple 
Lossless or AIFF encoder, using a different album name (such as Sgt. 
Pepper-2), for burning onto an audio CD. After burning the CD, you can 
delete Sgt. Pepper-2 to reclaim the hard drive space.
 
✓ Apple Lossless Encoder: Use the Apple Lossless encoder for songs that 
you intend to burn onto audio CDs as well as for playing on an iPod or 
iPhone. The files are just small enough (about 60–70 percent of the size 
of the AIFF versions) that they don’t hiccup on playback.
 
✓ MP3 Encoder: Use the MP3 format for songs that you intend to burn 
on MP3 CDs or that you intend to use with MP3 players or your iPod 
or iPhone — it’s universally supported. If you use MP3, I recommend 
choosing the Higher Quality option from the Setting pop-up menu.

134
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
✓ WAV Encoder: WAV is the high-quality sound format that’s used on 
PCs (like AIFF on Macs), but it also takes up a lot of space (about 10MB 
per minute). Use WAV if you plan on burning the song to an audio CD 
or using WAV with PCs. Choose the Automatic option from the Setting 
pop-up menu for best results. Don’t use WAV for songs that you intend to 
transfer to your iPod or to an MP3 CD; use MP3 instead.
 
To find out more about audio encoding formats, how to adjust custom settings 
to reduce space and increase audio quality, and how to convert songs from 
one format to another (and what problems to look out for when doing so), 
visit this book’s companion Web site.
Don’t fall into the gaps
Some CDs — particularly live concert albums, classical albums, rock operas 
(such as The Who’s Tommy), and theme albums (such as Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely 
Hearts Club Band by The Beatles) — are meant to be played straight through, 
with no fading between the songs.
Fortunately, you can turn on the Gapless Album option for multiple songs or 
for an entire album. With the Gapless Album option set in iTunes, songs play 
seamlessly one to the next. You can also play these songs seamlessly on your 
iPod or iPhone (including seventh-, sixth-, and fifth-generation models).
To turn on the Gapless Album option for an entire CD before importing it, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the No button if the import dialog appears (to postpone importing).
 
2. Select the CD title in the Source pane.
 
 The CD title appears in the Source pane under Devices.
 
3. Choose File➪Get Info.
 
 The CD Info dialog opens, as shown in Figure 8-5.
 
4. Select the Part of a Gapless Album check box and then click the OK 
button.

To turn on the Gapless Album option for multiple songs on the CD but not the 
entire CD, follow these steps:
 
1. Follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding list.
 
2. Select the songs in the List pane.
 
 From the album, select the songs that you want to play continuously 
(such as the first two songs of Sgt. Pepper).
 
 To select multiple songs, click the first one, press and hold Ô on a Mac 
or Ctrl in Windows, and click each subsequent song. To select consecutive 
songs, click the first one, hold down the Shift key, and click the last one.
 
3. Choose File➪Get Info and then click the Yes button in the warning 
dialog about editing multiple items.
 
 The Multiple Item Information dialog opens.
 
4. Click the Options tab to see the Options pane, as shown in Figure 8-6.
 
5. Select Yes from the Gapless Album pop-up menu.
 
 After choosing Yes on the pop-up menu, a check mark appears next to 
the Gapless Album option to indicate that it has changed.
 
6. Click the OK button to close the Multiple Item Information dialog and 
update the options for the selected songs.
 
For older iPod models, or as an alternative to using the Gapless Album option, 
you can use the Join Tracks option when ripping a CD to join the tracks in 
your iTunes library so that they play seamlessly on an iPod or iPhone. To join 
tracks, select the tracks and choose Advanced➪Join CD Tracks. You can join 
tracks only when ripping a CD, not afterward.

Ripping music from CDs
After changing your import settings and preferences, you’re ready to rip. To 
rip a CD, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert an audio CD into your computer.
 
 The songs appear in the List pane as generic, unnamed tracks at first. 
If your computer is connected to the Internet and you’ve turned on the 
option to automatically retrieve song information from the Internet and 
the CD is in the Gracenote CDDB database (described in Chapter 12), 
iTunes automatically retrieves the track information.
 
 A dialog appears asking whether you want to import the CD, with Yes 
and No buttons.
 
2. Click Yes to import (and skip to Step 5) or No to set options first.
 
 Click the No button to set preferences and import settings as described 
in the previous section, to set songs to be skipped, or if you see 
unnamed tracks rather than the proper track, artist, and album names in 
the List pane. If all you need to change are the import settings, click the 
Import Settings button in the lower right corner of the List pane.
 
 If the first attempt at retrieving song information doesn’t work and 
you see unnamed tracks, check your connection to the Internet first. If 
everything is fine with your connection, stop the importing operation 
and then choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names to try again to get the 
track information. If you don’t want to connect to the Internet or if your 
CD isn’t recognized by the Gracenote database, you can type in the track 
information yourself (see Chapter 12).

137
 Chapter 8: Bringing Content into iTunes
 
3. (Optional) Deselect the check boxes next to any songs on the CD that 
you don’t want to import.
 
 iTunes imports only the songs that have check marks next to them; 
when you remove the check mark next to a song in the List pane, iTunes 
skips that song.
 
 Be sure to set your import settings and the Gapless Album option to 
your liking before actually ripping the CD.
 
4. Click the Import CD button.
 
 The Import CD button appears next to the Import Settings button in the 
lower-right corner of the List pane. The status display shows the prog-
ress of the operation. To cancel, click the small x next to the progress 
bar in the status display.
 
 iTunes displays an orange, animated waveform icon next to the song 
that it’s importing. When iTunes finishes importing each song, it 
replaces the waveform icon with a check mark, as shown in Figure 8-7. 
(On a color monitor, the check mark is green.) iTunes chimes when it 
finishes the import list.
 
Figure 8-7: 
iTunes 
shows a 
check mark 
to indicate 
that it’s done 
ripping the 
song.
 
 
5. When all the songs are imported, eject the CD by clicking the Eject 
button next to the disc name in the Devices section of the Source 
pane.
 
 You can also choose Controls➪Eject Disc to eject the disc. Mac users can 
press the Eject button on the upper-right corner of the Mac keyboard.

138
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
Adding music files
If you already have music or other audio files — MP3, AAC, AIFF, or WAV 
files — that you downloaded or copied to your hard drive, you can simply 
drag them over the Library section of the Source pane, or the List pane, of 
the iTunes window to bring them into your library. If you drag a folder or disk 
icon, all the audio files that it contains are added to your iTunes library (and 
if you drag it into the Playlists section of the Source pane, a playlist is 
created — see Chapter 14 for details). You can also choose File➪Add to 
Library on a Mac, or File➪Add File to Library and File➪Add Folder to Library 
on a Windows PC, as an alternative to dragging.
 
When you add an audio file to your iTunes library, a copy is placed inside the 
iTunes Media folder without changing or deleting the original file; that is, as 
long as you have your iTunes preferences set for Copy Files to iTunes Media 
Folder When Adding to Library. (This is the default setting, which you can 
find on the Advanced tab of the iTunes Preferences dialog.) See Chapter 15 for 
details on storing music in your iTunes Media folder.
If you have files in another folder or on another hard drive and you want to add 
them to the iTunes library without copying the files to the iTunes Media folder, 
you can copy a link to the original files without copying the files. To copy only 
links to song files and not copy the actual files when you add songs, you can 
turn off the default copy files option by doing the following:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
2. Click the Advanced tab in the iTunes Preferences dialog.
 
3. Turn off the Copy Files to iTunes Media Folder When Adding to 
Library setting.
You can check out the contents of your iTunes Media folder by using the Finder 
on a Mac or Windows Explorer on a Windows PC, as I describe in detail in 
Chapter 15.
 
MP3 CDs are easy to add because they’re essentially data CDs. Simply insert 
them into your CD-ROM drive, open the CD in the Finder, and drag and drop 
the MP3 audio files into the iTunes window — no need to rip, in other words. 
Downloaded audio files are even easier — just drag and drop the files into 
iTunes. If you drag a folder or CD icon, all the audio files it contains are added 
to your iTunes library.

139
 Chapter 8: Bringing Content into iTunes
Adding Podcasts
A podcast can be anything from a single song or video to a radio or TV 
show — an audio podcast is an MP3 audio file, and a video podcast is a video 
file (see “Adding Videos” in this chapter for technical details). 
You can add podcasts to your iTunes library by subscribing to them in 
the iTunes Store (as I describe in breathtaking detail in Chapter 7) or by 
subscribing to them directly from Web sites that host them. Similar to a 
recording of a radio broadcast, you can save and play a podcast at your 
convenience — both in iTunes on your computer and on your iPod, iPhone, 
and Apple TV.
The podcast producer uses Really Simple Syndication (RSS) technology — 
the same technology used to distribute blogs and news feeds across the 
Internet — to publish the podcast. RSS feeds are typically linked to an RSS or 
an eXtensible Markup Language (XML; the language of RSS) button. With a 
feed reader, aggregator application, or browser plug-in, you can automatically 
check RSS-enabled Web pages and display updated stories and podcasts. RSS 
version 2, the most popular version for podcasting, is supported directly by 
some Web browsers, including Apple’s Safari for Mac OS X and Windows.
With iTunes, you can play a podcast, incorporate it into playlists, make 
copies, and burn it onto CD as much as you like.
Subscribing to podcasts
The Podcasts section of the iTunes Store offers access to many thousands 
of podcasts, but more than a million podcasts exist, many of which are 
available only on their respective Web sites. The iTunes Store makes it easy 
to subscribe to podcasts, so check there first — turn to Chapter 7 to see how 
to find and subscribe to podcasts in the iTunes Store.
By subscribing, I mean simply listing the podcast in your iTunes Podcasts 
pane so that new episodes are downloaded automatically. It’s like a magazine 
subscription that’s updated with a new issue every month or so. You don’t 
have to register or fill out any form. You don’t have to provide an e-mail 
address or any other information. Your copy of iTunes automatically finds 
new podcast episodes and downloads them to your computer.

140
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
The easiest way to subscribe to a podcast is through the iTunes Store. 
However, if you can’t find a podcast in the store and you know how to find 
its Web site, open your browser and go to that Web site. Some Web sites also 
offer an iTunes button to click to go directly to the iTunes Store to subscribe 
to the podcast.
If you don’t see an iTunes button, you can still subscribe to a podcast directly 
from iTunes by grabbing information from its Web site first. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. In your browser, Control-click (Mac) or right-click (Windows or Mac) 
the podcast’s RSS2 link on the Web page.
 
 Look for the RSS version 2 link on the Web page.
 
2. Copy the podcast’s RSS2 link:
 
• Safari: Choose Copy Link.
 
• Firefox or Internet Explorer: Choose Copy Link Location.
 
3. In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Subscribe to Podcast.
 
 The Subscribe to Podcast dialog opens.
 
4. Paste the RSS2 link into the dialog that appears by choosing 
Edit➪Paste and then click the OK button.
 
 As an alternative, you can also press Ô-V on a Mac or Ctrl-V in Windows.
 
 When you paste it, the link should look something like this:
http://www.rockument.com/blog/?feed=RSS2
 
 iTunes downloads the podcast to your computer and switches to the 
Podcasts selection in the Source pane.
 
5. Click the i icon to see information about the podcast.
 
 You can click the i icon on the far-right podcast listing margin to display 
separate information about the podcast’s newest episode.
 
6. Select the podcast and then click the Play button.
 
 You can now play the podcast just like a song or video in your iTunes 
library. You can use the iTunes playback controls to fast-forward, 
rewind, or play the podcast from any point. The blue dot next to a 
podcast means that you haven’t played it yet. As soon as you start 
listening to or watching a podcast, the dot disappears. You can even 
drag podcast episodes into a playlist, as I describe in Chapter 14, and 
then burn that playlist onto a CD, as I describe in Chapter 15.

141
 Chapter 8: Bringing Content into iTunes
If the podcaster embedded a photo in an audio podcast file or included a link 
to a video from the file, the photo or video content appears in the Artwork 
pane.
Updating podcasts
Many podcast feeds provide new material on a regular schedule. iTunes 
can check these feeds automatically and update your library with new 
podcast episodes. You can, for example, schedule iTunes to check for 
new podcast episodes — such as news, weather, traffic reports, and morning 
talk shows — before you wake up and automatically update your iPod or 
iPhone. When you get up, you have new podcast episodes to listen to in 
your iPod or iPhone.
To check for updates manually, select Podcasts in the Library section of the 
Source pane and then click the Refresh button in the lower-right corner of the 
Podcasts pane, which appears if podcasts need to be updated. All subscribed 
podcast feeds are updated immediately when you click Refresh, and iTunes 
downloads the most recent (or all) episodes, depending on how you set your 
podcasts preferences to schedule podcast updates.
Scheduling podcast updates
To change your podcast settings so that iTunes can check for new podcasts 
automatically, click the Settings button at the bottom of the Podcasts pane to 
display the Podcast Settings dialog, as shown in Figure 8-8.
 
Figure 8-8: 
Set 
iTunes to 
automatically 
check for, 
download, 
and keep 
podcast 
episodes.
 

142
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
You can change the settings for each podcast separately by choosing the 
podcast in the Settings For pop-up menu. The settings are as follows:
 
✓ Check for New Episodes: Choose to check for podcasts every hour, day, 
week, or manually — whenever you want.
 
✓ Settings For: Choose which podcast in your iTunes library you are 
scheduling updates for, or choose Podcast Defaults to apply these 
settings to all podcasts in your library.
 
✓ When New Episodes Are Available: You can download the most recent 
one (useful for news podcasts), download all episodes (useful for 
podcasts you might want to keep), or nothing so that you can use the 
Refresh button to update manually as you need.
 
✓ Episodes to Keep: Choose to keep all episodes, all unplayed episodes, 
the most recent episodes, or previous episodes (refer to Figure 8-8).
 
 Keeping unplayed episodes is a useful way to organize your news 
podcasts. If you’ve played an episode (or a portion of it), you likely don’t 
need it anymore, but you probably do want to keep the ones you haven’t 
played yet. With this setting, iTunes automatically deletes the ones 
you’ve played.
 
 If you copy podcasts automatically when synchronizing your iPod or 
iPhone, as I describe in Chapter 9, don’t set the Episodes to Keep pop-up 
to All Unplayed Episodes — use All Episodes instead. This is why: If 
you listen to part of a podcast episode on your iPod or iPhone and then 
synchronize your iPod or iPhone, the podcast episode disappears from 
iTunes (because it is no longer unplayed). But don’t worry; the episodes 
are still out there on the Internet. You can always recover them by 
choosing Download All for the When New Episodes Are Available option.
Adding Videos
Besides purchasing and downloading videos from the iTunes Store, as I 
describe in nearly orgasmic detail in Chapter 7, you can also download video 
files (files that end in .mov, .m4v, or .mp4) from the Internet, or copy them 
from other computers and bring them into iTunes. From iTunes, you can sync 
them to your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV after converting them into a format 
that looks best for those devices.

To convert a video for use with an iPod or iPhone, select the video (see 
Chapter 11 for browsing instructions) and choose Advanced➪Create

You can drag a video file into iTunes just like an audio file. Drag each video 
file from the Mac Finder or Windows Desktop to the Library section of the 
Source pane, or directly to a playlist in the Playlists section of the Source 
pane, or to the List pane. The video files that you import into iTunes show 
up in the Movies section of your iTunes library — click Movies in the Library 
section of the Source pane to see them.
Video files are organized in folders and stored in the iTunes Media library on 
your hard drive just like audio files. You can find the video file’s location 
on your hard drive and its type by selecting the video and choosing File➪Get 
Info.

Chapter 9
Into the Sync with iTunes
In This Chapter
▶ Synchronizing your iPod or iPhone with your iTunes library
▶ Choosing what to sync and what not to sync
▶ Copying content directly to, or deleting from, your iPod or iPhone
i
Tunes is the all-knowing, all-powerful synchronizer, the software you use 
to put content and your iTunes Store account information on your iPod or 
iPhone.
Synchronizing your iPod or iPhone with iTunes means keeping it up to date 
with all or part of your iTunes library — matching it song for song, movie for 
movie, and so on. The sync operation also keeps an iPod touch or iPhone up 
to date with your iTunes Store account information so that you can download 
items from the iTunes Store or App Store directly to your iPod touch or iPhone.
If you make changes in iTunes after syncing the iPod or iPhone, those changes 
are automatically made in the iPod or iPhone when you sync again. Your iPod 
or iPhone mirrors all the content of your iTunes library, or as much of the 
content as will fit — and iTunes can make assumptions if the entire library 
won’t fit, or give you options to be more selective, as I describe in this chapter.
 
You also use iTunes to sync Apple TV, which lets you play your iTunes library 
content on an HDTV audio-video system. To find out more about Apple TV, 
visit this book’s companion Web site.
When you first set up your iPod or iPhone, you can choose the option to sync 
your entire iTunes library automatically. From that point on, your iPod or iPhone 
synchronizes with your entire library automatically, right after you connect it to 
your computer. (See Chapter 2 for details on setting up your iPod or iPhone.)
The full, everything-but-the-kitchen-sync approach works well if your combined 
iTunes library and photo library are small enough to fit in their entirety 
on your iPod or iPhone. For example, if your iTunes and photo libraries 
combined are less than 29GB and you have a 32GB iPod touch, sync 
everything. (You can see the size of your iTunes library in GB, or gigabytes, 

146
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
at the bottom of the iTunes window in the center.) Syncing everything copies 
your entire library, and it’s just as fast as copying individual items (if not 
faster) because you don’t have to select the items to copy.
If your iTunes library has more content than your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV 
can hold, you can make decisions about which parts to sync. You can select 
options to synchronize music, TV shows, movies, and so on. For example, 
you can copy all your songs and audio books, but only some of your TV 
shows, none of your movies, and only the podcasts you haven’t heard yet.
This chapter also describes how to copy songs, videos, podcasts, and audio 
books directly to your iPod or iPhone using the manual method. You can 
even combine automatic syncing with manual methods to build your iPod or 
iPhone library as you see fit.
If you store photos in an iPhoto library (on a Mac) or in a program (such as 
Adobe Photoshop Album in Windows), you can set up your iPod, iPhone, or 
Apple TV with the option to copy your entire photo library. See Chapter 18 
for details.
Syncing with Your iTunes Store Account
You can sync your iPod touch or iPhone with your iTunes Store account 
information in advance, so that you don’t have to manually sign in with your 
iPod touch or iPhone before downloading from the iTunes Store or App Store. 
 
To manually sign in or create an account on your iPod touch or iPhone, 
choose Settings➪Store and touch Sign In or Create New Account. If your 
iPod touch or iPhone is already synced with your account, the View Account 
button appears in place of Sign In.
If you were signed in to your iTunes Store account when you initially set up 
and synced your iPod touch or iPhone, the store account information was 
also synchronized. If not, or if you want to resync your store information, 
visit the iTunes Store and sign in to your account first, before syncing your 
iPod or iPhone. 
You don’t have to buy anything; just signing in to the store provides all the 
info you need for syncing an iPod touch or iPhone with the iTunes Store 
account. (If you haven’t set up your iTunes Store account yet, flip back to 
Chapter 7, do the deed, and then sign in by clicking the Sign In tab in the 
upper-right area of the iTunes window.) 

147
 Chapter 9: Into the Sync with iTunes
After signing into your account, go ahead and follow the steps in the next sec-
tions to sync your iPod or iPhone — “Copying Everything”, “Choosing What 
to Sync”, or “Manually Managing Music and Videos”.
After syncing to your account, your iPod touch or iPhone will always sync 
any purchased content or apps you download directly to it with your iTunes 
library whenever you connect it to your computer — that way you don’t lose 
any content or apps if, heaven forbid, something happens to your iPod touch 
or iPhone.
Copying Everything
Follow these steps to sync all the content in your iTunes library to an iPod or 
iPhone:
 
1. Connect the iPod or iPhone and select its name when it appears in the 
Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the sync options to the right of the Source pane, with 
the Summary page (under the Summary tab) open. The Summary page 
shows how much space on the device is occupied by content and how 
much is still free. (See Figure 9-1.)
 
Figure 9-1: 
The 
Summary 
page for an 
iPod touch 
offers sync 
options.
 

148
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
2. If the iPod or iPhone isn’t already synchronizing, click the Sync 
button in the lower-right corner to synchronize it.
 
 Most likely your iPod or iPhone is already set to automatically synchro-
nize with iTunes after connecting it. After clicking the Sync button (or if 
iTunes is automatically syncing), the iTunes Status pane tells you that 
iTunes is syncing the iPod or iPhone.
 
 If you haven’t made any sync selections, the default is to copy every-
thing in your iTunes library to your iPod or iPhone. (Only the music, 
audio books, and audio podcasts in your library are copied to an iPod 
shuffle.) 
 
 If your iPod or iPhone is not set to automatically synchronize, or even if 
synchronization is going on, you can select content to sync, as I describe 
later in this chapter, and click Apply to start re-syncing again with the 
new settings.
 
3. Wait for the synchronization to finish and then click the Eject button 
next to the iPod or iPhone name in the Source pane.
 
 You should always wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) displays 
that the synchronization is complete.
 
4. Disconnect your iPod or iPhone from your computer.
 
 That’s it. Your iPod or iPhone is now synchronized.
 
Your iTunes library is the main library for your content, while the library in 
your iPod or iPhone is like a satellite holding some or all of the same content. 
If you make changes in your iTunes library after syncing the iPod or iPhone, 
those changes are automatically made in the iPod or iPhone when you sync 
again — unless you manually manage content, as I describe in “Manually 
Managing Music and Videos” in this chapter. That means if you delete an 
album or video from your iTunes library, that album or video is also deleted 
from your iPod or iPhone the next time you sync. You can delete items 
directly from your iPod or iPhone without changing your iTunes library — see 
“Deleting items on your iPod or iPhone” in this chapter.
You probably don’t need to know anything else in this chapter about 
synchronizing your iPod or iPhone with content — unless your iTunes library 
and additional photo library are too large to fit, or if you want to be more 
selective about which content to synchronize. 
 
iTunes backs up your synchronization settings for each iPod or iPhone that 
you connect from the last time when you synchronized the device.

149
 Chapter 9: Into the Sync with iTunes
 
Photos you’ve organized in an iPhoto library (on a Mac) or in a program (such 
as Adobe Photoshop Album in Windows) are also copied over. See Chapter 18 
for details.
If your iTunes library is too large to fit on your iPod or iPhone, iTunes 
decides which songs and albums to include by using the ratings that you set 
for each song. (To find out how to set ratings, see Chapter 12.) If your iPod 
or iPhone already has photos on it, iTunes asks whether you want to delete 
them to gain more space. After clicking the Yes or No button, iTunes tries its 
best to fit everything. If it has to cut something, though, it skips copying new 
photos and displays the message Some photos were not copied.
 
You can squeeze more songs onto an iPod shuffle if you convert them to a 
lower-bit-rate format — and you can do this on the fly. If you’ve imported 
songs into iTunes at higher-bit-rate formats or with encoders such as iTunes 
Plus, Apple Lossless, or WAV (see Chapter 8 for details), you can set iTunes to 
automatically convert songs to 128-kbps AAC files while syncing with the iPod 
shuffle. The songs are not changed in your iTunes library. To do this, connect 
your iPod shuffle to your computer, click its name in the Devices section of the 
Source pane to show the Summary page sync options, and select the Convert 
Higher Bit Rate Songs to 128 kbps AAC option (which appears only for an iPod 
shuffle). As a result, the songs take up less space on the iPod shuffle than they 
occupy in your iTunes library.
If you’re still short of space even after skipping photos, iTunes displays a 
warning about the lack of free space, and it asks whether you want to disable 
podcast synchronization and let iTunes create a selection of songs in a 
playlist based on ratings and playback counts in iTunes. (See Chapter 14 for 
details on using playlists.)
 
✓ If you click the Yes button, iTunes creates a new playlist (titled “Your 
device name Selection,” as in “My iPod touch Selection”) and displays 
a message telling you so. Click the OK button, and iTunes synchronizes 
your iPod or iPhone using the new playlist. iTunes also sets your iPod or 
iPhone to synchronize music automatically by playlist, as I describe in 
the next section.
 
✓ If you click the No button, iTunes updates automatically until it fills 
your iPod or iPhone without creating the playlist.
From that point on, your iPod or iPhone synchronizes with your iTunes 
library automatically, right after you connect it to your computer. If you add 
or delete content in your iTunes library, that content is added or deleted in 
the iPod or iPhone when you sync again.

150
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
To prevent an iPod or iPhone from automatically synchronizing, press 
Ô-Option (Mac) or Ctrl-Alt (Windows) while you connect the device; then 
keep pressing until the iPod or iPhone name appears in the iTunes Source 
pane. You can then change the iPod or iPhone sync setting to manually 
manage music and videos, as I describe later in this chapter.
 
If you connect an iPod or iPhone previously linked to another computer to 
your computer, iTunes displays a message warning you that clicking the 
Yes button replaces the iPod or iPhone content with the content from your 
computer’s library. If you don’t want to change the content on the iPod or 
iPhone, click No. If you click Yes, iTunes erases the iPod or iPhone and 
synchronizes it with your computer’s library. To avoid this warning, first set 
the iPod or iPhone sync settings to manually manage music and videos, as 
I describe later in this chapter, on the computer the iPod or iPhone was 
previously synced.
Choosing What to Sync
If you have a massive music library that doesn’t fit on your iPod or iPhone, 
you can go the selective route, choosing which content to automatically 
sync with your iTunes library. By synchronizing selectively, you can still 
make your iPod or iPhone match at least a subset of your iTunes library. If 
you make changes to that subset in iTunes, those changes are automatically 
made in the device when you synchronize again.
 
You don’t have to sync to one massive library in iTunes — you can create 
several subsets of your main library (sublibraries) so that each sublibrary 
could be small enough to fit on a certain type of device. For example, you 
might create a sublibrary for a 32GB iPod touch and another sublibrary 
for a 16GB iPod nano. Before connecting a device, you could switch to its 
corresponding sublibrary within iTunes and then synchronize automatically.
 
To find out how to manage multiple iTunes libraries, visit the Tips section of 
the author’s Web site (www.tonybove.com).
Syncing everything but the kitchen
You can decide which items you don’t want to synchronize and simply not 
include them by first deselecting them one by one in your iTunes library. (If 
you have a large iTunes library, this may take some time — you may find it 
easier to synchronize by playlists, artists, and genres, as I show in the next 
section.)

151
 Chapter 9: Into the Sync with iTunes
By default, all content items are selected — a check mark appears in the 
check box next to the item. To deselect an item in your iTunes library, click 
the check box next to the item so that the check mark disappears. To reselect 
an item, just click the check box again.
 
You can quickly select (or deselect) an entire album by showing the Browser 
(choose View➪Show Column Browser) and selecting the album. Then press Ô 
(Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) while selecting (or deselecting) a single song in the 
album in the List pane.
After you deselect the items you don’t want to transfer, connect your iPod or 
iPhone to your computer and select its name when it appears in the Devices 
section of the Source pane (refer to Figure 9-1). Then select the Sync Only 
Checked Songs and Videos check box. The Sync button changes to Apply — 
click the Apply button.
iTunes restarts synchronization and deletes from the iPod or iPhone any 
items in the library that are deselected, to save space, before adding back in 
the items in the iTunes library that are selected. That means the items you 
deselected are now gone from your iPod or iPhone — replaced by whatever 
items were selected. Of course, the items are still in your iTunes library. Wait 
for the synchronization to finish and then click the Eject button next to the 
iPod or iPhone name in the Source pane.
Getting picky about playlists, 
artists, and genres
You can include just the items that are defined in playlists, including Genius 
playlists, and/or just specific artists. Syncing by playlists, artists, and genres  
is a great way of syncing vast amounts of music without syncing the entire 
library. (To find out how to create playlists, see Chapter 14.)
For example, you can create four playlists that contain all essential rock, folk, 
blues, and jazz albums, and then select all four, or just one, two, or three of 
these playlists to sync with your iPod or iPhone, along with everything by 
specific artists (such as Frank Zappa, who doesn’t fit into these categories). 
You can even include audio books in your playlists, or create a playlist of just 
audio books, to sync with your iPod or iPhone.
After connecting your iPod or iPhone to your computer, select its name when 
it appears in the Devices section of the Source pane (refer to Figure 9-1). 
Then click the Music tab of the sync options. The Music sync options page 
appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.

152
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
Figure 9-2: 
Synchronize 
only the 
selected 
playlists, 
artists, and 
genres.
 
By default, the Entire Music Library option is checked, unless you are manu-
ally managing music as I describe later in this chapter. To change your sync 
options, select the Sync Music check box. 
If you were manually managing music, a message appears asking if you are 
sure that you want to sync music — all content already on your iPod or 
iPhone will be replaced. Click the Sync Music button (or Cancel to cancel) to 
return to the Music sync options page.
To choose playlists, artists, and genres to sync with the iPod or iPhone, click 
the Selected Playlists, Artists, and Genres option at the top of the Music sync 
options page (refer to Figure 9-2). You can then select each playlist from the 
Playlists list, each artist from the Artists list, and (if you scroll the Music sync 
options page) each genre from the Genres list. You can choose any number 
of playlists, artists, and genres. (In Figure 9-2, I selected the Music Videos and 
Recently Added smart playlists along with a few artists.) 
Finally, click the Apply button to apply changes and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.

153
 Chapter 9: Into the Sync with iTunes
iTunes copies only what you’ve selected in the Playlists, Artists, and Genres 
sections of the Music sync options page. If you also select the Include Music 
Videos check box (as I do in Figure 9-2), iTunes includes music videos listed 
in the playlists (except, of course, for an iPod shuffle, which doesn’t play 
video). For an iPod touch or iPhone, you can also select the Include Voice 
Memos check box to sync your voice memos from the Voice Memo app with 
iTunes. (See Chapter 21 for details on using Voice Memo.)
 
You can also automatically fill up the rest of your iPod or iPhone free space 
with random songs (after syncing your selected playlists, artists, and genres) 
by selecting the Automatically Fill Free Space With Songs option. iTunes 
randomly chooses the music as I describe in the latter part of the “Copying 
Everything” section. If you select the Sync Only Checked Songs and Videos 
check box on the Summary page of the iPod or iPhone sync options (refer to 
Figure 9-1), only selected items are copied. iTunes ignores items that are not 
selected, even if they’re listed in the chosen playlists for synchronization.
Picking and choosing podcast episodes
You can get picky about which podcast episodes should be copied during 
synchronization. Clicking the Podcasts tab of the sync pages presents 
options for choosing podcast episodes to include. (You can include audio 
podcasts to sync with an iPod shuffle, but not video podcasts.)
Connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer, and select its name when it 
appears in the Devices section of the Source pane (refer to Figure 9-1). Then 
click the Podcasts tab. The Podcasts sync options page appears, as shown in 
Figure 9-3. Click the Sync Podcasts option at the top.
The Podcast sync options let you choose unplayed or recently added 
episodes (as shown in Figure 9-3). Select the Automatically Include ____ 
Episodes Of ____ check box; choose a modifier from the first pop-up menu, 
such as All Unplayed or 10 Most Recent; and then choose All Podcasts or 
Selected Podcasts from the second pop-up menu. If you chose Selected 
Podcasts, you can select a podcast in the Podcasts column below these 
options, and then select specific episodes in the Episodes column (which 
may already be selected depending on your choices in the pop-up menus). 
For example, in Figure 9-3, I’m synchronizing the 10 most recent episodes of 
selected podcasts — I’ve already selected The Flying Other Brothers-Music 
Podcast (2 new episodes out of 3), and I’m selecting the Social Folk Roots of 
California Rock episode of the Rockument podcast.

154
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
Finally, click the Apply button to apply changes, and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Synchronize

podcasts.
 
Choosing movies and TV shows
Movies and TV shows take up a lot of space, so if you limit the movies and TV 
episodes you synchronize with your iPod or iPhone, you gain extra space for 
more music, audio books, podcasts, and photos. (This section doesn’t apply 
to the iPod shuffle, which doesn’t play movies or TV shows.)
To get choosy about movies, connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer, 
and select its name when it appears in the Devices section of the Source 
pane (refer to Figure 9-1). Then click the Movies tab of the sync options. The 
Movies sync options page appears as shown in Figure 9-4. You see the Movies 
sync options page for an iPod, as shown in Figure 9-4, or the Video sync 
options for an iPhone — scroll the Video sync options page to see the Movies 
section.
Select the Sync Movies check box (as shown in Figure 9-4). Select the 
Automatically Include ____ Movies check box; choose a modifier from the 
pop-up menu, such as All, All Unwatched, or 10 Most Recent Unwatched. If 

155
 Chapter 9: Into the Sync with iTunes
you choose any option other than All, you can then select specific movies 
from the list below the option. For example, in Figure 9-4 I’m automatically 
including 1 Most Recent movie along with the selected movie Jacob’s Ladder. 
 
Figure 9-4: 
Synchronize 
the selected 
movies only 
(iPod).
 
To pick only the TV episodes you want, click the TV Shows tab of the sync 
options. The TV Shows sync options page appears, as shown in Figure 9-5.
Select the Automatically Include ____ Episodes Of ____ check box; choose a 
modifier from the first pop-up menu, such as All, All Unwatched, or 5 Most 
Recent; and then choose All Shows or Selected Shows from the second 
pop-up menu. If you chose Selected Shows, you can select a show in the 
Shows column below these options, and then select specific episodes in the 
Episodes column (which may already be selected depending on your choices 
in the pop-up menus). 
For example, in Figure 9-5, I’m synchronizing all episodes of selected shows 
whether I’ve watched them or not — but I’m also selecting only two episodes 
of Star Trek: The Original Series and deselecting the other episodes, in order 
to get only the episodes I want.
Finally, click the Apply button to apply changes and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.

Manually Managing Music and Videos
If your entire library is too big for your iPod or iPhone, you may want to copy 
individual items directly. By setting your iPod or iPhone to manually manage 
music and videos, you can add content to your iPod or iPhone directly via 
iTunes, and you can delete content as well. You can even copy some songs or 
videos from another computer’s iTunes library without deleting any content 
from your iPod or iPhone.
To set your iPod or iPhone to manually manage music and videos, first 
connect it to your computer. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the iPod or iPhone name in the Devices section of the iTunes 
Source pane.
 
 After selecting the name, the Summary page appears, displaying the 
iPod or iPhone sync options (refer to Figure 9-1).
 
2. Select the Manually Manage Music and Videos check box (on an iPod 
shuffle, select Manually Manage Music).
 
 iTunes displays a message for iPod nano and iPod classic models 
(and older models) warning you that manually managing music and 
videos also requires manually ejecting the iPod or iPhone before each 
disconnect

157
 Chapter 9: Into the Sync with iTunes
 
3. Click the OK button for the warning, and click the Apply button to 
apply the change.
 
Don’t disconnect your iPod or iPhone while managing music and videos 
manually. You have to eject it first, as spelled out in the next section. If you 
don’t, you may find that it doesn’t work properly and needs to be restored, as 
I describe in Chapter 22.
Copying items directly to 
your iPod or iPhone
After setting your iPod or iPhone to manually manage music and videos, you 
can select and drag music and videos — songs, albums, audio books, music 
videos, movies, and TV shows — to your iPod or iPhone name in the Source 
pane. (Similarly, after setting an iPod shuffle to manually manage music, 
you can select and drag music, audio books, and audio podcasts to the iPod 
shuffle.)
You can drag the media from its section in the iTunes library or from an 
existing playlist, or drag an entire playlist. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. In the iTunes Source pane, select the source of your media.
 
 You might select Music in the Library section, for instance, or a playlist 
in the library.
 
 You can select music in your library using List, Grid, or Cover Flow view 
(see Chapter 11 for browsing details), or select songs in a playlist.
 
2. Drag items (such as one or more songs or an album) directly from 
your iTunes library or playlist over the iPod or iPhone name in the 
Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 You can drag an individual songs or an entire album from Cover Flow 
view, List view, or Grid view (as I do in Figure 9-6). When you drag an 
album cover or album title, all the songs in the album are copied. If you 
drag a playlist name from the Source pane to the iPod or iPhone name, 
all the songs associated with the playlist copy along with the playlist 
itself.
 
3. Wait for the copying to finish and then click the Eject button next to 
the iPod or iPhone name in the Source pane to eject it.
 
4. Disconnect your iPod or iPhone from your computer.

Deleting items on your iPod or iPhone
When you manually manage music and videos on an iPod or iPhone (or 
manage music on an iPod shuffle), you can also delete content from the iPod 
or iPhone. Set the option to manually manage music and videos (if it isn’t set 
that way already) and then follow these steps:
 
1. In the Source pane, click the triangle to the left of the iPod or iPhone 
name to expand its library.
 
 The iPod or iPhone library appears in the Source pane with Music, 
Movies, TV Shows, and other sections, followed by playlists. The library 
is indented underneath the iPod or iPhone name.
 
2. Click any content type in the iPod or iPhone library to see the items.
 
 The content items appear in the iTunes List pane to the right of the 
Source pane.
 
3. Select an item and press Delete/Backspace or choose Edit➪Delete.
 
 iTunes displays a warning to make sure that you want to do this; click 
the OK button to go ahead or the Cancel button to stop. If you want 
to delete a playlist, select the playlist underneath the iPod or iPhone 
name in the Source pane and then press Delete/Backspace or choose 
Edit➪Delete.

159
 Chapter 9: Into the Sync with iTunes
 
Like in the iTunes library (as I describe in Chapter 14), if you delete a playlist, 
the songs listed in the playlist aren’t deleted. They’re still on your iPod or 
iPhone unless you delete the songs directly from the iPod or iPhone library.
Autofill it up
You can also automatically fill your iPod or iPhone while managing music 
and videos manually. Autofill randomly picks songs from your entire iTunes 
library or from a playlist you select in the iTunes Source pane.
Autofill is especially useful for copying random songs to an iPod shuffle every 
time you connect it to your computer. Eventually, you can shuffle through 
everything in your library if you so wish by randomly autofilling your iPod 
shuffle every time you sync.
Set the option to manually manage music on the iPod shuffle or to manage 
music and videos on the iPod or iPhone (if it isn’t set that way already). Then 
follow these steps:
 
1. In the Source pane, click the triangle to the left of the iPod or iPhone 
name to expand its library.
 
 The iPod or iPhone library appears in the Source pane.
 
2. Select Music under the iPod or iPhone name in the Devices section of 
the Source pane.
 
 The music on your iPod or iPhone appears in the List pane, along with 
the Autofill pane along the bottom, as shown in Figure 9-7.
 
3. Choose your source of music from the Autofill From pop-up menu.
 
 Choose either a playlist, as I did in Figure 9-7 (the Purchased smart play-
list), the Genius option (which I describe in Chapter 14), or Music for the 
entire music library. If you choose a playlist or Genius, Autofill uses only 
the playlist or the Genius feature as the source to pick random songs. 
After choosing your source of music, iTunes creates a playlist and dis-
plays it in the List pane.
 
4. (Optional) Click the Settings button to set options and then click the 
OK button.
 
 After clicking the Settings button, the Autofill Settings dialog appears. 
You can choose to replace all the items on the iPod or iPhone, to choose 
items randomly, or to choose higher rated items more often. If you don’t 
select to replace all items, iTunes adds the items without replacing 
existing content. Click the OK button to close the Autofill Settings dialog.

5. Click the Autofill button to start copying songs.
 
 iTunes copies the contents of the Autofill playlist to your iPod or iPhone.
 
6. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then click the Eject button.
 
 Always wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) tells you that the 
copying is finished.
 
You can click the Autofill button repeatedly to create different random 
playlists. When you get one you like, select all its contents and choose 
File➪New Playlist from Selection to create a new playlist that contains the 
songs generated by Autofill. The next time you connect your iPod or iPhone, 
select this new playlist from the Autofill From pop-up menu and then click the 
Autofill button to load the music from the playlist to your iPod or iPhone.

office computer. The iPod classic, nano, and older models offer one-way 
synchronization of personal information from your computer to the iPod. 
(The iPod shuffle doesn’t hold personal information, so this chapter isn’t 
relevant for it.)
The iPod touch or iPhone can take care of all aspects of your digital life: It 
can send and receive e-mail, keep track of your calendar, sort your contacts, 
and save bookmarks to all your favorite Web sites as you browse them. 
You can also add personal info directly to your iPod touch or iPhone, and 
synchronize that information back with your computer, which is two-way 
synchronization.
If you’re a road warrior, you may want to fill your iPod or iPhone with your 
personal information. This chapter shows you how.

Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
Applications to Organize Your Life
You already manage your contacts, calendars, e-mail, and Web bookmarks 
with applications on your computer. Now you can use iTunes to synchronize 
your iPod classic or iPod nano with these calendars and contacts, or your 
iPod touch or iPhone with these calendars, contacts, e-mail accounts, and 
bookmarks.
If you’re a Mac user, you have it easy: You can use the Address Book applica-
tion to manage your contacts, iCal for calendars, Mail for e-mail, and Safari 
for Web bookmarks. All these applications are provided free with Mac OS X. 
You can also sync contacts from Microsoft Entourage, Yahoo! Address Book, 
and Google Address Book, and sync calendars from Entourage.
If you’re a Windows user, you can sync your contacts with Microsoft Outlook 
2003 or 2007, Yahoo! Address Book, Google Address Book, Windows Address 
Book (Outlook Express), or Vista Contacts. You can sync calendars with 
Outlook and sync bookmarks with Microsoft Internet Explorer or Apple’s 
Safari for Windows.
The iPod touch and iPhone can also use the Exchange ActiveSync protocol 
to sync e-mail, calendars, and contacts with Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 
Service Pack 2 or Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1. For many e-mail 
accounts, the settings automatically appear, like magic.
If you signed up for Apple’s MobileMe service (formerly the .Mac service, 
now www.me.com), you can automatically keep your iPod touch or iPhone 
synchronized along with several computers and other iPod touch and iPhone 
models, all at once, with the latest e-mail, bookmarks, calendar entries, and 
contacts, as I describe in the section “Going MobileMe to Sync Your iPod 
touch or iPhone,” later in this chapter.
What’s cool about “cloud computing” Web services like MobileMe, Microsoft 
Exchange, and Yahoo! Mail is that their e-mail services push e-mail messages 
to your computer and your iPod touch or iPhone so that they arrive 
immediately, automatically. Other types of e-mail account services let you 
fetch e-mail from the server — you must first select the account in Mail on 
your iPod touch or iPhone before it can actually retrieve the e-mail.
 
You probably already know how to manage your calendar activities and your 
contacts on your computer. In fact, you’re probably knee-deep in contacts, 
and your calendars look like they were drawn up in the West Wing. If not, visit 
the tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com) for advice on using 
MobileMe and on adding and editing contacts and calendar information on 
your Mac (with Address Book and iCal) or Windows computer (with Outlook). 
You can also find out how to use third-party utilities to manage personal 
information on your iPod touch or iPhone.

 Chapter 10: Syncing Mail, Calendars, Contacts, and Bookmarks 
Syncing Your Personal Info Using iTunes
You use iTunes to synchronize an iPod classic or iPod nano with calendars 
and contacts on your computer.
With an iPod touch or iPhone, you can sync your personal information in 
three ways: using iTunes or using MobileMe (if you purchase the MobileMe 
service) or Microsoft Exchange. You can switch between these methods 
anytime you want. If you set up the iPod touch or iPhone to sync contacts, 
calendars, or bookmarks with MobileMe or Microsoft Exchange, syncing 
for those items is turned off in iTunes. MobileMe and Microsoft Exchange 
get their write-ups in the next section, and this section tackles the iTunes 
method.
To synchronize your iPod or iPhone with contacts, calendars, e-mail 
accounts, and bookmarks by using iTunes, follow these steps:
 
1. Connect the iPod or iPhone, and select its name when it appears in 
the Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the iPod or iPhone sync options to the right of the 
Source pane, with the Summary page (under the Summary tab) open.
 
2. Click the Info tab for an iPod touch or iPhone, or the Contacts tab for 
an iPod classic or iPod nano (or older model).
 
 The Info sync options page appears for the iPod touch or iPhone (see 
Figure 10-1 for an iPod touch), offering the Contacts, Calendars, Web 
Browser, Notes, Mail Accounts, and Advanced sections. (At the top is a 
link to the MobileMe service if you are not already using it for syncing.)
 
 If you have an iPod classic, nano, or older model, what you see is the 
Contacts and Calendars synchronization options page, as shown in 
Figure 10-2.
 
3. Select the option to synchronize contacts.
 
 On a Mac: Select the Sync Address Book Contacts check box (shown in 
Figure 10-2). With an iPod touch or iPhone, you also have the option to 
sync with Yahoo! Address Book — click the Configure button to enter 
your login information. An option to sync with Microsoft Entourage 
appears for the iPod touch, iPhone, iPod nano, or iPod classic if you 
have that application on your Mac.
 
 On a Windows PC: Select the Sync Contents With option and choose 
Yahoo! Address Book, Windows Address Book, Google Contacts, or 
Outlook from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 10-1).
 
4. Select the All Contacts option, or select the Selected Groups option 
and choose which groups to synchronize.

165
 Chapter 10: Syncing Mail, Calendars, Contacts, and Bookmarks 
 
 You can synchronize all contacts or just selected groups of contacts 
(such as the AA1 and AA1-facebook groups selected in Figure 10-2). To 
choose groups, select the check box next to each group in the list; scroll 
the list to see more groups.
 
 If you make changes on an iPod touch or iPhone, iTunes automatically 
keeps all contacts you’ve selected synchronized with your computer’s 
application.
 
5. Scroll the page and select the option to synchronize calendars.
 
 On a Mac, select the Sync iCal Calendars check box (shown in Figure 
10-2); an option to sync with Microsoft Entourage also appears if you 
have the application on your Mac. On a Windows PC, select the Sync 
Calendars With option and choose Outlook from the pop-up menu 
(refer to Figure 10-1).
 
6. Select the All Calendars option. (Alternatively, if you’re using iCal 
with Mac OS X, select the Selected Calendars option and choose the 
calendars to synchronize.)
 
 In Windows, you can synchronize all calendars with Microsoft Outlook, 
but you don’t have the option to sync only selected calendars. (The 
Selected Calendars option is grayed out.) With iCal in Mac OS X, you can 
synchronize all calendars or just those you select. To choose specific 
calendars, select the check box next to each calendar in the list.
 
 The iPod touch and iPhone include the Do Not Sync Events Older Than 
xx Days option, in which you can set the xx number of days.
 
 Unless you are using an iPod touch or iPhone, you can skip to Step 12.
 
7. Select the calendar to use for new events entered into your iPod touch 
or iPhone (Mac OS X only).
 
 If you’re using Mac OS X and iCal, you should set the calendar to use for 
new events you create on your iPod touch or iPhone. Choose a calendar 
name in the Put New Events into the Calendar option. When you create 
a new event on your iPod touch or iPhone (as I describe in Chapter 21) 
and sync it to your computer, the new event appears in this calendar. 
This affects only new events — events you modify on your iPod touch or 
iPhone retain their calendar information from before.
 
 Because you can’t select individual calendars with Outlook in Windows, 
this option is grayed out — all events you create on an iPod touch or 
iPhone synchronize with the Outlook main calendar.
 
8. To synchronize Web bookmarks with your iPod touch or iPhone, 
scroll down to the Web Browser section and select the Sync 
Bookmarks option.
 
 On a Mac running OS X, the option is Sync Safari Bookmarks; on a 
Windows PC, iTunes selects Internet Explorer or Safari for this option, 
depending on which one is your default browser.

166
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
9. To synchronize notes on your computer with an iPod touch or iPhone, 
scroll down to the Notes section.
 
 You can sync the notes you create in the Notes app on your iPod touch 
or iPhone with the Mail application on a Mac or with Outlook on a 
Windows PC. Select the Sync Notes option; on a Windows PC, choose 
Outlook from the pop-up menu for the Sync Notes With option.
 
10. To synchronize e-mail accounts with an iPod touch or iPhone, scroll 
down to the Mail Accounts section and select the Sync Selected Mail 
Accounts option.
 
 Mail Accounts, as shown in Figure 10-3, appears below the Notes and 
Calendars sections on the Info sync options page. On a Mac, select the 
Sync Selected Mail Accounts option. On a Windows PC, choose Outlook 
or Outlook Express from the pop-up menu for the Sync Selected Mail 
Accounts From option.
 
Figure 10-3: 
Synchronize 
e-mail 
accounts 
with an iPod 
touch (or 
iPhone).
 
 
11. Choose the e-mail accounts you want to sync with your iPod touch or 
iPhone.
 
 After selecting the Sync Selected Mail Accounts option in Step 10, a list 
of e-mail accounts appears in the box below. To choose accounts, select 
the check box next to each account in the list; scroll the list to see more 
e-mail accounts.

167
 Chapter 10: Syncing Mail, Calendars, Contacts, and Bookmarks 
 
12. Click the Apply button to apply the changes. (Alternatively, click the 
Cancel button to cancel the changes.)
 
 iTunes starts to synchronize your iPod or iPhone.
 
13. Wait for the sync to finish and then click the Eject button next to the 
iPod or iPhone name in the Source pane to eject the iPod or iPhone.
 
 Wait until the iTunes Status pane (at the top) displays the message Sync 
is Complete.
After setting the synchronization options, every time you connect your iPod 
or iPhone, iTunes automatically synchronizes it with your personal sync 
options.
Synchronizing an e-mail account to your iPod touch or iPhone copies only 
the e-mail account setup information; the messages are retrieved by the 
iPod touch or iPhone over the Internet. Whether the messages in your inbox 
appear on your iPod touch or iPhone and on your computer depends on the 
type of e-mail account you have and how you’ve configured it.
 
If you select a calendar or a group of contacts to be synchronized on a Mac 
and later want to remove that particular calendar or group of contacts, 
deselect the calendar (see the preceding Step 6) or the group (see the preceding 
Step 4) and then click the Apply button to resynchronize. iTunes synchronizes 
only the group of contacts and calendars selected, removing from the iPod or 
iPhone any that aren’t selected.
iTunes also offers Advanced options at the bottom of the Info page for the 
iPod touch or iPhone (refer to Figure 10-3). Use these options to sync your 
iPod touch or iPhone from scratch to replace all contacts, calendars, notes, 
mail accounts, or bookmarks. You can choose which ones you want to 
replace by selecting the check box next to each option. iTunes replaces the 
information once, during the next sync operation. After that operation, these 
Advanced options are automatically turned off.
Going MobileMe to Sync Your 
iPod touch or iPhone
MobileMe synchronizes MobileMe e-mail accounts, along with contacts, 
calendars, and bookmarks, on a Web server — also known as the cloud. 
You can then keep your iPod touch or iPhone synchronized to the cloud 
wirelessly, without having to connect it to your computer.

168
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
The place to start organizing your information is usually your computer. 
However, if you’ve already entered contacts and calendars on your iPod touch 
or iPhone, sync your contacts and calendars on your iPod touch or iPhone 
with iTunes first, as I describe in the previous section. Then sync your 
computer with MobileMe, and then your iPod touch or iPhone with MobileMe.
 
Make sure that the information you synchronize the very first time to 
MobileMe is the correct, complete information. You should synchronize 
your primary source — typically your computer — with MobileMe before 
synchronizing your iPod touch or iPhone.
MobileMe first makes its appearance when you set up your iPod touch or 
iPhone: An advertisement appears with buttons to try MobileMe. If you 
skipped the ad (like many people do), you can go back and try MobileMe by 
following these steps:
 
1. Connect the iPod touch or iPhone to your computer and select its 
name when it appears in the Devices section of the Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the sync options to the right of the Source pane, with 
the Summary page (under the Summary tab) open.
 
2. Click the Info tab.
 
 The Info sync options page appears, offering the MobileMe setup button.
 
3. Click the Set Up Now button.
 
 iTunes jumps to your browser to open the MobileMe setup page on the 
Apple Web site. Here you can find out all about MobileMe, click the 
Free Trial button, or log in if you already have an account. Apple also 
provides step-by-step instructions for setting up MobileMe on your 
computer and syncing with your iPod touch or iPhone — or you can 
read all about it in the next few sections.
After setting up your MobileMe account on a Mac or Windows PC as 
described in the next sections, you turn on your MobileMe account on your 
iPod touch and iPhone, as I describe in section “Setting Up Mail Accounts on 
Your iPod touch or iPhone,” later in this chapter.
Setting up on a Mac
Setting up MobileMe is easy on a Mac: When you sign in to MobileMe for the 
first time, MobileMe automatically configures Mac OS X Mail on your Mac to 
send and receive e-mail from your MobileMe account and to synchronize 
contacts from Address Book and calendars from iCal. If you already set up 
your iPod touch or iPhone with a Mac and MobileMe service, automatic 
synchronization should already be set up on that Mac.

169
 Chapter 10: Syncing Mail, Calendars, Contacts, and Bookmarks 
If not, you can set up a Mac to sync with MobileMe at any time. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu, choose MobileMe, 
click the Account tab, and sign in.
 
 If you see the .Mac logo instead (for older versions of Mac OS X), select 
.Mac and sign in. Follow the on-screen instructions, if they appear.
 
2. Click the Sync tab.
 
 The Sync options for MobileMe appear, as shown in Figure 10-4.
 
Figure 10-4: 
Sync 
options for 
MobileMe 
on a Mac.
 
 
3. Select the Synchronize with MobileMe check box and then choose a 
sync interval from the pop-up menu. (Refer to Figure 10-4.)
 
 For the most frequent updates, choose Automatically to sync with 
MobileMe every 15 minutes.
 
4. Select the check boxes to choose information to sync with MobileMe.
 
 You can choose to sync just contacts, calendars, bookmarks, or 
mail accounts, or all of them. (You can also sync other items, such 
as Dashboard Widgets, Dock Items, Keychains, and Mail Rules and 
Signatures, for use with other Macs, but these are not synced to your 
iPod touch or iPhone.)
 
5. Click the Sync Now button.
 
 The sync commences. To make sure that your data has synced, go to 
www.me.com, log in, and click the Contacts and Calendar icons along the 
top row of icons on the left.

170
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
Setting up in Windows
Download and install on your PC the latest version of MobileMe Control Panel 
for Windows, available from http://support.apple.com/downloads. 
MobileMe Control Panel is required to set up and manage MobileMe syncing 
and manage iDisk settings on a Windows PC.
To set up a Windows PC to sync with MobileMe or to check your sync settings 
or sync immediately, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Windows Start menu, open Control Panel and choose 
MobileMe Control Panel.
 
 The MobileMe panel appears with tabs along the top.
 
2. Click the Account tab for the Account pane (if it isn’t already visible) 
and log in with your MobileMe member name and password if you 
aren’t already logged in.
 
3. Click the Sync tab.
 
 The sync options appear, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
4. Select the Sync with MobileMe check box and then select a sync 
interval.
 
 For the most frequent updates, choose Automatically to sync with 
MobileMe every 15 minutes.
 
5. Select the check boxes to sync your contacts, calendars, and bookmarks, 
and then use the drop-down lists to choose which Windows applications 
you want to use when syncing with these items.
 
6. Click the Sync Now button.
 
 The sync starts. To make sure that your data has synced, go to www.
me.com, log in, and click the Contacts and Calendar icons along the top 
row of icons on the left.
 
If you use Microsoft Outlook in conjunction with Microsoft Exchange Server, 
MobileMe won’t sync contacts or calendars with Outlook — use Exchange 
Server instead. See the section “Setting Up Mail Accounts on Your iPod touch 
or iPhone,” later in this chapter.
When you sync upon a cloud
If your contacts or calendar entries show up in duplicate or triplicate in your 
computer or on your iPod touch or iPhone, as if they were stuck inside of 
MobileMe with the memory blues again, you probably need to overwrite the 
data in the MobileMe cloud.

171
 Chapter 10: Syncing Mail, Calendars, Contacts, and Bookmarks 
 
Figure 10-5: 
Sync 
options for 
MobileMe 
on a 
Windows 
PC.
 
Selecting items to synchronize may not overwrite all the data in the cloud. To 
overwrite the data stored in the cloud with the data on your computer, open 
MobileMe (in System Preferences on a Mac or Control Panel in Windows), 
click the Sync tab, and then click the Advanced button. (Refer to Figure 10-4 
for a Mac or Figure 10-5 for Windows.) Select the computer you are syncing 
from in the list at the top and then click Reset Sync Data.
In the dialog that appears, choose an option from the Replace pop-up menu:
 
✓ On a Mac, you can choose All Sync Info, or Bookmarks, Calendars, or 
Contacts. (The other choices on the pop-up menu — Key Chains, Mail 
Accounts, and so on — don’t copy over to the iPod touch or iPhone but 
are useful for keeping other computers synchronized.)
 
✓ In Windows, you can choose All Sync Info, or Bookmarks, Calendars, or 
Contacts.
After choosing an option from the Replace pop-up menu, click the arrow 
underneath the Cloud icon to change the animation so that the data arrow 
points from the computer to the cloud. Finally, click the Replace button.
This action replaces the data in the MobileMe cloud with the data on your 
computer. You can also use these steps to go in reverse — replace the data 
on your computer with the data in MobileMe. To do this, click the arrow so 
that the animation points the arrow from the cloud to the computer.

172
Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
Your iPod touch or iPhone can receive pushed e-mail, contacts, calendars, 
and bookmarks from the MobileMe cloud over a Wi-Fi connection as long as it 
is awake (meaning that the screen is on or the device is connected to your 
computer or to a power adapter).
 
Changes you make to contacts, calendars, and bookmarks in your iPod touch 
or iPhone are synchronized to the Web server at www.me.com. You can also 
go to www.me.com and access your information directly with your Web 
browser.
Setting Up Mail Accounts on 
Your iPod touch or iPhone
To set up a Mail account on your iPod touch or iPhone, including a MobileMe 
e-mail account (with contacts, calendars, and bookmarks) or a Microsoft 
Exchange account, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the Home screen.
 
 The Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen appears, with the 
Accounts section at the top, as shown in Figure 10-6 (left side).
 
2. Tap the Add Account button and then tap the account type from the 
list of account types that appears.
 
 Your choices are Microsoft Exchange, MobileMe, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, 
AOL, or Other, as shown in Figure 10-6 (right side). After tapping the 
account type, the New Account screen appears for Exchange, MobileMe, 
Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and AOL accounts, and the Other screen appears for 
Other accounts.
 
3. Enter your account information as follows:
 
 Generally speaking, you’ll need to enter your name, username, password, 
and optional description by tapping next to a field’s name (such as Name 
or Address) to display the keyboard. Then use the keyboard to enter the 
information and tap Return on the keyboard to finish entering. As you tap 
Return, the next field appears ready for you to enter information, until you 
reach the last field. Tap Return to finish entering information.
 
• MobileMe, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, or AOL: Enter your name, username, 
password, and an optional description on the New Account screen, 
and then tap Save in the upper-right corner to save account 
information. Your iPod touch or iPhone verifies the account; if 

173
 Chapter 10: Syncing Mail, Calendars, Contacts, and Bookmarks 
the account can’t be verified, the message Cannot Get Mail 
appears, indicating that the username or password is incorrect. 
Tap OK and try Steps 2 and 3 again (or tap Cancel to cancel). If 
the account is verified, you’re done for a Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, or 
AOL account and you can skip the rest of these steps — the Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars settings screen appears with the new account 
listed in the Accounts section. For MobileMe, your iPod touch or 
iPhone displays your account’s settings screen.
 
• Microsoft Exchange: Enter your name, username, domain 
(optional), password, and an optional description on the New 
Account screen, and then tap Next in the upper-right corner 
to save the account information and move on to the Exchange 
account’s settings screen. Microsoft’s Autodiscovery service kicks 
in to check your username and password to determine the address 
of the Exchange server. If it can’t find the server’s address, a dialog 
appears for you to enter it — enter the complete address in the 
Server field and tap Save.
 
• Other: Tap Add Mail Account on the Other screen for an IMAP 
(Internet Message Access Protocol) or POP (Post Office Protocol) 
account. The New Account screen appears; enter your name, 
username, password, and an optional description, and then tap 
Save in the upper-right corner to save the account information. 
The iPod touch or iPhone searches for the account on the Internet 
and displays the New Account settings screen.

Part II: Filling Up Your Empty Cup 
 
4. Set your mail account settings on the New Account settings screen as 
follows:
 
• MobileMe or Exchange: Turn on any of or all the items you want 
to sync: Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and Bookmarks (MobileMe 
only). If you sync contacts, calendars, or bookmarks using your 
MobileMe or Exchange account, syncing them in iTunes is turned 
off. Any contacts, calendars, and bookmarks on your iPod touch 
or iPhone are replaced by the MobileMe or Exchange account 
versions. You can always return to the account setting’s screen to 
turn them off to enable syncing with iTunes. For Exchange, you can 
set how many days of e-mail you want to sync to your iPod touch 
or iPhone. Tap Save in the upper-right corner to finish and save 
your settings.
 
• Other: Tap IMAP or POP on the New Account settings screen, 
depending on the type of e-mail account you have — ask your 
e-mail service provider if you don’t know. Then enter or edit the 
account information, including your user name and password for 
incoming and outgoing mail. (You get this information from your 
service provider if you don’t know it.) Tap Save in the upper-
right corner to finish and save your settings. The Mail, Contacts, 
Calendars settings screen appears with the new account listed in 
the Accounts section.
 
5. When the Sync or Cancel warning appears for MobileMe or Exchange 
accounts, tap Sync (or Cancel).
 
 When you tap the Sync button, MobileMe or Exchange overwrites 
any existing contacts, calendars, and bookmarks on your iPod touch 
or iPhone (or the subset of these that you chose in Step 4). The Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars settings screen appears with the new account listed 
in the Accounts section.
 
6. Tap Fetch New Data, and tap Off for Push to turn it on (if it isn’t 
already on).
 
 That’s it! Your iPod touch or iPhone syncs automatically from this point 
on, with data pushed or fetched from the e-mail account depending on 
your push and fetch settings. (For details, see Chapter 20.)
Changing and Deleting Mail Accounts
You can temporarily turn off a Mail account on your iPod touch or iPhone, 
change its settings, or delete it from your iPod touch or iPhone.
 
Changes you make to Mail accounts on your iPod touch or iPhone are not 
transferred back to your computer when you synchronize, so it’s safe to make 
changes without affecting e-mail account settings on your computer.

175
 Chapter 10: Syncing Mail, Calendars, Contacts, and Bookmarks 
To turn off a Mail account in your iPod touch or iPhone temporarily, or 
change account settings, choose Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from 
the Home screen and then touch the account in the Accounts section to see 
that account’s settings screen. You can then change your account’s settings, 
including the items that are synced to your iPod touch or iPhone with a 
MobileMe or Microsoft Exchange account.
To delete the account, scroll down and tap Delete Account. Deleting a Mail 
account from an iPod touch or iPhone doesn’t delete the e-mail account itself 
or its settings on your computer.
 
It’s way beyond the scope of this book to explain all the e-mail account and 
advanced options. Grab your network administrator or Internet service provider 
and offer free coffee in exchange for help. If you don’t have anyone to turn to, 
visit the Tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com) for tips on using 
MobileMe and other e-mail accounts, and for changing e-mail account settings 
on your iPod touch or iPhone.

Sorting in iTunes
In This Chapter
▶ Browsing your iTunes library
▶ Changing options for viewing your content
▶ Sorting content by view options
▶ Searching for content in the library
▶ Finding pesky duplicates
▶ Deleting items from the library
Y
ou rip a few CDs, buy some songs and movies from the iTunes Store, 
and you’re hooked. You keep adding more and more content to your 
library and forget how to find items you added last month. It’s time to 
discover how to organize your content and navigate your iTunes library.
The iTunes library can hold an unlimited number of files, depending on how 
much space you have on your hard drive. But even if you keep your iTunes 
library down to the size of what fits on your iPod or iPhone, you still have a 
formidable collection at your fingertips. If your content collection is getting 
large, organize it to make finding songs, audio books, podcasts, and videos 
easier. After all, finding U2’s “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” is a 
challenge, even in a library that fits on an 8GB iPod nano.
This chapter shows you how to search, browse, and sort your iTunes library. 
You can find any content item in seconds. You can also change the viewing 
options to make your library’s display more useful, such as displaying songs 
sorted by artist, album, genre, or other attributes, or sorting TV shows by 
season or episode.

Part III: Managing Your Library 
Browsing Your Library Content
As you know, the iTunes window provides the List pane on the right side and 
the Source pane on the left side (refer to Chapter 6 for figures showing Mac 
and Windows versions). The List pane offers a view of your library and 
content, depending on which sources of content you choose in the Source 
pane on the left side. The choices in the Source pane are as follows:
 
✓ Library section: Select Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Audiobooks,

✓ Store section: The iTunes Store (see Chapter 7).
 
✓ Devices section: Your iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV appear listed here 
when connected, as well as an audio CD when inserted into your 
computer. When you select a device such as an iPod, iTunes displays the 
summary page with synchronization options. See Chapter 9 for details 
on navigating the library on an iPod set for managing content manually.
 
✓ Shared section: Shared iTunes libraries on your home network appear 
here, as I describe in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Genius section: The Genius Mix and any Genius playlists you generate 
appear in this section. See Chapter 14 for details on using the Genius 
Mix and Genius playlists.
 
✓ Playlist section: Smart playlists and regular playlists appear in this

tinually change a playlist of random songs. See Chapter 13 for details on 
iTunes DJ, and Chapter 14 for the player’s guide to playlists.
Overwhelmed by all the content in the List pane? Try browsing. iTunes offers 
three View buttons in the upper-right corner for browsing your content in the 
List pane:
 
✓ List (the left button, or choose View➪As List) shows items in a list. 
You’ve seen this before in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Grid (the center button, or choose View➪As Grid) shows thumbnail 
cover art images in a grid, as shown in Figure 11-1. Select a thumbnail of 
an album to select the album. Double-click a thumbnail to display a list 
of albums with an artwork column.
 
✓ Cover Flow (the right button, or choose View➪As Cover Flow) shows the 
cover browser, also known as Cover Flow, as described in the next section.
 
In List view, choose View➪Show Column Browser to show the browser, which 
displays columns you can browse to easily find items. The browser appears in 
the top part of the List pane (peek ahead to Figure 11-3 to see it). To make the 
browser disappear and see your content in a full list, choose View➪Hide 
Column Browser. You can also display songs in a list with the album cover art 
by choosing View➪Show Artwork Column. (Turn this off by choosing 
View➪Hide Artwork Column.)

Cover Flow
Browsing by cover art with Cover Flow
Does viewing a cover whet your appetite for the music, story, or video 
inside? Of course it does. Covers provide a context that simply can’t be put 
into words or conveyed by sound. One fantastic innovation of iTunes is how 
it integrates cover art from albums, books, podcasts, and videos with your 
library so that you can flip through your content to find items based on the 
artwork. Figure 11-2 shows the iTunes window using Cover Flow view to 
display the Music portion of the iTunes library.
To select Cover Flow, click the rightmost of the three View buttons in the 
upper-right corner of the iTunes window. You can also show the cover 
browser by choosing View➪As Cover Flow.
Cover Flow lets you flip through your cover art to select music, movies, TV 
shows, podcasts, and audio books. (The cover browser doesn’t work with 
ringtones or radio stations.) Just drag the slider to scroll swiftly through 
your library or click to the right or left of the cover art in the foreground to 
move forward or backward, respectively. When you scroll or click through 

183
 Chapter 11: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
cover art, the content items in the List pane also change. Double-click the 
foreground cover art to start playing the first item — whether it’s an album’s 
first song, a movie, the first chapter of an audio book, or the first episode of a 
TV show.
Click the Browse Full-Screen button to display Cover Flow, um, full-screen. 
You can still click a cover to select an album, click within each cover to move 
forward and backward, and use the cover browser’s slider to navigate your 
library. iTunes also offers a volume control slider to set the audio volume 
while browsing full-screen cover art. Press Esc (Escape) or click the Browse 
Full-Screen button (with its arrows pointing inward) in the lower-right corner 
of the display to stop displaying the cover browser full-screen and return to 
the iTunes window.
To fill your library automatically with cover art, get yourself an iTunes Store 
account (if you don’t already have one). Log in to your account; then choose 
Advanced➪Get Album Artwork. iTunes grabs the cover art not only for 
content downloaded from the iTunes Store — including movies, TV shows, 
audio books, and podcasts — but also for CDs you ripped, provided that 
the albums are also available in the iTunes Store. Even if you downloaded or 
ripped only one song of an album, you get the album’s cover art for that song.

You can also get your cover art from other places that sell CDs, audio books, 
and DVDs (including Amazon.com) or even scan it from the actual CDs, DVDs, 
or books. You can then add cover art from a scanned or downloaded image 
file to any content item in your iTunes library, as I describe in Chapter 12. 
The optimal size for cover art is 300 x 300 pixels.
Browsing songs by artist and album
To select List view, click the leftmost of the three View buttons in the upper-
right corner of the iTunes window. You can also choose View➪As List.
To browse music in your library in List view, select Music in the Source pane 
in the Library section. The List view shows the title of each song in the Name 
column, the artist or band name in the Artist column, and the title of the 
album in the Album column. To browse the list, choose View➪Show Column 
Browser. To hide the browser, choose View➪Hide Column Browser. Browser.
The Column Browser in List view organizes music content into Genres, 
Artists, Albums, Composers, and Groupings columns — you can choose 
which columns to display by choosing View➪Column Browser and selecting 
each category to show (or deselecting each category to remove). For exam-
ple, in Figure 11-3, I show the Genres, Artists, and Albums columns, and I also 
display the Artwork Column by choosing View➪Show Artwork Column. (Turn 
this off by choosing View➪Hide Artwork Column.)
The Column Browser appears in the leftmost column by default or if you 
choose View➪Column Browser➪On Left (as described in Chapter 6). The 
Genres, Artists, and Albums columns appear from left to right, with the song 
list in the far right column. When you select an album, iTunes displays only 
the songs for that album in the far right column.
You can switch the Column Browser to appear in the top part of the List 
pane, as shown in Figure 11-3, if you choose View➪Column Browser➪On Top. 
This view is useful if your display is not very wide.
Select a genre in the Genres column to see artists in that genre in the Artists 
column, or select All at the top of the column to see all artists for all genres. 
When you select an artist in the Artists column (refer to Figure 11-3), the 
album titles appear in the Album column (on the right). When you select an 
album, iTunes displays only the songs for that album in the List pane below 
the Column Browser.

Figure 11-3: 
Select an 
artist to see 
the list of 
albums for 
that artist.
 
 
To see more than one album from an artist at a time, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl 
(Windows) while clicking each album name.
After selecting an album in the Albums column, the songs in the List pane are 
listed in the proper album track order, just as the artist, producer, or record 
label intended.
If you don’t get track information from the Internet for each song on a CD 
that you’re ready to rip (as I show dramatically in Chapter 6), or if you don’t 
add the track information yourself via the content item’s information dialog 
(as I describe in wondrous detail in Chapter 12), iTunes displays only a blank 
space for the artist and album name along with Track 01 and so on for each 
track. That makes browsing for a song or artist by name difficult, to say the 
least.
 
To see all the songs in the library in the browser, select All at the top of each 
of the columns — Genres, Artists, and Albums. You can also switch to Grid 
(refer to Figure 11-1) or to Cover Flow view (refer to Figure 11-2) to show the 
album cover art.

Part III: Managing Your Library 
Browsing audio books
If you don’t see Audiobooks in the Library section of the Source pane, choose 
iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows), click the General 
tab at the top of the Preferences window, select the Audiobooks option next 
to the Show heading, and click the OK button. The Audiobooks option then 
appears in the Source pane in the Library section.
To browse the audio books in your library, select Audiobooks in the Source 
pane. You can browse audio book titles and authors with the Column Browser 
in List view, or browse cover art in Grid or Cover Flow view. The List view 
shows the title of each book with its part number (long books typically have 
multiple parts) in the Name column and the author’s name in the Authors 
column. If you add the Albums column heading to the Column Browser or to 
List view (as I describe in the section “Changing the List view options,” later 
in this chapter), the title of the book appears in the Albums column. 
Browsing podcasts
To browse podcasts, select Podcasts in the Library section of the Source 
pane. You can browse podcast episodes with the Column Browser in List 
view, or browse cover art in Grid or Cover Flow view. You can then see the 
episodes of a podcast by clicking the podcast, and in List view, clicking 
the triangle next to the podcast name. For details on playing episodes, see 
Chapter 13.
The List view shows the title of each podcast and its episodes in the Podcast 
column. The mysterious blue dot next to a podcast means that you haven’t 
played one or more episodes of the podcast yet. (The same blue dot appears 
next to each unplayed episode.) As soon as you start listening to or watching 
a podcast, the dot turns into a half-moon until you complete the episode 
(accompanied by the theme of The Twilight Zone).
You can click the i icon on the far-right podcast listing margin in List view to 
display separate information about the podcast’s newest episode.
Browsing movies, videos, and TV shows
To browse movies, select Movies in the Library section of the Source pane. 
Any video files you add to your library from sources other than the iTunes 
Store are classified as movies — but you can change their media type as I 
describe in Chapter 12 so that, for example, a video shows up as a TV show 
rather than a movie. You can also find in the Movies listing those movies and 
short films you downloaded from the iTunes Store.

187
 Chapter 11: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
You can browse movies, TV shows, and videos with the Column Browser in 
List view, or browse cover art in Grid or Cover Flow view. The Grid view (as 
shown in Figure 11-4) and the Cover Flow view show the first key frame of the 
movie or the box cover art for the movie.
You can browse TV shows by selecting TV Shows in the Library section of the 
Source pane. The List view shows the episode title, show title, and season 
number. The Column Browser in List view organizes TV shows by Genres, 
Shows, and Seasons. The Grid and Cover Flow views show the promotional 
cover art for the TV show.
Browsing applications and iPod games
The applications you download for your iPod touch or iPhone, along with 
the games you download for your iPod classic or iPod nano (or older 
model iPod), show up in the Applications section of your iTunes library. 
Applications for the iPod touch and iPhone are available in the App Store, 
and games for the iPod nano, iPod classic, and older models are in the iTunes 
Store (see Chapter 7 for glorious details). And although you can’t run the 
applications or play the games in iTunes, you can browse the list of applications 
and games you downloaded.
If you don’t see Applications in the Library section of the Source pane, 
choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows), click 
the General tab at the top of the Preferences window, select the Applications 
option from the list of options for the Show heading, and click the OK button. 
The Applications option then appears in the Source pane in the Library section.
To browse iPod touch or iPhone applications, or iPod classic and iPod nano 
“click wheel” games, select Applications in the Source pane. Applications are 
classified by genre according to the App Store categories, and these genres 
appear in the Genre category in List view. The iPod Games genre refers to 
any “click wheel” games you download for your iPod classic or iPod nano 
(or older model iPod). The applications in Grid view are separated into two 
sections: one for iPhone and iPod touch Apps, and the other for iPod Games. 
The Grid and Cover Flow views show the promotional cover art for the 
application.
 
In case you’re a closet gamer without an iPod touch or iPhone, visit this 
book’s companion Web site for details on how to play games on your iPod 
classic or iPod nano.

Column Browser to hide it. You can also display cover art in List view by 
choosing View➪Show Artwork Column, or hide the cover art by choosing

iTunes displays a playlist as a song list in the List pane, even if it includes 
other content items. The column headings for playlists have different 
meanings for the following types of content:
 
✓ Songs and music videos: The Name is the title of the song; the Artist is 
the band, artist, or performer. The Album is the title of the CD or vinyl 
record on which the song appeared. For music videos, the Name is 
typically the title of a song in the music video.
 
✓ Podcasts: The Name is the title of the podcast episode (as in “Ballad 
Roots of California Folk-Rock”), the Artist is the name of the podcast 
author (as in Tony Bove) or producer (such as Chicago Public Radio), 
and the Album is the name of the podcast (as in Rockument).

189
 Chapter 11: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
 
✓ Audio books: The Album is typically the book’s title (as in Fear and 
Loathing in Las Vegas), and the Name is typically the title of one of the 
parts (as in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas–Part 1 of 3).
 
✓ TV shows: The Name is the name of the TV show episode (as in “Mr. 
Monk and the Airplane”), the Artist is the name of the show (as in 
Monk), and the Album is the season (as in Monk, Season 1).
Changing the List view options
iTunes lets you customize the List view in the List pane for each type of 
content. For music, the list starts out with the Name, Art, Time, Artist, Album, 
Genre, Rating, and Play Count columns. You might have to drag the horizon-
tal scroll bar along the bottom of the song list to see all these columns. You 
can display more, less, or different information in your song list.
Customize your List view in the following ways:
 
✓ Make a column wider or narrower. While you move your cursor over 
the divider between two columns, the cursor changes to a vertical bar 
with opposing arrows extending left and right; you can click and drag 
the divider to change the column’s width.
 
✓ Change the order of columns. Click a column heading and drag the 
entire column to the left or right.
 
 You can’t change the position of the Name column and the narrow 
column to its left, which displays indicators and shows the playlist 
order.
 
✓ Add or remove columns. You can add or remove any column except 
Name and the playlist order:
 
a. Select the type of content in the Source pane in the Library 
section (Music, Movies, TV Shows, , iTunes U, Podcasts, 
Audiobooks, Ringtones, or Radio) and choose View➪View Options.
 
b. Select the columns that you want to appear in the list from the 
View Options dialog (as shown in Figure 11-5 for Music).
 
You can also change which columns are visible by Control-clicking (on a Mac)
or right-clicking (in Windows) any column heading in the list in either Browse 
view or List view.
 
Enabling the Kind column in the View Options dialog can help you keep track 
of different kinds of files, such as songs encoded as AIFF, AAC, or MP3 or 
videos encoded in QuickTime or MPEG.

Sorting Content by the List View Options
With just a little know-how, you can use the List view options to sort the 
listing of content items. You can sort items not only by name or album but 
also by composer, the date the items were added to the library, or other 
information that you can add to an item (as I describe in Chapter 12).
At the very least, you can sort the content by the column headings you now 
use in the List view. You can also add other column headings to your List 
view (as I describe in the previous section) and sort with them.
For example, clicking the Time heading reorders the items by their duration 
in ascending order, from shortest to longest. If you click the Time heading 
again, the sort is in descending order, which is reversed, starting with the 
longest item. You can sort by any column heading, such as Artist, Album, 
Track, Date Added, and Ratings.
You can tell whether the sort is in ascending or descending order by the 
little arrow indicator in the heading. When the arrow points up, the sort is in 
ascending order; when pointing down, it’s in descending order.
 
You can always sort a list using the old standby, alphabetical order. Click 
the Artist heading to sort the items in the list by artist name in alphabetical 
order (arrow pointing up). Click it again to sort the list in reverse alpha-
betical order (arrow pointing down).
iTunes also lets you sort the song list via the Album column. Each time you 
click Album, the heading cycles through each of the following options:

191
 Chapter 11: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
 
✓ Album, which sorts alphabetically by album title.
 
✓ Album by Artist, which groups albums by artist and then lists them 
alphabetically.
 
✓ Album by Year, which groups albums by artist and then lists them 
chronologically by year (set in the Song Information dialog).
iTunes keeps track of the songs, audio books, and podcasts you skip — not 
to be polite, just to be useful. You can use this feature to sort the Music and 
Audiobooks lists of your library in List view, thereby making it easier to 
select and delete the items you skip.
Searching for Content
Because your iTunes library will most likely grow, you might find the usual 
browsing and scrolling methods that I describe earlier in this chapter too 
time-consuming. Let iTunes find your content for you!
 
If you want to search the entire library with the Column Browser open in List 
view, select All at the top of the Genres and Artists columns to browse the 
entire library before typing a term in the Search field. Or, if you prefer, choose 
View➪Hide Browser to show the List view without the browser. (For a peek at 
what that looks like, see Figure 11-6.)
Locate the Search field — the oval field in the upper-right corner — and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click in the Search field and enter several characters of your search 
term.
 
 Use these tips for successful searching:
 
• Specify your search with a specific title, artist, or album.
 
• Narrow your search by typing more characters. Using fewer 
characters results in a longer list of possible songs.
 
• Case doesn’t matter, nor do whole words. The Search feature ignores 
case. For example, when I search for miles, iTunes finds a long list 
that includes “Eight Miles High,” “Forty Miles of Bad Road,” and 
“She Smiles like a River,” as well as everything by Miles Davis.
 
2. Look through the results, which display while you type.
 
 The search operation works immediately, as shown in Figure 11-6, 
displaying any matches in the Name, Artist, and Album columns.
 
3. Scroll through the search results and then click an item to select it.

192
Part III: Managing Your Library 
To back out of a search so that the full list appears again, you can either 
click the circled X in the Search field (which appears after you start typing 
characters) or delete what you typed. You then see the entire list in the List 
pane, just like before you began your search. All the items are still there and 
remain there unless you explicitly remove them. Searching manipulates only 
your view of the items.
 
Figure 11-6: 
Search for 
anything by 
typing any 
part of the 
name, artist, 
album, or 
title.
 
Finding the Content’s Media File
Getting lost in a large library is easy. While you browse your library, you 
might want to return quickly to view the current item playing. While your file 
plays, choose View➪Go to Current Song (or press Ô-L on a Mac or Ctrl-L in 
Windows as a shortcut). iTunes shows you the item that’s playing.
You can also show the location of the media file for any content item. This 
trick comes in handy when you want to open the media file’s folder. On 
a Mac, choose File➪Show in Finder (or press Ô-R); in Windows, choose 
File➪Show in Windows Explorer (or press Ctrl-R). iTunes gives control to the 
operating system (Mac or Windows), which displays the folder that contains 
the media file.

193
 Chapter 11: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes
Showing Duplicate Items
Because your library will grow, you’ll probably want to check for duplications. 
Some songs that appear on artist CDs also appear on compilation or soundtrack 
CDs. If you rip them all, you could have duplicate songs that take up space on 
your hard drive. You might even have duplicate videos and audio books.
On the other hand, maybe you want to find different versions of the same 
song by the same artist. Even when the songs appear on different albums, 
iTunes can quickly find all the songs with the same title by the same artist.
To show duplicate items in the list, choose File➪Show Duplicates. iTunes 
displays all the duplicate items in the List pane in the order of the last sort. 
(For example, if you last sorted by Album, the items appear in Album order.) 
If you’re using the Column Browser in List view, you see all the duplicate 
items in artist order. Click the artist to see the duplicate items specifically for 
that artist.
To stop showing duplicate items and return to your previous view, click the 
Show All button below the list of duplicates.
Deleting Content
Deleting content might seem counterproductive when you’re trying to build 
your iTunes library, but sometimes you just have to do it. For example, you 
might want to delete the following:
 
✓ Versions of songs: You might have ripped a CD twice — say, once in AIFF 
format to burn the songs onto another CD and once in AAC format for 
your library and iPod or iPhone. You can delete the AIFF versions in your 
library after burning your CD (see Chapter 15 for burning instructions).
 
 Items from playlists: You can delete items from playlists yet keep the 
items in your library. When you delete an item from a playlist, the item is 
simply deleted from the list — not from the library. You can delete entire 
playlists as well without harming the content in the library. You have to 
select a media category in the Library section in the Source pane first, 
to delete content from the library. (See Chapter 14 for more information 
about playlists.)

194
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
✓ Anything you are embarrassed to have in your library or simply don’t 
want.
 
 You can select any content item and remove it from your iTunes library. 
You then have a choice of keeping the item’s file on your hard drive in 
the same folder, or transferring it to the Trash (on a Mac) or Recycle Bin 
(on a Windows PC) to delete it entirely.
To delete a song, iTunes lecture, video, audio book, application, or an entire 
album or artist, select the media type (Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, 
iTunes U, Audiobooks, Applications, Ringtones, or Radio) and then select the 
item (or select an artist for the artist’s entire oeuvre, or an album to select 
the entire album). Press Delete/Backspace (or choose Edit➪Delete) to delete.
 
You can select a single TV show episode and then choose Edit➪Delete All to 
delete all episodes.
 
You can select a single episode of a podcast and then choose Edit➪Delete 
All to delete all episodes but keep the podcast itself so that you are still 
subscribed to the podcast. If you delete the podcast, you remove it from your 
library, and you have to resubscribe to it to get it back. If you delete an 
episode, you can get it back by clicking the Get button next to the episode.
Deleting a content item from the iTunes library removes the item from your 
library, but it doesn’t remove it from your hard drive until you agree. In the 
first warning dialog that appears, click the Remove button to remove the 
selected items from the library or click the Cancel button. iTunes then 
displays a second warning about moving the files that are still in the iTunes 
Music folder to the Trash (Mac) or Recycle Bin (Windows). You can click 
the Move to Trash button on a Mac, or the Move to Recycle Bin button in 
Windows, to trash the item. Click Keep File to keep it in your music folder, or 
click Cancel to cancel the operation.
If you choose to move content to the Trash or Recycle Bin, the content is 
not yet deleted from your hard drive — you can recover the files by copying 
them out of the Trash or Recycle Bin, or you can empty them to delete them 
permanently.
 
You can delete multiple items in one clean sweep. Press Shift while you click a 
range of items. Alternatively, press Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) when you click 
individual items to add them to the selection. Then press Delete/Backspace 
(or choose Edit➪Delete).

Chapter 12
Adding and Editing Information 
in iTunes
In This Chapter
▶ Retrieving information online
▶ Editing information for each content item
▶ Adding information, cover art, comments, and ratings
O
rganization depends on information. You expect your computer to 
do a lot more for you than just store a song with Track 01 as the only 
identifier. Not only can iTunes retrieve the song’s track information from the 
Internet, but it can also find the cover art for you.
Adding all the information for your iTunes content seems like a lot of trouble, 
but you can get most of the information automatically from the Internet — 
and without all that pesky typing. Adding track information is important 
because you certainly don’t want to mistakenly play Frank Zappa’s “My 
Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama” when trying to impress your classical music 
teacher with the third movement of Tchaikovsky’s Pathétique Symphony, do 
you? And because videos you make yourself or convert from other sources 
don’t have this automatic information, you have to enter some description to 
tell them apart.
This chapter shows you how to add information to your content library in 
iTunes and edit it for better viewing so that you can organize your content 
by artist, album name, genre, composer, and ratings. You can then use this 
information to sort your content in List view or Browse view by clicking the 
column headings. This chapter also describes how to add cover art for 
navigating your library with Cover Flow.

196
Part III: Managing Your Library 
Retrieving Song Information 
from the Internet
Why bother entering information if someone else has already done it for you? 
You can easily get information about most music CDs from the Internet (that 
is, assuming you can connect to the Internet). The online database available 
for iTunes users holds information for millions of songs on commercial CDs 
and even some bootleg CDs.
Retrieving information automatically
When you pop a commercial music CD into your computer running iTunes, 
iTunes automatically looks up the track information for that CD on the 
Internet and fills in the information fields (name, artist, album, and so on). 
You don’t need to do anything to make this happen. You can also edit the 
information after iTunes fills in the fields.
If your computer doesn’t access the Internet automatically, you might want 
to turn off this automatic information retrieval. (You can always retrieve 
the information manually, as I describe in the next section.) To turn off the 
retrieval of track information, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
 The iTunes Preferences dialog appears with buttons along the top.
 
2. Click the General tab (if it’s not already selected).
 
 The General preferences appear.
 
3. Deselect the Automatically Retrieve CD Track Names from Internet 
option.
 
 With this option turned on, iTunes connects to the Internet automatically 
and retrieves the track information. When turned off, iTunes doesn’t 
retrieve the information, but you can retrieve it manually. (Cue the next 
section!)
Retrieving information manually
You can connect manually to the Internet at any time (for example, by using 
a modem connection) and retrieve the song information when you’re ready 
to use it. After you connect to the Internet, choose Advanced➪Get CD Track 
Names.

 Chapter 12: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
Entering Content Information
You have to enter the information for certain media, including CDs that aren’t 
known by the Gracenote CDDB, custom CD-Rs, and videos and audio books 
that you bring into iTunes from sources other than the iTunes Store. No big 
deal, though; just follow these steps:
 
1. Click directly in the information field (such as Artist). 
 
2. Click again so that the mouse pointer toggles to an editing cursor — 
but not so quickly that the track starts playing.
 
3. Type text directly into the information field.
 
After grabbing the song information from the Internet or typing it, iTunes 
keeps track of the information for the CD even if you just play the CD 
without importing it. The next time you insert the CD, the song information is 
automatically filled in.
Using the Gracenote database
The first time I popped a commercial music CD 
into a computer, song information appeared like 
magic. iTunes automatically displayed the song 
names, album title, and artist names. How did it 
know? This information isn’t stored on a stan-
dard music CD in digital form, but iTunes has to 
recognize the disc somehow.
The magic is that the software knows how 
to reach out and find the information on the 
Internet — in the Gracenote CDDB service. 
CDDB stands for (you guessed it) CD Database. 
The site (www.gracenote.com) hosts 
CDDB on the Web and searches for music CDs 
by artist, song title, and other methods. The 
iTunes software already knows how to use this 
database so you don’t have to!
Gracenote recognizes an audio CD by taking 
into account the number, sequence, and 
duration of tracks. (This is how the database 
recognizes CD-Rs that are burned with the 
identical songs in the same order.) The data-
base keeps track of information for most of the 
music CDs that you find on the market.
The database doesn’t contain any information 
about personal or custom CDs unless people 
submit information to the database about 
such CDs. You can submit information about 
your personal or custom CDs by using iTunes: 
Type the information for each track while the 
audio CD is in your computer and then choose 
Advanced➪Submit CD Track Names. The infor-
mation that you enter is sent to the Gracenote 
CDDB site, where the good people who work 
tirelessly on the database check out your infor-
mation before including it. In fact, if you spot a 
typo or something erroneous in the information 
that you receive from the Gracenote CDDB, you 
can easily correct it. Just use the Submit CD 
Track Names command to send the corrected 
version back to the Gracenote site. The good 
folks at Gracenote appreciate the effort.

Part III: Managing Your Library 
Editing the Information
Retrieving ready-made song information from the Internet is a great help, 
but you might not always like the format it comes in. Maybe you want to edit 
artist and band names or other information the way I do — I like to list solo 
artists by last name rather than by first name. (Gracenote CDDB lists artists 
by first name.) For example, I routinely change Miles Davis to Davis, Miles.
Other annoyances sometimes occur when bands feature The at the beginning 
of their names, such as The Who, The Band, The Beatles, and The Beach 
Boys. Even though these names sort correctly (in alphabetical order, under 
their proper names), I dislike having The before the band name, so I routinely 
remove it.
You might also want to change the information that is supplied by the iTunes 
Store for the movies, TV shows, music videos, audio books, and podcasts 
you download. And if you obtain your content from other sources, you might 
need to add information for the first time.
You can edit the content information by clicking directly in the specific 
track’s field (such as the Artist field) and then clicking again so that the 
mouse pointer toggles to an editing cursor. You can then select the text and 
type over it — or use the Copy, Cut, and Paste commands on the Edit menu — 
to move tiny bits of text around within the field. As you can see in Figure 12-1, 
I changed the Artist field to Beck, Jeff.
 
Figure 12-1: 
Click inside 
a field to 
edit the 
information.
 
You can edit the Name, Artist, Album, Genre, and Ratings fields in the list. 
However, editing this information by choosing File➪Get Info is easier. Keep 
reading to find out why.

199
 Chapter 12: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
Editing multiple items at once
Editing in the content list is fine if you’re editing the information for one item, 
but typically you need to change all the tracks of an audio CD. For example, 
if a CD of songs by Bob Dylan is listed with the artist as Bob Dylan, you 
might want to change all the songs at once to Dylan, Bob. Changing all the 
information in one fell swoop is fast and clean, but like most powerful 
shortcuts, you need to be careful because it can be dangerous.
Follow these steps to change a group of items at once:
 
1. Select a group of content items by clicking the first item and then 
pressing Shift while you click the last item.
 
 All the items between the first and last are highlighted. You can extend a 
selection by Shift-clicking other items or add to a selection by Ô-clicking 
(Mac) or Ctrl-clicking (Windows). You can also remove items already 
selected by Ô-clicking (Mac) or Ctrl-clicking (Windows).
 
2. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ô-I (Mac) or Ctrl-I (Windows).
 
 A warning message displays:
 
 Are you sure you want to edit information for multiple 
items?
 
 Speed-editing the information in multiple items at once can be dangerous 
for your library organization. If, for example, you change an informational 
snippet for one item in a selected group (the song or movie title, for 
example), the corresponding snippet for all items in the selected group 
is going to change as well! Be careful about what you edit when using 
this method.
 
3. Click the Yes button to edit information for multiple items.
 
 The Multiple Item Information dialog appears, as shown in Figure 12-2.
 
4. Edit the field you want to change for all the items.
 
 When you edit a field, a check mark appears automatically in the check 
box next to the field. iTunes assumes that you want that field changed 
in all the selected items. Make sure that no other check box is selected 
except the ones for the fields that you want.
 
5. Click the OK button to make the change.
 
 iTunes changes the field for the entire selection of items.

200
Part III: Managing Your Library

iTunes offers both Artist and Album Artist fields for a song so that you can 
include the album artist name if it’s different — such as the artist name for a 
compilation album that features songs by different artists (for example, Eric 
Clapton’s Crossroads box set, in which the Album Artist is Clapton but the 
Artist for each song might be the Yardbirds, Cream, Blind Faith, and so on). 
You can also use this field for Artist name formatted differently; for example, 
the Artist field could have the artist as Bob Dylan and the Album Artist as 
Dylan, Bob. You can then change the list view options (as I describe in Chapter 
11) to include the Album Artist field as a column for sorting the song list.
Editing fields for a single item
Although the track information grabbed from the Internet is enough for 
identifying a song in your iTunes library, some facts — such as composer 
credits — might not be included. Adding composer credits is usually worth 
your effort because you can then search and sort by composer and create 
playlists based on the composer. Videos (movies, TV shows, and music 
videos), podcasts, and audio books might also have information in their 
fields that you want to change or have blank fields that could use some 
helpful information.
To get a look at (and edit) what Gracenote CDDB has provided about an 
item select the item and then choose File➪Get Info (or press Ô-I on a Mac 
or Ctrl-I in Windows). You see the item’s information dialog, as shown in 
Figure 12-3.

201
 Chapter 12: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
 
Figure 12-3: 
A song’s 
information 
dialog.
 
 
When you select one item, its information dialog appears and your edits affect 
only one item; when you select multiple items, the Multiple Item Information 
dialog appears and your edits affect multiple items.
A selection’s information dialog offers the following tabs:
 
✓ Summary: The Summary tab (as shown in Figure 12-3) offers useful 
information about the media file format and location on your hard drive, 
the file size, and the digital compression method (along with bit rate, 
sample rate, and other settings).
 
✓ Info: The Info tab allows you to change the name, artist, composer, 
album, genre, year, and other information. You can also add comments, 
as shown in Figure 12-4.
 
✓ Video: The Video tab lets you enter information to describe the video. 
The information fields are set up for TV shows, including the title of the 
show, episode number and ID, and season number, but you can skip 
them for movies and music videos and just add a description.
 
✓ Sorting: The Sorting tab allows you to add information to fields for addi-
tional choices while sorting your library content. For example, you can 
add a different name for the artist in the Sort Artist field to the right of 
the Artist field, such as Dylan, Bob for Bob Dylan. Information from the 
Info tab appears on the left side, and you can add an alternative sort 
field on the right side. You can even add a Show field for the title of a 
concert or some other use. Choose View➪View Options to select a sort 
field as a List view option, and then you can sort your content in List 
view by using the sort fields.

202

mation from 
the Info tab.
 
 
✓ Options: The Options tab, as shown in Figure 12-5, offers the following:
 
• Volume Adjustment: You can set the volume for a song, video, 
podcast, or audio book in advance so that it always plays at that 
volume (or lower, if your overall iTunes or iPod/iPhone volume 
is set lower). Drag the slider to the right to increase the volume 
adjustment up to 100% (twice the usual volume); drag the slider to 
the left to decrease the volume adjustment to –100% (half the usual 
volume). For more details on setting the volume in advance, see 
Chapter 13.
 
• Equalizer Preset: Choose an equalizer preset for an item. See 
Chapter 13 for details on using the Equalizer in iTunes, and Chapter 16 
on how you can use an Equalizer preset to control how an item 
sounds on your iPod or iPhone.
 
• Media Kind: Set (or change) the type of media. For example, after 
importing a video, you can change its Media Kind to movie, TV 
show, or music video.
 
• Rating: Assign up to five stars to an item as a rating. (See how in 
the next section.)
 
• Start Time and Stop Time: Set the start and stop times for an item. 
You can use these options to cut unwanted intros and outros of a 
song (such as announcers, audience applause, and tuning up), or 
to skip opening credits or commercials of movies. You can also use 
it in conjunction with the Convert feature to split an item (or, in the 
parlance of record label executives and artists, split a track) into 
multiple items (tracks).

203
 Chapter 12: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
 
 Visit this book’s companion Web site for details on setting start 
and stop times and using the iTunes equalizer.
 
• Remember Playback Position: Set this option for an item so that 
when you select and play the item, iTunes resumes playing it from 
where you left off. This option is usually turned on for audio books, 
movies, and TV shows.
 
• Skip When Shuffling: Set this option for an item to be skipped from 
Party Shuffle.
 
• Part of a Gapless Album: Set this option for an item to be played 
back without a gap between songs. (See Chapter 8 to find out 
about the gaps between songs.)
 
✓ Lyrics: The Lyrics tab offers a text field for typing or pasting lyrics (or 
any text). Some songs in the iTunes Store are supplied with lyrics — you 
can find them here.
 
 You can view lyrics on an iPod touch or iPhone by starting a song and 
then, while the song is playing, tapping the song’s album cover. To see 
lyrics on an iPod nano or iPod classic, start playing a song and then 
press the Select button several times until you see the lyrics. On an iPod 
nano, the first press shows the scrubber bar, the second shows ratings, 
the third shows the Shuffle slider, and the fourth shows the lyrics. If you 
press the Select button too many times, the iPod returns to the Now 
Playing display.
 
✓ Artwork: The Artwork tab allows you to add or delete artwork for the 
item. See the upcoming section “Adding Cover Art.”

Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
If you follow the careers of certain guitarists, vocalists, or session musicians, 
you can sort your music in List view by something other than the given artist 
for the album. First, provide a new entry for the Sort Artist or Sort Album 
Artist fields on the Sorting tab, and then choose that field as a view option so 
that you can sort on it. For example, I like to use the Sort Artist field for the 
leader, lead guitarist, or lead singer in a band, or a session player or special 
guest (such as Nicky Hopkins, who played keyboards on a variety of albums 
by different bands including The Who, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles). 
After entering Nicky Hopkins into the Sort Artist field for the songs, I can 
choose View➪View Options and select Sort Artist for a column heading. I can 
then sort the List view by clicking the new Sort Artist heading to find all 
recordings featuring Nicky Hopkins.
You can apply the entry of a sort field on the Sorting tab to all the tracks of 
the same album or to all tracks by the same artist, album artist, composer, 
or show. After changing the sort field for an item on the Sorting tab, select 
the item in List view, Control-click (Mac) or right-click (Windows) the item to 
display the contextual menu, and then choose Apply Sort Field. Click Yes to 
make the change.
 
To move through an album one item at a time when using Get Info (without 
closing and reopening the information dialog), click the Previous or Next 
buttons in the lower-left corner of the dialog.
Adding a rating
iTunes allows you to rate your content. The cool thing about ratings is that 
they’re yours. You can use ratings to mean anything you want. For example, 
you can rate songs based on how much you like them, whether your mother 
would listen to them, or how they blend into a work environment. You can 
also rate videos based on your watching habits, as well as audio books and 
podcasts.
To add a rating to a content item, click the Options tab (refer to Figure 12-5) 
and drag inside the My Rating field to add stars. The upper limit is five stars 
(for the best). You can also select the item and choose File➪Rating to assign 
a rating to an item, or display a Ratings column in List view to assign ratings. 
(See Chapter 11 for details on changing the view options.)
You might have noticed the My Top Rated playlist in the Source pane. This 
playlist is an example of a smart playlist — a playlist that updates when 
ratings are changed. The My Top Rated playlist plays all the top-rated songs 
in your library. You can find out more about playlists in Chapter 14.

205
 Chapter 12: Adding and Editing Information in iTunes
Adding Cover Art
iTunes displays the cover art for your albums, videos, movies, podcasts, 
audio books, and TV shows in the Cover Flow browser. (See Chapter 11 for 
details.) All current iPod models and the iPhone, and even Apple TV, all 
display the cover art. So it makes sense to get the art, especially because it’s 
free!
Items that you buy from the iTunes Store typically include an image of the 
album, book, or box cover art or a photo of the artist that serves as cover 
art. You can see the artwork in the lower-left corner of the iTunes window 
by clicking the Show/Hide Artwork button, (the rightmost button in the row 
of four buttons at the bottom of the iTunes window on the left side).  The 
artwork changes for each item or album that you select or play. You can 
toggle between displaying the cover art of the item playing to the cover art 
of a selected item by clicking the right arrow (or the words Now Playing) 
above the cover art view in iTunes. Toggle back to displaying the cover 
art of the now-playing item by clicking the right arrow again (or the words 
Selected Item).
To fill your library automatically with cover art for the CDs you ripped, get 
yourself an iTunes Store account if you don’t already have one. Log in to your 
account and then choose Advanced➪Get Album Artwork. iTunes grabs the 
cover art not only for iTunes Store purchases, but also for CDs you ripped — 
provided that the albums are also available in the iTunes Store.
 
To download cover art for ripped CDs automatically after ripping them 
(without having to manually choose Advanced➪Get Album Artwork each 
time), choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences in Windows, 
click the Store tab, and select the Automatically Download Missing Album 
Artwork option.
You can also get your cover art from other places that sell CDs, such as 
Amazon.com, or you can even scan them from the actual CDs. The optimal 
size for cover art is 300 x 300 pixels. Save it in a graphics format that iTunes 
(and its underlying graphics technology, QuickTime) understands — JPEG, 
GIF, PNG, TIFF, or Photoshop. With a Web browser, you can visit Web pages 
to scout for suitable art; just Control-click (Mac) or right-click (Windows) an 
image to download and save the image on your hard drive. With Safari on 
a Mac and some browsers (such as Firefox) in Windows, you can drag the 
image directly from the Web browser window into the iTunes art pane.
To add artwork to one or more items, select it (or them) in your iTunes 
library and do one of the following:

206
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
✓ Drag the artwork’s image file from a Desktop folder into the artwork 
viewing area (the lower-left corner of the iTunes window).
 
 To add artwork for an entire album (rather than just individual songs) 
or season of TV shows, first select the album or season in the Column 
Browser or select all the items in List view. Then drag the image file into 
the artwork viewing area.
 
✓ Add artwork to a single item through the information window.
 
 Choose File➪Get Info and then click the Artwork tab in the Get Info 
dialog. Click the Add button, browse your hard drive or network for the 
image file, select the file, and then click the OK button.
 
✓ Add artwork for multiple items in the Multiple Item Information 
dialog.
 
 Choose File➪Get Info after selecting the items, enable the Artwork field 
(select its check box), and then drag a graphics file for the cover art 
from a Desktop folder to the Artwork well. Click the Yes button for the 
warning message to change the artwork.
 
 See the section “Editing multiple items at once,” earlier in this chapter, 
to find out more about using the Multiple Item Information dialog.
To remove the artwork from an item, view the artwork in a larger window or 
resize the artwork, choose File➪Get Info, and then click the Artwork tab. You 
can add a different image with the Add button, delete images with the Delete 
button, or resize images with the size slider.

I
f you like to entertain folks by spinning tunes and playing videos at home 
or at parties, iTunes could easily become your media jockey console. With 
iTunes, your computer is a mean multimedia machine that can mix sounds, 
photos, and videos. And even if you’ve never mastered a stereo system 
beyond adjusting the bass, treble, and volume, you can quickly and easily 
fine-tune the sound in iTunes, and even adjust the volume and equalizer 
settings for each song, video, audio book, and podcast.
But that’s not all: You can also use iTunes to play video on your computer’s 
display, or you can send it to a larger television or display monitor — even 
a video projector — to get a bigger picture. And if you’ve integrated Apple 
TV with your home audio system and television, you can use iTunes to feed 
music and video to Apple TV wirelessly, as I describe in this chapter. 
 
To find out more about Apple TV, visit this book’s companion Web site.
Changing the Computer’s Output Volume
You can control the volume and other characteristics of the sound coming 
from your computer’s speakers, headphones, or external speakers. Even if 
you connect your computer to a home audio system with its own volume and 
equalizer controls, it’s best to get the volume correct at the source — your 
computer and iTunes — and then adjust the output volume as you please on 
your audio system or external speaker unit.

208
Part III: Managing Your Library 
You control the volume by using your computer system’s audio controls. 
iTunes also controls the volume, but that control is within the limits of the 
computer’s volume setting. For example, if you set your computer’s volume 
to half and set iTunes volume to full, you get half volume because the 
computer limits the volume to half. If you set your computer volume at 
half and also reduce the iTunes volume to half, you actually get one-quarter 
volume — half the computer’s setting. After the sound leaves your computer, 
you can adjust it further with the volume controls of your stereo system or 
external speakers.
The appropriate volume depends entirely on your preferences for hearing 
music, audio books, or video soundtracks. In general, though, the maximum 
level of output from your computer is preferable when connecting to a stereo 
system or speakers with volume controls. After setting your computer to 
the maximum volume, adjust the iTunes volume or your stereo or speaker 
volume (or both) to get the best sound. When using the computer’s speakers 
or headphones, the computer’s volume and the iTunes volume are the 
only volume controls that you have, so after adjusting the volume on your 
computer to the maximum level (or lower if you prefer), adjust the iTunes 
volume.
Adjusting the sound on a Mac
The Mac was built for sound from the very start. Making and playing music 
have been part of the Mac culture since the day that Steve Jobs introduced 
an audience to the original Mac with sound coming from its small speaker. 
(It played synthesized speech and simple tones, but it was the first personal 
computer with built-in sound.)
Today’s Macs come with built-in or external speakers and at least one 
headphone/line-out connection that you can use to connect external speakers 
or a stereo system. Mac OS X lets you configure output speakers and control 
levels for stereo speakers and multichannel audio devices.
 
If you use external speakers, headphones, or a stereo system, make sure that 
you connect these devices properly before adjusting the volume.
To adjust the volume on your Mac, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock and 
then click the Sound icon.
 
 Otherwise, press Option and a volume control key on your keyboard 
simultaneously as a shortcut. You can have iTunes open and playing 
music while you do this.
 
2. In the Sound preferences window that opens, click Output and select 
the sound output device.

209
 Chapter 13: Playing Content in iTunes
 
 If you have headphones or external speakers attached to the headphones 
connection on your Mac, a Headphones option appears in the list of 
sound output devices, as shown in Figure 13-1. The External Speakers 
or Internal Speakers option may also appear for speakers connected 
through a line-out connection or built into the Mac.
 
3. Adjust the volume.
 
 You can do any of the following:
 
• Drag the slider to adjust the volume while you listen to music.
 
• Select the Mute check box to silence your Mac.
 
• Drag the Balance slider to put more music in the left or right 
channel.
 
4. Close the Preferences window, either by choosing System 
Preferences➪Quit System Preferences, clicking the red button in the 
upper-left corner of the window, or pressing Ô-Q.
 
 The Sound preferences window isn’t like a dialog: When you change 
settings, you can hear the effect immediately without having to click OK. 
(There isn’t an OK button, anyway.)

Using AirTunes or Apple TV for 
Wireless Stereo Playback
You want to play the music in your iTunes library, but your stereo system 
is across the room or in another room, and you don’t want to extend wires 
to the stereo system. What you need is a wireless connection from your 
computer to your stereo system.
You can use an Apple AirPort Wi-Fi network in your home — such as AirPort 
Express by itself, or Apple TV with AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule. AirPort 
Express and Apple TV work with Apple’s AirTunes technology, which lets 

211
 Chapter 13: Playing Content in iTunes
you play your iTunes music through your stereo or powered speakers in any 
room of your house, without wires. The only catch is that your computer 
must be within range of the Wi-Fi network or connected by an Ethernet cable.
Apple’s AirPort technology provides Wi-Fi networking for any AirPort-
equipped Mac or wireless-capable PC that uses a Wi-Fi–certified IEEE 802.11b, 
802.11g, or 802.11n wireless card or offers built-in Wi-Fi. For more about 
AirPort, see Mac OS X Snow Leopard All-in-One For Dummies, by Mark L. 
Chambers (published by Wiley).
If you already have a wireless network in place, you can add AirPort Express 
without changing anything. The AirPort Express wirelessly links to your 
existing wireless network without requiring any change to the network. You 
can even use several AirPort Express units — one for each stereo system or 
set of powered speakers, in different rooms.
All by itself, AirPort Express creates a Wi-Fi network. You can attach your 
Internet cable modem or other Ethernet network to AirPort Express to link 
your ready-made Wi-Fi network to the outside world. You can also take 
AirPort Express on the road to use in hotel rooms to share an Internet 
connection among wireless computers.
To use AirTunes and AirPort Express, follow these steps:
 
1. Follow the instructions to install the software supplied with AirPort 
Express.
 
2. Connect your stereo or a set of powered speakers to the AirPort 
Express audio port.
 
 You can use an optical digital or analog audio cable. (Both are included 
in the AirPort Express Stereo Connection Kit available from the Apple 
Store.) Which cable you use depends on whether your stereo or set of 
powered speakers has an optical digital or analog connection.
 
3. Plug AirPort Express into an electrical outlet.
 
 Use the AC plug that came with AirPort Express or the power extension 
cord included in the AirPort Express Stereo Connection Kit. AirPort 
Express turns on automatically when connected to an electrical outlet. 
The status light glows yellow while AirPort Express is starting up. When 
it is fully up and running, the light turns green.
 
4. On your computer, set your iTunes preferences to look for speakers 
connected wirelessly with AirTunes.
 
a. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
b. Click the Devices tab to show the Devices pane.

212
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
c. Select the Look for Remote Speakers Connected with AirTunes check 
box in the Devices pane, as shown in Figure 13-3.
 
 You also have these options in the Devices pane:
 
• To control volume from a stereo: Select the Disable iTunes Volume 
Control for Remote Speakers check box to control speakers 
separately (a setting you should use if connecting to a stereo with 
a volume control).
 
• To control volume from iTunes: Leave this option deselected (the 
default) to control the volume from within iTunes.

 After selecting the option to look for AirTunes-connected speakers, the 
Speakers pop-up menu appears in the lower-right corner of the iTunes 
window. Note: The menu will probably be set to Computer, the default 
option.
 
5. Choose AirTunes-Equipped Network from this new pop-up menu.
 
 The Speakers pop-up menu includes the computer itself as well as any 
available wireless AirTunes networks, as shown in Figure 13-4. You can 
select the AirTunes network to play music (“Express Buddy” in Figure 13-4). 
From that point, iTunes plays music through the AirTunes network 
rather than through the computer. To get back to playing music through 
speakers connected to the computer (or through the computer’s built-in 
speakers), choose Computer from the Speakers pop-up menu.

Choosing Airport Express “Express Buddy”
The AirPort Express is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, and it 
travels well because all it needs is a power outlet. You can take your laptop 
and AirPort Express to a friend’s house or party, connect the AirPort Express 
to the stereo system and a power outlet, and then use your laptop anywhere 
in its vicinity to play DJ. You can even use portable powered speakers in a 
hotel room without wires and use a hotel room’s LAN-to-Internet access with 
an AirPort Express to connect your wireless computer and other wireless 
computers in the room to the Internet.
To play music through speakers connected to your Apple TV, choose Apple 
TV from the Speakers pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 13-5. You can use 
any computer with iTunes to play its library content (audio and video) 
through Apple TV to your home entertainment system without your having 
to synchronize that library’s content — meaning that you don’t have to 
change the content that is already synchronized with your Apple TV. That 
way, if you invite a friend over with her laptop, you can quickly play any tune 
in her laptop’s library without changing the synchronized content from your 
computer. You can play anything in an iTunes library, even if your Apple TV is 
already filled with synchronized content. 
 
To find out how to synchronize your Apple TV, visit this book’s companion 
Web site.

If you set up your Apple TV to work with an Apple AirPort-based network, you 
can choose the Multiple Speakers option in the Speakers pop-up menu (refer 
to Figure 13-5) and play your iTunes content through both the computer and 
Apple TV speakers at the same time.
Playing Songs
When you’ve found a song you want to play (see Chapter 11 for browsing and 
searching details), simply select it in the List pane and then click the Play 
button. The Play button toggles to a Pause button while the song plays.
When the song finishes, iTunes continues playing the songs in the list in 
sequence until you click the Pause button (which then toggles back into the 
Play button) or until the song list ends. This setup is useful if you select an 
album, but not so great if you select a song at random and don’t want to hear 
the next one. (Fortunately, you can arrange songs in playlists so that they 
play back in exactly the sequence you want; see Chapter 14 for details.)
You can skip to the next or previous song by pressing the right- or left-arrow 
key, respectively, or by clicking the Forward or Back button next to the Play 
button. You can also double-click another song in the list to start playing it.

215
 Chapter 13: Playing Content in iTunes
 
Press the spacebar to perform the same function as the Play button; press the 
spacebar again to pause.
 
If you want to see the rest of your computer screen while playing music, you 
can minimize the iTunes screen to just the playback controls. On a Mac, 
choose Window➪Zoom (or click the green button in the upper-left corner of 
the window); choose it again (or click the green button again) to zoom back 
out to full size. On a Windows PC, choose View➪Switch to Mini Player (or 
press Ctrl-M); click the screen button (the middle button on the left side of the 
Mini Player) or press Ctrl-M to zoom back out to full size.
Grooving with the iTunes DJ
Playlists, as I describe in Chapter 14, are great for organizing music in the 
order that you want to play it, but you can have iTunes serve up songs at 
random. iTunes DJ (formerly Party Shuffle) is a dynamic playlist that 
automatically generates a semirandom selection in a list that you can modify 
on the fly. With iTunes DJ, you might even find songs in your library you 
forgot about or rarely play. iTunes DJ always throws a few rarely played 
songs into the mix.
To use iTunes DJ, follow these steps:
 
1. Select iTunes DJ in the Playlists section of the Source pane.
 
 The iTunes DJ track list appears in place of the List pane, with the 
Source pop-up, Settings, and Refresh buttons at the bottom, as shown 
in Figure 13-6.
 
2. Choose a source from the Source pop-up menu below the track list.
 
 You can select Music (refer to Figure 13-6) to use the entire music 
portion of your library, or select any playlist as the source for music 
(including a smart playlist; see Chapter 14 for details). If you select a 
playlist, iTunes DJ limits its choices to songs from that playlist.
 
3. Click the Settings button, and set the following options in the Settings 
dialog as shown in Figure 13-7:
 
• Recently Played Songs: Choose how many songs should remain in 
the Party Shuffle list after they’re played. You can drag already-
played songs (even though they’re grayed out after playing) to a 
spot later in the list to play them again.
 
• Upcoming Songs: Choose how many songs should be listed as 
upcoming (not yet played). By displaying upcoming songs first, you 
can decide whether to rearrange the list or delete songs from the 
Party Shuffle playlist before they’re played.

216
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
Figure 13-6: 
iTunes DJ

your entire 
library or

• Play Higher Rated Songs More Often: Select this option to have 
iTunes add more high-rated songs to the random list. Using this 
option, you weight the randomness in favor of higher-rated songs. 
See Chapter 12 to find out how to add ratings to songs.
 
• Allow Guests to Request Songs with Remote for iPhone or iPod touch: 
Select this option to let your guests use Apple’s Remote app for 
the iPod touch or iPhone to connect to your iTunes library and 
request songs, which are added to the iTunes DJ playlist. You can 
enter a welcome message for your guests that appears in Remote, 
and if you also select the Enable Voting check box, your guests 
can use Remote to vote on songs — songs with more votes are 
automatically promoted to the top of the iTunes DJ list. You can 
restrict access to a specific playlist or other source in the Source 
pane (such as Genius playlists) by selecting the Restrict Requests 
to Source option and choosing a source from the pop-up menu. 
(For example, I chose the My Top Rated playlist in Figure 13-7.) You 
can control access via Remote by selecting the Require Password 
check box and entering a password.
 
4. (Optional) If you don’t like the order of songs, you can rearrange 
them. If you dislike any songs, you can remove them.
 
 You can rearrange the order of songs in the iTunes DJ playlist by dragging 
songs to different positions in the list. Remove songs by selecting them 
in the iTunes DJ playlist and pressing Delete/Backspace (or choosing 
Edit➪Delete). Don’t worry — the songs aren’t deleted from your library, 
just from the iTunes DJ playlist.

217
 Chapter 13: Playing Content in iTunes
 
Figure 13-7: 
Change the 
iTunes DJ 
settings.
 
 
5. Play the iTunes DJ playlist by selecting the first song (or any song) 
and then clicking the Play button or pressing the spacebar.
 
 You can start playing the first song or any song on the list. (When you 
pick a song in the middle to start playing, the songs before it are grayed 
out to show that they won’t play.)
 
6. Add, delete, or rearrange songs, even while iTunes DJ plays.
 
 While the iTunes DJ list plays, you can add songs in one of two ways:
 
• Open iTunes DJ in a separate window by double-clicking iTunes DJ 
in the Source pane. You can then drag songs from the main iTunes 
window — either from the Music portion of your library (select 
Music in the Library section of the Source pane) or from a playlist in 
the Source pane — directly into position in the iTunes DJ track list.
 
• Without opening iTunes DJ in a separate window, you can switch to 
the music portion of your library or a playlist and drag the song over 
iTunes DJ in the Source pane. When you add a song to iTunes DJ, it 
shows up at the end of the track list. You can then drag it to a new 
position.
You can add one or more albums to the iTunes DJ track list by dragging the 
albums; the songs play in album order. You can also add all the songs by an 
artist by dragging the artist’s name. iTunes DJ acts like a dynamic playlist — 
you add, delete, and change the order of songs on the fly.
 
Cool DJs mix the iTunes DJ window with other open playlist windows. Just 
double-click the playlist item in the Source pane to open it in a separate 
window. You can then drag songs from different playlist windows to the iTunes 
DJ window while iTunes DJ plays, adding songs in whatever order you want in 
real time.

218
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
If you have songs in your library that you never, ever want to have appear in 
your iTunes DJ playlist, select the song, choose File➪Get Info, click the 
Options tab, and select the Skip When Shuffling option. With this option on, 
the song is skipped when shuffling playback and when using iTunes DJ. You 
can skip entire albums by selecting the album, choosing File➪Get Info, clicking 
Yes to the warning dialog, and choosing Yes from the Skip When Shuffling 
pop-up menu. (You can select an entire album quickly by showing the 
browser — choose View➪Show Column Browser — and selecting the album 
name in the Album column.)
Cross-fading song playback
You can often hear a song on the radio fade out while another song immediately 
fades in over the first song’s ending — a cross-fade. With iTunes, you can 
smoothly transition from the ending of one song to the beginning of the next 
one. Ordinarily, iTunes is set to have a short cross-fade of one second (the 
time after the fade-out of the first song to the fade-in of the second), but you 
can adjust that if you like.
What’s totally cool is that you can cross-fade two songs in iTunes even if 
they’re from different sources. The songs could be in your library, in a shared 
library, on CD, or even on one (or more) iPods connected to your computer 
and playing through iTunes. You can play DJ at a party with a massive music 
library on a laptop and enlarge that library with one or more iPods and any 
number of CDs, and have the songs cross-fade.
You can change the cross-fade by choosing iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac 
or Edit➪Preferences in Windows and then clicking the Playback button. The 
Playback preferences dialog appears, as shown in Figure 13-8.
In the Playback preferences dialog, select the Crossfade Songs check box and 
then increase or decrease the cross-fade by dragging the slider. Each notch 
in the slider represents one second. The maximum amount of cross-fade is 12 
seconds. With a longer cross-fade, you get more overlap from one song to the 
next; that is, the second song starts before the first one ends. To turn off the 
cross-fade, deselect the Crossfade Songs check box.

Playing Podcasts
A podcast transfers audio or audio/video episodes, such as weekly broadcasts, 
automatically to your iTunes library from the Internet or through the iTunes 
Store (as I describe in episodic detail in Chapter 8). Podcasts that you 
subscribe to appear in the List pane when you select the Podcasts option in 
the Library section of the Source pane. You can add podcast episodes to your 
library by subscribing to them in the iTunes Store (see Chapter 7) or on a 
Web site (see Chapter 8).
To play the most recent podcast episode, select the Podcasts item in the 
Library section of the Source pane, select a podcast in any view, and then 
click the Play button. To play a specific podcast episode, follow these steps: 
 
1. Select the Podcasts item in the Library section of the Source pane and 
choose List or Cover Flow view.
 
2. Select a podcast in the List view or in the list under the Cover Flow 
view, and then click the triangle to see its episodes.
 
 The triangle rotates, and a list of episodes appears beneath the podcast, 
as shown in Figure 13-9 (using List view).

220
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
3. Select the podcast and then click the Play button.
 
 You can use the iTunes playback controls to fast-forward or rewind 
the podcast or play it from any point. The blue dot next to a podcast 
means that you haven’t yet played it. As soon as you start listening to a 
podcast, the dot disappears.
 
Figure 13-9: 
Open a pod-
cast to see 
its episodes.
 
When you play a podcast, iTunes remembers your place when you stop 
listening to it, just like it remembers when you place a bookmark in an audio 
book or pause during a movie — even after quitting and restarting iTunes. 
iTunes resumes playing from that playback position when you return to the 
podcast to play it.
Some podcasts are enhanced to include chapter marks and photos. When 
you play an enhanced podcast in iTunes, a Chapters menu appears on the 
iTunes menu bar. Choose this menu to display the podcast’s chapter marks, 
artwork, and chapter start times.
If the podcaster embedded a photo in an audio podcast file or included a link 
to a video from the file, the photo or video content appears in the Artwork 
pane.
Although you can drag a podcast into a playlist to include it in that playlist, 
you can also drag a podcast to the Source pane to create a new playlist, as 
long as you drag it to an empty space in the Playlist section of the Source 
pane (and not into another playlist). The new playlist takes on the name of 
the podcast. You can also add other podcasts to the new playlist and rename 
the playlist. For more information about playlists, see Chapter 14.

221
 Chapter 13: Playing Content in iTunes
Playing Audio Books
You can store and play audio books, articles, and spoken-word titles just 
like songs in iTunes, and you can download titles from the iTunes Store (as I 
describe prolifically in Chapter 7). Choose Audiobooks in the Library section 
of the Source pane to see them.
To play an audio book, select it just like you would a song (see details on 
browsing and listing content in Chapter 11) and then click the Play button. 
You can use the iTunes playback controls to fast-forward or rewind the audio 
book or play it from any point.
Audio books from the iTunes Store are enhanced to include chapter marks. 
When you play any of these audio books in iTunes, the Chapters menu 
appears on the iTunes menu bar, just like it does for a 
podcast with chapters. Choose the Chapters menu to display and select the 
audio book’s chapter marks.
Playing Videos
iTunes is versatile when it comes to playing videos — the TV shows, movies, 
video podcasts, and music videos you downloaded from the iTunes Store 
(see Chapter 7) as well as the video files you imported into iTunes from other 
sources (see Chapter 8).
To watch a video in iTunes, select it in your library (see details on browsing 
and listing movies, TV shows, and videos in Chapter 11) and then click the 
Play button. Use the iTunes Previous/Rewind, Play/Pause, and Forward/
Next buttons to control playback and the iTunes volume slider to control the 
volume, just like with songs.
By default, the video appears in the Artwork pane in the lower-left corner of 
the iTunes window, as shown in Figure 13-10. If the Artwork pane isn’t visible, 
playing the video makes it appear. You can also make the Artwork pane 
appear or disappear by clicking the Show/Hide Artwork button.
To watch a video in a separate window, click the video while it plays in 
the Artwork pane. A separate window appears that includes a transparent 
QuickTime controls pane with buttons for controlling video playback, as 
shown in Figure 13-11. Click the Play button at the center of the pane to play 
or pause, and then drag the slider to move forward or backward through 
the video. Click the Rewind or Fast Forward button on either side of the Play 
button in the controls pane to move backward or forward through a video. 
Click the red “close window” button in the upper-left corner to close the 
window.

The transparent QuickTime controls pane disappears while the video plays, 
but you can make it reappear at any time by moving the cursor to the bottom 
center of the video window. The controls pane also offers a volume control 
slider to set the audio volume of the video, and the Full-Screen Video button 
to change the video display to full-screen. (See the section “Playing a video 
full-screen,” later in this chapter.)

223
 Chapter 13: Playing Content in iTunes
You can resize the separate video window by dragging the lower-right corner 
of the window. You can also choose fixed window sizes by choosing them 
from the View menu. For example, choose View➪Video Size➪Half Size to 
display the video window at half the actual size, or choose View➪ Video 
Size➪Double Size to display the window at twice the size. Choose View➪ 
Video Size➪Actual Size to set the window back to the actual size of the video 
picture.
Changing video playback preferences
To change your iTunes preferences for playing movies, TV shows, and music 
videos, choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows), 
and click the Playback tab (refer to Figure 13-8). You can choose the following 
options separately for movies/TV shows and for music videos:
 
✓ In the Artwork Viewer, as described above and shown in Figure 13-10.
 
✓ In a Separate Window, as described above and shown in Figure 13-11.
 
✓ In the iTunes Window, as shown in Figure 13-12, with a transparent 
QuickTime controls pane that offers buttons for controlling video 
playback. Click the Play button at the center of the QuickTime controls 
pane to play or pause, and then drag the slider to move forward or 
backward through the video. Click the Rewind or Fast Forward button 
on either side of the Play button in the controls pane to move backward 
or forward through a video. Click the circled X to stop playing the video 
and return to the normal iTunes window.
 
✓ Full Screen or Full Screen (with Visuals), which fills the entire computer 
display. See the next section, “ Playing a video full-screen” for details.
Playing a video full-screen
After choosing the Full Screen option from the Play Movies and TV Shows 
pop-up menu and/or the Play Music Videos pop-up menu as described in 
the previous section (refer to Figure 13-8), those videos fill the screen when 
they play, with a transparent QuickTime controls pane offering buttons for 
controlling video playback.

224
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
Figure 13-12: 
Click the 
circled X to

the video 
inside the 
iTunes 
window.
 
 
Some videos look good when displayed full-screen, but others may not. Videos 
purchased from the iTunes Store look fine, but video from other sources may 
look pixilated at full-screen resolution.
 
 To change from watching a video in a separate window to a full-screen view, 
click the Full-Screen Video button in the transparent QuickTime controls 
pane (refer to Figure 13-11). This button doesn’t appear unless you’re playing 
a video in a separate window. You can also choose View➪Video Size➪Fit to 
Screen.
When you’re playing a video in full-screen view, the following controls are 
available:
 
✓ Esc (Escape): Press to stop full-screen playback and return to the iTunes 
window.
 
✓ Spacebar: Press to pause playback. (Pressing the spacebar again 
resumes playback.)
 
✓ Your mouse or pointing device: Simply move these to display the 
transparent QuickTime controls pane and then click the Full-Screen 
Video button (now with its arrows pointing inward) to stop full-screen 
playback and return to the iTunes window.
 
A cool party trick is to seamlessly mix music videos and music with visuals. 
(See Chapter 6 to find out about displaying visuals.) To display a mixed 
playlist of music and videos (see Chapter 14 to create playlists), choose 
iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows). Then click the 
Playback tab and choose the Full Screen (with Visuals) option from the Play 

225
 Chapter 13: Playing Content in iTunes
Music Videos pop-up menu (or even the Play Movies and TV Shows pop-up 
menu, if you include these in your playlist). When you play the mixed music-
video playlist, iTunes automatically shows full-screen video for your videos 
and full-screen visuals for your music, seamlessly moving from one to the 
other.
For many, the computer display is just fine for viewing videos full-screen. 
However, if you want to connect your PC to a television, the easiest way is 
through Apple TV. Apple TV lets you connect an HD-compatible television 
and audio system wirelessly (or by wired Ethernet) to any computer running 
iTunes in the network and store content for playback. 
 
To find out more about Apple TV and details about connections to home video 
and stereo equipment, visit this book’s companion Web site.
Adjusting the Sound
Some songs are just too loud. I don’t mean too loud stylistically, as in thrash 
metal with screeching guitars; I mean too loud for your ears when you’re 
wearing headphones or so loud that the music is distorted. And some songs 
are just too soft; you have to increase the volume to hear them and then 
lower the volume to listen to louder songs. Videos, podcast episodes, and 
audio books can also vary greatly from loud to soft. To remedy these problems, 
you can set the volume in advance for these items. You can also sound-check 
your entire music library to bring it in line, volume-wise.
Setting the volume in advance
With songs, audio books, podcast episodes, and videos that you already 
know are too loud (or too soft), consider setting the volume for those items 
in advance so that they always play with the desired volume adjustment. You 
can even set the volume for entire albums or podcasts.
To adjust the overall volume of a particular item in advance so that it always 
plays at that setting, perform the following steps:
 
1. Select one or more items in your iTunes library.
 
 To set the volume in iTunes for multiple songs, you can select an entire 
album in Browse view or you can select all the songs. To set the volume 
for a whole podvcast, select it instead of individual episodes.
 
2. Choose File➪Get Info.
 
 The information dialog appears.

226
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
3. Click the Options tab.
 
 Drag the Volume Adjustment slider left or right to adjust the volume 
lower or higher, as shown in Figure 13-13. You can do this while playing 
the file.
 
4. Click the OK button to finish.
 
Figure 13-13:

Equalizing the sound
The Beach Boys were right when they sang “Good Vibrations” because that’s 
what music is — the sensation of hearing audible vibrations conveyed to the 
ear by a medium, such as air. Musicians measure pitch by the frequency of 
vibrations. When you increase the bass or treble, you’re actually increasing 
the volume, or intensity, of certain frequencies. iTunes provides an equalizer 
to fine-tune the sound spectrum frequencies in a more precise way than with 
bass and treble controls. It increases or decreases specific frequencies of the 
sound to raise or lower highs, lows, and midrange tones.
You can use the iTunes equalizer (EQ) to customize playback for different 
musical genres, listening environments, or speakers. iTunes comes with more 
than 20 EQ presets of the most commonly used settings, including ones for 
specific music genres, such as classical and rock.

227
 Chapter 13: Playing Content in iTunes
To choose an equalizer preset for a song, video, podcast, or audio book, 
select the item in the iTunes library, choose File➪Get Info, and click the 
Options tab (refer to Figure 13-13). Click the Equalizer Preset pop-up menu 
to assign an EQ preset, and click the OK button. If something is playing, you 
hear the effect in the sound immediately after choosing the preset.
For even finer control, you can open the iTunes Equalizer window by choosing 
Window➪Equalizer. You can then adjust frequencies by clicking and dragging 
sliders that look like mixing-board faders. You can also see what a preset 
actually does to the frequencies by clicking the Equalizer window’s pop-up 
menu to select the same preset by name. The faders in the equalizer show 
you exactly what the preset does.
 
Find out more about tweaking the sound with the equalizer by visiting the Tips 
section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com).
Sound-checking and enhancing the volume
Because music CDs are manufactured inconsistently, discrepancies occur 
in volume. Some CDs play louder than others; occasionally, even individual 
tracks on a CD might vary.
You can standardize the volume level of all the songs in your iTunes library 
with the Sound Check option. This option has the added benefit of applying 
the same volume adjustment when you play the songs back on your iPod or 
iPhone, as I describe in Chapter 16.
To enable Sound Check, follow these steps:
 
1. Drag the iTunes volume slider to set the overall volume for iTunes.
 
 The volume slider is located in the upper-left corner of the iTunes 
window, to the right of the Play button.
 
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
 The iTunes Preferences dialog appears.
 
3. Click the Playback tab.
 
 The Playback preferences appear (refer to Figure 13-8).
 
4. Select the Sound Check box.
 
 iTunes sets the volume level for all songs according to the level of the 
iTunes volume slider.

228
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
5. Click the OK button.
 
 The Sound Check option sets a volume adjustment based on the volume 
slider on all the songs so that they play at approximately the same 
volume.
The operation runs in the background while you do other things. If you quit 
iTunes and then restart it, the operation continues where it left off when you 
quit. You can switch Sound Check on or off at any time.
You can also improve the depth of the sound by enhancing high and low 
frequencies. Audiophiles and sound purists would most likely use the 
equalizer to boost frequencies, but you can use this brute-force method to 
enhance the sound. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (Windows).
 
 The iTunes Preferences dialog appears.
 
2. Click the Playback tab.
 
 The Playback preferences appear (refer to Figure 13-8).
 
3. Select the Sound Enhancer check box and adjust the slider:
 
• Increase the sound enhancement. Dragging the Sound Enhancer 
slider to the right (toward High) is similar to pressing the loudness 
button on a car stereo or the equivalent of boosting the treble 
(high) and bass (low) frequencies in the equalizer.
 
• Decrease the high and low frequencies. Drag the slider to the left 
toward Low.
 
 The middle setting is neutral, adding no enhancement — the same as 
disabling Sound Enhancer by deselecting its check box.

Chapter 14
Organizing iTunes Content 
with Playlists
In This Chapter
▶ Creating a playlist of songs and albums
▶ Adding podcast episodes and videos to playlists
▶ Creating and editing smart playlists
▶ Creating a Genius playlist
T
he ability to play any set of songs in a specific order is one of the joys 
of using iTunes and iPods. A playlist is a list of the items that you want, 
organized in the sequence that you want to play them. For example, you can 
make a playlist of love songs from different albums for a romantic mood, or 
surf songs for a trip to the beach.
You can also organize playlists for different operations, such as copying 
to your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV or burning a CD. I create playlists that 
combine songs from different albums based on themes or similarities. For 
example, I have a jazz playlist for cruising around with my iPhone in the city 
at night, a classic rock playlist for jogging with my iPod shuffle in the morning 
and hanging out in coffee shops with my iPod nano, a playlist of short films 
mixed with TV shows for a long airplane ride with my iPod touch, and a 
playlist of rain songs to celebrate rainy days.
You can create as many playlists of songs, audio books, podcast episodes, 
and videos as you want, in any order that you like. The items and their files 
don’t change, nor are they copied. iTunes simply creates a list of the item 
names with links to the actual items and their files.
You can even create a smart playlist, which automatically includes items in 
the playlist based on the criteria you set up and also removes items that 
don’t match the criteria. The information included in iTunes (see Chapter 12) 
is very useful for setting up the criteria. For example, you can define the 
criteria for a smart playlist to automatically include songs from a particular 
artist or songs that have the highest rating or fit within a particular musical 
genre.

230
Part III: Managing Your Library 
Creating Playlists
Playlists are important for managing your content library. For example, you 
need to create a playlist in order to burn a CD (as I show in Chapter 15), 
and you may want to synchronize your iPod or iPhone using playlists (as I 
describe in Chapter 9). They can also make it easier to find items you like 
without searching the entire library for them. You can create playlists of 
individual songs or entire albums. You can also include audio books, TV 
shows, videos, podcast episodes, and Web radio stations in playlists.
To create a playlist, follow these steps:
 
 
1. Click the Add Playlist button (in the lower-left corner of the iTunes 
window under the Source pane) or choose File➪New Playlist.
 
 
 This step creates a new, untitled playlist in the Playlists section of the 
Source pane named, appropriately enough, untitled playlist, highlighted 
and ready to rename.
 
2. Give the playlist a new descriptive name.
 
 You can begin typing a new name and press Return (or just click 
somewhere else) to save the name. (If the playlist name wasn’t highlighted 
first, click once to select it and then click the name again so that the text 
cursor appears; doing so highlights the playlist name, making it ready 
for you to type the new name.)
 
 After you type the new name, iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabetical 
order in the Playlists section of the Source pane (underneath the preset 
smart playlists).
 
3. Select a source, such as Music or Audiobooks, in the Library section of 
the Source pane and then drag items from the library to the 
playlist.
 
 Drag one item at a time or drag a group of items, dropping them onto the 
playlist name in the Source pane. The initial order of items in the playlist 
is based on the order in which you drag them to the list. You can add all 
the podcast episodes to a playlist by dragging the podcast name, or you 
can open it to reveal its episodes (see Chapter 13 for details) and drag 
separate episodes to the playlist rather than the entire podcast.
 
4. Select the playlist in the Playlists section of the Source pane to play it.
 
 After selecting a playlist, the items in the playlist appear in the List pane. 
Select any item in the playlist to start playing from that item to the end 
of the playlist, and click the Play button.
To rearrange the list of items in the playlist, see the section “Rearranging and 
managing playlists,” later in this chapter.

231
 Chapter 14: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists
To open a playlist in a new window, double-click the icon next to the playlist 
name in the Source pane. You can then browse your music library and drag 
items from your music library to the separate playlist window.
 
To create a playlist quickly, select the group of items in the List pane that you 
want to make into a playlist. Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection, or drag 
the selection to an area between playlists in the Source pane. You can then 
type a name for the new playlist that appears.
 
Making a playlist of an album is simple. Select the Music option in the Library 
section of the Source pane, and then select an album — either in Grid or Cover 
Flow view, or in List view using the Column Browser (choose View➪Show 
Column Browser). Drag the selected album to an area between playlists in 
the Playlists section of the Source pane. Or, select the album and then choose 
File➪New Playlist from Selection. iTunes automatically creates a new playlist 
named after the album. You can create a playlist with all of a podcast’s epi-
sodes the same way: choose Podcasts in the Source pane and select the pod-
cast that you want to make into a playlist, and then choose File➪New Playlist 
from Selection.
You might want to play several albums back to back without having to select 
each album to play it. For example, you might want to use an iPod on that 
long drive from London to Liverpool to play The Beatles’ albums in the order 
they were released (or perhaps in the reverse order, following The Beatles’ 
career from London back to Liverpool). To create a playlist of entire albums 
in a particular order, drag each album to the same playlist in the order you 
want to play them. Each time you drag an album, iTunes automatically lists 
the songs in the proper track sequence for each album. The albums are listed 
in the playlist in the order that you dragged them.
You can mix videos with songs and other items in a playlist. For example, 
you can mix songs and music videos, songs and a video documentary, or just 
a selection of TV shows, music, podcasts, movies, and audio books for an 
entire day’s worth of entertainment. However, if you transfer the playlist to 
an iPod that doesn’t play video, the iPod skips the videos.
Rearranging and managing playlists
To rearrange the items in a playlist, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the playlist in the Playlists section of the Source pane.
 
 After selecting a playlist, the items in the playlist appear in the List pane.
 
2. Drag items in the List pane to rearrange the list.
 
• To move an item (such as a song) up the list and scroll at the same 
time, drag it over the up arrow in the first column.

232
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
• To move an item down the list and scroll, drag it to the bottom of 
the list.
 
• To move a group of items at once, press Shift and select a range of 
items (or press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows while clicking to 
select specific songs) and then drag them into a new position.
 
 Besides dragging items, you can also rearrange a playlist by sorting it: 
Just click one of the column headings, such as Name, Time, or Artist.
 
You can drag items from one playlist to another. Only links are copied, not the 
actual files.
You can rename a playlist at any time by clicking its name twice and typing a 
new one. Also, in case you forget which items are in which playlists, you can 
see all the playlists that include a particular item. In List view, press Control 
on a Mac and click the item; in Windows, right-click the item and choose 
Show in Playlist from the contextual menu. The playlists that include the item 
are listed in the submenu.
 
You can organize playlists into folders in the Source pane. Choose File➪New 
Playlist Folder to create a folder in the Playlists section. Then drag playlist 
names and drop them over the new folder — just like how you treat files and 
folders in your operating system. Folders are useful for grouping playlists that 
are similar in content or function. For example, I created a different folder that 
corresponds to each of my iPods to organize the playlists I use to synchronize 
with those iPods. (See Chapter 9 to read about iPod synchronization.) You can 
include smart playlists in folders as well as regular playlists.
Deleting items from a playlist
You can delete items from playlists while keeping the items in your library. 
When you delete an item from a playlist, the item is simply deleted from the 
list — not from the library. You can also delete entire playlists without harm-
ing the content in the library. Note: You’ll need to switch to the Library sec-
tion of the Source pane (Music, Movies, TV Shows, and so on) if you want to 
delete items permanently from your library.
To delete an item from a playlist, select the playlist in the Playlists section of 
the Source pane and then select the item. Press Delete/Backspace or choose 
Edit➪Delete. In the warning dialog that appears, click the Remove button to 
remove the selected item from the list.
 
The one way you can completely delete an item from your library from within 
a playlist is by selecting the item and pressing Ô-Option-Delete (Mac) or Ctrl-
Alt-Backspace (Windows).

233
 Chapter 14: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists
To delete a whole playlist, select the playlist in the Playlists section of the 
Source pane and then press Delete/Backspace or choose Edit➪Delete.
Using Smart Playlists
Under iTunes DJ (near the top of the Playlists section of the Source pane), 
you can find smart playlists, which are indicated by a gear-in-a-document icon. 
iTunes comes with a few sample smart playlists, such as My Top Rated and 
Recently Added, and you can create your own. Smart playlists add items to 
themselves based on prearranged criteria, or rules. For example, when you 
rate your content items, My Top Rated changes to reflect your new ratings. 
You don’t have to set up anything because My Top Rated and Recently Added 
are already defined for you.
Of course, smart playlists are ignorant of your taste in music or video. You 
have to program them with rules by using the song information in iTunes 
(see Chapter 12 about adding or editing song information, including ratings). 
For example, you can create a smart playlist that uses the Year field to grab 
all the songs from 1966. This list, in no particular order, might include The 
Beatles (“Eleanor Rigby”), Frank Sinatra (“Strangers in the Night”), The 
Yardbirds (“Over Under Sideways Down”), and Ike and Tina Turner (“River 
Deep, Mountain High”) — a far-out playlist, no doubt, but not necessarily 
what you want. You can use other fields of information that you entered 
(such as ratings, artist name, or composer) to fine-tune your criteria. You can 
also use built-in functions, such as Play Count (the number of times the item 
was played) or Date Added (the date the item was added to the library).
Creating a smart playlist
To create a new smart playlist, choose File➪New Smart Playlist. The Smart 
Playlist dialog appears (as shown in Figure 14-1), offering the following 
choices for setting criteria:
 
✓ Match the Following Rule: From the first pop-up menu (refer to Figure 14-1),
 you can choose any of the categories used for information, such as 
Artist, Composer, or Last Played. From the second pop-up menu, you 
can choose an operator, such as the greater-than or less-than operator. 
The selections that you make in these two pop-up menus combine 
to create a rule, such as Year is greater than 1966 or, as in 
Figure 14-1, Composer contains (the words) Woody Guthrie.

234
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
 You can also add multiple conditions by clicking the + button (on the 
right) as shown in Figure 14-2. You then decide whether to match all or 
any of these conditions. The Match xx of the Following Rules option is 
enabled by default when you set one or more rules.
 
Figure 14-1: 
Set the first 
match rule 
for a smart 
playlist.
 
 
Figure 14-2: 
Use multiple 
conditions 
and a time 
limit for a 
smart 
playlist.
 
 
✓ Limit To: You can limit the smart playlist to a specific duration, measured 
by the number of songs (items), time, or size in megabytes or gigabytes, 
as shown in Figure 14-2. You can have items selected by various methods, 
such as random, most recently played, and so on.
 
✓ Match Only Checked Items: This option selects only those songs or 
other items in the library that have a check mark beside them, along 
with the rest of the criteria. Selecting and deselecting items is an easy 
way to fine-tune your selection for a smart playlist.
 
✓ Live Updating: This allows iTunes to continually update the playlist 
while you play items, add or remove items from the library, change their 
ratings, and so on.
After setting up the rules, click the OK button. iTunes creates the playlist, 
noted by a gear-in-a-document icon and the name untitled playlist (or whatever 
phrase you used for the first condition, such as the album or artist name). 
You can click in the playlist field and then type a new name for it.

235
 Chapter 14: Organizing iTunes Content with Playlists
Editing a smart playlist
To edit a smart playlist, select it from the Playlists section of the Source 
pane and choose File➪Edit Smart Playlist. Or, you can Control-click (Mac) or 
right-click (Windows) the playlist and then choose Edit Smart Playlist from 
the contextual menu. Either way, the Smart Playlist window appears with the 
criteria for the smart playlist.
For example, to modify the smart playlist so that items with a higher rating 
are picked, simply add another star or two to the My Rating criteria.
 
You can also choose to limit the playlist to a certain number of items selected 
by various methods, such as random, most recently played, and so on.
Adding a Touch of Genius 
If you select a song and click the Genius button, iTunes takes a look at your 
selection and creates a playlist of songs that go along with it. That’s genius!
The Genius sidebar (which I describe in glorious detail in Chapter 6) works 
with Apple’s iTunes Store content to match your tastes to other iTunes users 
using a technique called collaborative filtering. The Genius feature analyzes 
the music in other people’s iTunes libraries — people who also have the 
same song you selected (if they also turn on the Genius feature in iTunes). 
All this information is shared anonymously. The only music Genius knows, 
however, is the music available in the iTunes Store.
A smart playlist for recent additions
Setting up rules gives you the opportunity to 
create playlists that are smarter than the ones 
supplied with iTunes. For example, I created a 
smart playlist with criteria (as shown in Figure 
14-2) that does the following:
 ✓ Includes any item added to the library in 
the past week that also has a rating greater 
than three stars.
 ✓ Limits the playlist to 72 minutes to be sure 
that it fits on a 74-minute audio CD, even 
with gaps between the songs. It also refines 
the selection to the most recently added if 
the entire selection becomes greater than 
72 minutes.
 ✓ Matches only selected items.
 ✓ Performs live updating.

236
Part III: Managing Your Library 
For the Genius feature to work, you need an iTunes Store account (see 
Chapter 7), and you must turn on Genius to enable iTunes to scan your music 
library and catalog your iTunes collection. The scanning process may take a 
few minutes or (for very large collections) a few hours, but you can continue 
using iTunes while it scans your music.
To turn on Genius, click the Turn on Genius button in the Genius sidebar, 
enter your Apple ID and password for your iTunes Store account, and click 
the Continue button.
You can also turn on the Genius feature by choosing Store➪Turn On Genius, 
and turn if off by choosing Store➪Turn Off Genius. If you add new music, you 
can tell iTunes to immediately update the Genius feature with new information 
by choosing Store➪Update Genius.
Creating a Genius playlist
To create a Genius playlist, select a song in the List pane and click the Genius 
button (the button with the atom icon) at the lower-right corner of the iTunes 
window. iTunes displays the Genius playlist based on the selected song. You 
can limit the number of songs for the Genius playlist by clicking the Limit To 
pop-up menu in the top row of buttons on the right side of the List pane, as 
shown in Figure 14-3.
You can refresh the Genius playlist with a new batch of songs based on the 
selected song by clicking the Refresh button in the top row of buttons (refer 
to Figure 14-3). When you refresh a Genius playlist, you lose the previous 
version of that playlist.
To save a Genius playlist, click the Save Playlist button in the right corner of 
the top row of buttons. The playlist is saved with the Genius icon using the 
name of the selected song and listed in the Playlists section of the Source 
pane at the top, above smart playlists. You can revisit this Genius playlist and 
refresh it, or change its song limit. You can also rearrange the songs in the 
Genius playlist by dragging them. To sort the songs, click the column headers 
in the List pane — just like other playlists.
You can synchronize your saved Genius playlists with your iPod or iPhone 
(see Chapter 9 for details). Synchronized Genius playlists on the iPod or 
iPhone contain the same songs that appeared in the iTunes version of the 
playlist. See Chapter 16 for details on using Genius playlists with iPods and 
iPhones.

Playing Genius mixes
The Genius of iTunes is that it can take into consideration everything in 
your library and, comparing your library to other libraries, come up with 
an interesting mix of songs. To give you a taste of what’s possible with the 
Genius feature, check out Genius Mixes. 
Start by selecting Genius Mixes in the Genius section of the Source pane 
(Genius must already be turned on as described earlier in this section). 
iTunes compiles a set of Genius mixes based on your library, as shown in 
Figure 14-4. Each square represents a separate mix. As you hover over a 
square, a play button appears; click the play button to play the mix.
You may be surprised at how well the Genius feature serves up appropriate 
mixes. Apple has improved the Genius feature by collecting more data from 
millions of iTunes users. You are one, so you should be proud that you have 
contributed to Genius!

In This Chapter
▶ Choosing the format and settings for burning a disc
▶ Burning an audio CD, an MP3 CD, or a data DVD
▶ Locating and backing up files in the iTunes library
▶ Backing up your entire iTunes library
Y
ou might think that your digital content is safe, stored as-is, on your 
iPod, iPhone, Apple TV, and hard drive. However, demons in the night 
are working overtime to render your hard drive useless — and at the same 
time, someone left your iPod out in the rain, your iPhone can’t phone home, 
and your Apple TV is on the fritz.
Copyright law and common sense prohibit you from using copyrighted 
content and then selling it to someone else. However, with iTunes, you’re 
allowed to make copies of music, videos, audio books, and podcasts that you 
own for personal use, including copies for backup purposes.
This chapter boils down everything you need to know about burning your 
own discs to make copies of your content. I burn audio CDs or MP3 CDs to 
make safety copies of songs I buy from the iTunes Store. I also like to 
custom-mix songs from different artists and albums onto an audio or MP3 CD.
I burn data DVDs to back up my video files — and I also copy my entire 
iTunes library to another hard drive as a backup, as I describe in this chapter. 
This operation is very important, especially if you’ve purchased items that 
don’t exist anywhere else in your collection but on your computer. That way, 
even if your hard drive fails, you still have your iTunes library.
 
To find out how to consolidate media files into one library, how to manage 
multiple iTunes libraries for easier synchronization with multiple devices, and 
how to move a library from one computer to another (such as a PC to a Mac 
or vice versa), visit this book’s companion Web site.

240
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
You should not rely on your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV as your sole music 
storage device or as a backup for your iTunes library. Although purchases you 
make with your iPod touch or iPhone are copied back to your iTunes library, 
you can’t copy any other content from your iPod, iPhone, or Apple TV to your 
computer via iTunes. It’s a one-way trip from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, or 
Apple TV because record labels and video distributors don’t want indiscriminate 
copying, and Apple has complied with these requests. You can, however, use 
third-party utility programs (not supported by Apple) to copy content both 
ways.
 
To find out more about third-party utility programs for managing your iPod or 
iPhone, visit the Tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com).
The iTunes Store uses Apple FairPlay technology for some content (such as 
commercial movies and TV Shows), which protects the rights of copyright 
holders while also giving you some leeway in using the copyrighted content. 
But you can still copy the media files freely so that backup is easy and 
straightforward on either a Mac or a PC.
 
Do not violate copyright law. You’re allowed to copy content for your own use, 
but you cannot legally copy content for any other purpose. Consult a lawyer if 
you’re in doubt.
Burning Your Own Discs 
Once upon a time, when vinyl records were popular, rock radio disk jockeys 
(who didn’t like disco) held disco-meltdown parties. People were encouraged 
to throw their disco records onto a pile to be burned or steamrolled into a 
vinyl glob. I admit that I shamelessly participated in one such meltdown. 
However, this section isn’t about that. Rather, burning a disc is the process in 
which the CD drive recorder’s laser heats up points on an interior layer of the 
disc to record information.
Using recordable CDs and DVDs
If you have a CD-R, CD-RW, or DVD-R drive (such as the Apple SuperDrive 
for a Mac) and a blank CD-R (R stands for recordable), you can burn music, 
audio books, and audio podcast episodes on audio CDs that play in most CD 
players. You can fit up to 74 minutes of music on a high-quality audio-format 
CD-R; most can go as high as 80 minutes.

241
 Chapter 15: Gimme Shelter for My Media
Blank audio CD-Rs (I’m talking discs now and not drives) are available in 
stores that carry consumer electronics. You can also get them online from 
the Apple Store (not the music store — the store that sells computers and 
accessories). Choose iTunes➪Shop for iTunes Products (Mac) or Help➪Shop 
for iTunes Products (Windows) to reach the Apple Store online.
You can also burn an audio CD-R of song files in the MP3 format, which is 
useful for backing up a music library or making discs for use in MP3 CD 
players. You can play MP3 files burned on a CD-R in MP3 format on any MP3 
disc player, on combination CD/MP3 players, on many DVD players, and (of 
course) on computers that recognize MP3-formatted CDs (including computers 
with iTunes). An MP3-formatted CD-R can hold more than 12 hours of music. 
You read that right — 12 hours on one disc. This is why MP3 discs are popular: 
because they are essentially CD-Rs with MP3 files stored on them.
If you have a DVD burner, such as an Apple SuperDrive, you can burn data 
discs in the DVD-R or DVD-RW format to use with other computers. This 
approach is suitable for making backup copies of media files (or any data 
files). A DVD-R can hold about 4,700,000,000 bytes (more than 4GB).
Creating a disc burn playlist
To burn a CD (actually a CD-R, but most people refer to recordable CD-R 
discs as CDs), you must first define a playlist for the CD. (See Chapter 14 to 
find out how to create a playlist.) You can use songs encoded in any format 
that iTunes supports; however, you get higher-quality music with the 
uncompressed AIFF and WAV formats or with the Apple Lossless format. (You 
can back up your library to DVD without creating a playlist, as I describe in 
the section “Backing up to DVD-Rs or CD-Rs,” later in this chapter.)
If your playlist includes music purchased from the iTunes Store in the older 
protected AAC-encoding format (before 2009), some rules might apply. You 
can burn seven copies of the same playlist containing protected songs to an 
audio CD, but no more. As of this writing, all music you purchase in the store 
is in the newer unprotected iTunes Plus format, with no limit on burning 
discs.
 
You can get around this limitation by creating or using a new playlist, copying 
the protected songs to the new playlist, and then burning more CDs with the 
new playlist.

242
Part III: Managing Your Library 
Calculating how much music to use
When you create an audio CD playlist, you can calculate how many songs can 
fit on the CD by totaling the durations of the songs. You can see the size of a 
playlist by selecting it; the bottom of the iTunes window shows the number 
of songs, the duration of the songs, and the amount in megabytes for the 
selected playlist. Click the duration to see a more precise total time for the 
playlist, as shown in Figure 15-1.
 
Figure 15-1: 
Click the 
duration of 
the playlist 
below the 
List pane to 
see the total 
time.
 
In Figure 15-1, the selected playlist takes about 1.1 hours (1:08:54, to be 
precise) to play, so it fits on a standard audio CD. (The 15 songs take up only 
65.3MB of hard drive space; they were purchased from the iTunes Store.)
 
A one-hour playlist of AIFF-encoded music, which occupies over 600MB of 
hard drive space, also fits on a standard audio CD. You calculate the amount 
you can fit on a standard audio CD using the duration, not the hard drive 
space occupied by the music files. Although a CD holds between 650MB and 
700MB (depending on the disc), the music is stored in a special format known 
as CD-DA (or Red Book) that fills byte sectors without error-correction and 
checksum information. Thus, you can fit about 90MB more — 740MB total — 
of AIFF-encoded music on a 650MB disc. I typically put 1.1 hours (about 66 
minutes) of music on a 74-minute or an 80-minute CD-R, leaving minutes to 
spare.
 
Always use the actual duration in hours, minutes, and seconds to calculate 
how much music you can fit on an audio CD — either 74 or 80 minutes for 
blank CD-Rs. I recommend leaving at least one extra minute to account for the 
gaps between songs.

243
 Chapter 15: Gimme Shelter for My Media
You do the opposite for an MP3 CD or a data DVD. Use the actual megabytes 
to calculate how many song files can fit on a disc — up to 700MB for a blank 
CD-R. You can fit lots more music on an MP3 CD-R because you use MP3-
encoded songs rather than uncompressed AIFF songs.
If you have too many songs in the playlist to fit on a CD, iTunes gives you the 
option to cancel the burn operation, or to burn as many songs in the playlist 
as will fit on the CD (either audio or MP3). Then it asks you to insert another 
CD to continue burning the remaining songs in the playlist.
Importing music for an audio CD-R
Before you rip an audio CD of songs that you want to burn to an audio CD-R, 
you might want to change the import settings (as I describe in Chapter 8). 
Use the AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless encoders for songs from audio CDs if 
you want to burn your own audio CDs with music at its highest quality. You 
can also burn MP3-encoded songs on an audio CD, but the quality is not as 
good as with AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless.
AIFF is the standard digital format for uncompressed sound on a Mac, and 
you can’t go wrong with it. WAV is basically the same thing for Windows. The 
Apple Lossless encoder provides CD-quality sound in a file size that’s about 
55 to 60 percent of the size of an AIFF- or WAV-encoded file. Both the AIFF 
encoder and the WAV encoder offer the same custom settings for sample 
rate, sample size, and channels, which you can set by choosing Custom from 
the Settings pop-up menu in the Importing section of the Advanced pane 
of iTunes Preferences. You can choose the automatic settings, and iTunes 
detects the proper sample rate, size, and channels from the source. Apple 
Lossless is always set to automatic.
 
The songs you purchase from the iTunes Store are supplied in an unprotected 
format encoded in AAC that carries no restrictions. (The format is also known 
as iTunes Plus.) However, you may still have songs in the older protected AAC 
format in use up until 2009. You can’t convert the protected format to anything 
else, but you can still burn the songs onto CDs, and the quality of the result on 
CD is acceptable. Audio books also come in a protected format that can’t be 
converted by iTunes, but you can burn them onto CDs with acceptable quality.
The AAC encoder creates an audio file that is similar in audio quality to one 
created by the MP3 encoder but takes up less space; both are acceptable to 
most CD listeners. I think AAC offers a decent trade-off of space and quality 
and is suitable (although not as good as AIFF or Apple Lossless) for burning 
to an audio CD.
 
For a complete description of these encoders, visit this book’s companion 
Web site.

244
Part III: Managing Your Library 
Switching import encoders for MP3 CD-Rs
MP3 discs are essentially CD-Rs with MP3 files stored on them. Consumer MP3 
CD players are readily available in consumer electronics stores, including 
hybrid models that play both audio CDs and MP3 CDs.
You can fit 8–12 hours of stereo music on an MP3 CD with the MP3 format — 
the amount varies depending on the encoding options and settings you 
choose. For example, you might be able to fit up to 20 hours of mono 
(monaural) recordings because they use only one channel and carry less 
information. On the other hand, if you encode stereo recordings at high bit 
rates (above 192 bits per second), you may fit up to 9 hours.
 
You can use only MP3-encoded songs to burn an MP3 CD-R. Any songs not 
encoded in MP3 are skipped and not burned. Audible books and commercial 
spoken-word titles are typically provided in an audio format that uses security 
technologies, including encryption, to protect purchased content; however, 
you can include anything that is encoded in MP3, including audio books from 
other sources. But you can’t burn an MP3 CD-R with Audible files; any Audible 
files in a burn playlist are skipped when you burn an MP3 CD-R.
Burning a disc
Burning a CD is a simple process, and getting it right the first time is a good 
idea because when you burn a CD-R, it’s done — right or wrong. You can’t 
erase content and reuse a CD-R. Fortunately, CD-Rs are inexpensive, so you 
won’t be out more than a few cents if you burn a bad one. (Besides, they’re 
good as coasters for coffee tables.)
Follow these steps to burn a disc:
 
1. Select the playlist and then click the Burn Disc button.
 
 The Burn Disc button appears in the lower-right corner of the iTunes 
window whenever you select a playlist (refer to Figure 15-1). After 
clicking Burn Disc, the Burn Settings dialog appears, as shown in 
Figure 15-2.
 
2. Select options in the Burn Settings dialog and click the Burn button.
 
 See the following section for instructions on selecting these important 
options.
 
3. Insert a blank disc (label side up).
 
 iTunes immediately checks the media and begins the burn process, 
displaying a progress bar and the names of the songs burning to the disc.

245
 Chapter 15: Gimme Shelter for My Media
 
 If you chose the MP3 CD format, iTunes skips over any songs in the 
playlist that aren’t in this format.
 
 When iTunes finishes burning the disc, iTunes chimes, and the disc is 
mounted on the Desktop.
 
Figure 15-2: 
Choose burn 
settings 
before burn-
ing the disc.
 
 
4. Eject the newly burned disc from your drive and then test it.
 
5. Don’t delete your burn playlist yet.
 
 You can read why in the later section “Troubleshooting burns.”
Burning takes several minutes. You can cancel the operation at any time by 
clicking the X next to the progress bar, but canceling the operation isn’t like 
undoing the burn. If the burn has already started, you can’t use that CD-R or 
DVD-R again.
If the playlist has more music than can fit on the disc using the chosen 
format, iTunes asks whether you want to create multiple audio CDs with the 
playlist. If you choose to create multiple audio CDs, iTunes burns as many 
full songs as possible from the beginning of the playlist and then asks you to 
insert another disc to burn the rest. To calculate the amount of music in a 
playlist, see the earlier section “Calculating how much music to use.”
 
Spoken-word fans: Audible audio books with chapter markers are burned onto 
a CD with each chapter as a separate track.
Choosing your burn settings
Set the following options in the Burn Settings dialog to ensure that you burn 
your CD right the first time (refer to Figure 15-2):

246
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
✓ Preferred Speed: Choose a specific recording speed or the Maximum 
Possible option from the Preferred Speed pop-up menu. iTunes typically 
detects the rating of a blank CD-R and adjusts the recording speed to 
fit. However, if your blank CD-Rs are rated for a slower speed than your 
burner or if you have problems creating CD-Rs, you can change the 
recording speed setting to match the CD’s rating.
 
✓ Disc Format: The disc format is perhaps the most important choice you 
have to make. Decide whether you’re burning an audio CD (CD-R), an 
MP3 CD (CD-R), or a Data CD (CD-R) or DVD (DVD-R or DVD-RW). Your 
choice depends on what type of player you’re using or whether you’re 
making a data backup of files rather than a disc that plays in a player. 
Choose one of the following:
 
• Audio CD: Burn a normal audio CD of up to 74 or 80 minutes 
(depending on the type of blank CD-R) using any iTunes-supported 
music files, including songs bought from the iTunes Store. 
Although connoisseurs of music might use AIFF- or WAV-encoded 
music to burn an audio CD, you can also use songs in the AAC and 
MP3 formats.
 
• MP3 CD: Burn an MP3 CD with songs encoded in the MP3 format. 
No other formats are supported for MP3 CDs.
 
• Data CD or DVD: Burn a data CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-RW 
with music files. You can use any encoding formats for the songs. 
Important: Data discs won’t play on most consumer CD players: 
They’re meant for use with computers. However, data discs are 
good choices for storing backup copies of music bought from the 
iTunes Store.
 
✓ Gap between Songs: You can add an appropriate gap between songs, 
just like commercial CDs. With this option enabled, you can set the gap 
time as well. You can choose from a gap of 0 to 5 seconds, or None. I 
recommend leaving the menu set to the default setting of 2 seconds for 
playlists of studio-recorded songs, and None for concerts and songs 
recorded live. Albums and song selections that you set to be gapless 
(see Chapter 8) will likewise be gapless if you set the Gap between Songs 
option to None.
 
✓ Use Sound Check: Musicians do a sound check before every performance 
to check the volume of microphones and instruments and their effect on 
the listening environment. The aptly named Use Sound Check option in 
the Burning preferences dialog turns on the Sound Check feature to 
balance your tunes, volume-wise.
 
 Note: This option, for audio CDs only, works regardless of whether 
you’re already using the Sound Check option in the Playback preferences 
for iTunes playback as described in Chapter 13. You can select this 
option for burning without ever changing the preferences for iTunes 
playback.

247
 Chapter 15: Gimme Shelter for My Media
 
✓ Include CD Text: Selecting this option adds the artist and track name 
text to the CD for certain CD players (often, in-car players) that can 
display the artist and track name while playing a CD.
Studying Files in an iTunes Library
If you like to keep your records properly filed, you’ll love iTunes and its 
nice, neat file-storage methods. For all content items, iTunes creates a folder 
named for the artist and subfolders within the artist folder named for each 
album. These folders are stored in the iTunes Media folder unless you change 
your storage preferences. Note, however, that if you updated a previous ver-
sion of iTunes that used the iTunes Music folder, iTunes continues to use the 
self-same iTunes Music folder.
Finding the iTunes library
The default method of storing content in the iTunes library is to store all 
media files — including music, videos, podcasts, and audio books — in the 
iTunes Media folder (or iTunes Music folder if you updated from a previ-
ous version of iTunes), which is inside the iTunes folder. With this method, 
media files that you drag to the iTunes window are copied into the iTunes 
Media folder (without deleting the original files). The iTunes folder also 
has folders for mobile applications and album artwork. So that’s easy — 
everything is inside the iTunes folder.
 
iTunes maintains a separate iTunes folder (with a separate iTunes Media 
folder) in each home folder (Mac) or user folder (PC). If you share your 
computer with other users who have home folders, each user can have a 
separate iTunes library on the same computer (and, of course, a separate iPod 
that synchronizes with it). You need only one copy of the iTunes program.
On a Mac, iTunes stores your content library in your home folder’s Music 
folder. The path to this folder’s default location is
your home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media
On a Windows PC, iTunes stores your content library in your user folder. The 
path to this folder’s default location is
your user folder/My Documents/My Music/iTunes/iTunes Media

248
Part III: Managing Your Library 
Locating a media file
You can find the location of any media file by selecting the item (such as a 
song or video), choosing File➪Get Info, and then clicking the Summary tab of 
the information dialog that appears. You can see the file type next to the Kind 
heading of the Summary tab. The Where section tells you where the song is, 
as shown in Figure 15-3.
 
Figure 15-3: 
Locate a 
media file 
from its 
information 
dialog.
 
 
If you access shared libraries on a network, you probably have content you 
can display in iTunes that isn’t actually in your library but is part of a shared 
library or playlist on a network. In those situations, when you look at the 
Summary tab of the information dialog for an item in a shared library, the 
Where section doesn’t appear. For more information about sharing iTunes 
libraries over a network, visit this book’s companion Web site. 
 
You can also open the folder that contains the media file for any item. Select 
the item in List, Grid, or Cover Flow view. Then, on a Mac, choose File➪Show 
in Finder (or press Ô-R); in Windows, choose File➪Show in Windows Explorer 
(or press Ctrl-R). iTunes gives control to the operating system, which displays 
the folder that contains the media file. You can show the file if it’s on your 
hard drive but not if it’s in a shared library on another computer.

249
 Chapter 15: Gimme Shelter for My Media
Copying media files
You can easily store the music that you rip from your CDs in other locations: 
After the music becomes digital, you can copy it endlessly with no subsequent 
loss in quality. You can copy media files to other hard drives and computers 
without any restrictions on copying — just keep in mind that protected items, 
such as movies and TV shows you purchased from the iTunes Store, have 
some playback restrictions (see Chapter 7 for iTunes Store details). 
To copy the media file for an item to another hard drive or folder (such as a 
song or video), you can drag the item directly from the iTunes window to the 
other hard drive or folder. 
You can also copy the files and folders from the iTunes Media folder to other 
hard drives or other computers using the operating system’s copying function. 
For example, on a Mac, you can use the Finder to copy content files. Windows 
PCs offer several methods, including using Windows Explorer, to copy files. 
For example, copying an entire album, or every song by a specific artist, is 
easy — just drag the folder to its new home folder on another hard drive.
Backing Up an iTunes Library
Backups? You don’t need no stinkin’ backups!
Yes, you do, so think twice about not making them! I know: Backing up your 
files can be inconvenient and can eat up the capacity of all your external hard 
drives. Still, it must be done. And fortunately, it’s easy to do, either manually 
as described in this section, or automatically with a system backup utility 
such as Apple’s Time Machine. 
With iTunes, you can copy your library to another hard drive on your computer 
or to another computer. You can burn as many data DVDs as needed to store 
all the files.
Backing up to DVD-Rs or CD-Rs
 
Apple provides a handy wizard that walks you through backing up your 
iTunes library, playlists, and iTunes Store purchases to CD-Rs or DVD-Rs. You 
can choose to back up the entire library, perform incremental backups (only 
items added or changed since the last backup), or save only store purchases. 
Choose File➪Library➪Back Up to Disc and then choose one of the following:

250
Part III: Managing Your Library 
 
✓ Back Up Entire iTunes Library and Playlist: This might take a stack of 
DVD-Rs (or a truckload of CD-Rs), but it’s worth doing if you have no 
other way to back up your library.
 
✓ Back Up Only iTunes Store Purchases: This is an essential procedure, 
because if you lose these files, you have to repurchase them. You can 
use CD-Rs or DVD-Rs.
 
✓ Only Back Up Items Added or Changed Since Last Backup: Use this 
method to copy only items that were added or changed since your last 
backup.
To restore your iTunes library from a stack of backup DVD-Rs or CD-Rs, open 
iTunes and insert the first disc. Then follow the instructions that appear 
automatically after inserting the disc.
Backing up to another hard drive
To copy your entire library to another hard drive, locate the iTunes folder 
on your computer (see the section “Finding the iTunes library,” earlier in this 
chapter). Drag this folder to another hard drive or backup device, and you’re 
all set. This action copies everything, including the playlists in your library.
 
The copy operation might take some time if your library is huge. Although you 
can interrupt the operation anytime, the newly copied library might not be 
complete. Finishing the copy operation is always best.
If you restore the backup copy to the same computer with the same names 
for its hard drive, the backup copy’s playlists work fine. Playlists are essentially 
lists of songs in the XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format, with pathnames 
to the song files. If the hard drive name is different, the pathnames won’t 
work. However, you can import the playlists back into iTunes by choosing 
File➪Library➪Import Playlist, and then browsing for and selecting the iTunes 
Media Library.xml file (or iTunes Music Library.xml file for previous versions 
of iTunes) inside the iTunes folder, which realigns the playlist pathnames to 
the new hard drive.
 
For a complete description of how to copy your iTunes library to other 
computers and hard drives, including from Mac to PC or vice versa, visit this 
book’s companion Web site.

Playing It Back on 
Your iPod or iPhone

In this part . . .
P
art IV is all about playing content with your iPod or 
iPhone, including music, videos, podcasts, audio 
books, and photos.
 
✓ Chapter 16 shows you how to locate and play 
songs. I show you how to find songs, shuffle and 
repeat songs and albums, and create playlists 
right on your iPod or iPhone. I also describe how 
to set the volume and tweak the sound.
 
✓ Chapter 17 describes how to locate and play vid-

Chapter 16
The Songs Remain the Same
In This Chapter
▶ Locating songs by artist, album, or playlist
▶ Repeating and shuffling songs and albums
▶ Creating and saving On-The-Go and Genius playlists
▶ Playing an iPod shuffle
▶ Tweaking the sound on your iPod or iPhone
▶ Changing the volume level and volume limit
E
ven though the iPod and iTunes have irrevocably changed the 
entertainment industry and how you enjoy music, one thing remains 
the same: You still play songs. You just play them with more panache on 
your iPod or iPhone.
You can pick any song that you want to hear at any time. You can also shuffle 
through songs to get an idea of how wide your music choices are or to 
surprise yourself or others. Browse by artist and album, select a playlist, and 
even create playlists on the fly — this chapter explains it all, for any iPod or 
iPhone. Note: If you have an iPod shuffle, everything you need to know is in 
the section “Playing an iPod shuffle.”
Locating Songs on your iPod or iPhone
With so many songs on your iPod or iPhone, finding a particular song by its 
title may take longer than finding it another way — like finding a needle in a 
haystack or even trying to find “Needle in a Haystack” by The Velvelettes. It 
may be faster to locate albums by cover art or to find songs by searching for 
artist (or composer), genre, album, or playlist. You can browse your music 
any number of ways without interrupting the music you’re playing.

254
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
Going with the Cover Flow
Cover Flow (also called the cover browser) lets you flip through your cover 
art to select music alphabetically by artist. The iPod classic, iPod nano, iPod 
touch, and iPhone (as well as some earlier sixth-generation models) can 
display the cover art for albums.
To browse music by cover art with an iPod touch, choose Music from the 
Home screen; on an iPhone, choose iPod from the Home screen. Then turn 
the iPod touch or iPhone quickly to view it horizontally. This movement 
changes the display to landscape mode and displays the cover browser, as 
shown in Figure 16-1.
 
Figure 16-1: 
Cover Flow: 
the cover 
browser 
(on an iPod 
touch).
 
Slide your finger across the album covers to scroll swiftly through the music 
library, or tap to the right or left of the cover art in the foreground to move 
forward or backward an album cover at a time.
Tap the Play button in the lower-left corner (shown in Figure 16-1) to start 
playing the first song in the foreground album; the Play button turns to a 
Pause button so that you can tap it again to stop playback. Tap the i button 
in the lower-right corner (or tap the foreground cover art) to list the songs in 
that album. Then you can tap a song to start playing it.
The Cover Flow browser is also available on the iPod classic and iPod nano 
models. Choose Music from the main menu on an iPod classic and then 
choose Cover Flow from the Music menu. Rotate an iPod nano 90 degrees to 
the left or the right, and the Cover Flow browser appears automatically. (You 
can also choose Cover Flow from the Music menu.)

255
 Chapter 16: The Songs Remain the Same
To browse by cover art on an iPod nano or iPod classic, scroll the click wheel 
clockwise to move forward or counterclockwise to move backward through 
album covers. You can also press the Fast Forward or Rewind buttons to step 
forward or backward in your library one cover at a time. Press the Select 
button in the middle of the click wheel to select the album in the foreground; 
a list of songs appears. Use the click wheel to scroll the list of songs and then 
press the Select button to select a highlighted song.
Choosing artists and albums
You can quickly and easily locate a song by looking up either the song’s artist 
or its album. Your iPod or iPhone organizes music by artist and then within 
each artist by album.
To browse music by artist on an iPod touch, choose Music from the Home 
screen; on an iPhone, choose iPod from the Home screen. Next, tap the 
Artists icon along the bottom row of the Music or iPod screen. A scrollable 
list of artists appears, with an alphabet listed vertically along the right side, 
as shown in Figure 16-2 — flick your finger down to see the very top, which 
shows the search field.

Slide your finger up and down the alphabet to scroll quickly, or tap any letter in 
the alphabet to scroll the list directly to that letter. Tap an album title or its cover 
art to see a list of songs in the album. Tap a song title to start playing the song.
Follow these steps with an iPod classic or iPod nano (or earlier models) to 
locate a song by artist and then by album:
 
1. Choose Music from the iPod main menu.
 
2. From the Music menu that appears, choose Artists.
 
 To be more selective, you can browse by genre first. Choose Genres and 
then choose a genre from the Genres menu to get a list of artists that 
have songs in that genre (in alphabetical order by artist name).

 You can find All Songs at the top of the artist’s menu; it should already 
be highlighted. Press the Select button to choose it or scroll until an 
album name is highlighted; then press the Select button. A song list 
appears after you choose either an album or All Songs.
 
5. Select a song from the list.
 
 The songs in the album list are in album order (the order that they 
appear on the album); in the All Songs list, songs are listed in album 
order for each album.
To choose an album directly on an iPod nano or iPod classic, choose Albums 
from the Music menu. The Albums menu appears, displaying albums in 
alphabetical order. Choose an album from the Albums menu. Then select a 
song from the list.
Choosing playlists
When you synchronize your iPod or iPhone with your entire iTunes library, 
your iTunes playlists are included. Well, that makes sense, doesn’t it? You can 
choose to synchronize your iPod or iPhone with only specified playlists, as I 
describe in Chapter 9.
To browse music by playlist on your iPod touch or iPhone, tap Music on the 
iPod touch Home screen or iPod on the iPhone Home screen, and tap the 
Playlists icon along the bottom row of the Music or iPod screen. A scrollable 
list of playlists appears. Tap a playlist title to see a list of songs in the playlist 
and tap a song title to start playing the song.

your finger up and down the alphabet to scroll quickly, or tap any letter in 
the alphabet to scroll the list directly to that letter. To search, tap inside 
the search field in the top, and start typing in the onscreen keyboard that 
appears. Suggestions appear below matching what you type — you can tap a 
suggestion to go right to it. Tap a song title to start playing the song.
You can also find music by composer or genre on an iPod touch or iPhone by 
tapping the More icon along the bottom row of the Music or iPod screen. You 
can then select Composers to see an alphabetical list of composers or Genres 
to see all the genres of the songs. Tap either a composer or a genre to see a

the list as previously described to highlight the song title and then press 
either the Select button or the Play/Pause button to play the selected song.

259
 Chapter 16: The Songs Remain the Same
When the song finishes, the iPod or iPhone plays the next song in the 
sequence that appeared in the list you chose it from. For example, if you 
chose a song on the Songs screen of an iPod touch or iPhone or the Songs 
menu of an iPod nano or iPod classic, the next song would be the next one 
in sequence on the Songs screen or menu. If you chose the last song in an 
album on the Albums screen or menu, the iPod or iPhone stops after playing 
it. If you chose a song from a playlist, the next song would be the next one in 
the playlist, and after playing the last song, it also stops playing, as with an 
album. (See the section “Repeating songs,” later in this chapter, to find out 
how to repeat albums and playlists.)
Controlling playback on 
an iPod touch or iPhone
Whenever you play a song on an iPod touch or iPhone, you see the album 
cover associated with the song on the Now Playing screen. You also see the 
buttons for playback control — Previous/Rewind, Play/Pause, and Next/Fast 
Forward. (See Figure 16-4.) Slide your finger along the volume slider at the 
bottom of the display to change the volume.

Tap the Next/Fast Forward button once to play the next song in sequence, 
and tap the Previous/Rewind button once at the beginning of a song, or twice 
during the song, to play the previous song. You can fast-forward through 
a song by touching and holding down the Next/Fast Forward button, and 
you can rewind a song by touching and holding down the Previous/Rewind 
button.
You can tap the bullet-list button in the upper-right corner if you want to 
display a list of the album’s contents. You can then tap the title of another 
song on the album to start playing that song.
 
To return to menus and make other selections when playing a song, tap the 
left-arrow button in the upper-left corner of the display.
Tap underneath the left-arrow button or the album title while a song is 
playing to show more buttons and the scrubber bar for navigating through 
the song, as shown in Figure 16-5 — and if lyrics are available in the iTunes 
information, they also appear.
To skip to any point in a song, use your finger to drag the playhead along the 
scrubber bar. To finely scrub through a song, after dragging the playhead, 
slide your finger down the screen (toward the physical Home button) to slow 
the scrubbing.
To start a song over from the beginning, drag the playhead on the scrubber 
bar all the way to the left or tap the Previous/Rewind button once.
 
If you’re viewing another content menu on the iPod touch or iPhone, tap 
Now Playing at the upper-right corner of the display to go directly to the Now 
Playing display.
Controlling playback on an 
iPod classic or iPod nano
While a song is playing, the artist name and song name appear on the Now 
Playing screen. Color-display iPods also display the album cover, and the 
iPod classic and iPod nano models show a progress bar as well.
To adjust the volume on an iPod nano or iPod classic, scroll the click wheel 
when you see the progress bar. On older iPod models, press the Select button 
once to show the progress bar. For more info, see the later section “Adjusting

Press the Next/Fast Forward button once to play the next song in sequence, 
and press the Previous/Rewind button once at the beginning of a song, 
or twice during the song, to play the previous song. You can fast-forward 
through a song by pressing and holding down the Next/Fast Forward button, 
and rewind a song by pressing and holding down the Previous/Rewind button.
To start a song over from the beginning, move the playhead on the scrubber

While playing a song, you can browse the album or its artist as well as assign 
the song to an On-The-Go playlist or Genius playlist. Press and hold the Select 
button, and a menu appears with the following choices: Start Genius, Add to 
On-The-Go, Browse Album, Browse Artist, and Cancel. Scroll the click wheel to 
choose an option.
To return to the menus and make other selections when playing a song on an 
iPod classic or iPod nano, press the Menu button or press and hold the Select 
button until a menu appears on top of the cover art.
 
You can cross-fade songs on an iPod nano or iPod classic, just like in iTunes 
(as I describe in Chapter 13). A cross-fade creates a smooth transition from the 
ending of one song to the beginning of the next one. To set your iPod nano or 
iPod classic to cross-fade songs, choose Settings➪Playback➪Audio Crossfade 
from the main menu and press Select to turn it on. (Press Select again to turn 
it off.)
Repeating songs
If you want to drive yourself crazy repeating the same song over and over, 
your iPod or iPhone is happy to oblige. (You might want to try repeating 
“They’re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa” by Napoleon XIV, a favorite from 
the old The Dr. Demento Show radio broadcasts — and perhaps they will 
come to take you away.) More than likely, you’ll want to repeat a playlist or 
album, which you can easily do.
On an iPod touch or iPhone, tap underneath the left-arrow button or the 
album title while a song is playing. The Repeat and Shuffle buttons appear, 
along with the scrubber bar and lyrics, directly below the top row of buttons. 
(Refer to Figure 16-5.)
Ordinarily when a song finishes, the iPod touch or iPhone plays the next song 
in the sequence that appeared on the Playlists, Artists, Songs, or Albums 
screen you chose it from. When it reaches the end of that list, it stops — if 
you chose the last song in an album on the Albums screen, the iPod touch 
stops after playing it. But if you tap the Repeat button once while the songs 
are playing, the entire sequence repeats. If you chose an album, the album 
repeats; if you chose a playlist, the playlist repeats.

263
 Chapter 16: The Songs Remain the Same
After you tap Repeat once to repeat the sequence of songs, the Repeat button 
shows blue highlighting. Tap the Repeat button again to repeat only the 
current song — the button changes to include a blue-highlighted numeral 1. 
Tap it once more to return to normal playback.
You can set your iPod classic or iPod nano (or older models) to repeat a 
single song, or to repeat all the songs in the selected album or playlist, by 
following these steps:
 
1. Locate and play a song.
 
2. While the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to 
the main menu and then choose the Settings menu.
 
3. Scroll the Settings menu until Repeat is highlighted.
 
 The Repeat setting displays Off, One, or All next to it.
 
4. Press the Select button until the setting changes to One to repeat one 
song or All to repeat all the songs in the album or playlist (or Off to 
turn Repeat off).
 
 If you press the button more than you need to, keep pressing until the 
setting you want reappears. The button cycles among the Off, One, and 
All settings.
 
You can also press the Previous/Rewind button to repeat a song.
Shuffling song order
Maybe you want your song selections to be surprising and unpredictable, 
and you want your iPod or iPhone to read your mind. You can shuffle song 
playback to play in random order, just like an automated radio station 
without a disk jockey or program guide.
On an iPod touch or iPhone
When you are playing a song or a song is paused, you can just shake your 
iPod touch or iPhone, and it shuffles the songs in the album you are playing. By 
default, your iPod touch or iPhone is set to shuffle when shaken (not stirred). 
To turn this feature off, choose Settings➪Music from the iPod touch Home 
screen or Settings➪iPod from the iPhone Home screen, and tap On for the 
Shake to Shuffle option to turn it off. (Tap Off to turn it on.)
You can also set your iPod touch or iPhone to shuffle songs across your 
library. The shuffle algorithm is as random as it gets (not taking into account 
a fundamental tenet of chaos theory that says a pattern will emerge). When 
an iPod touch or iPhone creates a shuffle, it reorders the songs (like shuffling 
a deck of cards) and then plays them in the new order.

264
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
To turn your iPod touch or iPhone into a random song player, choose Music 
from the iPod touch Home screen or iPod from the iPhone Home screen, and 
tap the Songs icon at the bottom of the display. The song list appears, with 
Shuffle at the top of the list. Tap Shuffle to turn on Shuffle.
You can also set the iPod touch or iPhone to shuffle songs within an album or 
playlist after starting the album or playlist. Start playing a song in the album 
or playlist and then tap underneath the left-arrow button or the album title 
while a song is playing. The Repeat and Shuffle buttons appear, along with 
the scrubber bar, directly below the top row of buttons (refer to Figure 16-5). 
Tap the Shuffle button to shuffle songs within the currently playing album or 
playlist.
 
You can also set an iPod touch or iPhone to shuffle any album or playlist 
before playing it. First, select the playlist or album; then tap Shuffle at the top 
of the list of songs for that playlist or album.
 
Want to repeat an entire album or playlist but still shuffle the playing order 
each time you hear it? Start playing a song in the album or playlist and then 
set your iPod touch or iPhone to repeat all the songs in the album or playlist 
as described in the section “Repeating songs,” earlier in this chapter. Then set 
the iPod touch or iPhone to shuffle the songs as described in this section.
On an iPod nano or iPod classic
To turn your iPod classic or iPod nano (or older model) into a random song 
player, choose Shuffle Songs from the main menu.
To shuffle songs in an album or a playlist with an iPod classic or iPod nano 
(or older model), or to shuffle albums, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings from the main menu and scroll to Shuffle.
 
 The Shuffle setting displays Off next to it.
 
2. Press the Select button once (Off changes to Songs) to shuffle the 
songs in the next album or playlist you play. Press Select again (Songs 
changes to Albums) to shuffle the albums without shuffling the songs 
within each album.
 
 When you set Shuffle to Songs, the iPod classic or iPod nano shuffles 
songs within the currently playing playlist or album, or if nothing is 
playing, the next album or playlist you choose to play. When you set 
Shuffle to Albums, it plays all the songs on the currently playing album 
(or the next album you play) in order and then randomly selects another 
album in the list and plays through it in order.
 
 If you press the Select button more than you need to, keep pressing 
until the setting you want reappears. The button cycles among the Off, 
Songs, or Albums settings.

265
 Chapter 16: The Songs Remain the Same
 
While playing a song or while a song is paused, you can shake an iPod nano so 
that its motion detector switches to a random song. Whenever you shake it, 
the iPod nano shuffles again to another random song. Shaking to shuffle 
doesn’t change your shuffle settings — it just immediately shuffles songs. 
Shaking to shuffle is disabled when you put the Hold switch in the Hold 
position (so that you don’t keep changing songs as you jog or exercise 
strenuously) or if the iPod nano display is off. You can also disable it by 
choosing Settings➪Playback➪Shake from the main menu and then press the 
Select button until the Shake setting displays Off. To turn it on, choose 
Settings➪Playback➪Shake from the main menu and press the Select button 
until the Shake setting displays Shuffle.
Playing an iPod shuffle
Speaking of shuffling, the iPod shuffle is a special iPod designed with song 
shuffling foremost in mind — it offers no display or menus for selecting 
specific songs or albums by title. The idea is to use iTunes to put songs, 
audio books, and podcasts — as well as playlists of these elements — on the 
iPod shuffle (as I describe in Chapter 9), clip it to your clothes or something, 
put the Apple-supplied earbuds in your ears, and listen while controlling 
playback with the earbud’s remote controller. The VoiceOver feature tells you 
the name of the song you’re playing (as well as your battery status) and lets 
you choose from a spoken menu of playlists.
Starting playback
The iPod shuffle has a three-position switch on the top for playing songs in 
playlist order, for shuffling songs randomly, and for turning it off. To start 
playing songs, plug the earbuds into the iPod shuffle and place them in your 
ears, and slide the three-position switch from Off to Play in Order (the icon 
with arrows chasing each other in a closed loop) or Shuffle (the icon showing 
arrows crossed).
Playback starts as soon as you turn the three-way switch away from Off — to 
indicate this, the iPod shuffle status light blinks green once. However, if the 
iPod shuffle is already playing before you plug in your earbuds, playback may 
stop. To start playback, press the center button on the remote controller or 
toggle the three-way switch to Off and back to Play in Order or Shuffle.
 
You can use any set of headphones with your iPod shuffle — attach them and 
slide the three-position switch from Off to Play in Order or Shuffle. To turn 
off playback, slide the three-position switch back to Off. The only difference 
is that you don’t have a remote controller to control playback or adjust the 
volume.

266
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
Controlling playback
To pause playback, press the earbud remote controller’s center button once. 
The iPod shuffle status light blinks green for 30 seconds.
To go forward to the next track, press the center button twice quickly (the 
status light blinks green once). To fast-forward through the current track to 
the next track, press the center button twice, but on the second press, keep 
holding it down.
To go back to the previous track, press the center button three times quickly 
within the initial six seconds of the current track (the status light blinks green 
once); to go to the beginning of the current track, press the center button 
three times after the initial six seconds. To rewind through the current track 
to its beginning and then to the previous track, press the center button three 
times, but on the third press, keep holding it down.
If you set the three-position switch to Play in Order, going backward or 
forward navigates in the order the songs were copied to the iPod shuffle 
or the order within each playlist. However, if you set the position switch to 
Shuffle, the playing order is randomized first. Then going backward skips 
backward within the shuffle order, and going forward skips forward within 
the shuffle order. For example, suppose your iPod shuffle plays the 14th song, 
then the 5th song, and then the 20th song. In that case, pressing the center 
button three times quickly within the first six seconds of the 20th song takes 
you back to the 5th song, and pressing it three times again takes you back 
to the 14th song. From there, pressing the center button twice quickly skips 
through the songs in the same order again: the 14th song, the 5th song, and 
then the 20th song.
Using VoiceOver to choose playlists
If you installed the VoiceOver kit and enabled VoiceOver for your iPod shuffle 
in iTunes when you set it up (as I describe in Chapter 2), you can hear the 
iPod shuffle talk back to you. Specifically, you can hear song titles and artist 
names, a menu of playlists for you to choose from, and the status of your 
battery charge.
VoiceOver for your iPod shuffle is enabled by default, but you can turn it on 
or off by connecting your iPod shuffle to your computer for synchronizing 
it, as I describe in Chapter 9. The Summary page of the iPod shuffle sync 
options appears, as shown in Figure 16-6. Under Voice Feedback, select the 
Enable VoiceOver check box to turn it on (or deselect it to turn it off). You 
also have the option to choose the language you want from the Language 
pop-up menu. This sets the language for spoken messages and playlist 
names, as well as many of the song titles and artist names. Finally, click the 
Apply button to apply these settings.

267
 Chapter 16: The Songs Remain the Same
To hear the title and artist of the song, press and hold the center button. If 
you press the center button twice quickly to go to the next track, the next 
message plays as well.
To hear the playlist menu, press and hold the center button until you hear 
a tone and then release it to hear the names of playlists. The playlist menu 
announces the current playlist (if one is playing), “All Songs,” any other 
playlists in alphabetical order, any podcasts, and finally any audio book titles. 
As you listen to the playlist menu, you can press the plus (+) or minus (–) 
button to move forward or backward in the playlist menu. After hearing the 
playlist, podcast, or audio book title you want, press the center button once 
to select it. If you don’t want to choose anything from the playlist menu, you 
can exit by pressing and holding the center button.
 
Figure 16-6:

If you’ve synced an iPod shuffle loaded with the VoiceOver kit with iTunes, 
iTunes adds a new option to the Options tab of the Get Info dialog: VoiceOver 
Language. You can use it to pick a different language for specific songs. After 
selecting the songs in iTunes, choose File➪Get Info, click the Options tab, and 
then choose a language from the VoiceOver Language pop-up menu. Click the 
OK button to finish.

Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
Ordering Playlists On-The-Go
You can create a temporary, On-The-Go playlist, queuing the songs in the 
order you want, right on your iPod touch, iPod nano, iPod classic, or iPhone. 
The selections appear automatically in a playlist appropriately called 
On-The-Go, on the Playlists menu. This option is particularly useful for 
picking songs to play right before driving a car. (Hel-lo! You shouldn’t be 
messing with your iPod or iPhone while driving.)
Selecting and playing songs 
for an On-The-Go playlist
Follow these steps with an iPod touch or iPhone to select songs for your 
On-The-Go playlist:
 
1. Choose Music from the iPod touch Home screen or iPod from the 
iPhone Home screen.
 
 The Music or iPod screen appears with the Playlists and other icons 
along the bottom of the display.
 
2. Tap the Playlists icon and choose On-The-Go from the Playlists list.
 
 The Songs list appears with a plus (+) sign next to each song, as well as 
an Add All Songs option at the top, as shown in Figure 16-7. If you have 
only several dozen albums, this list isn’t too long, and you can skip to 
Step 4. If you have a lot more music, narrow your search with Step 3.
 
Figure 16-7:
 Add songs 
to the 
On-The-Go 
playlist.
 

269
 Chapter 16: The Songs Remain the Same
 
3. (Optional) Tap Playlists, Artists, Songs, or More to narrow your search 
for songs to add to the On-The-Go playlist.
 
 Tap an icon along the bottom row (see Figure 16-7) to browse your iPod 
touch or iPhone library — tap Playlists to select songs from playlists 
or entire playlists, tap Artists to browse artists, or tap Songs to select 
songs. On an iPod touch, tap Albums to select from albums or tap More 
to select songs from compilations, to browse by genre, or to select audio 
books or podcast episodes. On an iPhone, tap More to select songs from 
albums or compilations, to browse by genre, or to select audio books or 
podcast episodes.
 
4. Tap the plus (+) sign next to a song you want to add to the On-The-Go 
playlist, or tap the plus sign next to Add All Albums to add all the 
albums of an artist found in Step 3.
 
 As you tap the plus sign for a song, the song is included in the 
On-The-Go playlist, and it turns gray in the list so that you know it has 
already been selected. You can tap Add All Albums as an alternative if 
you want to add all the songs for a particular artist — first browse for 
that artist in Step 3.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4, adding songs in the order you want them to be 
played.
 
 You can continue to add songs to the list. Your iPod touch or iPhone 
keeps track of the On-The-Go playlist until you clear it (as I describe in 
the section “Clearing an On-The-Go playlist,” later in this chapter) or 
synchronize it, as I describe in Chapter 9.
 
6. Tap the Done button when you’re finished adding songs.
 
 The Done button appears in the upper-right corner while you select 
songs, just waiting for you to finish. After touching Done, you return to 
the list of songs in the On-The-Go playlist, as shown in Figure 16-8.
 
7. To start playing the On-The-Go playlist, tap any song.
 
 Scroll up or down the list (see Figure 16-8) to choose a song, and tap the 
song title to play the playlist starting from that song. You can tap Shuffle 
to shuffle the songs in the playlist.
 
The songs in the playlist are in playlist order (the order you added them). You 
can change that order by tapping the Edit button (see Figure 16-8), which 
displays the Edit screen with a Move icon (three horizontal bars, like half of 
an I-Ching symbol) on the far right side of each song. Drag the Move icon for a 
song to move it up or down the list. Then tap the Done button at the top of the 
Edit screen.
 
You can also add entire playlists, entire albums, or everything by an artist to 
the On-The-Go playlist. In Step 4, tap the Playlists, Artists, or Album icon on an 
iPod touch (or the More icon followed by the Albums selection on an iPhone) 
to show one of those menus and then select a playlist, album, or artist. Finally, 
tap All Songs at the top of the list of song selections.

Clearing an On-The-Go playlist
After creating the On-The-Go playlist, it remains defined in your iPod or 
iPhone until you clear it.
It turns out that when you synchronize your iPod or iPhone with your iTunes 
library, the On-The-Go playlist is automatically copied to your iTunes library 
and then cleared. (You can rename the playlist there, just like any other 
playlist — see Chapter 14.)
You can also clear the On-The-Go playlist completely in one step on an iPod 
touch or iPhone: just tap the Clear button. (See Figure 16-8.)
To clear the On-The-Go playlist in an iPod nano or iPod classic, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Choose Music➪Playlists➪On-The-Go from the main menu.
 
2. Select Clear Playlist in the list of items in the playlist.
 
 The Clear menu appears, showing the Clear Playlist and Cancel options.
 
3. Select the Clear Playlist option.
 
 All the items disappear from the On-The-Go playlist. If you don’t want to 
clear the playlist, select the Cancel option.
Consulting the iTunes Genius
The Genius button for creating Genius playlists in iTunes (wisely laid out for all 
to see in Chapter 14) has also been incorporated into the iPod nano, iPod clas-
sic, iPod touch, and iPhone to create Genius playlists. You can also listen to your 
Genius Mixes in your iTunes library on your iPod nano, iPod touch, or iPhone.
 
For Genius to work, it has to recognize the song you select and you need to 
have enough songs on your iPod or iPhone that are (basically) similar. As for 
the mechanics of it all, you do need to set up an account in the iTunes Store if 
you don’t already have one (see Chapter 7) and then enable the Genius feature 
in iTunes as I describe in Chapter 14. Finally, you have to synchronize your 
iPod or iPhone as described in Chapter 9 so that the Genius is activated. (You 
can also add Genius playlists along with other playlists in iTunes to your iPod 
or iPhone while syncing.)

273
 Chapter 16: The Songs Remain the Same
To create a Genius playlist on an iPod touch or iPhone, choose Music from 
the iPod touch Home screen or iPod from the iPhone Home screen and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Locate and start playing a song to base the Genius playlist on.
 
 The Now Playing screen appears when the song is playing.
 
2. Tap the Now Playing screen to see the control buttons.
 
 Tap underneath the left-arrow button or the album title while a song is 
playing. The Repeat, Genius, and Shuffle buttons appear underneath 
the scrubber bar directly below the top row of buttons. (Refer to Figure 
16-5.) The Genius button is the one in the center sporting the atom icon.
 
3. Tap the Genius button.
 
 The Genius playlist appears, as shown in Figure 16-9, with New, Refresh, 
and Save buttons at the top. You can flick your finger to scroll the list. 
The Genius playlist can be as long as 25 songs. Tap any song to start 
playing the playlist from that song.

4. (Optional) Refresh the Genius playlist by tapping Refresh.
 
 Refreshing a playlist changes it to include different songs based on the 
same song you played (depending on how many similar songs you have 
in your iPod touch or iPhone).
 
5. Save the Genius playlist by tapping Save.
 
 The playlist is saved in the Playlists section of your iPod touch or 
iPhone using the title of the song it is based on. The playlist is copied 

274
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
back to your iTunes library when you sync your iPod touch or iPhone. 
That’s all you need to do — the next steps are optional.
 
 If you subsequently refresh a saved Genius playlist before syncing, the 
saved playlist is refreshed and you lose the previous version of it.
 
6. (Optional) Create a new Genius playlist by tapping New and then 
selecting a new song to base it on.
 
 After touching New, the song list appears for selecting a song. Choose a 
song, and your iPod touch or iPhone creates a new Genius playlist and 
starts playing the song, displaying the Now Playing screen.
 
7. (Optional) After Step 6, return to the Genius playlist by tapping the 
left-arrow button in the upper-left corner of the Now Playing screen.
 
You can refresh any Genius playlist, whether you created it in iTunes and 
synced to your iPod touch or iPhone, or you created it directly on your iPod 
touch or iPhone. Select the playlist and tap Refresh at the top of the list (or 
tap Delete to delete the list).
 
You can set an iPod touch or iPhone to create a Genius playlist based on a 
song before you actually start playing the song itself. Just choose Music from 
the iPod touch Home screen or iPod from the iPhone Home screen, and then 
tap Playlists in the lower-left corner of the display. Tap Genius at the top of the 
list of playlists, and a list of songs appears. Select a song, and your iPod touch 
or iPhone creates a Genius playlist based on it and then starts playing the 
song you selected. To return to the Genius playlist, tap the left-arrow button in 
the upper-left corner of the Now Playing screen.
To create a Genius playlist on an iPod nano or iPod classic, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Locate and start playing a song to base the Genius playlist on.
 
 The Now Playing screen appears when the song is playing.
 
2. Press and hold the Select button until a menu appears on top of the 
Now Playing screen.
 
3. Choose Start Genius and press the Select button.
 
 The new Genius playlist appears, with Refresh and Save Playlist at the 
top of the list. Scroll the list to see all the songs, and select any song to 
start playing the playlist associated with that song.
 
4. (Optional) Refresh the Genius playlist by selecting Refresh at the top 
of the Genius playlist.
 
 Refreshing a playlist changes it to include different songs based on the 
same song you played (depending on how many similar songs you have 
in your iPod).

275
 Chapter 16: The Songs Remain the Same
 
5. (Optional) Save the Genius playlist by selecting Save Playlist (under 
Refresh at the top of the Genius playlist).
 
 The playlist is saved in the playlists section of your iPod using the title 
of the song it is based on. The playlist syncs automatically with your 
iTunes library the next time you connect your iPod and sync it (as I 
describe in Chapter 9).
 
 If you subsequently refresh a saved Genius playlist, the saved playlist is 
refreshed and you lose the previous version of it.
Genius Mixes are generated by iTunes from songs in your library that go 
great together. (See Chapter 14 to learn how to apply the touch of Genius.) 
Genius Mixes are synced automatically if you sync everything to your iPod 
touch, iPhone, or iPod nano, or you can sync specific Genius Mixes as 
playlists — see Chapter 9 to learn how to sync by playlist.
To play your Genius Mixes from your iTunes library on an iPod nano, choose 
Music➪Genius Mixes from the main menu. You can use the Next/Fast-forward  
or Previous/Rewind buttons to browse the Genius Mixes — the dots at the 
bottom of the Genius Mixes screen indicate how many Genius Mixes are 
synced to your iPod nano. To start playing a Genius Mix, press the Play/
Pause button or the Select button when you see its screen. Genius Mixes play 
just like playlists.
To play them on your iPod touch, choose Music from the Home screen and 
tap the Genius icon in the lower left corner. On an iPhone, choose iPod from 
the Home screen and tap the Genius icon in the lower left corner. You can 
flick with your finger left or right to browse the Genius Mixes — the dots at 
the bottom of the Genius Mixes screen indicate how many Genius Mixes are 
synced to your iPod touch or iPhone. To start playing a Genius Mix, tap the 
Play arrow in the middle of the screen for a Genius Mix. Genius Mixes play 
just like playlists.
Adjusting and Limiting the Volume
 
Because an iPod or iPhone can be quite loud when set to its highest volume, I 
recommend turning down the volume before using headphones.
To adjust the volume on an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Play something (like music).
 
2. While the content is playing, tap the lower portion of the display and 
slide your finger on the volume slider.

276
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
 
 After tapping the lower portion of the display while playing something, 
the volume slider with a silver knob appears on the iPod touch or 
iPhone screen at the bottom underneath the playback controls. (Refer to 
Figure 16-4.) Use your finger to slide the knob to the right to increase the 
volume or to the left to decrease the volume.
To adjust volume for an iPod classic or iPod nano, follow these steps:
 
1. Play something.
 
2. While the content is playing, change the volume by scrolling the click 
wheel.
 
 A volume bar appears in the iPod display to guide you. Scroll with your 
thumb or finger clockwise to increase the volume or counterclockwise 
to decrease the volume.
To adjust the volume for an iPod shuffle, press the Volume Up (+) or Volume 
Down (– button on the earbud remote.
You can also limit the highest volume for your iPod or iPhone to be lower 
than the actual maximum. This limit can help protect your hearing while 
you’re listening to content from sources with different volume levels.
To limit the volume to be lower than the actual maximum volume on an iPod 
touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings from the Home screen.
 
2. Choose iPod from the Settings screen of an iPhone or Music from the 
Settings screen of an iPod touch.
 
3. Choose Volume Limit from the iPod Settings (iPhone) or Music Settings 
(iPod touch) screen.
 
 A volume slider appears with a silver knob.
 
4. Slide your finger on the volume slider to limit the volume.
 
 Slide the knob with your finger to the right to increase the volume or to 
the left to decrease the volume.
 
5. Tap the iPod button (iPhone) or the Music button (iPod touch) in the 
upper-left corner of the display to set the limit and return to the 
previous menu, or if you want, tap the Lock Volume Limit button to 
lock the volume limit.
 
 If you accept the new limit without locking it, you get to skip the next 
step; you’re done. The lock is useful for locking the volume limit so that 
others can’t change it (such as your children). However, it also means 
that you have to enter the volume limit code to unlock the iPod touch or 
iPhone to change the volume limit.

277
 Chapter 16: The Songs Remain the Same
 
6. Set the volume limit code for locking the volume limit.
 
 If you tapped the Lock Volume Limit button to lock the volume limit, 
your iPod touch or iPhone displays four squares for entering a code 
number. Tap the calculator-style number pad to type numbers for 
your code and be sure to make up a code that you can remember! (If 
you don’t want to enter a code, tap the Cancel button in the upper-left 
corner.)
To limit the volume to be lower than the actual maximum volume on an 
iPod shuffle, connect it to your computer for synchronizing, as I describe in 
Chapter 9. The Summary page of the iPod shuffle sync options appears (refer 
to Figure 16-6). Select the Limit Maximum Volume check box and drag the 
volume slider underneath this option to set the maximum volume. Finally, 
click the Apply button to apply the new setting.
Tweaking the Sound
You can do some tweaking of the sound quality in your iPod or iPhone 
in addition to the usual sound adjustments you make in iTunes (which I 
describe in amplified detail in Chapter 13). You can use the same Sound 
Check option provided in iTunes to standardize the volume level of all the 
songs. You can also use the iPod or iPhone equalizer to choose presets for 
different musical genres, listening environments, or speakers.
Peaking with the Sound Check
To enable Sound Check to work in your iPod or iPhone, first follow the steps 
in iTunes described in Chapter 13 to sound-check your iTunes library. After 
syncing your iPod or iPhone with the sound-checked library (as I describe 
in Chapter 9), you can take advantage of the volume leveling in your iPod or 
iPhone.
To turn on Sound Check in an iPod touch or iPhone, choose Settings➪Music 
from the iPod touch Home screen or Settings➪iPod from the iPhone Home 
screen. Tap the Off button next to the Sound Check option to turn it on. Tap 
On to turn it back off.
To turn on Sound Check in an iPod nano or iPod classic, choose Settings➪
Playback➪Sound Check➪On from the main menu. To disable it, choose 
Settings➪Playback➪Sound Check➪Off.

Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
To turn on Sound Check in an iPod shuffle, connect it to your computer for 
synchronizing, as I describe in Chapter 9. The Summary page of the iPod 
shuffle sync options appears (refer to Figure 16-6). Select the Enable Sound 
Check option, and click the Apply button to apply the new setting. After the 
iPod shuffle syncs with the iTunes library, the songs in your iPod shuffle are 
sound-checked.
All things being equal(ized)
You can use the iPod or iPhone built-in equalizer presets to improve or 
enhance the sound coming through a particular stereo system and speakers. 
With the equalizer presets, you can customize playback for different musical 
genres, listening environments, or speakers.
 
The iPod or iPhone equalizer uses a bit more battery power when it’s on, so 
you might have less playing time.
To set an equalizer preset on an iPod touch or iPhone, choose Settings➪
Music from the iPod touch Home screen or Settings➪iPod from the iPhone 
Home screen, and tap EQ to display a list of presets. You can scroll the list of 
presets and tap a preset to select it — a check mark appears next to it after 
you select it. The equalizer is set to Off until you select one of the presets.
To select an iPod equalizer preset on an iPod classic or iPod nano, choose 
Settings➪Playback➪EQ from the main menu to display a list of presets. You 
can scroll the list of presets and press Select to select one. The equalizer is 
set to Off until you select one of the presets.
Each equalizer preset offers a different balance of frequencies designed to 
enhance the sound in certain ways. For example, Bass Booster increases the 
volume of the low (bass) frequencies; Treble Booster does the same to the 
high (treble) frequencies.
To see what a preset actually does to the frequencies, choose Window➪
Equalizer in iTunes to open the iTunes equalizer; then select the same preset 
by name. The faders in the equalizer show you exactly what the preset does.

to specific songs, audio books, podcast episodes, and videos — and use those 
presets when playing these items back on your iPod or iPhone — by visiting 
the free tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com).

Bring Videos, Books, and Podcasts
In This Chapter
▶ Playing movies and TV shows on your iPod or iPhone
▶ Playing YouTube videos
▶ Playing podcasts and audio books
▶ Listening to the iPod nano’s FM radio
T
he Buggles sang “Video Killed the Radio Star,” but both coexist quite 
nicely on your iPod or iPhone, which is not only a fantastic music player 
(and the current iPod nano can even play FM radio), but also a terrific video 
player, with crisp, clear picture quality. Video appears horizontally on an 
iPod touch, iPod nano, or iPhone screen (in what’s known as landscape 
mode), and if you rotate it 180 degrees to the opposite horizontal position, the 
video adjusts accordingly. All the controls you expect in a DVD player are 
right on the screen at the touch of a finger.
You can also play audio books and podcasts on this multimedia machine. 
The iTunes Store offers an amazing selection of TV shows, movies, audio 
books, and podcasts. (See Chapter 7.) This chapter shows you how to control 
video playback, skip forward or backward, and scale the picture to fit your 
screen. It also shows you how to watch YouTube videos on your iPod touch 
or iPhone.
Everything’s Coming Up Videos
Movies, TV shows, and music videos are easy to locate and play. Videos you 
purchase from the iTunes Store are ready to use, but videos you bring in from 
other sources may have to be converted first by iTunes for use on your iPod 
or iPhone. You can tell whether a video needs to be converted by selecting 
the video in iTunes and checking the Advanced menu: the Create iPod or 
iPhone version option is grayed out. To convert a video, select the video in 
iTunes and choose Advanced➪Create iPod or iPhone Version.

280
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
 
To find out more about why videos need to be converted and how to prepare 
your own videos and convert imported videos for use with an iPod or iPhone, 
visit the free tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com).
To locate and play a video on your iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap Videos on the iPod touch Home screen, or tap iPod on the iPhone 
Home screen and then tap the Videos icon at the bottom of the screen.
 
2. Scroll the Videos screen to see the sections for Movies, TV Shows, 
Music Videos, and Podcasts (video podcasts only).
 
 The video titles are listed in alphabetical order within these sections.
 
3. Tap the title of an item to play it.
To play a video on an iPod classic or iPod nano, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Videos from the main menu to select a movie, TV show, or 
imported video. Choose Music from the main menu to select a music 
video.
 
2. Scroll the menu until the title is highlighted and then press the Select 
button to play your selection.
 
 Hold the iPod nano horizontally to view the picture. If you rotate the iPod 
nano to the opposite horizontal position, the video adjusts accordingly.
Videos are automatically set to remember the playback position when you 
pause them. (See how to pause in the next section.) This feature lets you 
pause a video or TV episode in iTunes while you synchronize your iPod or 
iPhone. After syncing, you can continue playing the video or episode on your 
iPod or iPhone from where you paused. This feature also works the opposite 
way: If you start playing a video on your iPod or iPhone and then pause, and 
then you sync it with iTunes, the video retains the playback position so that 
you can continue playing it in iTunes from where you paused.
Playback at your fingertips 
on an iPod touch or iPhone
To control playback on an iPod touch or iPhone, tap the screen to show the 
video controls (as shown in Figure 17-1). You can tap again to hide them.
Tap the Play/Pause button while a video is playing to pause the playback. To 
raise or lower the volume, drag the volume slider. (See Figure 17-1.) To stop 
watching a video before it finishes playing, tap the Done button in the upper-
left corner of the display or press the physical Home button.

Next/Fast Forward
Volume
You can fast-forward through a video by touching and holding down the 
Next/Fast Forward button, and you can rewind a video by touching and 
holding down the Previous/Rewind button.
To skip to any point in a video, drag the playhead along the scrubber bar. To 
start a video over from the beginning, drag the playhead on the scrubber bar 
all the way to the left or tap the Previous/Rewind button (if the video doesn’t 
contain chapters).
 
If the video contains chapters, you can skip to the previous or next chapter 
by tapping the Previous/Rewind or Next/Fast Forward button. To start playing 
at a specific chapter, tap the bullet-list button that appears in the upper-right 
corner.
If a video offers an alternative audio language or subtitles, a Subtitles button 
appears. Tap the Subtitles button and then choose a language from the Audio 
list or a language from the Subtitles list, or tap On to turn off subtitles.
 
You can delete a video directly from your iPod touch or iPhone by flicking left 
or right across the video selection in the Videos menu and then tapping the 
Delete button that appears. Your video is still in iTunes but is deleted from 
the iPod touch or iPhone — but remember, you can sync it again and copy the 
video back to it (as I explain in Chapter 9). If you delete a rented movie from 
the iPod touch or iPhone, it’s deleted permanently.

282
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
Scaling the picture on an 
iPod touch or iPhone
Videos are displayed in landscape mode in widescreen format on an iPod 
touch or iPhone. You can also scale the video picture to fill the screen or to 
fit within the screen. Tap the Scale button (the one with two arrows facing 
away from each other — refer to Figure 17-1) or double-tap the video picture 
itself to switch from one to the other.
Filling the screen may crop the sides or top and bottom to give you a larger 
view of the center of the picture. Fitting to the screen assures that the entire 
picture is shown, but you may see black bars on the sides or top and bottom.
Playback under your thumb 
on an iPod nano or classic
The video playback controls on an iPod classic or iPod nano work the same 
way as with songs — you use precisely the same buttons, in other words. 
Scroll the click wheel to adjust the volume as you would for a song (as I 
describe in Chapter 16).
To pause playback, press the Play/Pause button while a video is playing. To 
start again, press Play/Pause again.
To skip to any point in a video, press the Select button to reveal the scrubber 
bar. Scroll the click wheel to move the playhead across the scrubber bar 
forward (to the right) or backward (to the left) in the video.
Press the Next/Fast Forward button once to play the next video in sequence 
(such as the next episode of a TV show), and press the Previous/Rewind 
button once at the beginning of a video, or twice during the video, to play 
the previous video in sequence. You can fast-forward through a video by 
pressing and holding down the Next/Fast Forward button, and rewind a video 
by pressing and holding down the Previous/Rewind button. If the video 
contains chapters, you can skip to the previous or next chapter by pressing 
the Previous/Rewind or Next/Fast Forward button — but remember, this trick 
works only if the original video was set up to contain chapters. To start a 
video over from the beginning, move the playhead on the scrubber bar all the 
way to the left, as previously described, or press the Previous/Rewind button 
once.
To return to menus and make other selections on an iPod classic or iPod 
nano, press the Menu button.

 Chapter 17: Bring Videos, Books, and Podcasts
YouTube on Your iPod touch or iPhone
With the iPod touch or iPhone, the newest and most popular videos in 
YouTube are right in your hand. All you need to do is connect to the Internet — 
by Wi-Fi with an iPod touch, or by Wi-Fi or 3G with an iPhone. (See Chapter 4 
to set up Wi-Fi.) You can search for and play videos, bookmark favorites for 
later playback, and share videos with others by e-mail.
Tap YouTube on the Home screen to run the YouTube app. If this is your first 
visit to the YouTube app, the Featured screen appears, as shown in Figure 17-2 
(left side). Otherwise, the screen you were viewing when you last used the 
app appears.
 
Figure 17-2: 
YouTube: 
Featured 
videos (left) 
and most-
viewed 
videos for 
today, for 
this week, 
and for all 
time (right).
 
You can tap icons along the bottom of the display to get to other screens, 
such as Most Viewed, as shown in Figure 17-2 (right side), which offers 
buttons at the top for today’s most-viewed videos, the faves for this week, 
and all the most-viewed videos.
After you’ve saved your favorites as bookmarks (see the section 
“Bookmarking and sharing,” later in this chapter), you can go right to your 
favorite videos by tapping the Favorites icon. Tap the More icon to see even 
more screens, including Top Rated (the best of the best), Most Recent (the 
most recent videos added), and History (all the videos you’ve played so far). 
You can also tap the Sign In button to sign in to your YouTube account and 
access the My Videos section of your account.

284
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
 
The History screen offers a Clear button so that you can clear your history at 
any time.
Running down a stream: Playback control
Tap a selection to play the video. YouTube streams the video to your iPod 
touch or iPhone — sending it bit by bit — so that you can start playing it 
immediately.
Tap the video picture to see the controls (see Figure 17-3, left side), which 
are exactly like the video controls described in the previous section. The 
progress of the downloaded stream appears in the scrubber bar. Even though 
you can play the video as it streams, you might want to pause it for a few 
seconds so that more of the stream is downloaded. You can then play the 
video without any hiccups (depending, of course, on the speed and stability 
of your connection).

Bookmarking and sharing
YouTube offers a couple of handy buttons on its videos (see Figure 17-3, left 
side, for both buttons):
 
✓ Bookmark button (a book icon): This button appears to the left of the 
Previous/Rewind button, and you can use it to bookmark the video so 
that you can easily find it on the Favorites screen.

285
 Chapter 17: Bring Videos, Books, and Podcasts
 
✓ Share button (an envelope icon): This button is located to the right 
of the Next/Fast Forward button. Tap it to bring up the e-mail sending 
screen to share the video with others via e-mail — see Chapter 20 for 
details on how to fill out the e-mail message.
Tap the Bookmark button to save a bookmark for the video — the video 
selection appears in the Favorites screen (tap the Favorites icon in the 
bottom row). (The Bookmark button is gray rather than white if the video is 
already bookmarked.)
You can also bookmark or share the video without playing it — in case the 
material disgusts you or you don’t have time for it — and you can view 
information about the video as well as related video selections, to clue you 
into its content before playing it. Tap the right-arrow button on the right side 
of each selection (refer to Figure 17-2, right side) to see information about the 
video and to use the Bookmark or Share buttons.
To delete entries from your Favorites screen (especially those news stories 
that have gone stale), tap the Favorites icon at the bottom of the display to 
show your bookmarked favorites; then tap the Edit button in the upper-right 
corner of the screen. The Favorites screen changes to include circled minus 
(–) signs next to the video selections. To delete a bookmarked video selection, 
tap the circled minus sign, which rotates and displays a Delete button over 
the selection; then tap the Delete button. To cancel deletion, tap the rotated 
circled minus sign again. Tap the Done button in the upper-right corner of the 
Favorites screen to finish editing.
Searching for videos
To search for the videos on YouTube that everyone’s talking about, tap the 
Search icon in the bottom row of icons. Then tap the Search Entry field that 
appears at the top of the screen. The on-screen keyboard pops up, ready for 
your search term. (For instructions on using the on-screen keyboard, see 
Chapter 3.)
If the entry field already has a search term, tap the circled x in the right 
corner of the field to clear its contents. Then tap out the letters of the search 
term using the on-screen keyboard and tap the Search key on the keyboard. 
Immediately after tapping Search, video selections from YouTube appear 
below, as shown in Figure 17-3, right side (in which I type just u2 to get the 
latest U2 music videos).
You can scroll this list by dragging up and down. If a video selection appears 
that satisfies your search, tap it to play it without further ado.

286
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
One Chapter at a Time: Audio 
Books and Podcasts
Audio books are, naturally, organized into chapters or parts. Podcasts are 
also organized into parts, called episodes, and both play the same way. The 
audio book title or podcast name and episode appear on your iPod or iPhone 
display along with its cover — similar to a book or album cover.
After syncing your audio books and podcast episodes (as I describe in 
glorious detail in Chapter 9), you can play them on your iPod or iPhone. 
Audio books and podcasts are automatically set to remember the playback 
position when you pause. If you pause playback on your iPod or iPhone and 
then sync with iTunes, you can resume playback at that position on either 
the iPod or iPhone, or in iTunes.
Finding and playing on an 
iPod touch or iPhone
Tap Music on the iPod touch Home screen or iPod on the iPhone Home 
screen, and then tap the More icon at the lower-right corner of the Music or 
iPod screen to see the More screen.
For the literary-minded, tap Audiobooks on the More screen and then scroll 
the Audiobooks screen to select and play an audio book. Tap an audio book 
on the Audiobooks screen that appears and then tap a chapter or part to play 
it, starting from that point. The audio book chapters or parts are listed in 
proper order for each book.
For a podcast, tap Podcasts on the More screen and then scroll the Podcasts 
screen to select and play a podcast episode. Podcasts are organized by 
podcast name (which is like an album name), and episodes are listed within 
each podcast in the order that they were released (by date). A blue dot 
appears next to any podcast that has unplayed episodes.
You control the playback of an audio book or podcast episode exactly the 
same way as a song (see Chapter 16) — you can pause playback by tapping 
the Play/Pause button and so on. You can control video podcasts the same 
way you control videos. (See the section “Everything’s Coming Up Videos,” 
earlier in this chapter.)

287
 Chapter 17: Bring Videos, Books, and Podcasts
Finding and playing on an 
iPod nano or iPod classic
Podcasts, naturally, have their own menu on an iPod nano or iPod classic. 
They’re organized by podcast name (which is like an album name), and 
podcast episodes are listed within each podcast in the order that they were 
released (by date).
To play a podcast episode, choose Podcasts from the iPod classic or iPod 
nano main menu. Scroll the Podcasts menu until the podcast name is 
highlighted and press the Select button; then scroll and select an episode. A 
blue dot appears next to any podcast that has unplayed episodes.
To play an audio book, choose Music from the iPod classic or iPod nano main 
menu, and then Audiobooks from the Music menu. The audio book episodes 
(collections of chapters) are listed in the proper order for each book. Scroll 
the list of audio book episodes until the one you want is highlighted and then 
press the Select button to play it.
Playing the FM Radio in an iPod nano
The current iPod nano model includes an FM radio that displays station and 
song information for radio stations that support RDS (Radio Data System). If 
the station supports iTunes Tagging, you can also tag any songs you hear for 
later purchase from the iTunes Store. You can also pause a radio broadcast, 
and resume playing it from the same point up to 15 minutes later.
Connect your earbuds or headphones to your iPod nano first, because the 
iPod nano uses the earbud or headphone cord as the FM radio antenna. Also, 
the radio doesn’t play through the iPod nano speaker— only through the 
earbuds or headphones.
To hear the radio, choose Radio from the iPod nano main menu. The radio 
screen appears with a station already selected — if you don’t see the radio 
dial underneath the station’s number, press the Select button until it appears. 
You can scroll the click wheel to tune to a station while you listen for a signal, 
or press the Next/Fast-forward or Previous/Rewind buttons to jump from sta-
tion to station. Press and hold Next/Fast-forward or Previous/Rewind to scan 
stations and hear a five-second preview of each station. To stop scanning and 
listen to the current station, press the Select button. 

288
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
To save a station as a favorite, Press and hold the Select button until a menu 
appears, scroll to highlight Add to Favorites, and then press the Select button. 
After saving one or more favorite stations, pressing Next/Fast-forward or 
Previous/Rewind while tuning takes you to the next or previous favorite station.
After you tune to a station, the progress bar replaces the radio dial. (Press the 
Select button to switch between the progress bar and the radio dial.) The 
progress bar fills up as you continue to listen to the station. To pause the 
broadcast while the radio is playing, press the Play/Pause button. The actual 
time you paused appears above the progress bar. As Live Pause continues, a 
yellow triangle appears for your pause point in the progress bar, and the progress 
bar continues to fill up — showing the time that’s passed since you paused. 
Press Play/Pause again to resume the broadcast from the point you paused.
You can navigate back and forth along the progress bar. To skip forward 
or back in one-minute intervals, press the Next/Fast-forward or Previous/
Rewind buttons. To fast-forward or rewind, press and hold Next/Fast-forward 
or Previous/Rewind, or scroll the click wheel. The progress bar displays as 
completely filled when Live Pause reaches the 15-minute limit. You can still 
navigate back and forth through the 15 most recent minutes, as long as your 
pause isn’t cleared. Anything older than 15 minutes is cleared to make room 
for the continuing broadcast. If you pause without resuming for 15 minutes, 
your iPod nano goes to sleep and clears your paused radio.
To disable Live Pause, press Menu from the Radio screen, highlight and select 
Live Pause, and then press the Select button to select Off. To enable Live 
Pause again, select On.
Tagging a song that strikes your fancy for later purchase from the iTunes 
Store is a great idea, but it only works with stations that support iTunes 
Tagging. To tag a song you hear, press and hold the Select button until a 
menu appears. Highlight Tag in the menu and press the Select button. Tagged 
songs are marked with a tag icon next to the song title, and they appear in 
the Radio menu under Tagged Songs (press the Menu button while the radio 
is playing to see the Radio menu).
The next time you sync your iPod nano to iTunes, your tagged songs are 
synced to iTunes and removed from the iPod nano. You can preview and 
purchase these tagged songs by clicking Tagged in the Store section of the 
Source pane, and then click the View button for the song you want. To pre-
view the song, double-click it or click the preview button. To buy the song, 
click the Buy button. 
To turn the FM Radio off and clear paused radio, press the Menu button and 
choose Stop Radio (which appears only if the radio is on). You can also 
display the most recently played songs on a station that supports RDS by 
pressing Menu and then choosing Recent Songs. 

Chapter 18
Your Pocket Picture Player
In This Chapter
▶ Synchronizing photo albums
▶ Viewing photos and slide shows
▶ Taking pictures and shooting videos with an iPhone
▶ Shooting videos with an iPod nano
▶ Sharing your photos and video clips
T
he world is awash in pictures, from photos and video clips to cartoon 
images, graphics, and famous paintings. In this chapter, I refer to 
everything you can see as a picture — whether it be a photo, graphic image, 
shot of a computer or iPod touch or iPhone screen, or a recorded video clip 
(a moving picture).
If you like to carry pictures around with you, you’re going to love the iPod or 
iPhone as a player for viewing pictures. And if you like to send and receive 
pictures by e-mail, you’re going to love the fact that you can use your iPod 
touch or iPhone to share them with others. This chapter shows you how.
Syncing with Photo Albums and Folders
After importing photos from cameras into your computer, and importing 
image files from other sources, you can organize them into albums or 
collections. On a Mac, you can use iPhoto (version 4.0.3 or newer) or 
Aperture. On a Windows PC, you can use Adobe Photoshop Album (version 
2.0 or newer) or Adobe Photoshop Elements (version 3.0 or newer).
You can then set up your iPod or iPhone to sync with your entire photo 
library or with specific albums in your library so that any changes you make 
to the library or to those albums are copied to the iPod or iPhone. In addition, 
any pictures you collect from e-mails on your iPod touch or iPhone are 
synced back to the photo library on your computer.

290
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
If you don’t have iPhoto or one of the Adobe products, you can store your 
pictures in their own folder on your hard drive (such as the Pictures folder in 
your home folder on a Mac or the My Pictures folder in your My Documents 
folder in Windows). You can then use iTunes to transfer pictures from this 
folder, treating the folder as a single photo album. If you have subfolders in 
this folder iTunes copies the subfolder assignments as if they were album 
assignments.
 
To find out more about organizing pictures into albums, visit the free tips 
section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com).
Transferring pictures to 
your iPod or iPhone
To copy pictures from your computer to your iPod or iPhone using iTunes, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Connect your iPod or iPhone to your computer and then select its 
name in the Devices section of the iTunes Source pane.
 
 iTunes displays the Summary page (under the Summary tab of the 
synchronization pages) to the right of the Source pane. (See Chapter 9 
for details.)
 
2. Click the Photos tab.
 
 The Photos sync options appear, as shown in Figure 18-1. (On a Mac, 
you’ll see iPhoto selected to sync photos from.)
 
3. Select the Sync Photos From check box and then pick the source of 
your pictures from the pop-up menu: a photo application, the Pictures 
(Mac) or My Pictures (PC) folder, or the Choose Folder option.
 
 Pick your application (such as iPhoto on a Mac or Adobe Photoshop 
Album in Windows) from the pop-up menu to synchronize with its 
library. If you don’t use these applications, pick the Pictures folder on a 
Mac or the My Pictures folder on a PC, or pick Choose Folder to browse 
your hard drive or other storage media and select the folder containing 
pictures. After selecting the folder, click Choose (Mac) or OK (Windows).
 
4. If you chose a photo application that organizes pictures by album, 
collection, events, or faces (such as iPhoto), or if you stored pictures 
in subfolders in your Pictures or My Pictures folder, select one of the 
following options below the Sync Photos From check box:
 
• All Photos Albums, and Faces: Copies all pictures and albums (or col-
lections) from the library or folder selected in Step 3.
 
• Selected Albums, Events, and Faces, and Automatically Include: 
Select this option to be more specific about which albums, events, 

291
 Chapter 18: Your Pocket Picture Player
and/or faces to sync, and to include recent events automatically — 
you can choose how many recent events or events from the last 
month or several months from the pop-up menu, or choose All 
Events or No Events. (In Figure 18-1, I chose The Most Recent 
Event.) After selecting this option, you can then make selections in 
the Albums, Events, and Faces columns.
 
• Events column: If you chose a photo application that organizes 
pictures by events (such as iPhoto), you can select the check box 
next to each name (or date, if no name) of an event to synchronize. 
 
• Albums column: Lets you choose which photo albums from the 
library (or subfolders from the folder) selected in Step 3 you want 
to copy. The idea here is to scroll the list box to see all the albums 
or collections in your library (or subfolders in your folder) and 
then select the check box next to each one you want to copy. (In 
Figure 18-1, you can see that I decided to copy the albums named 
John and Jimi 2 from my iPhoto library.)
 
• Faces column: If you chose a photo application that organizes 
pictures by faces (such as iPhoto), you can select the check box 
next to each face’s name. (In Figure 18-1, you can see that I decided 
to copy all pictures with Jimi Bove’s face and John Bove’s face from 
my iPhoto library.)
 
5. Click the Apply button to apply changes, and click the Sync button if 
synchronization hasn’t already started automatically.
 
 iTunes copies the photo library or albums you selected to your iPod or 
iPhone (and deletes all other pictures from the iPod or iPhone except 
those saved in Saved Images or in Camera Roll)
Syncing saved pictures with iTunes
You can save pictures that you receive via e-mail on your iPod touch or 
iPhone, photos you record with your iPhone, videos you shoot with your 
iPhone 3GS, and videos you shoot with your iPod nano in a special photo 
album — Saved Images (for image captures and e-mailed pictures you save) 
or Camera Roll (for photos and videos you shoot).  (I describe how to save 
pictures from e-mails later in this chapter.)
To synchronize these saved pictures back to your computer, connect your 
iPod touch or iPhone to your computer as you normally would to sync it (as 
described in Step 1 of the previous section).
On a Mac, iPhoto pops up automatically — click the Import All button, or 
select the pictures you want and click the Import Selected button. After 
importing the pictures into the iPhoto library, iPhoto asks whether you want 
to delete the originals from the iPod touch or iPhone. Click Delete Originals 
to delete the pictures from the iPod touch or iPhone (they’re safe in your 

292
Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
photo library now) or click Keep Originals to save them — in case you want 
to e-mail them or upload them to social networks from your iPod touch or 
iPhone.

shown).
 
On a Windows PC, iTunes can be set up to sync with Adobe Photoshop 
Album or Photoshop Elements (as I describe in the previous section) and 
will automatically transfer the pictures (including video clips). If you don’t 
use those applications, follow the instructions that came with your photo 
application to import the pictures, or use the Microsoft Scanner and Camera 
Wizard, to save the pictures to a folder of your choice. 
 
 To import recorded videos to your computer from an iPod nano, the iPod 
nano must be enabled for disk use — select the iPod nano in the Device 
section of the Source pane, click the Summary tab, and select the Enable Disk 
Use option. In addition to appearing in iTunes, your iPod nano from this point 
on also appears on your computer as an external hard drive, with the same 
name you gave it during initial setup. Your recorded videos are stored in 
the DCIM folder on your iPod nano, and you can simply drag them to your 
computer. To clear space on your iPod nano after you’ve copied your 
recorded videos to your computer, delete them from the DCIM folder.

Viewing Pictures and Slideshows
You might remember the old days when you carried fading, wallet-sized 
photo prints, or worse, a deck of slides that required a light box or projector 
to show them to others. You can now dispense with all that because all you 
need is your iPod or iPhone.
Slide shows are an especially entertaining way of showing pictures because 
you can include music as well as transitions between them. You can display 
your slide show on the iPod or iPhone, or on a television by connecting your 
iPod or iPhone to the TV using the Universal Dock, Component AV Cable, or 
Composite AV Cable from Apple (available in the Apple Store).
 
To find out how to connect your iPod or iPhone to televisions, stereos, video 
monitors, and video equipment, visit this book’s companion Web site.
Viewing pictures on an 
iPod touch or iPhone
To view pictures on your iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap Photos on the Home screen.
 
 The Photo Albums screen appears, as shown in Figure 18-2 (left side), 
with a list of photo albums. On an iPod touch, the list includes Saved 
Photos if you’ve saved pictures from e-mail messages. On an iPhone, 
the list includes Camera Roll for saved pictures from e-mails and for 
new photos shot with the iPhone Camera (and video clips shot with the 
iPhone 3GS Camera).
 
2. Tap a photo album’s name (or the arrow to the right of the name), or 
tap Photo Library to see all pictures.
 
 Thumbnail images appear, as shown in Figure 18-2 (right side). The 
Photo Library choice displays thumbnails of all the pictures in your 
iPod touch or iPhone (except the Camera Roll or Saved Images albums). 
Selecting an album displays thumbnails of only the pictures assigned to 
that album.
 
3. Flick your finger to scroll the thumbnails and tap a thumbnail to 
select a picture.
 
 You might have several screens of thumbnails. Flick your finger to scroll 
the thumbnails and tap one to select it and view it.

To view a picture in landscape orientation, rotate the iPod touch or iPhone 
sideways. The picture automatically changes to fit the new orientation and 
expands to fit the screen if the picture itself is in landscape orientation.
To zoom into the picture to see more detail, double-tap the area you want to 
zoom into. Double-tap again to zoom out. You can also zoom into an area by 
unpinching with two fingers, and zoom out by pinching. To pan around a

Viewing pictures on an iPod 
nano or iPod classic
To view pictures (photos and images, but not video clips) on your iPod nano 
or iPod classic, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Photos from the main menu.
 
 The Photos menu appears with All Photos and Settings choices at the 
top, followed by a list of photo albums and/or events in alphabetical 
order.
 
2. Choose All Photos or an album or event name.
 
 The All Photos choice displays thumbnail images of all the pictures in 
your iPod. Selecting an album or event displays thumbnail images of 
only the pictures assigned to that album or event.
 
3. Scroll the click wheel to highlight the thumbnail you want and then 
press the Select button to select the picture.
 
 You might have several screens of thumbnails. Scroll the click wheel to

 Pressing the Menu button returns you to the Photos menu.
Shooting Videos with an iPod nano
So you think those nifty portable video cameras are so cute? Check out the 
current model iPod nano: You can shoot high-quality video with sound, and 
even apply special video effects. You can, of course, watch what you record 
on your iPod nano, and then transfer the video to your computer to edit and 
share.
 
To find out how to shoot photos with an iPhone (and shoot videos with an 
iPhone 3GS), visit the free tips section of my Web site (www.tonybove.com).
Turn your current model iPod nano around, and you’ll find the lens and 
microphone on the back. It points outward so that you use the display as a 
viewfinder to see the video you’re shooting. Be careful not to block the lens 
or microphone with your fingers — hold the iPod nano on its edges when 
recording for best results.
To use iPod nano as a video camera, choose Video Camera from the main 
menu. The screen turns into a viewfinder, and you can shoot video in land-
scape or portrait mode by rotating the iPod nano. When you’re ready to 
begin shooting, press the Select button. Press it again to stop recording. 
While you are recording, a blinking red light appears in the upper right 
corner of the display, next to the recording time.
 
You can apply special effects only before recording — the Pod nano can’t 
add or remove effects after recording, and you can’t change video settings 
while recording. To shoot video with special effects, choose Video Camera 
from the main menu, and then Press and hold the Select button to display the 

299
 Chapter 18: Your Pocket Picture Player
video effects palette. Scroll the click wheel to highlight the effects, and press 
the Select button to select the one that’s highlighted. The viewfinder screen 
appears with the selected effect — which is fun for viewing the world through 
the viewfinder. Press the Select button again to start shooting with the special 
effect, and press it again to stop recording. When you press the Menu button 
to leave the Video Camera screen, the special effect changes back to Normal.
Your recording time depends on the how much space you have in your iPod 
nano, and how long your battery can last. A recorded video can be up to 2GB 
in size. Once a recorded video takes up 2GB of space, recording stops. To 
resume recording, press the Select button.
The iPod nano saves your recorded videos in the Camera Roll. To watch what 
you just recorded, press Menu from the Video Camera viewfinder to show the 
Camera Roll. Select a video by its date and time, and press the Select button 
to play it. Your recorded videos can also be played from the Videos menu — 
choose Videos➪Camera Videos, select a video from the list, and then press 
the Select button to play it.
To delete a recorded video on your iPod nano, choose Videos➪Camera 
Videos and then select a video from the list to delete. Press and hold the 
Select button until a menu appears, scroll the click wheel to highlight Delete 
or Delete All, and then press Select. It’s a good idea to remove any recorded 
videos you don’t want to save, because they take up a lot of space.
To sync your recorded videos with your computer, see “Syncing saved pic-
tures with iTunes” earlier in this chapter.
Sharing Pictures with an 
iPod touch or iPhone
What good is it to collect pictures without sharing them with other people? 
You can share pictures in your iPod touch or iPhone by sending one or more 
in an e-mail, uploading as many as you want to social networks, and sharing 
entire photo albums using MobileMe. With an iPhone 3G or 3GS, you can also 
send pictures using MMS (if supported by your carrier). And with an iPhone 
3GS, you can record video clips and share them the same way, using e-mail or 
MMS. You can also upload video clips to YouTube or your MobileMe gallery.
Sending a picture by e-mail
To send an image in an e-mail, tap Photos on the Home screen, tap a photo 
album or Photo Library, and choose the image for viewing (refer to Figure 18-2). 
Then tap the picture to see the navigation controls (refer to Figure 18-3).

Part IV: Playing it Back on Your iPod or iPhone 
Tap the Options button in the lower-left corner of the screen to see the 
Options menu, as shown in Figure 18-4, and then tap the Email Photo button 
to e-mail a photo or the Email Video button (not shown) to e-mail a video 
clip. If you have MMS support with your iPhone carrier, you also see buttons 
to send the photo or video by MMS.
 
Figure 18-4: 
Choose the 
option to 
e-mail the 
photo.
 
The New Message screen appears in the Mail app for e-mail or in the 
Messages app for MMS messages on an iPhone. The photo or video clip is 
embedded in the message. You can tap in the message field to enter text. 
Then fill in the To and Subject fields, as described in Chapter 20.
 
You can also use the Options menu to assign the photo to a contact in your 
Contacts list (see Chapter 21 for details) or use the image as the iPod touch 
or iPhone wallpaper (see Chapter 4). If you’ve set up a photo gallery on 
MobileMe to share with others, you can include any picture or video clip in 
this published gallery so that others can immediately see it. Choose Send to 
MobileMe in the Options menu, and select the gallery to include the picture or 
video clip.
Selecting and copying multiple pictures
To select more than one picture (photo, image, or video clip) to copy and 
paste into another app or to share by e-mail, tap Photos on the Home screen 
and tap a photo album or Photo Library (refer to Figure 18-2, left side). Then 
tap the Options button in the lower-left corner of the thumbnail images (refer 
to Figure 18-2, right side).

301
 Chapter 18: Your Pocket Picture Player
The Select Photos screen appears, showing the same thumbnails. Tap each 
thumbnail on the Select Photos screen, as shown in Figure 18-5 (left side), to 
select each image. As you tap each thumbnail, a check mark appears in the 
thumbnail to indicate that it is part of the selection.
The Share and Copy buttons appear at the bottom as you make a selection. 
To e-mail the selected pictures, tap the Share button and then tap Email. 
The Mail app launches and starts a new e-mail message that includes all the 
selected images (see Chapter 20 for details on sending e-mails).
To copy the pictures to another app or paste them into an existing message, 
tap the Copy button. You can paste the pictures into any app that accepts 
pasted pictures — such as a saved e-mail draft message in Mail. Touch and 
hold to mark an insertion point in the e-mail message (which brings up the key-
board), and the Select/Select All/Paste bubble appears, as shown in Figure 18-5 
(right side). Tap Paste to paste the images into the message.
 
You can also receive pictures from others by e-mail. (See Chapter 20 for details 
on how to check your e-mail.) A down-arrow button appears within a message 
that contains an attached picture. Tap the down-arrow button to download the 
picture to your iPod touch or iPhone.
After the download completes, tap the picture in the e-mail message, and the 
Save Image and Cancel buttons appear. Tap the Save Image button to save 
the picture in your iPod touch or iPhone photo library (in the Saved Images 
album) or tap Cancel to cancel. If the message has more than one picture 
(such as three), you can tap a button to save them all.

Capturing a screen shot
You too can capture shots of the iPod touch or iPhone screen and display 
them in a book or Web site, just as I have. No matter what application you’re 
running, quickly press and release the Sleep/Wake and physical Home buttons at 
the same time. The iPod touch or iPhone screen flashes (and if your volume 
is up, you can hear a shutter click). This indicates that the screen was saved 
in the Saved Images album on an iPod touch or the Camera Roll album on 
an iPhone — choose the album in Photos to see the picture. You can take as 
many screen shots as you like. The next time you sync your iPod touch or 
iPhone to your computer, your photo application (such as iPhoto) launches 
to receive these new pictures.

Touching the 
Online World

In this part . . .
T
his part takes the concept of playing media to an 
entirely new level by providing access to the world of 
online content. Now you can use your iPod touch or 
iPhone to touch Web sites around the world, download 
songs, check your e-mail, and even monitor your stock 
portfolio.
 
✓ Chapter 19 spins the Web and shows you how to 
surf Web pages with Safari on your iPod touch or 
iPhone. You find out how to search with Google 
or Yahoo! and interact with Web services to do 
everything from checking live news feeds to mak-
ing travel reservations.
 
✓ Chapter 20 shows you how to turn your iPod 
touch or iPhone into a lean, clean e-mail 
machine. You can check e-mails from multiple 
e-mail accounts, send messages, and manage 
your e-mail settings.
 
✓ Chapter 21 puts you in contact with your 
Contacts, helps you manage your Calendar, and 
connects you with the most popular social net-
works on the planet — Facebook, MySpace, and 
Twitter. The weather becomes more predictable, 
your stocks proudly show their charts, and the 
Earth itself reveals its secrets in satellite and 
map views.

Chapter 19
Surfin’ Safari
In This Chapter
▶ Browsing the Web with your iPod touch or iPhone
▶ Navigating, scrolling, and zooming into Web pages
▶ Saving and using Web page bookmarks
▶ Saving Web site icons to your Home screen
T
he World Wide Web makes the world go ’round a whole lot faster than 
ever before. I browse the Web for many different kinds of content and 
services. It’s gotten to the point where I now use the Web to make travel, 
restaurant, and entertainment reservations, and I purchase everything 
online, from music, videos, books, and clothing to electronics equipment, 
garden supplies, groceries, and furniture. I get to track my shipments and 
purchases, review the latest news, check up on the blogs of my friends and 
associates, read novels, view slide shows and movies posted on the Internet, 
and even scan text messages from cell phones — all thanks to the Internet.
I can do all this using the Safari browser on an iPod touch or iPhone with an 
Internet connection, so I rarely need a laptop when I travel. I can also search 
using Google or Yahoo! — both services are built into Safari, and I can always 
browse any other search site. An iPod touch or iPhone can join AirPort and 
other Wi-Fi networks at home, at work, or at Wi-Fi hotspots around the world, 
as I describe in Chapter 4, to connect to the Internet. An iPhone can also use 
the Edge network, and an iPhone 3G or iPhone 3GS can also use a 3G network.
Take a Walk on the Web Side with Safari
Safari on the iPod touch or iPhone not only lets you browse through Web 
sites, but also lets you add bookmarks and icons to your Home screen for 
convenient access. (You can also synchronize those bookmarks with your 
computer’s Web browser, as I describe in Chapter 10.)

306
Part V: Touching the Online World  
Go URL own way
It’s a snap to browse any Web site. Just tap out the site’s address on the 
on-screen keyboard. (For instructions on using the on-screen keyboard, see 
Chapter 3.)
 
The Web site address is known as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and 
usually begins with http://www. followed by the name of the Web site or 
other characters (such as http://www.apple.com or http://www.tony
bove.com/tonytips). However, you can leave off the http://www. part 
and just go with the rest of the characters of the URL (apple.com or tony
bove.com/tonytips).
For the blow-by-blow account, check out the following steps:
 
1. Tap Safari on the Home screen.
 
 The iPod touch or iPhone displays the last Web page you visited or a 
blank page, with the rectangular URL entry field at the upper-left corner 
and an oval search-entry field in the upper-right corner, as shown in 
Figure 19-1, left side. (If you don’t see these two entry fields side by side, 
tap the status bar at the top of the screen to jump to the top of the Web 
page.)
 
2. Tap the URL field.
 
 The on-screen keyboard appears. Above that is an entry field for typing 
the URL.
 
3. If the entry field already has a URL, tap the circled x in the right 
corner of the field to clear its contents.
 
4. Tap out the URL for the Web page using the on-screen keyboard.
 
 Immediately as you start typing the characters of the URL, you see a list 
of suggested Web sites in your bookmarks or history list that match the 
characters you typed so far (as shown in Figure 19-1, right side). You 
can scroll the suggested list by dragging up and down. If the Web site 
you want appears, tap it to go directly to the site without further ado. 
Otherwise, keep typing the URL, including the extension — the keyboard 
includes a .com button, next to the Go button, for your convenience.
 
5. Tap the Go button on the keyboard (or tap Cancel to cancel).
 
 When you tap the Go button, the keyboard closes and the message 
Loading appears in the status bar. Then the Web page loads from the 
Internet, if the page exists. If you mistyped the URL or the page doesn’t 
exist, you get the message Safari can’t open the page because 
it can’t find the server. Tap OK and start again from Step 2.
 
 To cancel entering a URL, tap the Cancel button in the upper-right 
corner of the screen (refer to Figure 19-1, right side).

To stop a Web page from loading if you change your mind, tap the x on the 
right side of the URL entry field. This x turns into a circular arrow after the 
page is loaded. To reload an already-loaded Web page to refresh its contents, 
tap the circular arrow.
Hanging loose with your bookmarks
If you already have bookmarks saved in your iPod touch or iPhone, you can 
go directly to your favorite bookmarked pages. (To add bookmarks to your 
iPod touch or iPhone, you can sync bookmarks from your computer’s Web 
browser, as described in Chapter 10, and you can also save bookmarks of 
pages you visit with your iPod touch or iPhone, as described in the section 
“Bookmarking as You Go,” later in this chapter.)
Follow these steps:
 
1. Tap Safari on the Home screen.
 
 Your iPod touch or iPhone displays the last Web page you visited or a 
blank page. A navigation bar sporting various icons and buttons appears 
along the bottom, as shown in Figure 19-2.
 
2. Tap the Bookmarks icon — the one that looks like an open book — on 
the navigation bar.

308
Part V: Touching the Online World  
 
 The Bookmarks screen appears with the special History folder that 
records your page visits, and other Bookmark-related folders (such as 
Bookmarks Bar and Bookmarks Menu, provided with the Safari application 
on Macs and PCs). You can scroll this list by dragging up and down.
 
3. Tap a folder to view its contents.
 
 For example, tapping Bookmarks Menu opens the folders and bookmarks 
from the Bookmarks Menu section of Safari on your Mac or PC. Tapping 
Bookmarks Bar opens the folders and bookmarks in the Bookmarks Bar 
section. Tapping History opens the history of the Web pages you’ve 
visited.
 
4. Tap a bookmark to load the Web page.
 
 Folders have a folder icon to the left of their names, and actual bookmarks 
have an open-page icon next to their Web page names. Tap a folder to 
reveal its contents, and tap a bookmark to load a Web page.

columns of text) to fill the screen for easy reading. You can also spread with 
two fingers to control the amount of zooming.

 Chapter 19: Surfin’ Safari
Pearl diving with Google or Yahoo!
If you’ve done any Web surfing at all, you already know all there is to know 
about search engines. They’re simply the tool for finding Web sites. The two 
most popular search engines out there — Google and Yahoo! — are built into 
Safari on your iPod touch or iPhone.
 
Google is set up to be your default Web search engine, but you can 
quickly change that. To choose Yahoo! (or to go back to Google), tap 
Settings➪Safari➪Search Engine and tap Yahoo! or Google. Turning on one 
search engine turns off the other one.
Follow these steps to search with Google or Yahoo! from within Safari:
 
1. Tap Safari on the Home screen.
 
 The last Web page you visited or a blank page appears. You can find 
the URL entry field in the upper-left corner and the oval search-entry 
field, with Google or Yahoo! in gray, in the upper-right corner (refer 
to Figure 19-1, left side). (If you don’t see these two entry fields side by 
side, tap the status bar at the top of the screen to jump to the top of the 
Web page.)
 
2. Tap the oval search-entry field.
 
 The keyboard appears. Above that is the search-entry field (with a 
magnifying glass icon).
 
3. Tap inside the search-entry field.
 
4. Tap out the letters of the search term using the keyboard.
 
 Immediately as you start typing characters, you see a list of suggested 
bookmarks in your bookmarks folder or history list. You can scroll this 
list by dragging up and down.
 
5. If a bookmark appears that satisfies your search, tap it to go directly 
to the Web page without further ado. Otherwise, keep typing the 
search term.
 
6. Tap the Google or Yahoo! button at the lower-right corner of the 
keyboard.
 
 Doing so closes the keyboard and displays the search results. (Note: The 
Google or Yahoo! button replaces the Go button on the keyboard when 
searching.)

Part V: Touching the Online World  
Let Your Fingers Do the Surfing
After you’ve found the Web page you want, you can use your fingers to 
navigate its links and play any media it has to offer. You can also bounce 
around from previous to next pages in your browsing session, open multiple 
pages, zoom into pages to see them clearly, and scroll around the page to see 
all its sections while zooming.
Scrolling and zooming
To zoom into a Web page in Safari, spread two fingers apart on the screen 
(unpinch). To zoom back out, bring your fingers together (pinch).
Double-tap the display to zoom into any part of the page. You can also 
double-tap a column to automatically zoom in so that the column fills the 
display. Double-tap again to zoom back out.
To scroll around the page, touch and drag the page. (If you happen to touch 
a link, drag the link so that you don’t follow it.) You can drag up, down, or 
sideways to see the entire Web page, or you can flick your finger up or down 
to quickly scroll the page. Use two fingers to scroll within the frame on a Web 
page or one finger to scroll the entire page.
 
To jump to the top of a Web page, tap the status bar at the top of the screen.
All of these gestures work the same way in either portrait or landscape 
orientation. To view a Web page in landscape orientation, rotate the iPod 
touch or iPhone sideways. Safari automatically reorients and expands the 
page. To set it back to portrait, rotate it again.
It’s all touch and go
To follow a link on a Web page, tap the link. Text links are usually underlined 
(sometimes in blue). Many images are also links that you can tap to navigate 
to another page or use to play media content.
If a link leads to a sound or movie file supported by the iPod touch or 
iPhone, Safari launches the player for the sound or movie; if the link points 
to YouTube, the YouTube app launches to play the video. (See Chapter 16 for 
sounds and Chapter 17 for videos.)

 Chapter 19: Surfin’ Safari
 
You can see the link’s destination — without following it — by touching and 
holding down on the link until the destination address appears (next to your 
finger). You can touch and hold an image to see whether it has a link.
To move to the previous page in your browsing sequence, tap the left-arrow 
button in the left side of the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. 
(Refer to Figure 19-2.) Safari replaces the current page with the previous one. 
If you’ve just started browsing and this is the first page you’ve opened, the 
left-arrow button is grayed out.
To move to the next page, tap the right-arrow button (to the right of the 
left-arrow button) in the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. (Refer 
to Figure 19-2.) Safari replaces the current page with the next one in the 
browsing sequence. This button is grayed out unless you’ve navigated 
backward to some previous page.
 
You can always go back to any of the pages you visited by tapping the 
Bookmarks button on the navigation bar and then tapping History. To clear 
your History list on your iPod touch or iPhone, tap Clear.
Surfing multiple pages
Although you can open Web pages one at a time and switch back and forth 
between them, you can also open several pages and start a new browsing 
sequence with each page, just like opening separate browser windows or 
tabs.
Some links automatically open a new page instead of replacing the current 
one, leaving you with multiple pages open. Safari displays the number of 
open pages inside the Pages icon in the right corner of the navigation bar at 
the bottom of the screen. If there’s no number on the icon, it means only one 
page is open.
To open a separate page, tap the Pages icon on the right side of the navigation 
bar at the bottom of the screen; then tap the New Page button. Safari brushes 
aside the existing page to display a new one. You can then use your bookmarks, 
enter a Web page URL, or search for a Web page. (If you change your mind 
and don’t want to open a new page, tap the Done button to cancel.)
To close a separate page, tap the Pages icon on the right side of the navigation 
bar to display the page thumbnail images and then tap the red circled x in the 
upper-left corner of the Web page thumbnail for the page you want to close. 
The page disappears.

312
Part V: Touching the Online World  
To switch among open pages, tap the Pages icon to display the page 
thumbnail images, as shown in Figure 19-3, and flick left or right to scroll the 
images. When you get to the thumbnail image of the page you want, touch it!
 
Figure 19-3: 
Switch 
among open 
Web pages.
 
Interacting with pages
Many Web pages have pop-up menus for making choices. For example, the 
NextBus Stop Selector site (www.nextmuni.com) offers pop-up menus for 
selecting the state, the transit agency, and the bus line. To make choices for a 
pop-up menu, tap the menu. Safari displays a list of possible choices for that 
pop-up menu (such as a list of bus lines). Choose one by tapping it; you can 
also flick to scroll the list of choices.
After choosing an option, tap the Done button to finish with that pop-up 
menu. You can also tap the Previous or Next button to move to the previous 
or next pop-up menu.
Entering text into a Web site — such as reservation information, passwords, 
credit card numbers, search terms, and so on — is as easy as tapping inside 
the text field. Safari brings up the keyboard for typing the text. You may want 
to rotate the iPod touch or iPhone sideways to view Web pages in landscape 
(horizontal) orientation so that the keyboard is wider and easier to use.
You can move to the next or previous text field by tapping the Next or 
Previous button at the top of the keyboard, or by tapping inside another text 
field. To finish typing with the keyboard, tap the Done button. If you don’t like 
what you typed, use the Backspace key to delete it before tapping Done.

313
 Chapter 19: Surfin’ Safari
After you finish filling out all the required text fields on the page, tap Go on 
the keyboard (or tap Search, which some pages use rather than Go). If the 
Web page is a form, tapping Go automatically submits the form. Some Web 
pages offer a link for submitting the form, which you must tap to finish entering 
information.
Copying text
You may want to copy one or more paragraphs of text from a Web page to 
paste into another app (such as Notes) or into an e-mail message. Although 
you can e-mail a link to a Web page (as I show in the section “Sending a Web 
link by e-mail,” later in this chapter), you may want to copy a section of text 
and then paste the section into the message itself.
To copy a section of text from a Web page, touch and hold somewhere within 
the section (also known as a “long tap”). Safari automatically highlights the 
section with selection handles on either end and displays the Copy bubble. 
(See Figure 19-4.) Tap Copy to copy the selection.
 
Figure 19-4: 
Copy a 
selected 
section of 
text on a 
Web page.
 
If you zoomed into the Web page and the “long tap” selects only a single 
word, try zooming out first (pinching) and then trying the “long tap” (touch 
and hold) again. You can also make a more precise selection by dragging 
one of the handles. A rectangular magnifier appears for dragging the handle 
precisely. When you remove your finger to stop dragging, the Copy bubble 
appears.
For details on pasting the selected text into apps such as Notes or into an 
e-mail message, see Chapter 3.

314
Part V: Touching the Online World  
Bookmarking as You Go
The best way to keep track of Web pages you’ve visited and want to visit 
again is to create bookmarks for the pages. You can then quickly go back to 
that page by selecting the bookmark. The bookmarks in your iPod touch or 
iPhone synchronize with your Safari bookmarks on your Mac, or with your 
Safari or Internet Explorer bookmarks on your PC, as I describe in Chapter 10.
Saving a bookmark
Follow these steps to save a bookmark:
 
1. Browse to the Web page you want.
 
2. Tap the plus (+) sign in the middle of the navigation bar (refer to 
Figure 19-2).
 
 The special options menu appears with the Add Bookmark, Add to Home 
Screen, Mail Link to This Page, and Cancel buttons.
 
3. Tap the Add Bookmark button to add a bookmark.
 
 The name of the Web site appears in the title field, ready for editing, 
along with the on-screen keyboard. Below that is the actual URL for the 
Web page, and below that, the Bookmarks folder.
 
4. (Optional) Edit the bookmark’s title.
 
 Before saving a bookmark, you can edit its title with the on-screen 
keyboard. Tap the circled x on the right side of the title field to clear its 
contents, or use the Backspace key on the keyboard to erase backward 
from the end of the title, and type the new title.
 
5. (Optional) Choose a bookmark folder.
 
 Before saving a bookmark, you can choose a bookmark folder for saving 
it; otherwise, Safari saves the bookmark in the topmost level of bookmarks. 
Tap Bookmarks to see the list of bookmark folders — you can flick to 
scroll the list quickly or drag it slowly. Select a bookmark folder by 
touching it.
 
6. Tap the Save button to save the bookmark or tap Cancel to cancel.
 
 The Save button appears in the upper-right corner of the display, and 
the Cancel button appears in the upper-left corner.
You can also edit your bookmarks and bookmark folders. Tap the Bookmarks 
button on the navigation bar and choose the folder to edit or the folder that 
has the bookmark you want to edit. Then tap the Edit button in the lower-left 
corner of the screen. The Edit Bookmarks display appears, with circled minus 
(–) signs next to the bookmark folders.

315
 Chapter 19: Surfin’ Safari
You can then do any of the following:
 
✓ To make a new folder within the selected folder, tap New Folder. If you 
want to create a new folder at the topmost level, first tap the Bookmarks 
button in the upper-left corner to go back to the topmost Bookmarks 
list, tap the Edit button, and then tap New Folder.
 
✓ To delete a bookmark or folder, tap next to the bookmark or folder and 
then tap Delete.
 
✓ To reposition a bookmark or folder, drag next to the item you want to move.
 
✓ To edit the name of a bookmark or folder, tap the bookmark or folder 
and use the on-screen keyboard to type the new title. (Tap the circled x 
in the title field to clear its contents first, if you want.)
 
✓ To change where a bookmark or folder is stored, tap the Bookmark 
Folder field for the selected bookmark or folder and then tap a new 
folder to hold the folder chosen for editing.
Tap the Done button in the lower-left corner of the Edit Bookmarks display to 
finish editing.
Sending a Web link by e-mail
As I describe in Chapter 20, your iPod touch or iPhone can send e-mail as 
well as receive it, as long as it’s connected to the Internet. And if you want to 
share a Web page you just found with your friend, the steps are simple:
 
1. Browse to the Web page and then tap the plus (+) sign in the middle of 
the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. (Refer to Figure 19-2.)
 
 A special options menu magically pops up from the bottom with the Add 
Bookmark, Add to Home Screen, and Mail Link to This Page buttons, 
along with a Cancel button.
 
2. Tap the Mail Link to This Page button.
 
 Keep in mind that you must have already set up an e-mail account on 
your iPod touch or iPhone, as I describe in Chapter 10.
 
 An e-mail message appears, ready for you to finish composing. The 
Subject field is already filled in with the Web page name, and the link 
itself is already inserted in the body of the message. The To and Cc fields 
are left blank — ready for you to fill in.
 
3. Tap the circled plus (+) sign on the right side of the To field to select a 
name from your Contacts list, or use the on-screen keyboard to enter 
the e-mail address.
 
 See Chapter 20 for details on sending an e-mail.
 
4. Tap Send at the upper-right corner of the display to send the message.

316
Part V: Touching the Online World  
Bringing It All Back Home
You can add Web thumbnail icons for your favorite Web pages to the Home 
screen so that you can access the page with one touch. Web icons appear on 
the Home screen along with the icons of other apps. (Discover how to rearrange 
the icons and add multiple screens to the Home screen in Chapter 3.)
Follow these steps to add a Web site to your Home screen:
 
1. Browse to the Web page you want.
 
2. Tap the plus (+) sign in the middle of the navigation bar.
 
 The special options menu appears, with Add Bookmark, Add to Home 
Screen, Mail Link to This Page, and Cancel buttons.
 
3. Tap the Add to Home Screen button.
 
 The name of the Web site appears in the title field, ready for editing, 
along with the keyboard. The icon to be added to the Home screen — a 
thumbnail image of the site or a graphic image defined by the site for 
this purpose (usually a logo) — appears to the left of the title field.
 
4. (Optional) Edit the Web icon’s title.
 
 Before saving a Web icon to the Home screen, you can edit its title with 
the keyboard. Tap the circled x on the right side of the title field to clear 
its contents, or use the Backspace key on the keyboard to erase backward 
from the end of the title and then type the new title.
 
5. Tap the Add button to add the Web site icon, or tap Cancel to cancel.
 
 The Add button appears in the upper-right corner of the display, and the 
Cancel button appears in the upper-left corner.

Chapter 20
The Postman Always Beeps Once
In This Chapter
▶ Checking and sending e-mail with an iPod touch or iPhone
▶ Changing message settings and sending options
▶ Setting the Push and Fetch features for optimal e-mail retrieval
Your e-mail is just a touch away. The Mail app on your iPod touch or 
iPhone can display richly formatted messages, and you can send as 
well as receive photos and graphics, which are displayed in your message 
along with the text. You can even receive Portable Document Format (PDF) 
files, Microsoft Word documents, and Microsoft Excel spreadsheets as attach-
ments and view them on your iPod touch or iPhone.
The Mail app can work in the background to retrieve your e-mail when your 
iPod touch is connected to Wi-Fi or your iPhone is connected to Wi-Fi or 3G. 
If you signed up for Apple’s MobileMe service (formerly the .Mac service, 
now www.me.com), as I describe in illustrious detail in Chapter 10, your 
iPod touch or iPhone receives e-mail the instant it arrives in the mailbox on 
the MobileMe service. Services such as MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange, and 
Yahoo! Mail push e-mail messages to your iPod touch or iPhone so that they 
arrive immediately, automatically. You get a single beep when your mail has 
arrived (unless you turned off the New Mail sound effect, as I describe in 
Chapter 4).
Other types of e-mail services let you fetch e-mail from the server — when 
you select the account in Mail on your iPod touch or iPhone, Mail automati-
cally starts fetching the e-mail, and you can browse your e-mail accounts or 
even use other apps while Mail fetches messages. You can also tell Mail to 
fetch more messages by tapping the Fetch (circular arrow) icon in the lower-
left corner of the Mail, Mailboxes, or message screens.

Part V: Touching the Online World  
Checking E-Mail
 
 You know that you have unread e-mail if the Mail icon on the Home screen 
shows a number — this is the number of unread messages in your inboxes. 
As e-mail is pushed (or fetched), this number increases until you read the 
messages. Tap the Mail icon to start the Mail app.
If you’ve set up an e-mail account, a list of mailboxes appears for that 
account, as shown in Figure 20-1 (left side). If you’ve set up more than one 
e-mail account, Mail displays the Accounts screen, listing the e-mail accounts 
you synchronized with your iPod touch or iPhone (see Figure 20-1, middle). 
Tap an account on the Accounts screen to view the mailboxes for that 
account (see Figure 20-1, right side). (See Chapter 10 for details on synchro-
nizing, setting up, deleting, and changing settings for e-mail accounts.)

Next, tap Inbox in the list of mailboxes. A list of incoming message headers 
appears, as shown in Figure 20-2, with the sender’s name, subject, and the 
first sentence or two of each message, along with a blue dot if the message 
hasn’t been read yet.
The message is the medium
Tap a message header to read the message. You can scroll the message by 
flicking or dragging your finger, and zoom into and out of the message by 
unpinching and pinching with your fingers. You can also zoom directly into 
a column in the message by double-tapping the message, and zoom out by 
double-tapping it again.

If the e-mail includes an attachment, a button appears within the message 
showing the icon of an attached file and a right arrow, as shown in Figure 20-3 
(left side) — to view the attachment, just tap the right arrow. If the format 
of the attached file is one of the supported formats (which include files that 
have the extensions .doc, .docx, .htm, .html, .pdf, .txt, .xls, and 
.xlsx), Mail downloads and opens the attachment as shown in Figure 20-3 
(right side). If not, Mail displays a document icon with the name of the file — 
but you can’t open it.
You can see all the recipients of a message (except Bcc, or blind carbon copy, 
recipients) by opening the message and tapping the blue word Details in the 
upper-right corner of the message. Tap a name or e-mail address that appears 
to see the recipient’s contact information. Tap Hide to hide the recipients.
 
You can add the sender or recipient to your Contacts list on your iPod touch 
or iPhone by tapping the name or e-mail address. A screen appears with the 
Email, Create New Contact, and Add to Existing Contact buttons. Tap Create 
New Contact to create a new contact (or tap Add to Existing Contact if you 
want to add the information to an existing contact). Tap the Email button to 
send an e-mail to that recipient’s address. (See the “Sending E-Mail” section, 
later in this chapter.)
Links appear in a message underlined in blue, and pictures embedded in the 
message may also have links. Tapping a link can take you to a Web page in 
Safari, open a map in Maps, or open a new preaddressed e-mail message in 
Mail. To return to your e-mail, press the physical Home button and tap Mail 
on the Home screen.

Deleting a message
To delete an open message, tap the Trash icon at the bottom center of the 
message display. Mail deletes the message from your iPod touch or iPhone 
(but not from your computer or mail server unless it’s set up that way — see 
Chapter 10 for details on setting up e-mail accounts) and then displays the 
next message in sequence. You can also move to the previous or next mes-
sage by tapping the up and down arrows in the upper-right corner.
 
You can also delete a message without opening it. In the list of message head-
ers, drag your finger across a message header and tap the Delete button that 
appears.

To delete a list of messages quickly, choose the mailbox (such as Inbox) and 
tap the Edit button in the upper-right corner of the screen. The messages 
appear with empty circles next to them. Tap each message so that a check 
mark appears in the empty circle. After checking off the messages to delete, 
tap the Delete button in the lower-left corner.
Sending E-Mail
You can use the Mail app to reply to any message instantly and send e-mail to 
any e-mail address in the world. You can even send a message to a group of 
people without having to select each person’s e-mail address.
To send an e-mail, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap Mail on the Home screen.
 
 The Accounts screen appears if you’ve set up more than one e-mail 
account, and you should look at Step 2; otherwise, the mailboxes appear 
for your account, and you can skip to Step 3.
 
2. (Optional) Choose an e-mail account from the Accounts screen for 
sending the e-mail.
 
 You can skip this step if you have only one e-mail account. If you have 
several e-mail accounts on your iPod touch or iPhone, you can select 
one of them or you can use the default account for sending e-mail. (See 
the next section in this chapter to set the default account.) You can also 
defer this decision until Step 6.
 
3. Tap the pencil-document icon in the lower-right corner of the Mail 
screen.
 
 The New Message screen appears, as shown in Figure 20-4, along with 
the keyboard. If you have multiple accounts set up on your iPod touch 
or iPhone, the default account for sending e-mail appears in the From 
field, as shown in Figure 20-4.
 
4. Enter the recipient’s e-mail address in the To field.
 
 If your recipient is listed in your Contacts, tap the circled plus (+) sign in 
the To field (see Figure 20-4) and choose a contact to add the contact’s 
e-mail address to the To field. You can repeat this process to add mul-
tiple e-mail addresses to the To field from your contacts.
 
 If your recipient isn’t listed in your Contacts or if you don’t know whether 
the recipient is listed, tap the To field entry and use the keyboard to 
type one or more e-mail addresses (and use a comma to separate each 
address). As you type an e-mail address, addresses that match from your 
Contacts list appear below. Tap one to add it to the To field.

5. (Optional) Add more addresses to the Cc or Bcc field.
 
 You can add e-mail addresses to the Cc (carbon copy) and Bcc (blind 
carbon copy) fields to copy others. Whereas Cc addresses appear on 
messages received by recipients, indicating that they were copied on the 
message, Bcc addresses don’t appear on messages received by recipi-
ents — they’re like stealth readers. Tap the Cc/Bcc letters to expand the 
message to include the Cc and Bcc fields; then enter addresses the same 
way you do in Step 4.
 
6. (Optional) Change the From address.
 
 You can change the e-mail address for the sender to one of your e-mail 
accounts. The default e-mail account for sending e-mail is already 
selected; tap the From field (refer to Figure 20-4) to display a pop-up 
menu of e-mail accounts and then tap an e-mail account to use as the 
sender’s account.
 
7. Enter the e-mail subject.
 
 Tap the Subject entry field (refer to Figure 20-4) to type a subject with 
the keyboard; then tap underneath the Subject field to type a message. 
Press Return on the keyboard when you’re finished.
 
8. Tap Send in the upper-right corner of the display (refer to Figure 20-4) 
to send the message.

323
 Chapter 20: The Postman Always Beeps Once
You can also forward and reply to any message you receive. Open the mes-
sage and tap the curled left-arrow button that appears in the lower-left side 
of the message display. Then tap Reply to reply to the sender of the message, 
Reply All to reply to all the recipients as well as the sender (but not the Bcc 
recipients), or Forward to forward the message to someone else (or Cancel 
to go back to the message). The New Message screen appears with the key-
board so that you can type your reply or add a message to the one you’re 
forwarding. Tap Send to send the reply or forwarded message.
 
When you reply to a message, files or images attached to the initial message 
aren’t sent with the reply. When you tap Forward to forward a message, a 
pop-up menu with the Include and Don’t Include buttons appears for a mes-
sage with an attachment. Tap Include to include the attachment in the for-
warded message, or tap Don’t Include to forward the message without the 
attachment.
To save a message as a draft so that you can work on it later, start typing 
the message as described in the preceding steps, but before tapping Send, 
tap Cancel in the upper-left corner of the display (refer to Figure 20-4). Then, 
from the menu that appears, tap Save to save the message in your Drafts 
mailbox or tap Don’t Save to discard the message (or Cancel to go back to 
typing the message). You can find the saved message in the Drafts mailbox of 
the same e-mail account. Tap the message to add to it or change it and then 
send it.
 
To send one or more photos in a message, tap Photos on the Home screen and 
select them as described in Chapter 18.
Message Settings and Sending Options
To change your e-mail message settings and sending options, choose 
Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the Home screen. In the Mail, 
Contacts, Calendars settings screen that appears, use your finger to scroll 
down to the Mail section to change your e-mail message settings and sending 
options, as shown in Figure 20-5.
In the Mail section, you can change global settings for messages in all 
accounts. To set the number of messages you can see at once in a mailbox, 
tap Show and then choose a setting. You can choose to see the most recent 
25, 50, 75, 100, or 200 messages. (To download additional messages when 
you’re in Mail, scroll to the bottom of your Inbox and tap Download More.)

If you think you have shaky fingers and might delete a message by mistake, 
you can set Mail to confirm that you want to delete a message first before 
deleting. Tap the Off button to turn on the Ask before Deleting option. (Tap it 
again to turn it off.) If Ask before Deleting is on, Mail warns you first when you 
delete a message, and you have to tap Delete to confirm the deletion.
What you see is what you got
You can also set how many lines of each message are previewed in the mes-
sage list headers. Choose Preview (refer to Figure 20-5) and then choose to 
see any amount from zero to five lines of each message. To set a minimum 
font size for messages, tap Minimum Font Size and then choose Small, 
Medium, Large, Extra Large, or Giant.
If you want to see all the images in your e-mails and don’t mind waiting for 
the images to download, turn on the Load Remote Images option. If you leave 
it off, your messages appear faster but you have to touch each image icon to 
download and see each image.
If you care about whether a message was sent directly to you or whether you 
were sent it as a Cc copy (which still might make it important, but at least 
you know), you can set whether Mail shows the To and Cc labels in message 
lists. Tap the Off button for the Show To/Cc Label option to turn it on. (Tap it 
again to turn it off.) If the Show To/Cc Label option is on, you see To or Cc in 
the list next to each message.

Return to sender, address unknown
For those who are obsessive about making sure that e-mails are sent — and 
you know who you are — Mail can send you a copy of every message you 
send. Tap the Off button to turn on the Always Bcc Myself option. (Tap it 
again to turn it off.) The Bcc refers to blind carbon copy, and it means that 
your message is sent and copied back to you without your e-mail address 
appearing in the recipient’s list.
You can add a signature to your messages that can include any text — not 
your real, handwritten scrawl but rather a listing of your name, title, phone 
number, favorite quote, or all of these — to personalize your e-mails. Tap 
Signature (refer to Figure 20-5) and then type a signature with the on-screen 
keyboard. The signature remains in effect for all future e-mails sent from your 
iPod touch or iPhone.
To set the default e-mail account for sending messages, tap Default Account 
(refer to Figure 20-5) and then choose an e-mail account. Your iPod touch 
or iPhone will use this account whenever you start the process of sending a 
message from another application, such as sending a photo from Photos or 
tapping the e-mail address of a business in Maps.
For details on synchronizing e-mail accounts automatically from iTunes or 
MobileMe, as well as for setting up an account, changing account settings, and 
deleting accounts manually on your iPod touch or iPhone, see Chapter 10.
If Not Push, Then Fetch
The Push and Fetch options control how your iPod touch or iPhone receives 
e-mail. You can set these options for all accounts and specifically for each 
account.
MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange, and Yahoo! Mail e-mail accounts can push 
messages to your iPod touch or iPhone so that they arrive immediately after 
arriving at the account’s e-mail server. With other types of accounts, the Mail 
app fetches messages from the account’s e-mail server — either on a time 
schedule or manually. (If manually, you select the account before the Mail 
app retrieves the e-mail.) Push accounts (such as MobileMe e-mail) can be 
set to either push or fetch.
You can turn the Push feature on or off as you please. Keeping it on uses 
more battery power because the iPod touch or iPhone receives messages 
immediately when it’s connected to the Internet. When you turn the Push 
feature off, Mail fetches the e-mail from the accounts instead, and you can set 
the timetable for fetching, or set fetching to manual.

For optimal battery life, turn Push off and set Fetch to Manually so that Mail 
fetches only when you tap the e-mail account to read or send e-mail. Pushing 
e-mail as it arrives, or fetching e-mail often, uses up a considerable amount of 
battery power; doing both drains the battery even more quickly.
To turn Push on or off, choose Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the 
Home screen and tap Fetch New Data. The Fetch New Data screen appears. 
Tap the On button for Push to turn it off (and vice versa).
If you like, set a timetable for fetching e-mail automatically so that you don’t 
have to think about it. Choose a time interval on the Fetch New Data screen — 
pick Every 15 Minutes, Every 30 Minutes, or Hourly. You can also pick Manually 
so that Mail fetches only when you tap the e-mail account to read or send 
e-mail.
You can also set Push or Fetch settings for individual accounts. Scroll the 
Fetch New Data screen to the bottom and touch Advanced. The Advanced 
screen appears. Each account in the list shows Push or Fetch, depending on 
whether the account offers push e-mail. Tap the account to change its settings 
separately.
 
Setting Push to Off or setting Fetch to Manually on the Fetch New Data screen 
overrides the individual account settings.

A
s John Lennon once sang, “Life is what happens to you when you’re 
busy making other plans.” And while life happens to you in real time, 
you can consult your iPod or iPhone calendar to view your appointments, 
look up friends in your list of contacts, and record voice memos on what to 
do next. On an iPod touch or iPhone, you can change appointments in the 
calendar and contact your contacts, as I describe in this chapter.
The iPod classic and iPod nano are supplied with “extras” (in the Extras 
menu) such as Calendars, Contacts, and Voice Memos, as well as “click 
wheel” Games, and you can find more in the iTunes Store that you can down-
load. The iPod touch and iPhone, on the other hand, can run many thousands 
of apps available in the App Store. (See Chapter 7 for details on downloading 
from the iTunes Store and App Store.) This chapter shows you how to use the 
Calendars, Contacts, and Voice Memos extras on an iPod classic or nano, as 
well as how to use the Calendar and Contacts apps supplied with your iPod 
touch or iPhone.
Your iPod touch or iPhone can also find almost anything on Earth, even itself, 
and show the location on a map or satellite picture. And although you can’t 
harness the forces of nature, or even the influences that drive Wall Street, you 
can use your iPod touch or iPhone to make better guesses about the weather 
and the stock market — find out how in this chapter.

Part V: Touching the Online World  
To socialize and stay in contact with friends, relatives, and associates, you 
can use social networks such as Facebook and MySpace to share photos, 
thoughts, links, and profile information. The App Store offers social networking 
apps that link you directly to these networks and to messaging sites such as 
Twitter. You’ll find all this and more in this chapter on your social life with 
iPod touch.
 
To find out how to sync your iPod classic or nano with “click wheel” Games 
from the iTunes Store, and to play those games, visit this book’s companion 
Web site.
Checking Your Calendar
The calendar in your iPod or iPhone isn’t just for looking up dates (though 
it’s quite good at that). If you see a blank calendar, it means that you need to 
synchronize your iPod or iPhone with your calendar files from iCal (Mac) or 
Outlook (Windows), or from MobileMe, as I describe in Chapter 10.
On an iPod touch or iPhone, tap Calendar on the Home screen. Here’s what 
happens:
 
✓ If this is your first visit to the Calendar app and you’ve synchronized 
multiple calendars to your iPod touch or iPhone, a list of your calendars 
appears (see Figure 21-1, left side). Tap All at the top to view all calendars 
merged into one or tap a specific calendar to see only that calendar. The 
calendar appears in a monthly view by default (see Figure 21-1, right side).
 
✓ If you opened Calendar before, the app shows the calendar and view 
opened previously.
Tap any day to see the events on that day, which are displayed below the 
calendar view in a list.
Tap the List, Day, or Month button to change the calendar view to a list of 
events, a full day of scheduled appointments, or a month view, respectively. 
If you roam around from day to day or month to month, tap the Today button 
in the lower-left corner of the display to see the calendar for today.
On an iPod nano or iPod classic, choose Extras➪Calendars. If you’ve synchronized 
multiple calendars, a list of calendars appears with All Calendars at the top. 
Press the Select button to select All Calendars for a merged view of all your 
calendars, or scroll the click wheel and press the Select button to select a 
specific calendar. You can then scroll the click wheel to go through the days 
of the calendar. Select an event to see its details. Press the Next and Previous 
buttons to skip to the next or previous month. To see your To-Do list, choose 
Extras➪Calendars➪To Do’s.

A change is gonna come 
(iPod touch or iPhone)
Change happens, and you’ll want to change your schedule or even add new 
events as you learn about them. Although you can enter appointments and 
events on your computer and sync them with your iPod touch or iPhone, as 
I point out in Chapter 10, you can also enter and change appointments and 
events directly in your iPod touch or iPhone and keep changes and additions 
synced with your computer.
To add an event, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Calendar app as described earlier.
 
 The Calendar app opens. Either the Calendar screen appears (refer to 
Figure 21-1, right side), or if you have multiple calendars, the list of 
calendars appears (refer to Figure 21-1, left side) — in which case you 
need to tap a calendar to see the Calendar screen.
 
2. Tap the plus (+) sign in the upper-right corner of the Calendar screen.
 
 The Add Event screen appears, as shown in Figure 21-2 (left side).

Yesterday’s settings (and today’s)
If the calendar events you synced from your computer include alarms, you 
can turn on your iPod classic or iPod nano calendar alarm so that it beeps 
for those events. Choose Extras➪Calendars➪Alarms. Select Alarms once to 
set the alarm to Beep, select Alarms twice to set it to None (so that only the 
message for the alarm appears), or select it a third time to set it to Off. (The 
Alarms choices cycle from Beep to None to Off and then back to Beep.) For 
details on setting alarms, see Chapter 4.
On an iPod touch or iPhone, you can set alerts for meeting invitations and 
choose how many weeks of events to sync back to (to clear out old events). 
Choose Settings➪Mail, Contacts, Calendars from the Home screen and then 
scroll the Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings screen to the Calendars section, 
as shown in Figure 21-4 (left side).

 Chapter 21: Using Applications on Your iPod or iPhone
If you have a Microsoft Exchange account set up with Calendars enabled, you 
can receive and respond to meeting invitations from others in your organization 
that also use Exchange. To set a sound as an alert for receiving a meeting 
invitation, tap the Off button for New Invitation Alerts to turn it on.
You can also turn time zone support on or off. When time zone support is 
on, event dates and times are displayed in the time zone of the city you 
selected. When time zone support is off, events are displayed in the time 
zone of your current location as determined by the network time. You might 
want to turn it on and select your home city so that dates and times are 
displayed as if you were in your home city, rather than where you actually 
are. For example, if you live in San Francisco and you’re visiting New York, 
turning on time zone support and selecting San Francisco keeps the dates 
and times in your calendars on San Francisco time. Otherwise, they would 
switch to New York time.
To turn on time zone support, tap Time Zone Support, and on the Time Zone 
Support screen (refer to Figure 21-4, right side), tap Off to turn on time zone 
support (or tap On to turn it off). Then tap Time Zone and enter the name 
of a major city. As you type, city names are suggested based on what you’ve 
typed. Select the city to return to the Time Zone Support screen and then tap 
the Mail button in the upper-left corner to return to the settings screen — or, 
if you’re finished making changes, press the physical Home button to leave 
settings altogether and return to the Home screen.
 
You can set your iPod touch or iPhone to play a beeping sound for your 
calendar alert. Choose Settings➪General➪Sounds and tap the Off button for 
Calendar Alerts to turn it on. (Tap it again to turn it off.)
Using Your Contacts
The bits of information that you’re most likely to need on the road are people’s 
names, addresses, and phone numbers. An iPod or iPhone can store that 
stuff (in the Contacts format) right alongside your music. To see how to sync 
your personal contacts info on your computer with the info on your iPod or 
iPhone, check out Chapter 10.
To view contacts on an iPod touch or iPhone, tap the Contacts icon on the 
Home screen. The All Contacts screen appears. If you’ve organized contacts 
into groups, you can tap the Groups button in the upper-left corner of the 
screen to show the Groups screen, and then tap a group to see just that 
group, or tap All Contacts to return to the All Contacts screen.

334

The contact list is sorted automatically in alphabetical order by last name 
(in bold) but displayed so that the first name comes first, as shown in Figure 
21-5 (left side). Scroll the list of contacts with your finger or tap a letter of 
the alphabet along the right side to go directly to names that begin with that 
letter. Then tap a contact to see that person’s info screen.

that contact. Tap a Web site address to load that page into Safari. Tap a 
physical address (with a street address) to bring up the Maps app and locate 
the contact on the map.
To view a contact on an iPod classic or iPod nano, choose Extras➪Contacts 
from the main menu. If you’ve organized contacts into groups, a list of groups 
appears, with All Contacts at the top. Press the Select button to select All 
Contacts, or scroll the click wheel and press the Select button to select a 
group. You can then scroll the list of contacts and select a contact. The 
contact list is sorted automatically in alphabetical order by first name and 
then last name, or by last name followed by first name.
Orders to sort and display
You can change which way the contacts sort so that you can look up people 
by their first names (which can be time-consuming with so many friends 
named Elvis).

Earth, Wind, and Finance on 
Your iPod touch or iPhone
You can use the Maps app to find any location on Earth and obtain driving 
directions — without having to ask someone out on the street. Your iPod 
touch or iPhone offers Location Services to nail down the unit’s physical 
location, and it offers that information to the Maps app and any other app 
that needs it, so you can instantly find out where you are in the world.
Your iPod touch or iPhone also runs apps that can connect to the Internet — 
such as the Weather and Stocks apps to display the most recent information. 
You can personalize the Stocks app to reflect your exact portfolio, and you 
can add cities to the Weather app to check conditions before you travel to 
them.
Consulting Maps
The Maps app provides street maps, satellite photos, and hybrid street-
satellite views of locations all over the world. It also offers detailed driving 
directions from any location to just about any other location — unless you 
can’t get there from here.
Tap Maps on the Home screen and a map appears, as shown in Figure 21-7 
(left side), ready for zooming, scrolling, or searching specific locations. To 
find out where you are, tap the Compass icon in the lower-left corner of the 
map screen. A dialog appears, asking whether Maps can use your current 
location; tap OK to use it. The map then changes to show your general location 
with a compass-like circle representing your approximate physical location, 
as shown in Figure 21-7 (right side). This circle continues to shrink as Maps 
retrieves more-accurate information.
You can zoom in to the map by double-tapping the map with one finger or 
unpinching with your fingers. To zoom out, pinch with your fingers or double-
tap with two fingers. You can also drag the map to pan around it and see 
more areas.
To find a location and see a map, tap the search-entry field at the top of the 
Maps screen (refer to Figure 21-7, left side). The keyboard appears so that 
you can enter information. You can find any location by its address or closest 
landmark, or you can find the physical address of a friend: Type the name of 
someone in your contacts list or an address, an intersection, the name of a 
landmark or of a general area, or a zip code.

letters you type match any names with street addresses in your Contacts list, 
Maps offers them up as suggestions. Tap a suggested name to look up that 
person’s home or business address.
To search for a landmark, an intersection, a zip code, or a type of business, 
type as much as you know into the Search field — such as 94111 pizza for 
a pizza shop in the 94111 zip code. If the landmark is well known, type its 
name, as shown in Figure 21-8 (left side). Then tap the Search key on the 
keyboard. A red pin appears to mark the location you’ve searched for on the 
map (see Figure 21-8, right side), with a label showing the address.
 
To clear the entry from the Search field quickly, tap the x on the right side of 
the field. You can then type a new search term.

If you search for the name of a business or type of business after searching for 
your own location, Maps is smart enough to locate the closest ones. Multiple 
pins appear on the map, showing the location of each business.
To bookmark a location after searching for it, tap the circled right arrow on 
the right side of the pin’s label (refer to Figure 21-8, right side) to open the 
Info screen, as shown in Figure 21-9 (left side). You can then mark the spot 
with a bookmark that includes a name and description or do other things 
such as get directions. Tap the Add to Bookmarks button on the Info screen, 
which brings up the keyboard so that you can type a name for the location, 
as shown in Figure 21-9 (right side). Tap Save in the upper-right corner of 
the Add Bookmark screen to save the bookmark (or Cancel to cancel the 
bookmark). Tap Map in the upper-left corner of the Info screen to go back to

curled-page icon in the lower-right corner (refer to Figure 21-7, left side) — to 
see a menu underneath the map. Then tap Satellite to view a satellite image 
of the site. You can zoom in to the image the same way you zoom in to the 
map. You can also view a hybrid of satellite image and street map — tap the 
Underneath button and then tap Hybrid in the menu underneath the map.
To get driving directions from one location to another, you first need to 
search for or pinpoint a location and then tap Directions at the bottom of the 
map screen (refer to Figure 21-8, right side).
For example, if you want to get directions from your current location to a 
bookmarked location, first find your physical location on the map by tapping the 
compass icon in the lower-left corner of the map screen (refer to Figure 21-7, 
right side). Then tap Directions, and in the Directions screen that appears, 
your current location already occupies the Start field. Tap the Bookmarks 
icon in the End field and select a bookmarked location for the End field, as 
shown in Figure 21-10 (left side).
 
You can tap a pin on a map to see the Info screen for that location, and 
then tap Directions to Here or Directions from Here to get directions. The 
Directions screen appears, with the first location selected as either the Start 
or End. You can also type entries for both the Start and End fields by tapping 
those fields and using the keyboard.

 Chapter 21: Using Applications on Your iPod or iPhone
After setting your Start and End locations, tap Route in the lower-right corner 
of the keyboard (refer to Figure 21-10, left side) to mark the route on the map. 
Alternatively, you can tap Clear in the upper-left corner to reenter your Start 
and End fields, or Cancel in the upper-right corner to cancel getting directions.
 
You can switch the entry for Start to End (or vice versa) by tapping the looped 
arrow button to the left of the Start and End fields. Using this button, you can 
get directions one way; then tap the button to reverse the Start and End fields 
to get directions for the way back.
As shown in Figure 21-10 (right side), the route on the map in the Overview 
screen is purple, with pins marking the start and end locations. Touch the 
car icon at the top of the Overview screen to see driving directions and 
the approximate driving time. If traffic data is available, the driving time is 
adjusted accordingly, but don’t expect miracles — the information depends 
on data collected and services provided by third parties, not by Apple, and 
traffic patterns change. You can also touch the bus icon to see public transit 
directions, or the walking-man icon to see walking directions.
To view directions one step at a time on the map, tap Start in the upper-right 
corner of the Overview screen (refer to Figure 21-10, right side) to see the 
first leg of the journey. Then tap the right-arrow button in the upper-right 
corner of the first leg’s screen to see the next stretch. You can also tap the 
left-arrow button in any of the step-by-step directions to go back a step. The 
Maps app patiently walks you through your entire journey.

Riding the storms with Weather
The Weather app provided with your iPod touch or iPhone looks up the 
current temperature and weather conditions, and it provides a six-day 
forecast for any city of your choice. Weather isn’t the only app that does 
this — you can try other apps such as The Weather Channel, WeatherBug, 
or AccuWeather (all free).
To use Weather, tap Weather on the Home screen. In daytime, the weather 
screen is light blue, and at night, it’s dark purple. What makes Weather useful 
is your ability to add your own cities — as many as you need — so that you 
can look up the weather in multiple locations instantly.
To add a city, follow these steps:
 
1. Tap the i button in the lower-right corner of the weather display for 
your city, as shown in Figure 21-11 (left side).
 
2. Tap the plus (+) sign in the upper-left corner of the Weather screen 
(Figure 21-11, center).
 
 A location field appears with the on-screen keyboard (Figure 21-11, 
right side).
 
3. Enter the city’s name or zip code — as you type, suggestions appear 
below in a list.
 
4. Choose one of the suggestions or continue typing the city name or zip 
code and then tap Search.
The city you chose appears in the list of cities on the Weather screen, with a 
circled minus (–) sign next to it on the left and three horizontal gray bars on 
the right.
 
At this point, you can add more cities by tapping the plus (+) sign in the 
upper-left corner again. You can also reorder the list of cities by dragging the 
three gray bars next to a city to a new place in the list.
To delete a city, tap the circled minus sign next to the city name (refer to 
Figure 21-11, center) to show the Delete button. Then tap the Delete button to 
delete it (or tap the circled minus sign again to leave it alone).

Tapping your money maker with Stocks
You can check your financial stocks, funds, and indexes with your iPod touch 
or iPhone as long as it’s connected to the Internet. (Whether the news is good 
or bad, you can quickly e-mail your broker — see Chapter 20.)
Tap Stocks on the Home screen. The Stocks app displays a few stocks and 
indexes you may be interested in (such as Apple and Google), and it shows 
updated quotes (although quotes may be delayed by up to 20 minutes). Scroll 
the Stocks list by dragging or flicking it with your finger.
Swipe the lower section of the Stocks screen to see either a summary, a graph 
(as shown in Figure 21-12, left side), or the latest news. To see a current 
graph of the stock, swipe the lower section to the center and tap the 1d (one 
day), 1w (one week), 1m (one month), 3m (three months), 6m (six months), 
1y (one year), or 2y (two years) button above the graph in the stock reader. 
Tap the change number next to each stock to switch to show the percentage 
change, the market capitalization, or the change in price.

Recording Voice Memos
An iPod touch can record audio through an external microphone (such as the 
Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic), while an iPhone can use either the 
external mic or its built-in mic. An iPod nano can record voice memos using 
its built-in mic on the back next to the video camera, or using an iPod nano–
compatible microphone. An iPod classic can record voice memos using the 
optional Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic or an iPod classic-compatible 
microphone. You can find external mics for purchase at the Apple Store. 
Voice memos can be up to two hours long. If you record for more than two 
hours, your iPod or iPhone automatically starts a new voice memo to con-
tinue your recording. After syncing with iTunes (as I describe in Chapter 9), 
the voice memos appear in the Music section of your iTunes library and in 
the Voice Memos playlist (created for you if you don’t already have one).
Recording on an iPod touch or iPhone
The Voice Memos app lets you record audio through an external microphone 
(such as the Apple In-Ear Headphones with Remote and Mic) connected to 
an iPod touch or iPhone, or through the internal microphone of an iPhone. 
You can then send recordings to others by e-mail (or by text message on an 
iPhone, if your account with your carrier supports MMS), or sync them back 
to your computer’s iTunes library. 
To start recording, tap the Voice Memos app on the Home screen and then 
tap the red dot button on the left side of the VU meter on the microphone 
recording screen. (You can also press the center button on the control 
capsule of the Apple In-Ear Headphones to start recording.) The red dot 
changes to a Pause button, as shown in Figure 21-13 (left side), and the list 
button on the right side of the VU meter changes to a Stop button. Tap the 
Pause or Stop button to stop recording.
Tap the list button on the right side of the VU meter to see the Voice Memos 
screen with your list of recordings, as shown in Figure 21-13 (middle). Select a 
recording, and you can then tap Share to send it by e-mail, or Delete to delete 
it. After tapping Share, tap Email Voice Memo to open a new e-mail message 
with the recording (or tap Cancel). See Chapter 20 for details on sending an 
e-mail.
You can also tap the Play/Pause button on the left of the recording to play it, 
and tap the right arrow on the far right side of the recording to open the Info 
screen for that recording, as shown in Figure 21-13 (right side).

Recording on an iPod nano or iPod classic
The Voice Memos Extra in your iPod nano or iPod classic lets you record 
voice memos through an external mic or, in the case of the iPod nano, 
through the internal mic. (Be careful not to block the mic, which is on the 
back.) To record voice memos with an iPod classic, first connect the Apple 
Earphones with Remote and Mic, or connect an external mic to the Dock con-
nection — you won’t see a Voice Memos menu item if you’ve never connected 
a mic to the iPod classic.
To start recording with an iPod nano, choose Extras➪Voice Memos from the 
main menu — the Record screen appears, showing a microphone. Press the 
Play/Pause button or the Select button to begin recording, and press it again 
to pause recording. After pausing, you can select Resume to continue record-
ing, or just press Play/Pause again. To finish, press the Menu button, and then 
highlight Stop and Save and press the Select button. Your saved recording is 
listed by date and time.
To start recording with an iPod classic, choose Voice Memos➪Start 
Recording from the main menu. Recording starts immediately. Press the Play/
Pause button to pause recording. After pausing, you can select Resume to 
continue recording, or Stop and Save to stop and save it. Your saved record-
ing is listed by date and time. 
 
You can set a chapter mark in your voice memo on an iPod nano to go back to 
that section quickly. While recording, press the Select button whenever you 
want to set a chapter mark. During playback, you can go directly to the next 
chapter by pressing the Next/Fast-forward button. Press Previous/Rewind 
once to go to the start of the current chapter, and twice to go to the start of 
the previous chapter.
To play or delete a recording on an iPod nano, choose Extras➪Voice Memos, 
press the Menu button, select Voice Memos, and then choose a recording. 
Select Play and then press the Select button to start playing the recording, or 
Delete to delete the recording. When you sync your voice memos with your 
iTunes library, they are automatically deleted from your iPod nano.
To play a recording on an iPod classic, choose Extras➪Voice Memos and then 
select the recording. When you sync your voice memos with your iTunes 
library, they are automatically deleted from your iPod classic.

A Day in the Social Life on 
an iPod touch or iPhone
Connecting socially on a digital network isn’t new — I connected to friends 
way back in the pre-Internet dark ages by using exotic-sounding networks 
such as Usenet, bulletin board systems (BBS), The Source, CompuServe, the 
WELL (Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link), and EIES (Murray Turoff’s server-based 
Electronic Information Exchange Service). What’s new is that more sophisticated 
social networks have appeared and gone mainstream very quickly, with 
MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter leading the pack.
You can use your iPod touch or iPhone to stay in touch with your connections 
on these and many other social networks on the Internet — viewing and 
typing messages, chatting, uploading and sharing photos, joining groups, and 
so on.
Ain’t it good to know you’ve 
got a Facebook friend
Facebook is the fastest-growing free-access social networking site as of this 
writing, with more than 200 million active users worldwide. If you’re one 
of them (as I am), you already know that you can add friends, send them 
messages, and update your personal profile with photos, videos, links, and all 
sorts of Facebook widgets that extend the service’s functions. Although you 
can do all this using a browser on your computer and using Safari on your 
iPod touch or iPhone, the site itself is far too cumbersome for easy access 
that way. What’s needed is a “baby Facebook” on the iPod touch or iPhone.
And that’s exactly what Facebook for iPhone is: This app — which also runs 
on the iPod touch — lets you check your friends’ status updates and photos, 
start a conversation in Facebook Chat, and upload images from your iPod 
touch or iPhone.
 
 After downloading the Facebook app (see Chapter 7 for details on downloading 
apps from the App Store), tap Facebook on the Home screen and then log in 
to your Facebook account, as shown in Figure 21-15 (left side). Your Facebook 
home screen appears, as shown in Figure 21-15 (center), showing your news 
feed. Tap the multiple-squares button in the upper left corner to see the 
Facebook icons for all of the app’s features, as shown in Figure 21-15 (right 
side). If you have any messages in your Inbox, a number appears on top of the 
Inbox icon (refer to Figure 21-15, right side).

and more 
choices

After logging in, the Facebook app remembers your username and password 
so that you don’t have to type them to log in again. (Of course, that means 
if anyone grabs your iPod touch or iPhone, they’ll have access to your 
Facebook account — use a passcode to lock up your iPod touch or iPhone, 
as I describe in Chapter 4, so that no one can use it without the passcode.) If 
you don’t want the Facebook app to remember your login info, tap the Logout 
button in the upper-right corner of Facebook’s icons screen (refer to Figure 
21-15, right side).
Along the bottom of the Facebook screen are the Home icon for returning to 
the Home screen, the profile icon (with your first name) for showing your 
profile, the Friends icon to access a list of your Facebook friends, and the 
Inbox icon to check your messages. You can also Chat to chat directly with 
any of your friends who are online.
The Facebook app even lets you upload and share photos: Tap the the Photos 
icon and add a new album (type its name and description). You can then tap 
the Camera icon in the upper right corner of the album’s screen, and choose 
Take Photo to snap a photo (iPhone only) or Choose From Library to pick a 
photo from your iPod touch or iPhone photo albums.

MySpace odyssey
So MySpace, owned by Fox Interactive Media, was the most popular main-
stream social networking site until Facebook came along. Today, it’s the num-
ber-two service, and it’s still an awesomely huge network. MySpace focuses 
on music, movies, and TV shows — just about every band in the universe has 
a MySpace page, and it’s easy to add music to your profile.
You can use Safari on your iPod touch or iPhone to access MySpace, but like 
most social networks, the home page you see is far too cumbersome for easy 
access that way. The MySpace Mobile for iPhone app is much easier to use 
and works fine on your iPod touch as well. It lets you send and receive 
messages, check status updates and photos, stay up to date on bulletins, and 
upload images from your iPod touch or iPhone.
 
 After downloading the MySpace app (see Chapter 7 for app downloading 
details), tap MySpace on the Home screen and log in to your MySpace 
account, as shown in Figure 21-16 (left side). As you log in, you can turn on 
the Remember Me option so that after logging in, the MySpace app remembers 
your username and password so that you don’t have to log in again.
After you log in, your MySpace Home screen appears, as shown in Figure 21-16 
(right side), with menu selections for viewing and editing your profile, 
checking the status and mood messages from your friends, checking friend 
updates, adding comments, reading bulletins, reading blogs, and changing 
your settings.

 Chapter 21: Using Applications on Your iPod or iPhone
Along the bottom of the MySpace screen are the Home icon for returning to 
the Home screen, the Mail icon to check your messages, the Requests icon 
to view and respond to requests, the Friends icon for a list of your MySpace 
friends, and the Photos icon to upload photos to your MySpace page. To add 
photos, tap the Photos icon to see the photos already on your MySpace page 
and then tap the Add Photos button. You can then snap a photo (iPhone 
only) or pick a photo from your iPod touch or iPhone photo albums.
Dedicated follower of Twitter
The most talked-about newcomer to the social network scene is Twitter, a 
free social messaging utility for staying connected with people in real time. 
With Twitter, you can post and receive messages that are 140 characters or 
less — called tweets. All public tweets are available to read on the public 
timeline, or you can read just the ones posted by the Twitter members you 
follow. You can post a tweet that can be read by all your followers and by 
anyone reading the public tweets.
Members use Twitter to organize impromptu gatherings, carry on a group 
conversation, or just send a quick update to let people know what’s going on. 
Companies use Twitter to announce products and carry on conversations 
with their customers. You can use Safari on your iPod touch or iPhone to 
access Twitter, but there are alternatives that offer a better Twitter experience 
on your iPod touch or iPhone.
For example, you can use the Twitter for iPhone Web service (http://
twitterforiphone.com) with your iPod touch or iPhone to easily flip 
through all your messages with the flick of a finger. Twitter for iPhone offers 
a menu, as shown in Figure 21-17 (left side), for checking recent posts, 
updating your status, sending direct messages and replies to others on 
Twitter, browsing friends, and adding new friends (called followers).
 
 The App Store has several apps for accessing Twitter, but my favorite as of 
this writing is Twitterific — the free version includes advertising (see Figure 
21-17, right side), but a premium version is also available without ads. The 
free version of Twitterific does all the basic stuff you’d expect a Twitter client 
for an iPod touch or iPhone to do: You can read messages from people you 
follow, post messages of your own, and get alerted to private direct messages 
and public replies.

354

Figure 21-17:

And wherever you go, “tweetness follows.” Twitterific taps into the location 
services of your iPod touch or iPhone so that with your permission, it can 
let your followers know where you are and let you know when your followers 
are posting from a nearby location. You can set options for viewing messages, 
optimize the interface for left-handed operation, and use its own mini-
browser to view linked Web pages without having to quit the app and run 
Safari. You can also copy a link to the last-opened Web page in Safari on your 
iPod touch or iPhone into a tweet — a very useful trick if you like to include 
Web links with your tweets. Tweet dreams!

the software, and restoring the iPod or iPhone to 
its original factory condition.

▶ Updating iPod or iPhone software
▶ Restoring your iPod or iPhone settings
▶ Restoring an iPod or iPhone to its original factory condition
T
his no-nonsense chapter may not be fun, but it’s necessary. Humans 
aren’t perfect, and neither are the machines they make. If your iPod or 
iPhone stops working as it should, or an iPod touch or iPhone app causes it 
to freeze up, you can turn to this chapter.
This chapter also covers updating the firmware and software on your iPod 
or iPhone. (Firmware is software encoded in hardware.) All software devices 
need to be updated now and then — it’s a good thing because new versions 
fix known bugs and add improvements.
Finally, I describe how to restore your iPod or iPhone to its factory default 
condition. Restoring to factory condition is a drastic measure that erases any 
music or information, but it usually solves a software glitch when nothing 
else does.
Powering Up and Unlocking
To turn on an iPod nano or iPod classic, press any part of the click wheel. To 
turn on an iPod touch or iPhone, press either the Sleep/Wake button or the 
physical Home button.
If an iPod nano or iPod classic refuses to turn on, check the position of the 
Hold switch — on the top of a current-model iPod classic or iPod nano (or 
on the bottom next to the dock connection on older iPod nano models). The 
Hold switch locks the iPod buttons so that you don’t accidentally activate 

358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
them. Slide the Hold switch to the left, hiding the orange layer, to unlock the 
buttons. (If you see the orange layer underneath one end of the Hold switch, 
the switch is still in the locked position.)
The “hold” switch for an iPod shuffle is actually the three-position switch (or 
the on-off switch on older models). Slide the three-way switch to expose the 
green layer underneath to turn on your iPod shuffle.
Rather than a hold button, iPod touch and iPhone models display the 
message Slide to unlock — slide your finger across this message to 
unlock your iPod touch or iPhone.
If you previously set a passcode for the iPod or iPhone (see Chapter 4), you 
must enter the passcode; otherwise you need to attach the iPod or iPhone to 
the computer you used to set up and synchronize it, or completely restore 
the iPod or iPhone to its original factory condition, as I describe later in this 
chapter.
 
Keep in mind that starting up an iPod touch or iPhone that was completely 
turned off takes quite a bit of power — more than if it woke from sleep. If you 
do turn it off, plug it into AC power or your computer before turning it back on.
Powering Down
Your iPod or iPhone should be set to go to sleep automatically, unless you 
change the settings.
The iPod nano or iPod classic lets you set its backlight to turn off automatically 
by choosing Settings➪General➪Backlight and picking the amount of time to 
remain on (or choosing Always On). This is similar to putting it to sleep.
You can set your iPod touch or iPhone to automatically go to sleep by 
choosing Settings➪General➪Auto-Lock and choosing the amount of time 
before sleeping (or choosing Never, to prevent automatic sleep).
You can force an iPod classic or iPod nano to power off by pressing the Play/
Pause button.
To force your iPod touch or iPhone to go to sleep, press the Sleep/Wake (On/
Off) button on the top. To turn it off completely so that it has to start its 
system again from scratch, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button on top for 
a few seconds until a red slider appears on the screen that says Slide to 
power off and then slide your finger across the slider to turn it off.

 Chapter 22: Ten Steps to Recovery
Stopping a Frozen App
Apple is not perfect, and neither are the many thousands of developers who 
create the apps that run on an iPod touch or iPhone, and the “extra” or click-
wheel games on an iPod nano or iPod classic.
If your iPod touch or iPhone freezes while running an app, press and hold the 
Sleep/Wake button on top for a few seconds until a red slider appears on the 
screen that says Slide to power off — then press and hold the physical 
Home button until the application quits. If that doesn’t work, see the previous 
section in this chapter.
If your iPod nano or iPod classic itself freezes, you need to reset its system — 
see the next section.
Resetting Your iPod or iPhone System
Sometimes problems arise with electronics and software that cause your 
iPod or iPhone to stop working properly. You can usually fix the problem by 
resetting it and restarting the iPod or iPhone system from scratch — just 
like resetting a computer. Resetting the system does not restore the iPod or 
iPhone to its original factory condition, nor does it erase anything — your 
content and settings remain intact.
Before resetting the system, you may want to connect the iPod or iPhone to 
a power outlet by using the AC power adapter. You can reset your iPod or 
iPhone without connecting it to power if it has enough juice in its battery. 
However, if you have access to power, it makes sense to use it because the 
reset operation uses power, and starting up your iPod or iPhone from scratch 
again also uses power.
To reset the iPod touch or iPhone, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and 
the physical Home button at the same time for at least ten seconds, ignoring 
the red slider that says Slide to power off, until the Apple logo appears.
To reset the iPod nano or iPod classic, follow these steps:
 
1. Toggle the Hold switch.
 
 Slide the Hold switch to the right, exposing the orange layer, to lock the 
buttons, and then slide it back to unlock.

360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
2. Press the Menu and Select buttons simultaneously and hold for at 
least six seconds or until the Apple logo appears; then release the 
buttons when you see the Apple logo.
 
 The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting 
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons.
 
Release the Menu and Select buttons as soon as you see the Apple logo. If you 
continue to press the buttons after the logo appears, the iPod displays the low 
battery icon, and you must connect it to a power source before using it again.
To reset the iPod shuffle, first disconnect it from your computer (if you 
haven’t already done so) and then slide the three-position switch to the Off 
position. The green stripe under the switch should not be visible. Wait five 
seconds and then switch the slider back to the Shuffle Songs or Play in Order 
position.
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music 
and data files.
Resetting iPod or iPhone Settings
Perhaps someone played a practical joke on you and set your iPod language 
to German (and you don’t understand German). Or maybe a fee-based hotel 
Wi-Fi network has captured your iPod touch or iPhone and won’t let go. 
Sometimes you need to reset your settings and preferences.
You can reset all your iPod nano or iPod classic settings, or all or part of 
your iPod touch or iPhone settings, while leaving your content and personal 
information intact. On an iPod touch or iPhone, you can also erase all content 
and reset network settings.
To reset iPod nano or iPod classic settings, choose Settings➪Reset Settings 
and select Reset (or Cancel to cancel). This resets all the items on the 
Settings menu to their default settings.
To see your resetting options on an iPod touch or iPhone, choose Settings➪
General➪Reset from the Home screen. The Reset screen appears, as shown in 
Figure 22-1.
You have several options for resetting:
 
✓ Reset All Settings: To return your iPod touch or iPhone to its original 
condition with no preferences or settings while still keeping your 
content and your personal information (including contacts, calendars, 
e-mail accounts, and apps with their data) intact, tap Reset All Settings.

iPod touch 
settings and 
clearing all 
content.
 
 
✓ Erase All Content and Settings: To erase everything, first connect the 
iPod touch or iPhone to your computer or a power adapter and then 
tap Erase All Content and Settings. This operation can take hours! It 
wipes out everything by overwriting the data. You can’t use the iPod 
touch or iPhone until it finishes. It may be easier and faster to do a full 
restore from iTunes, as I describe in the section “Restoring to Factory 
Condition,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Reset Network Settings: You can reset your network settings so that 
your previously used networks are removed from the Wi-Fi list. This type 
of reset is useful if you can’t find any other way to stop a Wi-Fi network 
from connecting automatically to your iPod touch or iPhone — just tap 
Reset Network Settings, and you’re automatically disconnected from any 
Wi-Fi network. (Wi-Fi is turned off and then back on.) For more details 
about choosing Wi-Fi networks, see Chapter 4.
 
✓ Reset Keyboard Dictionary: To reset the keyboard dictionary, tap this 
button. This erases all words that have been added to the dictionary. 
(Words are added when you reject words suggested by the keyboard and 
type the word — see Chapter 3 for details.)
 
✓ Reset Home Screen Layout: If you rearranged the icons on your Home 
screen (as I describe in Chapter 3), you may want to set them back 
to their original positions. To reset your Home screen to the default 
arrangement, tap Reset Home Screen Layout.
 
✓ Reset Location Warnings: Location warnings are requests by apps to 
use the Location Services. The iPod touch or iPhone stops displaying 
these warnings the second time you tap OK. If you want to start 
displaying the warnings again, tap Reset Location Warnings.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Checking the Software Version
You should always keep your iPod or iPhone updated with new versions of 
the system software that controls it. iTunes automatically checks for updates 
of this software and lets you update your iPod or iPhone without affecting the 
music or data stored on it.
Make sure that you use the newest version of iTunes. To check for the 
availability of an updated version for Windows, run iTunes and choose 
Help➪Check for iTunes Updates.
If you use a Mac and you enabled the Software Update option in your System 
Preferences, Apple automatically informs you of updates to your Apple 
software for the Mac, including iTunes, Safari, iCal, and Address Book. All 
you need to do is select which updates to download and then click the Install 
button to download them. iTunes includes updates for all iPod and iPhone 
generations and can detect which model you have.
To determine which version of the system software is installed on your iPod 
touch or iPhone, choose Settings➪General➪About from the Home screen; on 
an iPod nano or iPod classic, choose Settings➪About from the main menu. 
Next to the word Version is information that describes the software version 
installed.
Updating the Software
iTunes tells you whether your iPod or iPhone has the newest software 
installed. Connect the iPod or iPhone to your computer, select it in the 
iTunes Source pane (in the Devices section) and you’ll see the Summary page 
appear to the right of the Source pane. The Version section of the page tells 
you whether your iPod or iPhone software is up to date and when iTunes will 
check for new software.
If an update is available, a dialog appears to ask permission to download it. 
Go ahead and click the OK button to update the software; you’ll be glad you 
did because Apple often includes new features and battery-saving upgrades. 
After updating the software, iTunes continues syncing with the iPod or 
iPhone until it is finished.

363
 Chapter 22: Ten Steps to Recovery
Restoring to Factory Condition
You can restore your iPod or iPhone to its original factory condition. This 
operation erases its storage and returns the iPod or iPhone to its original 
settings. It’s the last resort for fixing problems, and it’s the only choice if you 
intend to change the computer you’re using for syncing your iPod or iPhone.
To restore an iPod or iPhone, follow these steps for both the Mac and 
Windows versions of iTunes:
 
1. Connect the iPod or iPhone to your computer.
 
 iTunes opens automatically.
 
2. Select the iPod or iPhone in the Devices section of the Source pane, 
and click the Summary tab if it isn’t already selected.
 
 The Summary pane appears to the right of the Source pane.
 
3. Click the Restore button.
 
 An alert dialog appears to confirm that you want to restore the iPod or 
iPhone.
 
4. Click the Restore button again to confirm the restore operation.
 
 A progress bar appears, indicating the progress of the restore operation. 
iTunes notifies you when the restore is finished.
Setting Up and Syncing
After the restore operation finishes (as previously described), iTunes displays 
the setup screen for a newly minted iPod or iPhone — the restore operation 
makes it like new again.
In the setup screen, as described in Chapter 2, you can give your iPod nano 
or iPod classic a new name.
For an iPod touch or iPhone, iTunes provides the options to restore the 
settings from a previously backed-up iPod touch or iPhone, or to set it up as 
new. If you choose to set it up as new, you can give your iPod touch or iPhone 
a new name and set the automatic options, as I describe in Chapter 2. See the 
next section in this chapter if you want to restore from a backup.

364
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
To replace content and apps that were erased by the restore operation, sync 
your iPod or iPhone with your computer’s iTunes library, as I describe in 
Chapter 9, and with personal information (contacts, calendars, notes, e-mail 
accounts, and bookmarks), as I describe in Chapter 10. You also need to 
resync your pictures, as I describe in Chapter 18.
Restoring Settings from a Backup 
(iPod touch and iPhone)
iTunes provides protection and backs up your iPod touch or iPhone settings 
so that you can restore them. This backup comes in handy if you want to 
apply the settings to a new iPod touch or iPhone, or to one that you had to 
restore to its factory condition.
Whenever you sync your iPod touch or iPhone, iTunes automatically copies 
all the settings you use to customize your iPod touch or iPhone and its apps, 
including Wi-Fi network settings, the keyboard dictionary, and settings for 
contacts, calendars, and e-mail accounts.
To restore your settings, connect your new or restored iPod touch or iPhone 
to the same computer and copy of iTunes you used before so that iTunes 
remembers the backup settings. iTunes should open automatically. (If it 
doesn’t, open iTunes manually.) As you start the setup process, iTunes gives 
you the choice of restoring the settings from a previously backed-up iPod 
touch or iPhone, or setting up the iPod touch or iPhone as new. Choose the 
option to restore the settings and then click the Continue button to finish 
setting up your iPod touch or iPhone. If you choose to set it up as new, follow 
the step-by-step instructions in Chapter 2 for setting it up.
To delete the backed-up settings for an iPod touch or iPhone, open iTunes 
and choose iTunes➪Preferences (on a Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (on a 
Windows PC). Click the Devices tab, select the iPod touch or iPhone in the 
Device backups list, and then click Remove Backup. You don’t need to 
connect the iPod touch or iPhone to do this.

Ten Tangible Tips
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping your battery juiced and your screen clean
▶ Rating your songs
▶ Deleting apps, videos, and podcasts from your iPod touch or iPhone
▶ Using international keyboards on an iPod touch or iPhone
T
his book is filled with tips, but I’ve put ten truly handy ones in this 
chapter that just didn’t fit in elsewhere but which can help make your 
iPod or iPhone experience a completely satisfying one.
Saving the Life of Your Battery
Follow these simple rules to extend your battery life:
 
✓ Don’t keep an iPod or iPhone in a snug carrying case when charging — 
that snug case can cause overheating.
 
✓ Top it off with power whenever it’s convenient.
 
✓ Set your iPod touch or iPhone to automatically go to sleep by choosing 
Settings➪General➪Auto-Lock from the Home screen.
 
✓ Set the iPod nano or iPod classic backlight to turn off automatically by 
choosing Settings➪General➪Backlight and picking the amount of time to 
remain on (or choosing Always On).
Everything else you need to know is in Chapter 1.

366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Keeping Your Screen Clean
If the iPod or iPhone display has excessive moisture on it from humidity or 
wet fingers, wipe it with a soft, dry cloth. If it’s dirty, use a soft, slightly damp, 
lint-free cloth — an inexpensive eyeglass cleaning cloth sold in vision-care 
stores or pharmacies is a good choice. By no means should you use window 
cleaners, household cleaners, aerosol sprays, solvents, alcohol, ammonia, or 
abrasives — they can scratch or otherwise damage the display. Also, try not 
to get any moisture in any of the openings, as it could short out the device.
Getting Healthy with Nike
Use your iPod touch, iPhone, or iPod nano as a workout companion with 
Nike+ running shoes and a Nike + iPod Sport Kit. The kit’s sensor fits inside 
your Nike+ shoe under the insole. A receiver is provided for the iPod nano 
and first-generation iPod touch (current-generation iPod touch and iPhone 
models include a receiver).
When you have the kit and the shoes, activate the app on your iPod touch or 
iPhone — choose Settings➪Nike + iPod and tap Off for the Nike + iPod option 
to turn it on. To activate the kit on your iPod nano, choose Nike + iPod from 
the main menu.
You can track your pace, time, and distance from one workout to the next, 
and you can pick songs and playlists to match. You can even sync your 
workout data with Nikeplus.com, see all your runs, and share motivation with 
runners across the world.
Rating Your Songs
Ratings are useful — the Shuffle and Genius features are influenced by 
ratings, and you can define smart playlists with ratings to select only rated 
songs so that you can avoid the clunkers and spinal tappers. In fact, when 
you try to put a music library on your iPod or iPhone that’s larger than the 
device’s capacity, iTunes decides which songs to synchronize based on — 
you guessed it — ratings.

367
 Chapter 23: Ten Tangible Tips
iTunes lets you rate your songs, but so does your iPod or iPhone. You can 
rate any song on your iPod or iPhone as you listen to it. Ratings you assign 
on your iPod or iPhone are automatically resynchronized to your iTunes 
library when you connect your iPod or iPhone again.
To assign a rating to a song, start playing the song on your iPod or iPhone 
(see Chapter 16 for details). The Now Playing screen should appear. On 
an iPod nano or iPod classic, press the Select button three times, cycling 
through the scrubber bar and Genius Start button to reach the rating bullets; 
then scroll the click wheel to give the song zero to five stars.
On an iPod touch or iPhone, follow these steps to rate your songs:
 
1. Tap the List button to display a list of the album or playlist contents.
 
 The List button is in the upper-right corner.
 
2. Tap the title of any song in the track listing or leave selected the song 
that’s playing.
 
3. Drag across the ratings bar at the top of the track listing to give the 
song zero to five stars.
The upper limit is five stars (for the best).
Deleting Apps from Your 
iPod touch or iPhone
You can turn off the synchronization of certain apps in your iTunes library 
before syncing your iPod touch or iPhone to iTunes, as I describe in Chapter 9, 
so that the apps disappear from your iPod touch or iPhone. But you can also 
delete apps directly from your iPod touch or iPhone.
Touch and hold any icon on the Home screen until all the icons begin to 
wiggle (as if you’re about to rearrange them or add Home screens). To delete 
an app, tap the circled x that appears inside the app’s icon as it wiggles. The 
iPod touch or iPhone displays a warning that deleting the app also deletes all 
its data; tap Delete to go ahead and delete the app and its data, or tap Cancel 
to cancel.
To stop the icons from wiggling, press the physical Home button on the 
device, which saves any changes you made to your Home screens.

368
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Deleting Videos and Podcasts from 
Your iPod touch or iPhone
Need more room on your iPod touch or iPhone? You can delete a video or 
podcast episode directly from your iPod touch or iPhone by flicking left or 
right across the video or podcast episode selection and then tapping the 
Delete button that appears.
Your video or podcast episode is deleted from your iPod touch or iPhone 
only. When you sync your iPod touch or iPhone with iTunes, the video or 
podcast episode is copied back to your iPod touch or iPhone unless you 
change your sync settings or switch to manually managing music and videos, 
as I describe in Chapter 9. Note: If you delete a rented movie from an iPod 
touch or iPhone, it’s gone forever (or until you rent it again).
Measuring Traffic in Maps
The Maps app supplied with the iPhone and iPod touch not only shows you 
the route to take, but in some areas, it can also show you traffic patterns so 
that you can avoid the jams. The traffic data is constantly updated and 
aggregated from a variety of Internet sources by Google. It is available 
for more than 30 major U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, and Washington.
To use Maps, tap Maps on the Home screen. The Maps app appears (refer to 
Chapter 21). You can obtain directions first, as I describe in Chapter 21, or 
just display any location on the map that has highways. To show traffic 
information, tap the Underneath button (the curled-page icon in the lower-
right corner) to see a menu underneath the map and then tap Show Traffic.
When the map shows traffic, highways are color-coded according to the flow 
of traffic:
 
✓ Green for highways moving faster than 50 miles per hour (mph)
 
✓ Yellow for 25–50 mph
 
✓ Red for less than 25 mph
If you don’t see color-coded highways, you may need to zoom out to see 
highways and major roads.
To stop showing the traffic, tap the Underneath button and then tap Hide 
Traffic.

 Chapter 23: Ten Tangible Tips
Turning On International Keyboards 
on Your iPod touch or iPhone
You can turn on keyboards for different languages and use them simultaneously. 
To turn on international keyboards, choose Settings➪General➪Keyboard 
from the Home screen and then tap International Keyboards (scroll the list 
to find it). The international keyboards appear, as shown in Figure 23-1 
(left side).
 
Figure 23-1: 
Turn on 
international 
keyboards 
(left), switch 
languages 
on the 
keyboard 
(middle), 
and draw 
Chinese 
characters 
(right).
 
You can turn on any of the keyboards you need — tap Off to turn each one 
on. To access languages with more than one keyboard, such as Japanese, tap 
Japanese first and then tap the specific keyboard layout (QWERTY or Kana).
You can then switch keyboards while typing information by tapping the globe 
icon, as shown in Figure 23-1 (middle), that appears to the right of the 123 
key when more than one international keyboard is turned on. The language of 
the newly active keyboard appears briefly on the spacebar.
Each time you tap the globe icon, the keyboard layout switches to the next 
language you’ve turned on, in the order that they appear in the international 
keyboards list.
To use the Japanese Kana keyboard, use the keypad to select syllables. For 
more syllable options, tap the arrow key and select another syllable or word 
from the window. With the Japanese QWERTY keyboard, you can use the 
QWERTY layout to input code for Japanese syllables. As you type, suggested 
syllables appear, and you can tap the syllable to choose it.

370
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Drawing Chinese Characters
The iPod touch and iPhone offer keyboards for both Traditional and 
Simplified Chinese, with Handwriting and Pinyin layouts for both. Turn 
on international keyboards as described in the preceding section and 
tap Chinese (Simplified) or Chinese (Traditional). Then tap Off to turn on 
Handwriting or Pinyin. (You can turn both on.)
For the Handwriting layouts, use the touchpad to enter Chinese characters 
with your finger. (Refer to Figure 23-1, right side.)
As you draw character strokes, matching characters appear in a list, with the 
closest match at the top. When you choose a character, its related characters 
appear in the list as additional choices.
For Simplified Pinyin, use the QWERTY keyboard to enter Pinyin for Chinese 
characters; as you type, suggested Chinese characters appear. Tap a character 
to choose it or continue entering Pinyin to see more character options.
Stopping a Wi-Fi Network from Joining
Your iPod touch or iPhone remembers your Wi-Fi connections and automatically 
uses one when it detects it within your range. If you’ve used multiple Wi-Fi 
networks in the same location, it picks the last one you used. (For details on 
choosing a Wi-Fi network, see Chapter 4.)
But if your iPod touch or iPhone keeps picking up a Wi-Fi network that you 
can’t properly join, such as a private network that requires a password you 
don’t know or a commercial network that charges for access, you can tell 
your iPod touch or iPhone to forget this particular network, rather than 
turning off Wi-Fi itself. This is very useful if a paid service has somehow 
gotten hold of your iPod touch or iPhone and won’t let you move on to other 
Web pages without typing a password.
Choose Settings➪Wi-Fi from the Home screen and tap the circled right-arrow 
(>) button next to the selected network’s name. The network’s information 
screen appears. Tap the Forget This Network button at the top of the screen 
so that your iPod touch doesn’t join it automatically. Then tap the Wi-Fi 
Networks button in the upper-left corner to return to the Wi-Fi Networks 
screen. You can always select this network manually, and you can still 
continue to use other Wi-Fi networks.
