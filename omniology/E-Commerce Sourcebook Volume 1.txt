INTRODUCTION
By the early 2000s, it seemed almost banal to assert
that the Internet has effected revolutionary change,
not only in the world of computers and communica-
tions, but in the broader realms of human civilization,
including areas of economics, culture, social relations,
language, and politics. That fact served to reinforce
how thoroughly entrenched the transformation has
become in society and in the public mind. In extending
its tentacles to ever further spheres of human interac-
tion, the Internet itself was being transformed as well.
At the outset of the 21st century, users of the Internet
at all levels—from the average Web surfer to the
technician, from activists to policy makers, from con-
sumers to entrepreneurs—were in the process of defin-
ing the Internet&rsquouo;s character and the place it
would secure within society. A flexible technology
and medium, the Internet was ultimately defined by
its uses, which continue to develop and expand.
Thus, with business developments playing a crucial
role in the Internet’s makeup, entrepreneurs were well
positioned to play a key role in impacting, if not
determining, the Internet’s future and, accordingly,
many aspects of society at large. Those entrepreneurs
engaging in e-commerce activities, in particular, were
of special importance in the early years of the 2000s as
the initial dot-com hype wore off and the e-commerce
industry began to search out new paradigms for online
commercial activity.
The literature on e-commerce—its opportunities
for riches, its technical workings, its effects on culture
and society, and its potential dangers—could fill miles
of shelf space in our libraries. In particular, books
seeking to instruct budding entrepreneurs in the art
of conquering the dot-com jungle comprise a vast
publishing niche in their own right. To date, however,
the literature has lacked a single comprehensive refer-
ence source designed to be of use to existing and
aspiring entrepreneurs, students, researchers, and in-
terested laypersons. Such a comprehensive source can

be found in the Gale E-Commerce Sourcebook, which
consists not only of practical knowledge and instruc-
tion, but also includes detailed directory data and re-
source contact-information, allowing readers to follow
through with their research in an efficient and prag-
matic way. The Gale E-Commerce Sourcebook exists
to fill this gap in the literature, answering in simple
terms the many questions that arise in the course of
establishing or running an e-commerce firm.
E-COMMERCE: HOW WE GOT HERE
The Internet, born in the 1960s of Pentagon-funded
experiments into cutting-edge military communica-
tions, blossomed into a research and information-
exchange medium of particular use to academics in
the 1970s and 1980s, and finally into the backbone
for email, the World Wide Web, and other popular
communications in the 1990s. By the end of the 20th
century, few people in the United States were com-
pletely without access to the Internet, either at home
or via libraries or commercial venues. Meanwhile, the
Web itself, designed to universalize Internet usage,
grew into a sweeping economic force as, it seemed,
the entire commercial universe was rapidly whisked
into cyberspace through the mid- and late 1990s, all
the while transforming the manner in which business
is conducted.
In this latter stage, businesses grew increasingly
interested in these technologies for their own strate-
gies, and looked to the Internet and the Web as a
potentially vast new market, upon which one needed
to capitalize quickly to establish a firm presence.
Meanwhile, there arose a tremendous literature in
business circles geared toward new business models
centered on or incorporating Internet communications
and technology.
A NEW ECONOMY? But coinciding as it did with the
broader economic boom of the 1990s, and as Internet

stocks defied gravity and traditional economic logic
in the late 1990s, this transformation in the economic
landscape gave rise to a new crop of literature pointing
to the Internet, e-commerce, and information technol-
ogies as hallmarks of a New Economy, a fundamen-
tally new epoch in economic history in which the old
rules—including the business cycle and traditional
business models and wisdom—no longer applied.
Such musings were fiercely debated, but the ideas
were taken seriously enough to occupy huge quantities
of space in the business press, economic journals, and
political and popular discourse, while in the stock
market the economic stalwarts appeared to shift from
blue chips like IBM, General Motors, and General
Electric to digital-age hot shots such as AOL, Ama-
zon.com, and Yahoo!.
Meanwhile, flamboyant and brash entrepreneurs
such as broadcast.com founder Mark Cuban and Buy.-
com’s chief Scott Blum epitomized the business he-
roes of the day, displacing the more staid and conser-
vative leaders of yesteryear. Cuban, for his part, grew
highly visible in the late 1990s as a prolific public
speaker, extolling his vision of e-commerce as the
medium that would consume commercial activity as
we know it. Blum, meanwhile, overtly and proudly
eschewed all traditional business sense, styling his
company as a daring trailblazer in e-commerce. On
the way, Blum built Buy.com into the second-largest
online retailer, after Amazon.com. All the while, com-
mentators enthusiastic about the emergent New Econ-
omy held up these entrepreneurs’ business models as
hallmarks of the future, chiding others to drop their
antiquated Old Economy thinking and embrace the
future in the making.
Lending some credence to such seemingly extreme
views, stock valuations in the dot-com revolution were
divorced from traditional bases, such as fundamentals,
profits, and long-term growth strategies. Those in-
sisting that this constituted a mere speculation bubble
were regularly denounced as cranks clinging to the
old mode of thinking. And, for a while, the market kept
proving the enthusiasts right. For instance, analysts
insisted in 1997 that Yahoo!’s stock was grossly over-
valued, but an investor who had accepted that analysis
and sold out would have missed out on a tremendous
financial windfall, as Yahoo!’s stock continued its
upward surge through the rest of the decade. When the
Dow Jones Industrial Average broke the unimaginably
high 10,000 barrier in March 1999, even skeptics
began to wonder if the economy had indeed entered
unprecedented territory, and whether information
technology now guaranteed us more or less continual
economic expansion.
THE DOT-COM BUSINESS MODEL. Through this pe-
riod, a dominant model among dot-com firms (espe-
cially true for pure-plays) began to emerge, differing
markedly from any previous model and particularly
novel given its tremendous success. In this model
long-term plans for profitability, attention to the bot-
tom line, and concern for internally funded growth
and development were almost completely abandoned.
The goal was to explode on the scene fueled by venture
capital, make a lucrative initial public offering (IPO),
watch the firm’s stock value catapult into the strato-
sphere, and then liquidate or sell out to a larger firm.
Frequently, this process was repeated several times
by the same individuals, producing a class of ‘‘serial
entrepreneurs.’’
As noted, investors failed to disappoint. Convinced
they were sitting on top of the greatest financial gold-
mine of the era, venture capitalists and others poured
enormous sums into just about every company with
a ‘‘.com’’ appended to its name. Thus, e-commerce
firms stayed afloat overwhelmingly on investor dol-
lars, which, during the boom years, proved to be an
especially lucrative practice but one that planted the
seeds of volatility. With few viable means of self-
sustaining income, these companies were rendered
almost entirely dependent on the whims of the stock
market and the attractiveness of their firms in the
venture capital markets, a market which, through this
period, was in large part based on hype-driven trends
and herd-like investment patterns.
With such copious flows of investment capital,
dot-coms could afford to engage in highly unorthodox
pricing strategies, undercutting their competitors by
wide margins to draw in customers. But with little
planning or organizational preparation to handle the
business that came in, e-commerce firms were notori-
ous for their dismal order-handling performance, and
the complaints rolled in and were echoed in the press,
leading to the first wave of a backlash that would
culminate in the tech-market crash. Meanwhile, al-
though these pricing strategies succeeded in winning
customers from competitors, there was little actual
money being made due to the low pricing for products
and services, and thus such firms still failed to generate
their own stable revenue streams, continuing their
dependence on investment capital. Finally, since rapid
growth and staking a claim to the emergent Internet
market were seen as chief priorities, dot-coms sunk
enormous quantities of capital into splashy advertising
schemes to grab the public’s attention.

MA-
TURES. Finally, in the first half of 2000, the New
Economy began to come apart at the seams as the
tech market went bust and the cushion of investment
capital was pulled out from under the dot-com crowd.
E-commerce outfits folded up their tents by the doz-
ens, resulting in a massive shakeout as startups scram-
bled to make themselves attractive to acquisition or
simply exited the market altogether. In the following

years, the stock markets continued to flounder, re-
maining well below their boom-cycle peaks. While
these events were certainly couched within a broader
trend in the economy and in the technology sector in
particular, the tremendous hype about the e-com-
merce-driven New Economy and the novelty and
brashness of the dot-com model produced a vicious
backlash. E-commerce became the poster sector for
late 1990s ‘‘irrational exuberance,’’ an apt term
coined by Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan
Greenspan.
Following the crash, both established, surviving
dot-coms and brick-and-mortar firms hardly retreated
from e-commerce. Amidst the wreckage, larger firms
swallowed up smaller ones and integrated their In-
ternet expertise and market footings into their own
operations. But the practice of emerging hard and fast
on an endless supply of investment dollars, with only
cursory planning for the long term and little grounding
in traditional business wisdom, was simply no longer
an available option, as this strategy rested on e-com-
merce’s novelty and hype, and investors’ attendant
rush to capitalize on the trend.
As for the New Economy, the reality in the early
2000s points to a middle ground between the hyper-
enthusiasts and the more vitriolic nay sayers. Techno-
logical innovations, and the Internet in particular, have
indeed produced substantial alterations in the produc-
tive workings of the economy, and e-commerce has
drastically transformed the ways in which business is
conducted, but old laws, such as the importance of
planning for sustainable profitability, remain firmly
intact.
The Internet economy didn’t consume the Old
Economy, nor did brick-and-mortars triumph over e-
commerce. Rather, the early 2000s are marked by a
growing synthesis between these two realms, to the
point where it no longer makes sense to dwell on
divisions between two types of economies: there is
now simply the economy, driven in part by, but also
transforming, the Internet and e-commerce. E-com-
merce business models in the 21st century can no
more afford to abandon traditional business thinking
than brick-and-mortar firms can afford to ignore e-
commerce.
THE INTERNET AND E-COMMERCE:
LASTING CHANGES
Though the glory years may be over, and e-com-
merce entrepreneurs must come to terms with a
rougher reality in which meticulous planning and in-
novative creativity are required for success, it is cru-
cial to understand the ways that the Internet and e-
commerce have transformed the economic and social
ix

S O U R C E B O O K
environment for the various actors with whom e-com-
merce firms regularly come into contact. Compre-
hending the relationship between e-commerce and
these groups is a vital component of the entrepreneur’s
arsenal of knowledge.
BUSINESSES.
Among the many lasting changes to
the make-up of businesses as a result of e-commerce
and its information-technology architecture was the
organizational structure. Relative to their forebears,
companies in the Internet age are diffusely organized,
operating across vast, interlocking networks, often
irrespective of geographical or international bound-
aries. Inter- and intrafirm networking are now the
norm, and this calls for more than simply ‘‘getting
connected.’’ Rather, networks must be strategically
and creatively designed to foster specific kinds of
relationships and flows of information for optimal
efficiency and competitive advantage.
Production methods have evolved from the mass
production techniques of the Fordist era to flexible
production procedures organized across diffuse net-
works, coordinated by highly integrated information
technology incorporating all facets of the firm’s opera-
tions, from supply logistics to inventories, from orders
to shipping information. The earlier, Fordist model
proved simply too rigid and costly for the diversified
and rapidly changing market conditions of the e-com-
merce era, and in its place are such developments as
information technology-based supply chain manage-
ment, just-in-time inventory, mass customization, and
other innovations.
Also generally proven to be too rigid and antitheti-
cal to the needs of e-commerce and Internet-based
production are the scientific management theories of
Frederick Winslow Taylor, known as Taylorism,
which served as the dominant mode of business man-
agement, particularly for large corporations with ex-
tensive bureaucracies, through the 20th century. Char-
acterized by highly regimented flows of information
and authority, Taylorism broke down corporations
into their components and designed each for optimal
efficiency via elaborate systems of rules. In this way,
control was concentrated in the hands of skilled pro-
fessional managers and organized hierarchically. In
the Internet age, with a premium on ‘‘knowledge
workers’’ and creative innovation, firms are increas-
ingly organized more horizontally, with diverse and
interweaving flows of information for maximum
knowledge sharing.
CONSUMERS. The experience of the customer was
among the most dramatically transformed components
of the e-commerce era. Accustomed to simple pricing
comparisons, 24-hour access, without respect to geog-
raphy, and without ever having to leave their homes,
customers are afforded incomparable convenience,

and their expectations have been heightened accord-
ingly. ‘‘The customer is always right’’ is an adage
that has rarely carried such significance, as consumers
grow familiar with the bevy of innovative customer-
service schemes already in place. From easy access
to account information to personalized shopping at
their favorite Web sites, the demands of customers
have never been as crucial to a firm’s operations; thus,
any business’s successful e-commerce strategy must
place a premium on getting to know customers and
earning their trust.
WORKERS. The Internet economy offered workers
a markedly different environment than that in most
traditional offices. Dot-coms lured many skilled
knowledge-workers, who were looking to circumvent
the standard corporate model, with flexible hours, a
casual work environment, creative input, control over
the work process, and cutting-edge business practices.
One drawing card that proved unreliable over the long
run, however, was the heavy reliance by e-commerce
firms on stock options to attract new workers. When
the economy tumbled and dot-coms went under, the
lucrative gains expected from stock options often
failed to materialize. Work in the e-commerce era is
characterized by perpetual connectivity, knowledge
of computer systems as a requirement, and completely
overhauled and redesigned work processes—even for
the most menial occupations—to incorporate informa-
tion technology.
INVESTORS. Internet technologies served to usher in
a vast industry catering to investors of all stripes, from
neophytes to professionals, from long-term specula-
tors to day traders. Champions of online investing
pointed to its low barriers to entry, technical ease
of Internet trading, low commissions on trades, and
greater investor control over portfolios as factors lead-
ing to the democratization of securities markets. But
while profound changes were afoot in the investment
world, online investment also posed its challenges to
the e-commerce industry and the economy as a whole.
With so many new investors entering the market, com-
panies have had to adjust to increasing volatility, thus
posing challenges to projections of long-term cash
flow.
PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK
The Gale E-Commerce Sourcebook is intended,
first and foremost, to be a practical resource for entre-
preneurs, researchers, high school and college busi-
ness students, and lay readers with no special prior
knowledge or training in business or information tech-
nology. It serves as a guide through the workings of
e-commerce, providing answers to the major questions
facing anyone seeking to break into the field, and
instructing readers how to launch, develop, grow, and
maintain an e-commerce enterprise. In addition, the
book helps general readers understand and appreciate
the broader e-commerce landscape, and instructs e-
commerce entrepreneurs, including existing brick-
and-mortar firms, how to transform their enterprises
in order to make the foray into the e-commerce market.
Wading into the murky waters of e-commerce liter-
ature and media commentary can be a confusing pros-
pect. From the excessive optimism of the late 1990s
to the often-dismal tone of the early 2000s, there has
been precious little opportunity to read consistently
level-headed analysis of the ins and outs of e-com-
merce for up-and-coming entrepreneurs. To be sure,
there is good reason for healthy skepticism of some
of the more dramatic claims about the Internet-based
revolution, not the least of which was the massive e-
commerce shakeout and the dramatic bust in the stock
market, which discredited the hype and called into
serious question the received wisdom of the Internet
business models of the late 1990s. The Gale E-Com-
merce Sourcebook seeks to strike a balance between
the positioning of e-commerce as a panacea for eco-
nomic growth on the one hand and the deriding of it
as a fraudulent money pit on the other. E-commerce,
while still developing, is clearly here to stay, and thus
it presents itself as a practicality and an opportunity.
Moreover, a common hallmark of the typical 1990s
instructional tome on e-commerce, seeking to impart
wisdom to the aspiring e-commerce titan, was its in-
flated claims and promises, not to mention trendy
jargon and irreverence for traditional business wisdom
that some conflated with the very nature of innovation
through its boom years. In place of hype, the Gale E-
Commerce Sourcebook attempts to impart practical
knowledge to the reader in clear, sober language
grounded
in
tried-and-true
business
practices.
Avoiding the superficial and faddish extremes of much
popular literature on e-commerce, the Gale E-Com-
merce Sourcebook hopes to aid readers in eluding the
costly mistakes—and losses—that such thinking all
too often produced.
For entrepreneurs just starting out in e-commerce,
so many questions arise that it often seems difficult
to know where to begin. In addition to all the general
considerations of launching a business of any stripe,
the e-commerce model spills a host of new questions
into the entrepreneur’s lap, ranging from the technical
considerations of doing business on the Internet to
the qualifications of traditional business methods that
the Internet model demands. The Gale E-Commerce
Sourcebook answers a great many of these questions
and provides suggested avenues for further inquiry.
WHITHER E-COMMERCE?
E-commerce in the 21st century is a much more

discriminating and competitive marketplace than that
which surfaced in the 1990s. Because emerging entre-
preneurs generally lack the economies of scale en-
joyed by their more entrenched and established com-
petitors, they need to be especially smart about where
they direct their money in the early development
stages, and they can no longer rely on an endless flow
of investment capital to make up the difference. E-
commerce entrepreneurs in the 2000s and beyond need
to be simultaneously creative and rational, grounded
in extensive knowledge of the workings of existing
xi

S O U R C E B O O K
market conditions, and wily enough to find their own
niche within them or even to transform those condi-
tions through innovation.
Obviously, a reference source such as this cannot
teach the kind of creativity and ingenuity that will
produce the next batch of e-commerce giants and mark
the development of the Internet; that remains the spe-
cial provenance of the entrepreneurial spirit. What the
Gale E-Commerce Sourcebook does help to provide is
the basic tools—knowledge, clarity, and informational
resources. In short, the foundation upon which such
creativity and development can be realized.

COMPA-
NIES. Despite the massive shakeout of so many e-
commerce firms, there were a number of highly suc-
cessful companies who not only sustained the down-
turn in the dot-com market but managed to flourish
and mature, acting as forebears of the kinds of firms
that will emerge in the 21st century. This final section
is devoted to those examples, and is subdivided into
two parts within Volume 2. The first half arranges
companies alphabetically by company name, with
each entry containing complete contact information
including contact name, address, and phone, toll-free
and fax numbers; email and URL addresses; brief
description of the type of business; and descriptive
data such as annual revenue, number of employees,
date founded, and major partners. The second half
consists of rankings of these firms according to annual
revenues and number of employees.
A General Index is also included at the end of
Volume 2 to provide easy access to organization
names, personal names, industries, and subject terms.
It is important to note that references are to book
numbers rather than to page numbers, and that each
section begins with book number ‘‘1.’’ Each book
number reference is preceded by a letter denoting a
section of the book: ‘‘T’’ denotes a ‘‘How To’’ topic,
‘‘O’’ denotes a listing within the Organization section,
and ‘‘C’’ refers the user to a listing within the Compa-
nies section.
METHOD OF COMPILATION. Directory listings and
company profiles in GECS were obtained using a
variety of means: Direct contact with the associations,
organizations, companies, and agencies through tele-
phone surveys, Internet research, or through materials
provided by those listees; government resources; and
data obtained from other relevant Gale directories.

ACCOUNTING PRACTICES IN E-
COMMERCE
In the early days of e-commerce and through the
thick of the dot-com boom, common wisdom held
that the novelty of the new electronic business model,
particularly as rendered over the Web, was enough to
float a business. Thus companies put their efforts into
creating the appearance of innovation, while some
traditional business concerns were pushed to the back
burner. This logic was fed by copious commentary in
business journals that dot-coms heralded the death
of the traditional business model. Only when the e-
commerce bubble burst in the early 2000s did opinions
begin to change in earnest, and e-commerce entrepre-
neurs discovered that a novel business idea wasn’t
enough—it had to be backed up by solid practices,
and accounting mattered to businesses, customers, and
investors alike.
So old-school bookkeeping practices are vitally
important, but the process of selecting the best ac-
counting practices for your firm depends on your spe-
cific business needs. These practices have to arise
organically out of the practices and operations your
firm employs in general.
NEW CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE
INFORMATION AGE
Some accounting considerations are fairly new in
the e-commerce era, or at least take on new impor-
tance. E-commerce firms, especially pure-play, on-
line-only firms, create new forms of value that must
be accounted for in some way. Firms delivering full-
fledged e-commerce services are more likely to focus
their accounting strategies around the product or ser-
vice they’re offering, paying special attention to fac-
tors like intellectual property and the firm’s unique
business practices. Innovative practices may have in-
nate value in a still-forming e-commerce market.

With the wealth of data at your firm’s virtual fin-
gertips, it’s crucial to keep in mind that any informa-
tion that can be transferred into useful knowledge has
potential power to augment your financial situation.
It’s important to not only harness such knowledge for
your firm’s benefit, but to account for it as well.
This doesn’t necessarily mean that the rules of the
accounting game have changed; rather, established
theories and methods of accounting have simply been
intensified by the addition of new layers of detail.
Accounting practices have to mirror the greater com-
plexity and subtle detail of business the Information
Age.
Determining when and how to account for particu-
lar transactions can have a great impact on the com-
pany’s cash flow, assets, and profits. Your firm must
devise stable models for allocating costs. Choosing
whether to expense a cost, classifying it as a simple
expense incurred immediatedly, or to capitalize a cost,
classifying it as an investment that can be amortized
over time, is one factor e-commerce firms must con-
sider. For instance, you need to determine how best
to account for internal-use software—software your
business develops or uses exclusively within the firm
with no plans to profit from the software itself. In
general, accounting organizations favor expensing
certain stages of software development as they are
incurred, as well as all costs surrounding the software
use, such as training, data maintenance, interest pay-
ments. However, certain direct development costs,
usually the ones directly tied to writing and testing the
software, are often capitalized as internal investments.
Your company’s financial team will need to be famil-
iar with published standards, such as those of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(AICPA) and the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB), in order to navigate through these
complex decisions.
Similarly, advertising costs can be expensed as
incurred—at each step as the advertising program is
developed—or when the advertisement actually hits
the market. Less often, advertising costs may be amor-
tized on the books, provided that the advertising meets
certain characteristics of longer-term investments. The
timing of the expense accounting may seem trivial,
but it is hardly trivial. In financial statements that
auditors, tax authorities, and investors need to make
crucial decisions about your firm, the timing of such

‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
decisions becomes very important for assessing the
actual state of your firm’s financial position at a
given time.
Intellectual capital refers to the accumulated
knowledge, expertise, and intangible assets in your
firm. It comes from employees; equipment such as
hardware, databases, and IT networks; and a host of
other sources including patents, trademarks, and the
scalability of existing hardware and software—any-
thing that can be considered to add value in some
vital way. Because the future value of intellectual
capital is difficult to judge, it is likewise difficult to
quantify intellectual capital for accounting purposes.
Nonetheless, the increasing role of intellectual capital
in assessing the value of businesses, particularly in
the e-commerce markets, demands that your firm not
let this asset go unaccounted for.
SOFTWARE
Software packages come in all varieties and soft-
ware consultants are readily available to help you
integrate those software applications with your com-
pany’s specific ways of conducting business. While
early electronic accounting applications consisted of
basic spreadsheets, word processors, and databases,
applications available in the e-commerce world har-
ness all the power of modern information technology
and telecommunications for almost unlimited options
and tremendous power and efficiency.
Accounting applications are generally able to track
all relevant accounting information, from basic ac-
counts payable and receivable to intangible assets, and
can augment their usefulness by managing inventory,
cutting checks, devising regular reports and account-
ing summaries, tracking customer and vendor ac-
counts, and integrating with other vital systems, such
as supply chain management applications, data ware-
houses, and internal networks and extranets.
WHAT’S THE BOTTOM LINE?
The challenge for your company is to create a
strategy that will put your firm in the strongest overall
position both internally and in the eyes of outsiders.
This includes staying within the bounds of accounting
ethics, which means not overstating your firm’s finan-
cial health by hiding, over- or understating any infor-
mation vital to an outside observer. Such practices
aren’t just important to outsiders. In order for you to
make accurate assessments of your firm and sound
strategic decisions, you need a clear accounting
schedule.

ADVERTISING YOUR WEB SITE
Online advertising is not a mature medium. As it
evolves, unresolved questions about its effectiveness
remain. While studies have shown that simple banner
ads will drive people to try new products, low click-
through rates have caused the use of banner ads to
decline. Although banner ads offer the possibility of
clicking through to another Web site, advertisers
should not look at online advertising only as a direct
response medium. Online advertising also offers the
possibility of building brand awareness. Creating such
awareness is not necessarily measured by click-
through rates. Since people generally go online to
perform some type of task, it is not surprising that
they are often unwilling to click-through an online
ad. However, that doesn’t mean that the ad was not
effective in terms of creating awareness and possibly
some future action.
OBJECTIVES OF ONLINE ADVERTISING
Owners who want to advertise their Web sites need
to determine whether their strategy is to drive sales
or to create greater awareness of their site. An early-
2002 study by AdRelevance based on interviews with
marketing executives involved in online advertising
found that 61 percent mentioned some aspect of brand-
ing as their main online advertising strategy. Creating
awareness ranked higher than direct response, driving
traffic, and driving sales as a primary objective.
Other studies have shown that direct response and
converting viewers to customers were more important
to online advertisers than building brand awareness.
A Nielsen/NetRatings study of new online advertising
campaigns launched in the first quarter of 2001 found
that nearly 90 percent were direct marketing cam-
paigns and that only slightly more than 10 percent
were branding campaigns.

These types of mixed results indicate the dual na-
ture of online advertising. On the one hand, direct
response ads allow for feedback and a direct connec-
tion with the viewer, who can respond to an online
ad with a single click. On the other hand, online
advertising facilitates brand-building by spreading the
word about a Web site. Advertisers may choose both
objectives and assign a percentage of ads for sales
and a percentage for brand-building. Ads that are de-
signed to drive sales are measured differently than
those intended to build brand awareness. Click-
through and conversion rates are effective measures
of ads designed to increase sales at a Web site. Brand-
building ads, on the other hand, are measured by such
factors as awareness, recall, and persuasion.
Ads that build brand or name awareness for a Web
site are more successful if they also promote brand
understanding. Name awareness alone is not sufficient
to drive traffic to a Web site. Rather, successful brand-
building ads offer multiple benefits to drive traffic.
They explain overall brand positioning by spelling
out the benefits of the site and how the site is able to
deliver them. Recognizing that one of the principal
motivations for searching the Web is to find informa-
tion, successful ads for Web sites present information-
based benefits available at the advertised site, such
as a product search feature, relevant content, or quality
of information.
WHERE TO ADVERTISE
Major Internet portals and other high-traffic sites
account for a high percentage of Internet advertising.
According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau
(IAB), the top 25 sites in terms of traffic took in 88
percent of all online advertising revenue during the
first half of 2001.
Web sites seeking to launch large advertising cam-
paigns that would involve ads appearing on several
sites may use the services of companies that specialize
in online advertising and operate advertising net-
works. Ad networks such as those operated by Dou-
bleClick Inc., 24/7 Real Media Inc., and ValueClick
Inc. serve as go-betweens between advertisers and
Web site publishers. While the ad networks vary from
agency to agency, they typically include higher traffic
Web sites organized into categories. They also offer
enhanced targeting capabilities that can deliver ad
impressions to viewers based on their past actions.
AD PRICING MODELS
There are two basic models for pricing online ads,
cost-per-impression and cost-per-performance. Cost-
per-impression (also known as cost-per-view) means
that advertisers are charged for the number of people
who actually see the ad, based on traffic to the Web
3
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
sites where the ad appears. This model usually charges
on a cost-per-thousand (CPM) basis. It is a model that
is based on traditional advertising, where advertisers
are charged according to the number of subscribers
or size of audience.
The cost-per-performance model, on the other
hand, offers advertisers the opportunity to pay on
the basis of measurable results. Online ads may be
measured in term of cost-per-click (CPC), cost-per-
action (CPA), cost-per-lead (CPL), or cost-per-acqui-
sition (CPA). Cost-per-action pricing includes not
only clicks but also sales and leads. Cost-per-lead
pricing is often used in business-to-business ads,
where the advertiser specifies how many leads it wants
a specific promotion to generate and pays only for
those that are delivered. Cost-per-acquisition is similar
to CPL except that advertisers only pay when the user
makes an actual purchase and is ‘‘acquired’’ as a
customer.
TYPES OF ONLINE ADS
According to a December 2001 study by the Inter-
active Advertising Bureau (IAB) and Pricewater-
houseCoopers (PwC), banner ads accounted for 36
percent of U.S. online advertising revenue in the first
three quarters of 2001. Sponsorships came in second
with 27 percent, followed by classified ads (16 per-
cent), slotting fees (8 percent), keyword search (4
percent), interstitials (3 percent), e-mail (2 percent),
rich media (2 percent), and referrals (2 percent).
While banner ads accounted for the highest per-
centage of online advertising revenue, their use de-
clined in 2001 compared to 2000. Web site publishers
often participate in banner exchanges with other Web
sites, but they need to be careful that their ads are
reaching an appropriate audience. Banner ad ex-
changes often result in less effective targeting.
New ad formats include floating ads and cursor
ads. Floating ads appear on screen and can’t be closed
or scrolled past. Since they don’t open another win-
dow, software programs designed to suppress pop-up
ads won’t find the floating ads. Such ads typically
run for only a few days to avoid the risk of alienating
users. Cursor ads involve attaching the advertiser’s
logo to the user’s mouse arrow. Still other types of ads
include sound effects, such as music and voiceovers, to
gain attention. Known as rich media ads, they utilize
JavaScript, dynamic HTML, and downloadable soft-
ware to gain the user’s attention through interactivity,
animation, and multimedia effects.
Pop-up ads, while they may gain attention, are
meeting resistance from Internet users, who have
learned to close them even before they are loaded.
Users resent that pop-up ads take away control of
their computer screen. They serve to interrupt users

rather than engage them. However, pop-up ads and
other interstitials were found to be effective in terms
of ad recall.
Text-based ads offer small advertisers a chance to
appear on sites that receive a lot of traffic, such as
the popular search engine Google (www.google.com).
Google’s AdWords program allows small advertisers
to mount a campaign of text-based ads for less than
$100. An AdWords campaign at Google might consist
of several text-based ads that rotate against the same
set of keywords. Google is able to determine which
ads have the highest click-through rate and subse-
quently can show those ads more frequently than ads
with lower click-through rates.
ONLINE ADVERTISING STILL GROWING
Advertising a Web site online is one of several
ways to market and promote an e-commerce Web site.
Online advertising was still evolving in 2002 as the
industry sought to define and standardize performance
measurements. Advertisers could choose from several
different pricing models. While the largest online ad-
vertisers spent millions of dollars to build their brands
and drive traffic to their Web sites, advertising oppor-
tunities also existed for small and medium-size e-
commerce Web sites. During the first half of 2002,
the number of unique online ads rose steadily, indicat-
ing that online advertising was making a comeback
from the decline in 2001.

ADVERTISING ON YOUR WEB SITE
The principal reason that Web site publishers take
advertising is to generate revenue. However, several
factors in 2001 caused many content sites to turn to
other models of revenue generation. For example, the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) reported that
the top 25 sites in terms of traffic took in 88 percent
of all online advertising revenue during the first half
of 2001. Another factor was the 18 percent decline
in online advertising recorded during the first three
quarters of 2001 compared to 2000. Among the new
models considered for generating revenue were sub-
scription services that made selected content available
only to subscribers, syndication, co-branding, and e-
commerce. Instead of looking for revenue from out-
side advertisers, some content sites began putting up
ads on their sites for products and services they could
provide themselves.
TRENDS IN ONLINE ADVERTISING
A survey by the Association of National Advertis-
ers found that 79 percent of all U.S. companies adver-
tised online in 2000, up from 67 percent in 1999.
Those companies spent an average of $2.4 million
each on online advertising, with about half of them
saying their primary goal was to develop and improve
brand loyalty.
Overall, eMarketer estimated that $7.3 billion was
spent on Internet advertising in the United States in
2001 and predicted that $8.1 billion would be spent
in 2002. Most of that growth was expected to come
from traditional advertisers. The top 10 companies
spending the most on online advertising in 2001 were
eBay ($45.1 million), General Motors Corp. ($42.3
million), Providian Corp. ($29.3 million), Ama-
zon.com Inc. ($27.5 million), Barnes & Noble Inc.
($26.2 million), Bank One Corp. ($25.7 million), AOL
Time Warner Inc. ($25.6 million), Classmates Online
Inc. ($24.6 million), Vivendi Universal SA ($21.4
million), and Dell Computer Corp. ($21.1 million),
according to a report from CMR.

POTENTIAL ADVERTISERS AND HOW TO
REACH THEM
While online advertising revenue declined signifi-
cantly in 2001, traditional advertisers spent more to
advertise online in 2001 than they did in 2000. Ac-
cording to the IAB, online ad sales declined 18 percent
during the first three quarters of 2001 (to $1.8 billion)
compared to the same period in 2000. Much of the
loss in online advertising revenue in 2001 was a direct
result of the dot-com shakeout.
However, traditional advertisers such as retailers
and automobile manufacturers spent $4.6 billion on
online advertising in 2001, compared to $2.7 billion
in 2000, according to Forrester Research, which used
a broader definition of online advertising than IAB.
Forrester also reported that traditional advertisers ac-
counted for 61 percent of online sales in 2001.
Sites that take advertising were trying to establish
longer-term relationships with advertisers that had
been getting 30-day contracts. Such longer-term rela-
tionships employed payment models based on users
acting on an ad rather than on a cost-per-thousand
(CPM) impressions payment model. Performance-
based models might be based on cost-per-clicks or on
actual sales resulting from the ad.
Some sites that were affiliated with offline proper-
ties in other media attempted to attract online advertis-
ers by offering cross-platform packages. That is, on-
line ads were offered as part of an overall package of
advertising that might include print and outdoor media
affiliated with the Web site owner.
AD NETWORKS ATTRACT LARGER
ADVERTISERS
Web sites with enough traffic to qualify may con-
sider becoming part of an ad network, such as Dou-
bleClick Media, 24/7 Network, or ValueClick Inc.
Each network has its own characteristics and qualifica-
tions for joining. Double Click Media, operated by
online ad agency DoubleClick Inc., is a collection
of high-profile branded sites. DoubleClick uses its
proprietary technology to deliver, target, and report
on its customers’ campaigns. It also allows Web pub-
lishers to outsource ad sales for their Web sites to the
company’s ad sales force.
The 24/7 Network is operated by 24/7 Real Media
Inc. It is a global online advertising network. As of
mid-2002 it consisted of more than 600 high-profile
Web sites and 3,000 small to medium-size Web sites
in North America, South America, and Europe. The
network offered a variety of value-added services to
both advertisers and Web site publishers.
ValueClick Inc. specializes in performance-based
pricing for its ad networks. It operated a comprehen-
sive network as well as 15 targeted categories grouped
5

S O U R C E B O O K
according to content. Small and medium-size Web
sites may join the ValueClick network by completing
an online application. Other products and services
offered to participating Web site publishers include
real-time statistical reporting, payment management,
and the ability to categorize each page of its Web site,
among others.
APPEALING TO SMALLER ADVERTISERS
Text-based ads appeal to smaller advertisers and
can be sold for as little as $10 a month. They load
faster than graphic ads and are more difficult to block.
Plain text ads are also easier to integrate into Web
site design. By appealing to smaller advertisers, Web
site owners can greatly increase the potential number
of advertisers on their sites. Other benefits include
decreasing their reliance on large advertisers and de-
voting fewer resources to ad sales.
A site may generate advertising revenue by offer-
ing its community of users the opportunity to advertise
to other members of the community. A simple adver-
tising program can be set up by the site’s Webmaster
by purchasing an off-the-shelf banner ad system,
tweaking it for text-based ads, and integrating it with
an automated payment system such as PayPal.
Although the use of banner ads declined from 2000
to 2001, joining a banner exchange network may be
useful for attracting smaller advertisers who couldn’t
otherwise afford to advertise their Web site. Generally,
banner exchanges offer less targeting capabilities than
ad networks or direct placement of ads.
PUTTING PRINT ADS ONLINE
The use of online classified ads increased from
2000 to 2001. According to the IAB, the percentage
of companies using online classified ads increased
from 5 percent in the first half of 2000 to 15 percent
in the first half of 2001. By 2002 online classified
advertising had become a highly competitive area
among print publishers. According to one newspaper’s
Web publisher quoted in Editor & Publisher, ‘‘It’s
instantly profitable.’’ Putting print classified ads on-
line was only the first step in the print-to-Web phe-
nomenon. Newspapers began putting other kinds of
print ads, including retail display ads, inserts, and
special sections, online. They trained their advertising
sales representatives to offer the online ads as a bonus
for advertising in print. Another advantage to the print
publishers was that it didn’t take a lot of extra work
to put the print ads online; much of the work was
handled by vendors who hosted the service.

MEASUREMENT, PERFORMANCE, AND
REPORTING
Potential advertisers want verifiable performance
measurements. As of early 2002 Web sites and ad
networks were using different measurements to deter-
mine click-through rates, number of unique visitors,
and similar metrics. To deal with this problem, the
Interactive Advertising Bureau and Pricewaterhouse-
Coopers (PwC) proposed a set of guidelines to stan-
dardize the measurement of online ads at the beginning
of 2002.
However, Web sites opposed to strict standards of
measurement pointed out that online advertising was
still a young and evolving medium. Online ads may
be incorporated into a site in so many different ways
that it is difficult, if not impossible, to standardize the
measurement of their effectiveness.
Online advertising can track a user’s actions and
provide quantified sales. Click-through rates are a
standard measurement of an ad’s effectiveness. Click-
through refers to the number of people who actually
click on an ad. Advertisers realize that click-through
rates are not the only measurement of an ad’s perform-
ance. They do not measure an ad’s effectiveness as
part of a brand-building campaign. Ads that are de-
signed to create brand awareness need not rely on
click-through rates as a measure of effectiveness.
Online advertising is still an evolving medium.
Web site publishers can attract advertisers in several
ways, such as by joining an ad network or a banner
exchange. An important factor is the ability to offer
a relevant, well-defined audience to potential advertis-
ers. Web sites that are not part of a network may
come to the attention of potential advertisers through
their own ads, search engine results, and other
methods.

ANTICIPATING THE SIZE OF YOUR
MARKET
Knowing how many potential customers you
have—and how much they’re willing to spend—is
one of the most basic yet difficult problems businesses
of all sorts face. Few businesses can know with cer-
tainty how much potential demand exists for their
products, yet having some idea can help maximize
revenues and prevent spending money on developing
a product that will never sell. Large companies readily
spend tens of thousands of dollars on detailed market-
ing studies to estimate potential demand, but even
these methods aren’t foolproof. Since their marketing
funds are often quite limited, small businesses in par-
ticular have to be flexible in order to cope with incom-
plete and sometimes inaccurate measures of market
potential.
Before you can estimate your market’s size, you
need to spend a little time defining exactly whom it
includes. Many new businesses make the mistake of
assuming almost anyone will buy their product. They
take a product-centered approach, thinking, for exam-
ple, ‘‘anyone who uses word-processing software will
subscribe to my new online resume-building suite.’’
It’s extremely rare to have a product that appeals so
widely. In this example it might make sense, instead,
to focus on selling to students who use public Web
terminals and need a centralized online tool to access
their information from different locations. Failing to
define the target market realistically can lead to over-
blown sales forecasts and poorly focused marketing.

DEFINING YOUR MARKET
Most businesses find they have one or two well-
defined primary markets for their products, and per-
haps one or two secondary markets as well. Defining
a target market carefully, also called segmenting the
market, takes into account a range of demographic
traits, or so-called firmographics if you’re selling to
other businesses. Among consumers, marketers regu-
larly consider the buyer’s age, gender, income, marital
status, geographic location, method of Internet access,
even ethnicity. For businesses, relevant characteristics
include annual sales, number of employees, number
of locations, major software platforms, and line of
business. Target markets are also commonly defined
according to an earlier buying history, such as people
who own luxury cars or businesses that use temporary
staffing agencies. This information helps identify who
is a qualified and likely buyer. As a rule, the number of
viable buyers is smaller than the targeted demographic
groups participating in the market.
Once the target market is defined, you can begin to
collect information about its size. If it is an established
market, meaning that other firms already offer a simi-
lar product or service, published research may be
available. This is also the case if it is a predictable
demographic group that many marketers target, say,
women over age 50 who use the Internet. A search
of newspaper, business press, and trade journal data-
bases at a library or directly over the Web can reveal
whether such information has been published in the
past. Trade journals, periodicals devoted to a particular
industry or profession, can be an especially rich source
of information. The same is true of trade associations,
which often compile and release statistics for the bene-
fit of their members. If your competitors include pub-
licly traded companies, occasionally investment re-
ports on the individual companies or the industry as
a whole will contain estimates of market size. Some-
times even a competitor’s financial disclosures will
include estimates of the total market size, or at least
their share of it. If you can’t find statistics that relate
directly to the market you intend to go after, you may
be able to find related numbers which can serve as a
platform for making other estimates.
Aside from finding second-hand estimates pub-
lished in newspapers or trade press, you could also
look for marketing research firms that sell standard-
ized, syndicated reports covering your target market
or a similar one. These kinds of reports often supply
the underlying statistics used in the press. Most indus-
tries have at least one research house that produces
ongoing reports and sells them to companies in the
industry along with industry analysts and the press.
Many times research firms disclose some of their basic
findings for free in press releases or summary sheets
available on their Web sites. General e-commerce

studies are produced by research firms like Forrester
Research, International Data Corporation, Jupiter Me-
dia Metrix, NetRatings, and the Yankee Group. Some
of these and a good number of others also conduct
customized studies to answer specific marketing ques-
tions that aren’t addressed in their standard reports.
ACTING ON MARKET ASSUMPTIONS
E-commerce firms can also gauge market size from
the ground up, estimating what a given marketing
campaign or series of campaigns will yield. Tests or
previous experience, for instance, may reveal that a
direct e-mail campaign gets a 1.5 percent response,
and that you typically end up selling to one out of
every four potential customers who respond to direct
marketing. By combining this information with other
available statistics, such as the total number of busi-
nesses in your target market, you can arrive at a crude
estimate of the total volume of business available via
direct marketing. The calculations might work like
this: you assume that the 1.5 percent represents the
interested or qualified market out of, say, a total of
20,000 businesses you target. This would amount to
a market of 300 qualified and interested businesses
you will reach if you contact all 20,000. Multiply the
300 by your average completed sale, let’s say $10,000,
and you arrive at a reachable market estimate of $3
million dollars out of a theoretical (and probably unre-
alistic) target market of $200 million (20,000 times
$10,000). Your sales forecast would probably be one-
quarter of $3 million, or $750,000, based on the histor-
ical rate of converting one in four interested prospects
into full-fledged sales.
This example is simplistic and would not be suit-
able for many needs. Each step of the estimate is
subject to error, and the sum of the potential errors
could be very great indeed. In practice, the number
of businesses that respond to direct marketing may
not be a good indicator of the whole market at all.
For one thing, a different e-mail message or a different
list of recipients might alter the response rate greatly.
Even with the ideal list and messaging, it may well
be that the qualified market is better defined by another
attribute, not simply those businesses having enough
interest to respond to your marketing letter. This
method also would not take into account important
issues like repeat sales (do customers need your ser-
vices again if they’ve already bought in the past?),
competitor activity (are your competitors gaining mar-
ket share and leaving you a dwindling portion?), and
changes in market size (is the total market growing
or shrinking?).
Still, market estimates made from reliable, relevant
past experiences have advantages over some ‘‘top-
down’’ estimates, which may purport a huge potential

market that never materializes. Some large-scale esti-
mates are based on a theory which can’t be fully
realized because, for example, potential customers
may find substitutes or work-arounds that prevent
them from ever entering the market for your products.
Statistics about the online world, especially, can be
subject to errors in counting unique visitors and ob-
taining accurate visitor demographics. Similarly,
broadly defined market studies may not arrive at an
effective definition of who is a likely buyer just by
using general demographic traits and statistics, and
may overestimate as a result. Of course, any given
method can underestimate the market as well, a phe-
nomenon seen in the early expansion of the Internet
in the 1990s.
When you analyze a general study’s implications
for your business, you should also look for assump-
tions in the study that vary widely from your firm’s
experience. For example, if you have established lines
of business in other areas, through cross-selling you
may be able to reach buyers who are not generally
considered part of the market. But by the same token,
you may have greater difficulty reaching the recog-
nized market.
The bottom line is that market estimates are by
nature open to interpretation and change. They are
useful for planning and have many implications for
your e-commerce strategy, but should not be taken as
literal or fixed. More than likely, the market itself is
changing over time, as is your position in it.

APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS
Until the late 1990s, it was rare to hear the term
‘‘ASP’’ (pronounced A-S-P, short for application ser-
vice provider) in business circles. Today the term has
made its way into the vocabulary of commerce and
e-commerce. According to information technology
consultancy IDC, ASPs will grow into a $20 billion
industry by 2006, up from $26 million in 1999.
ASPs are third-party software hosts, independent
firms that deploy, manage, and provide access to com-
puter applications from their centralized location(s)
and servers through a rental-like arrangement. Clients
access the applications most commonly via the Web.
In their article, ‘‘Application Service Providers: The
Next Horizon in Software,’’ Marc Osten and Michael
Stein compare using an ASP to the voicemail service
offered by most telephone companies. The technology
itself is located at the phone company’s offices, on
its equipment. The phone company is responsible for
its management and maintenance, but you—and thou-
sands of others—pay a monthly fee to access its capa-
bilities. To callers who hear your personal greeting
and leave a message that only you can retrieve, it’s
a seamless process; the technology functions as if it
were your own.
ASPs have grown rapidly in the past few years
due to the increasing presence of the Internet and
faster, cheaper bandwidth. Their popularity may also
be due to the realization that they can provide access,
particularly for small and medium-sized businesses,
to applications that would otherwise be out of financial
and technological reach. Using an ASP, a small com-
pany can access sophisticated accounting software,
for example, that it wouldn’t be able to afford to
license or have the staff to install and manage.
Another benefit of using an ASP is the speed of
implementation. A firm can sign up with one or more
ASPs (different ASPs host different applications) and
within days or weeks have access to the application.
If the firm were buying its own licenses and installing
the software on site (or at multiple sites), it could take
anywhere from weeks to months, depending on the
complexity of the application, networking needs, and
staffing. For a budget-conscious business or a firm
with a small or overburdened IT (information technol-
ogy) staff, ASPs can function as an off-site IT depart-
ment of sorts.
Today, ASPs offer just about any type of applica-
tion a business might need, including accounting and
e-commerce, human resources, database management,
customer relationship management (CRM), project
management and office productivity, enterprise re-
source planning (ERP), and sales force automation
(SFA).
Typically ASPs charge a monthly subscription fee
based on the number of users at the client’s company.
Some charge quarterly or annually, and some may
charge based on the number of transactions or fre-
quency of usage. There may be additional up-front
set up fees or charges for training and customization.
When deciding whether to work with an ASP,
consider which applications you’ll need. Evaluate
your existing hardware and software, whether you
have high-speed Internet access (you’ll need to get it,
if not), your IT staffing, and the cost of the applications
if you were to license them yourself. Contact various
ASPs to gather information. Depending on the appli-
cation you’re considering, you might want to find an
ASP that specializes in your industry, such as
healthcare or e-commerce, or you might want to find
an ASP that specializes in a functional area, such as

human resources or supply chain management. You
may also consider more than one ASP, perhaps one
for payroll and another for accounts payable.
Be sure when talking to representatives from ASPs
that you ask the same questions of each to ensure a
fair and accurate comparison. Your questions should
cover whether customization of the applications is
possible, or necessary, so that they function smoothly
with your existing systems and data; what staff train-
ing and support the ASP will provide; and its response
times and channels (can you call a toll-free number
for help or must you email?). Ask about reliability
(opt for companies with 1% or less ‘‘downtime’’)
and security procedures, including results of security
audits. You’ll want to know what the ASP’s data
backup and storage procedures are, whether you have
real-time access to your data, and what contingency
plans the company has in case of natural disasters or
power outages, for example. You’ll also want to know
about the application’s ‘‘scalability’’; i.e., does it have
the capacity to support your business in one, three,
and five years? These items will likely vary by ASP, so
be sure to ask, and then carefully weigh the answers.
Ask about a ‘‘try before you buy’’ test period
before making a final decision. When you have chosen
your provider(s) of choice, you’ll sign a contract with
your ASP, referred to as a service level agreement,
Service level agreements (SLA) or SLA. Make sure
your agreement spells out the details of your arrange-
ment. It should include:
T
start and end dates of service,
T
an implementation schedule,
T
specific levels of customer support your firm is to
receive,
T
reliability and performance standards and what
you’re entitled to if the ASP fails to meet them,
T
provisions for system and data security,
T
detailed subscription and set-up fees and when
they are to be paid, and
T
any training and customization that will occur as
well as how and where (via the Web or on-site?)
it will take place.
The SLA should specifically state that you are the
sole owner of your company’s data for the duration
of the agreement and termination conditions. Just as
you’ll want to know that your ASP has a contingency
plan in place for the unexpected, you’ll want to have
such a plan, an exit strategy, in case your relationship
with the ASP ends. Consider what your steps will be
if the ASP goes out of business, is acquired, or is
not meeting its commitments as spelled out in your
9

agreement. Certainly none of us wants to enter a busi-
ness relationship with the worst in mind; a good selec-
tion process, a detailed agreement, and a contingency
plan will facilitate a smooth and productive rela-
tionship.

AUTHORING SOFTWARE
To construct a Web site, Web developers must
use some form of authoring software. Typically, this
software allows the site developer to move back and
forth between a window that displays a Web site’s
layout and a window in which the developer actually
works. Many authoring software programs come with
a variety of prefabricated site designs from which
developers can choose. Other programs offer tools
that allow users to develop a more customized design.
Many programs offer both options. At the core of most
authoring software programs is an HTML (hypertext
markup language) editor, a program that helps users
write and manipulate the necessary HTML coding for
their Web sites. HTML codes, or tags, essentially tell
the different pieces of your Web site what to do. For
example, one code or set of codes might position a
paragraph of text in a large, blue font on the first page
of your site, while another code might create a link
from a graphic on your site to another Web site. Along
with facilitating HTML editing, many authoring soft-
ware programs now automate the Web development
tasks, including e-commerce and chat room functions,
that once proved complicated for even the most tech-
nologically savvy designers.

CHOOSING AUTHORING SOFTWARE
The type of authoring software designers use de-
pends upon their experience level and what they want
the site to be able to do. For example, developers who
plan to create a highly sophisticated site tend to use
a product such as Macromedia’s Dreamweaver 4. An
October 2001 issue of PC Magazine states, ‘‘with
unmatched
design
power
and
extensibility,
Dreamweaver has become the de facto standard for
professional Web designers. In short, if you want to
build a truly advanced site, you’ll most likely use
Dreamweaver... if it can be done on the Web, it can
be done with Dreamweaver.’’ Available for both Mac-
intosh and Windows operating systems, Dreamweaver
costs roughly $300. It requires some degree of famil-
iarity with HTML and basic Web site design, so it
may not be the best choice for a novice. Another
product for Web design professionals is Adobe GoL-
ive 5.0, which offers various multimedia and frame-
editing tools along with its HTML editor.
COST AND PERFORMANCE
More suited to beginners are products like Micro-
soft FrontPage 2002, which is about half the price of
Dreamweaver, and NetObjects Fusion MX, an even
cheaper alternative at $100. Neither program requires
familiarity with HTML. Like Dreamweaver, Fusion
targets developers wanting to build sites for busi-
nesses. The program, only available for Windows op-
erating systems, includes e-commerce wizards and
other prefabricated templates to lead novices through
the Web design process. Fusion is considered the sim-
plest of mainstream Web authoring tools; as such,
it allows for quick site development. Some experts
caution, however, that the program might not offer
developers as much control over their Web sites as
they would like. If you are looking for a beginners’
tool that offers a bit more sophistication, you might
consider Microsoft’s FrontPage, which received a PC
Magazine Editors’ Choice award in 2001. ‘‘If you
wish, FrontPage can do everything for you via its
wealth of prefab designs. Or you can use the familiar
Office-like tools to create your own look. FrontPage’s
one-click publishing, easy access to HTML code, dis-
cussion boards, image galleries, database connections,
and other extras will tickle many a Web builder’s
fancy,’’ according to the magazine.
Depending on your needs, you may decide to opt
for even less expensive Web authoring software. The
CoffeeCup HTML editor, which costs $49, offers
many of the same features as a program like Fusion
at half the cost. Some experts assert that you don’t
necessarily need additional software to build a basic
Web site. Many leading word processing programs,
such as Microsoft Word, include templates for Web
pages. Be aware, however, that if you choose a more
limited HTML editing program, you may need to add
additional tools, such as Adobe LiveMotion or Sonic
Foundry Stream Anywhere, if you plan to add extras
to your site at some point.
EDUCATION OPTIONS
To learn more about Web page construction before
deciding upon authoring software, you can visit sites
like Builder.com and WebMonkey.com. Both offer ex-
tensive Web authoring resources, including various
tutorials. Builder.com includes an HTML primer and
sections
dubbed
‘‘Web
Building
Essentials,’’
‘‘Graphics 101,’’ and ‘‘Streaming Media 101’’ in the
authoring and site design section of its how-to library.
WebMonkey.com also offers a how-to library with
various sections including authoring (which covers
HTML basics), tables, frames, browsers, style sheets,
and tools.
If you are planning to use authoring software to
design your own site, check with your hosting com-
pany to see which operating systems its servers sup-
port. Incompatibility can pose problems. For example,
Linux-based servers may not support some features
of the Windows-based Microsoft FrontPage authoring
package. Also, keep your potential future needs in
mind. While you don’t want to spend more money
than you need to on authoring software (particularly
if you end up getting a complex program with which
you are uncomfortable working), it will be in your
best interests to use an authoring system that allows
for expansion and enhancements.

BANDWIDTH MANAGEMENT
Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can
be transferred over a communication channel in a

specific amount of time. While bandwidth is most
commonly associated with the time it takes to load a
Web page, bandwidth also refers to the time in which
other transactions, such as opening a word processing
program on a personal computer, are completed. For
digital devices, such as high-speed cable modems,
transmission speed is expressed in bits per second
(bps); for analog devices such as microprocessors and
analog modems, transmission speed is expressed in
cycles per second, or hertz (hz).
Bandwidth management is simply the process of
optimizing bandwidth to improve efficiency. When
bandwidth is inadequate for the function being per-
formed, such as loading a Web page or transferring
a large file across a network, the slowdown that occurs
is called a bottleneck. To avoid these bottlenecks,
network operators use bandwidth management tools,
which are also known as traffic or packet shapers.
Among other things, these tools allow network manag-
ers to allocate more bandwidth for important elec-
tronic applications, such as e-commerce transactions,
by labeling them as high-priority functions. Lower
priority functions receive less bandwidth. Since the
mid-1990s, bandwidth management demands have in-
creased significantly as information transferred via
the Internet, as well as via local area networks (LANs),
has grown in both size and diversity.
If you have chosen an Internet Service Provider
(ISP) to host your online business, issues of bandwidth
management will likely be handled by the ISP. The
ability of an ISP to allocate appropriate bandwidth to
your site depends upon the technologies used by the
ISP and the capabilities of the ISP’s network mangers.
When bandwidth management problems arise, ISPs
may either add extra bandwidth to their networks,
considered by many experts a short-term and rather
costly solution, or they might employ various band-
width management tools to control bandwidth alloca-
tion. Along with identifying and prioritizing the pack-
ets that carry information through networks, these
tools allow ISPs to recognize network traffic patterns
and to allocate resources appropriately. For example,
a bandwidth management tool might recognize that
certain Web sites receive higher volumes of traffic
and allocate more bandwidth to those sites.
One of the most popular bandwidth management
tools used by large ISPs is PacketShaper/ISP, devel-
opedbybandwidthmanagementtechnologyfirmPack-
eteerInc.Byclassifyingnetworktrafficbasedonappli-
cation, protocol, subnet, and URL, PacketShaper
allows ISPs to prioritize network requests, allocating
more bandwidth to the tasks deemed most important.

11
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
to prioritize and optimize network bandwidth by con-
trolling the bandwidth allocated to each Web server.
If you are hosting your own Web site, you are
responsible for managing your own bandwidth. Band-
width management issues can arise whether you are
using a Web site to actually sell products online, to
simply advertise products online, or to facilitate gen-
eral business functions, such as file sharing between
employees, communication between employees, and
online
inventory
management.
When
deciding
whether to add bandwidth or to improve the efficiency
of your existing bandwidth, you should consider both
the cost and logistics involved with each option. In
some cases, you may be ready to upgrade from your
analog modem to a broadband connection, such as
DSL (digital subscriber line). While this is typically
quite costly, it does dramatically improve perform-
ance. If you are not ready for such an upgrade, you
can instead opt to enhance your existing bandwidth.
To gain more information about this option, research
the cost, availability, and reliability of various band-
width management tools that will meet your needs.
While most small businesses are unable to afford
sophisticated products like Packeteer’s PacketShaper
and Intel’s Traffic Shaper, various bandwidth manage-
ment tools do exist for online entrepreneurs with lim-
ited resources. For example, Massachusetts-based
Trellix Corp. offers bandwidth management tools, as
well as Web hosting services, to small businesses. In
addition, SpiderSoftware, located in British Columbia,
Canada, has developed SpiderCache Lite, a product
that helps boost Web server capacity and reduce the
time it takes for Web pages to load, for small to
medium-sized businesses. Also, California-based Sy-
gate Technologies Inc. offers the Sygate Office Net-
work, which allows clients to boost bandwidth by
using multiple modems or by upgrading to broadband
technology. In some cases, software companies sell
bandwidth management tools separately, and in other
cases, they offer them only as part of a Web hosting
or electronic business services suite.
If you’re looking to prepare yourself for future
bandwidth demands, you might consider investing in
fixed wireless (Wi-Fi) technology. According to Mike
Hogan in the March 2002 issue of Entrepreneur, ‘‘the
service best suited to entrepreneurs is the relatively
new 802.11b technology. The same 2.4GHz Wi-Fi
protocol that delivers 10Mbps worth of LAN band-
width indoors can transfer data up to 1.5Mbps for 10
miles between an ISP’s transceiver and your own
antenna.’’ As of March 2000, roughly 600 wireless
ISP’s offered 802.11b services in 2,670 markets across
the United States.

BRICKS-AND-CLICKS VERSUS PURE
PLAY E-COMMERCE
The concept of bricks-and-clicks (B & C) was
developed in the late 1990s, when dot.com hysteria
was at its peak. During this time, the dot.com hype
was so enormous that traditional firms felt threatened
by the new way of doing business.
In response, brick-and-mortar (traditional) busi-
nesses, searched for and found an effective way to
combat the threat. They developed an in-between busi-
ness model that wouldn’t drastically change their busi-
ness operations. Imagine a spectrum: on one end of the
spectrum is the traditional brick-and-mortar business
model, on the other end is the pure cyber-business
model, and in the middle are various degrees of these
two combinations. This middle ground constitutes the
bricks-and-clicks model.
MAIN ADVANTAGES OF A HYBRID
BUSINESS MODEL?
A hybrid-business model has important advantages
over a pure play e-commerce model. For the most
part, a traditional business has already established its
operating model and a base of customers—as well as
operating revenues. These elements are critical to the
success of any business. Case in point, most dot.com
failures occurred during the early stages of their life
cycles, when they were trying to establish a customer
base substantial enough to generate operating profits.
Traditional businesses that have been around for
some time establish recognition and branding, both
of which are very important to the sustainability of
any business. These are major elements in influencing
the customer’s decision to purchase a product from
someone they recognize and trust.
Various studies on online shopping indicate that
among Internet users, the majority first find informa-
tion, then comparison shop, and finally go to the store
to make the actual purchase. This is true mostly for
first-time buyers and high-ticket items. It is reasonable
to assume that there will always be those who use the
Internet to shop and then visit the store to ‘‘see and
touch’’ the actual product. A B & C business can
utilize both channels to drive sales and to mutually
reinforce each other.
While pure play e-commerce firms enjoy lower
barriers to entry, they have few assets or brand recog-
noition to leverage en route to building their opera-
tions, rendering them largely dependent on venture
capital through the often-lengthy process of getting
the firms on their feet and independently profitable.
The fickleness of the stock market and venture capital
markets in the early 2000s are testimony to the dangers
in relying too heavily on this route.
Finally, the National Retail Federation released a
study in the fall of 2000 reporting that customers
shopping via multiple channels spent more money
than did customers shopping through just a single
channel. Clearly, then, as time goes on and Internet
models mature, there were definite advantages to
achieving some kind of convergence between the
pure-play model and the brick-and-mortar model.
MAKING THE MOST OF BRICKS-AND-
CLICKS
Bricks-and-clicks firms can also leverage existing
supply chains, rather than building new ones from
scratch. On the other hand, this advantage has a few
pitfalls. In particular, as companies begin to open their
existing businesses to new online sales channels, there
exists the danger of cannibalization, where the newer
operations eat into existing ones rather than working in
concert with them. And existing distribution channels
will actively resist any new channels that seem to
threaten their business or relationships with the firm.
Another challenge to the brick-and-click firm is to
achieve the maximum degree of symbiosis between
their online and physical storefronts and strategies. To
avoid cannibalization, your brick-and-click company
needs to go to great lengths to provide a consistent
shopping experience at all their channels, which is
achieved through effective and flexible branding strat-
egies. Customer service needs to be similarly consist-
ent and integrated, bringing all systems into harmony
with each other so that, for the customer, dealing with
your firm is seamless whether online, at a storefront,
or moving back and for the between the two.
CHOOSING THE CORRECT BUSINESS
MODEL FOR MY VENTURE
Despite all these advantages, the precise placement
of your business along the pure-play/hybrid/bricks-
and-mortar spectrum is, in the end, a decision that

you must make according to your specific needs and
desires and the particular conditions of your market.
To determine the right business model for your enter-
prise, you must first define your vision, then develop
a strategy allowing you to leverage the elements in
which you can excel.
To determine where on this spectrum you should
place your business, begin by determining what kinds
of resources you have at your disposal, what products
and services you plan to sell, and what kind of
model—traditional, pure play, or hybrid—will most
suit the needs of your target customer base.

BUSINESS PLANNING FOR ONLINE
ENTERPRISE
One of the central questions on the minds of many
business analysts is simple, yet of extreme importance:
how could so many online businesses (dot.com’s)
have failed? Is it possible that the failures were the
result of poor planning or, perhaps, unqualified man-
agement? Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to
these questions. The truth is that there are many rea-
sons why so many online businesses failed during the
early 2000s.
Nevertheless, there is one element that has contrib-
uted to such failures more than any other. That element
is poor planning, or, more precisely, lack of solid e-
business strategic planning. In many cases, online
13
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
enterprises were built on the same planning foundation
as traditional businesses, and, as history shows, these
enterprises were unable to continue operation.
The issue of proper and valid planning for an online
enterprise is of utmost importance in the process of
online enterprise development. Remember that your
planning stage is like a foundation of a building. If
it is not sound and solid, everything that you will
build on top of it will always be shaky and will likely
collapse once it is subject to volatile and quaking
market forces.
ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCES
For the most part, a business is a business, and the
ultimate objective of any business is to be profitable.
Nevertheless, there are some major differences be-
tween conventional business plans and online busi-
ness plans.
The first thing to remember is that the same rules
of sound business—profitability, controlled expenses,
marketing, and product or service usefulness—apply
to the online environment just as they do to in a
traditional setting. Yet, there are a few areas where
additional planning and considerations have to take
place.
THE CONNECTED ECONOMY
There are three primary elements that distinguish
the traditional economy from the connected economy.
These three elements are connectivity, interactivity,
and speed. Everything else is essentially the same
in both environments. For example, if you consider
Ebay.com’s business model, there is nothing truly new
about it. Auctions have been around for hundreds of
years. What makes Ebay.com’s business plan specific
to the e-commerce marketplace, however, is its ability
to leverage connectivity, interactivity, and speed for
connecting buyers and sellers all over the world.
CONNECTIVITY. Connectivity is the ability to connect
interested parties. In the traditional economy, connec-
tivity was limited to the physical size of the place of
business, or to its distribution reach. In the connected
economy, there is no such limit. Anyone can become a
participant as long as they have access to the Internet.
INTERACTIVITY. Interactivity is the ability to interact
directly with the source in real time. For example,
when you are watching TV, you are experiencing a
non-interactive media (one way communication) be-
cause you do not have the ability to interact with the
source. On the other hand, when you read or watch
the news online, you can interact with the source by
voicing your opinion, or by searching for additional
information on your topic of interest.

G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
SPEED. Speed is an important part of the connected
economy because it allows parties to communicate
and interact in real time. For example, when reading
a newspaper, you are reading information that was
complied many hours ago. The speed in which the
information flows from the reporters to the press and
to the newsstand is very slow. On the other hand, you
can view up-to-the minute news online with hardly
any delay.
INCORPORATING THESE ELEMENTS INTO
YOUR BUSINESS PLANS
Interactivity, connectivity and speed are part of the
early stages of your business plan. You should always
start your online business plan with a phase called
‘‘vision.’’ The vision phase contains three elements:
T
Desire: This is where you define the need and
value for the proposed product or services that you
are planning on providing online.
T
Drivers: In this category, you need to outline how
you are going to leverage the properties of connec-
tivity, interactivity, and speed to operate your new
enterprise. For example, if you are planning on
selling sunglasses online, you need to define how
your customers will interact with your site (i.e.
order, ask questions, see pictures of the product
etc.), as well as how you are going to interact
with suppliers and delivery entities. For an online
business, this section of you plan should be given
a lot of thought, and should be fully developed
before you continue to develop the other compo-
nents of your plan.
T
Landscape: The third and last component of the
vision phase of your plan is the landscape. In this
section you need to outline some of the research
that you have conducted on your competition.
Once you have done that, you need to analyze
your competition and find out where their weak-
nesses are, and how you can take advantage of
those weaknesses to develop a competitive advan-
tage. Once you have developed your competitive
advantage, and completed all the other components
of the vision phase, you may continue to further
develop your online business plan by defining your
operations, marketing and financial parts of your
plan.
PLANNING STRATEGIES
The best place to start planning for your online
enterprise is with a valid strategic plan. A strategic
plan is somewhat different from a business plan in
that it is shorter and puts more emphasis on your
vision rather than on your operations. Remember that
if your operational plans are perfect, you may find
your new business going in the wrong direction if
you have not fully developed and validated your vision
phase.

BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS EXCHANGE
(B2B)
B2B exchanges are one example of how the In-
ternet has affected corporate buying and selling prac-
tices and changed the way sellers interact with buyers.
At the beginning of 2000, public marketplaces (includ-
ing industry-sponsored marketplaces, or ISMs, and
independent exchanges) appeared to be the most
promising model for B2B exchanges. However, by
mid-2001, public marketplaces had lost favor to pri-
vate exchanges, also known as private hubs or market-
places. Private exchanges were created by companies
for their suppliers and trading partners. They allowed
corporate buyers to collaborate better with their part-
ners, including high-volume trading partners as well
as small and medium-size suppliers. Private ex-
changes also offered more security for online transac-
tions. The main benefit, though, was cost savings.
PUBLIC B2B MARKETPLACES
There are two types of public B2B marketplaces:
industry-sponsored marketplaces (ISMs), also known
as consortia-led marketplaces, and independent or
third-party marketplaces. ISMs are formed by a group
of companies within an industry, many of whom are
competitors. Independent marketplaces, on the other
hand, do not involve collaboration among industry
competitors. They are typically owned and operated
by a B2B startup company that is not a trading partner
with the exchange. Although most B2B marketplaces
are focused on vertical industries, some are set up to
facilitate transactions among a diverse group of buyers
and sellers.

Ariba’s Commerce Services Network offered a
marketplace of nearly 10,000 suppliers in mid-2001.
Those suppliers were directly connected to Ariba’s
network and had established some 5,000 unique
buyer-supplier relationships. These included buyers
and suppliers that had integrated their systems into
each other’s networks as well as suppliers that had
become preferred vendors for a particular company.
According to Jupiter Media Metrix, 58 B2B ISMs
were launched in 2000. Examples include Covisint
(auto industry), Aerospan (aerospace industry), and
Worldwide Retail Exchange (retail industry). Advan-
tages of ISMs over independent marketplaces include
backing by large corporate sponsors, built-in talent,
and transaction liquidity.
ISMs require industry competitors to become col-
laborators. Since they are formed through alliances by
competing companies, ISMs need to obtain regulatory
approval from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
and, in some cases, international regulatory agencies.
Covisint, for example, was formed in 2000 by auto-
makers General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.,
DaimlerChrysler AG, Renault SA, and Nissan. Its
technology partners were Commerce One Inc., and
Oracle. The FTC’s approval of Covisint was condi-
tional, since the agency was unable to determine if it
would cause any competitive concerns.
PRIVATE EXCHANGES
By mid-2001 private exchanges were more popular
in the B2B sector than public marketplaces. They
offered participating companies the chance to save as
much as 10 percent of their cost of sales within three
years, according to Forrester Research.
The cost of building a private exchange could range
from $6.8 million to $53 million, according to a mid-
2001 report from Forrester Research cited in CRMDai-
ly.com. Forrester recommended that companies con-
sidering building a private hub should also consider
the alternatives, such as EDI (electronic data inter-
change), an extranet that connects the firm’s legacy
system to its business partners, or a public market-
place.
Another mid-2001 study by AMR Research esti-
mated that building a private exchange could cost a
Fortune 500 company anywhere from $50 million to
$100 million. Such an exchange would include a sup-
ply chain hub as well as external systems linking
the company to its customers and other key trading
partners.
Private exchanges may be constructed on different
models. A private exchange that concentrates on pro-
curement, for example, would help a company aggre-
gate its purchasing across several different categories.
15
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
Suppliers would be expected to provide volume dis-
counts. Another model focusing on streamlining sup-
ply chain operations would include a vendor-managed
inventory system. Private exchanges can also focus on
product development, where buyers shift their design
activities with suppliers into a private hub.
Each model has its own benefits. A private ex-
change concentrating on procurement can result in
material savings. One that focuses on supply chain
operations can save on inventory expense, while a
product development-focused private exchange can
reduce the R&D budget.
A May 2001 report by Jupiter Media Metrix fore-
cast that more firms would use private trading net-
works (PTNs), or private exchanges, for collaboration
rather than sales over the next 12 months. The survey
of more than 400 purchasing managers at U.S. compa-
nies with revenue greater than $500 million found
that PTNs represented a new tool to link the interests
of buyers, suppliers, and distribution partners. Among
the collaborative online activities that PTNs were ex-
pected to facilitate were inventory level monitoring
and product design. The purchasing executives cited
closer relationships with their suppliers as the primary
benefit of PTNs, while faster time to market and closer
links to channel partners were also important consider-
ations. Only 20 percent of those surveyed said they
would concentrate on procurement applications.
THE COST OF PARTICIPATING IN
ONLINE MARKETPLACES
Integrating into B2B marketplaces could cost firms
between $5.4 million and $22.9 million, according to
a March 2001 report from Forrester Research. While
that would result in big business for technology pro-
viders, it also put a lot of pressure on the marketplaces
to deliver cost savings. Companies seeking to gain the
benefits of lower prices and a streamlined purchasing
process through B2B marketplaces would be required
to make a significant up-front investment. They would
need to spend money on changing internal procure-
ment systems, integrating electronic marketplaces into
their internal systems, purchasing B2B applications,
and paying transaction fees associated with the mar-
ketplaces.
Companies would spend different amounts de-
pending on what they sought to gain from participating
in the online marketplaces. According to Forrester
Research, corporate buyers seeking to trim transaction
costs associated with maintenance, repair, and opera-
tions purchases would spend an average of $5.6 mil-
lion on transaction fees, integration software, and in-
ternal staffing. On the other hand, companies that
wanted to make spot purchases of materials to help
manage inventory and avoid shortfalls would spend

S O U R C E B O O K
an average of $10.7 million on new software installa-
tion and related consultant fees. A third type of com-
pany that intended to use the B2B marketplace to
manage all of its purchasing would spend an average
of $22.9 million on consultants to implement its elec-
tronic marketplace strategy.
MARKET FOR B2B EXCHANGES
At the beginning of 2001, Jupiter Media Metrix
forecast that international spending on B2B online
marketplaces would grow from $2.6 billion in 2000
to $137.5 billion by 2005. While North American
companies accounted for 81 percent of total spending
in 2000, that percentage was projected to drop to
60 percent of the total by 2005. Spending by North
American companies on B2B marketplaces was fore-
cast to increase from $2.1 billion in 2000 to $80.9
billion in 2005.
During an economic slowdown, B2B electronic
marketplaces offered such benefits as shortened prod-
uct development cycles, collaboration, and lower
product costs, according to Jupiter Media Metrix. The
company surveyed executives at more than 90 market-
places and found that they were implementing or plan-
ning to implement several new features. These in-
cluded trading systems and marketing systems. Other
features being added to B2B marketplaces were cus-
tomer relationship management (CRM) components,
electronic bill presentation and payment services, cata-
log management, and inventory management.
Another study by the Boston Consulting Group,
released in the fourth quarter of 2000, found that the
greatest benefits of B2B exchanges were in the area
of increased productivity rather than higher revenue.
The study forecast that B2B exchanges would grow
rapidly but would not generate significantly higher
revenue. Rather, the benefits to buyers and sellers
would lie in increased productivity, with gains equiva-
lent to 1 to 2 percent of sales. The study also predicted
that many of the 700 B2B marketplaces then in exis-
tence would find it difficult to survive, with specific
industry segments being able to support only one to
three major marketplaces.
OUTLOOK FOR B2B MARKETPLACES
A mid-2001 study of B2B marketplaces by Jupiter
Media Metrix noted that many B2B buyers were reluc-
tant to move online and would remain hesitant until
late 2002. Rather than focusing on building transac-
tions, the study found, B2B exchanges should add
services that would improve productivity, such as col-
laborative product design and supply-chain inventory
management.
The evolution of public marketplaces from a trans-
action-based model to one that offered technology and
services was noted by eMarketer, which tracked the
development of five leading independent B2B ex-
changes from the beginning of 2001 to the beginning
of 2002. All five—Altra Market Place (commodity-
based trade), Citadon (engineering and building indus-
try), eMerge Interactive (cattle), MetalSite (steel trad-
ing), and SciQuest (life sciences)—had shifted their
emphasis from a transaction-based business model to
becoming technology vendors and service providers.
Some were beginning to offer software and services
to facilitate the development of private exchanges
among their members. The challenge for the evolving
B2B exchanges was not only to convince customers
of the potential value of their technology offerings
but also to help users adapt to the new systems. A
late 2001 study by Giga Information Group and Booz
Allen Hamilton found that one in two companies sur-
veyed complained that the technology of B2B market-
places was not mature enough to allow them to get
online and become operational in a short time.
Meanwhile, private exchanges had become the pre-
ferred model by the end of 2001. IBM predicted that
there would be some 3,120 online B2B exchanges by
2003, according to eMarketer. Nearly all of those
exchanges would be privately run or operated by large
enterprises. IBM estimated there would be more than
1,400 large enterprises involved in the construction
of B2B exchanges and that they would serve a market
of 2 million small and medium-sized enterprises.
Public exchanges were expected to evolve into
supplier gateways to private exchanges, and they
would also facilitate the setting of technology stan-
dards for their industries. On the other hand, there
would be two types of private exchanges. One type
would connect a large enterprise with its several small
and medium-size business partners, while the other
type would link two high-volume trading partners in
a one-to-one connection. While private exchanges
would offer more customized and tightly integrated
supply chain connections, eMarketer noted that many
companies were just beginning to make preparations
for the build-out of these external networks.

BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER (B2C)
EXCHANGE
Business-to-consumer (B2C) exchanges are en-
gaged in the process of electronic retailing, also known
as e-tailing. Basically, a B2C business is one that
sells goods and services to consumers via the Internet.
Many bricks-and-mortar firms—like housewares re-
tailer Bed, Bath, and Beyond and book retailer Bor-
ders—sell merchandise from their B2C Web sites as
well as via traditional retail outlets. Other companies,
like online retailing giant Amazon.com, are known as
pure-play Internet businesses because they rely exclu-
sively on Internet sales.
Founded in July 1995, Amazon.com was one of
the first viable B2C exchanges. Because the B2C
model was relatively new then, Amazon had no choice
but to develop its own technology and manage its
own site. To attract customers, the firm offered low
17
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
prices and free shipping. Like many other B2C busi-
nesses launched in the mid- and late 1990s, the firm
was much more focused on securing a wide base of
customers than on earning a profit. As online shopping
became more popular, established technology firms
like IBM Corp. developed e-commerce services and
began offering to build and even oversee sites for
companies wanting to launch a B2C exchange. At the
same time, a slew of e-commerce upstarts such as
Scient Corp. began offering similar services. Along
with merchandise like books, CDs, and computer soft-
ware and hardware, B2C exchanges began to sell
clothes, cosmetics, perfume, plants, toys, and other
types of merchandise in the late 1990s.
Many analysts questioned the viability of B2C
businesses in the late 1990s after several e-tailing
problems gained national attention. For example, Toy-
srus.com was unable to handle an unexpected rush of
orders during the 1999 holiday shopping season and
failed to deliver shipments by Christmas day that year.
Consumer confidence in online sales dipped, prompt-
ing speculation about the dim future of B2C ex-
changes. However, the B2C model continued to
evolve as issues such as the security of online credit
card payments were resolved by advances in tech-
nology.
A multitude of B2C exchanges went bankrupt in
2000 and 2001 as investors, increasingly concerned
about profitability, proved reluctant to continue fund-
ing unprofitable dot-com businesses. As a result, only
the most solid B2C businesses remained operational.
Even those based on ideas that appeared promising,
such as online grocer Webvan Group, found them-
selves unable to stay afloat when they could not satisfy
investors’ demands for a business model that had
already produced profits or would produce profits in
the very near future. In the case of Webvan, many
analysts agree that the firm, in its quest to secure as
many customers as possible, expanded too rapidly
into other goods before stabilizing its core grocery
delivery operations. Founded in 1999, Webvan was
supposed to evolve into a vast delivery service that
handled all types of online orders. Founder Louis
Borders decided to start with groceries, launching op-
erations in San Francisco, California. Visitors to Web-
van’s Web site could select the items they wished to
purchase and place them into an electronic shopping
cart. To complete a purchase, shoppers were asked to
select a 30-minute window in which the groceries
would be delivered. According to many industry ex-
perts, the upstart made several sound marketing and
customer service decisions. For example, to draw re-
peat business and to encourage larger orders, Webvan
offered free delivery for orders over $50. Also, cus-
tomers with questions about their orders could call a
toll-free customer service line. As a result, within
six months, Webvan had managed to reach 47,000

customers in a single market, compared to the 110,000
clients secured by its largest competitor, Peapod,
which had operations in eight markets.
However, despite the firm’s impressive growth, its
continued losses began to concern investors in 2000.
Rather than curb spending and focus its efforts on
minimizing losses, Webvan launched new operations
in Dallas, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia. The firm also
developed a new logo and branding strategy and rede-
signed its Web site, which was organized into eleven
product categories. The changes were designed to
communicate Webvan’s determination to become a
leading force in online distribution of all kinds. How-
ever, many critics believed that the money and time
would have been better spent on developing Webvan’s
original brand, which had yet to be fully developed.
According to a July 2001 article in The Industry Stan-
dard, ‘‘Webvan was so intent on meeting its long-
term goal of building a behemoth that could deliver
anything to anyone anywhere that it lost sight of a
more mundane task: pleasing grocery customers day
after day. In the process, it jeopardized the shorter-
term goal of being a modest but profitable online
supermarket.’’ In July 2001, Webvan declared bank-
ruptcy.
Failures like Webvan offer lessons for entrepre-
neurs planning to develop a B2C exchange. First and
foremost is the lesson that securing a large base of
customers is not more important than creating a profit-
able business. In fact, entrepreneurs in the early 2000s
found it increasingly difficult to securing funding of
any sort for a business plan that did not detail exactly
how and when a company would begin earning a
profit. Also important is deciding who your customers
are and developing a close relationship with them. A
May 2002 issue of Entrepreneur details additional
strategies entrepreneurs should consider when plan-
ning to create their own B2C exchange. One tactic is
to decide if you can be profitable and still offer a
lower price than rivals. Buy.com, an electronics and
computer hardware and software e-tailer is successful
because it offers a wide range of products at arguably
the lowest prices available. Also, if you are planning
to sell some sort of specialty item, offer specialized
content and services as well, as does Igourmet, which
is ‘‘more than a place to buy gourmet food-it’s a
gourmet food authority. While shopping, customers
are treated to large product pictures and descriptive
information about each item for sale.’’ The gourmet
foods business also invests considerable resources in
shipping its perishable items and offers a 100 percent
satisfaction guarantee that can be redeemed within
five days of receiving an order.
Although the uncertain economic conditions of the
early 2000s appeared daunting to many online entre-
preneurs, the myriad of dot-com failures during those
years did help solidify some specific ‘‘dos and don’ts’’
for those wanting to launch a B2C business. One of
your best bets for creating a successful B2C exchange
is to examine carefully the successes and failures of
other B2C businesses.

BUSINESS-TO-GOVERNMENT (B2G)
E-COMMERCE
When you consider launching an e-commerce en-
terprise, there are several client models to choose
from. The best publicized are business-to-consumer
(B2C) and business-to-business (B2B). But govern-
ment, at the local, state, and federal levels, is also a
rapidly emerging client base for companies offering
products and services through an electronic business.
While governments at all these levels have been slow
to adopt e-commerce strategies relative to enterprises
in the private sector, the early 2000s saw public agen-
cies reorganizing to take advantage of e-commerce in
order to streamline their practices and provide better
service to their citizenry. As a result, a tempting new
market for e-commerce entrepreneurs has emerged.
AN OPENING MARKET
According the research firm Gartner Group, gov-
ernment expenditures on information technology for
e-government was expected to quadruple in the first
half the 2000s, reaching $6.5 billion by 2005. Some
85 percent of all government agencies were actively
planning e-procurement implementation in the early
2000s,
signaling
that
governments
increasingly
planned to buy their goods and services of the Internet.
In terms of sheer market volume, then, the business-to-
government model poses enormous earning potential.
Moreover, while the bulk of this increase stems from
governments overhauling to become viable for e-gov-
ernment operations, businesses that begin developing

relationships with governments during this rapid
expansion and transformation period may eke out a
competitive advantage over the long run by generating
lasting business in the B2G sector.
The B2G market was greatly aided by the Govern-
ment Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires fed-
eral agencies to move to electronic forms by 2003,
and which signaled government’s commitment to
electronically based services and communications
with their citizens and with each other. In addition,
agencies at all levels of government increasingly em-
ploy a chief information officer, a role implemented
specifically, in most cases, for leading the transition
to e-government operations. Often such officers deal
with e-commerce providers directly, and it is likely
to be the same group you proposition and target in
your advertising and marketing schemes.
Depending on the size and capabilities of your e-
commerce firm, you may choose to specifically target
governments or agencies at the federal, state, or local
level. To be sure, the opportunities are prevalent at any
level of government. At each level, officials express
interest in developing greater electronic communica-
tion with their constituents, via e-procurement, Web
portals, e-payments, and other government-to-citizen
applications.
One area of opportunity is in the e-solutions mar-
ket, as governments seek out help from private-sector
solutions providers to help them speed up and smooth
their transitions to e-government services. A wide
assortment of e-solutions is in demand in the public
sector. The most immediate demand is for e-procure-
ment infrastructure software and services while gov-
ernment agencies transform themselves into e-govern-
ment organizations. But, with the experiences of the
private sector to learn from, most government agen-
cies will likely choose a more holistic approach to
developing their new IT systems and processes, and
thus will require a range of services, including every-
thing from Web site design and management and back-
end set-up services to Internet security and systems
integration.
Once you’ve decided to jump into the B2G fray,
the next step is figuring out how to sell to govern-
ments. One of the most successful marketing schemes
in the early 2000s was creating Web-based B2G online
marketplaces, similar to B2B exchanges but focused
specifically around the products and services catering
to government agencies. Either developing or joining
one of these exchanges will put you in touch with a
larger community of vendors and government agen-
cies, allowing you to find customers through an estab-
lished network, discover and focus your services to-
ward government needs via online forums and other
communication channels, and find other businesses
for potential strategic alliances in the B2G field.

Federal purchases are frequently made with the
SmartPay small-purchase credit card, and so to attract
customers in the public sector, you need to advertise
yourself as familiar with and capable of accepting the
card electronically. You can download the SmartPay
logo to advertise on your site from the federal govern-
ment’s General Services Administration Web site.
CHALLENGES
However, working with governments poses some
challenges. For one, sales margins tend to hover at 5-
15 percent lower, on average, than those in the private
sector, according to a report in Computer Reseller
News. Still, the ability to carve out a viable and lasting
niche in this booming market can allow you to make
up for any lower margins. In addition, the buying
process in government tends to be drawn-out com-
pared with the private sector, requiring several layers
of approval and rigid procedures for submitting and
accepting bids. Such formalities add time to the pro-
cess of securing contracts.
Finally, the transition to e-government carries with
it greater pressures for governments compared with
commercial enterprises in the form of regulations as
well as the sensitivity toward ‘‘consumer’’ tastes and
rights. The protection of citizens’ privacy and other
security and regulatory concerns are particularly pro-
nounced in the public sector, and thus government
agencies will likely proceed with some trepidation,
so as to avoid wasting money on systems that need
to be overhauled down the road.

CALL CENTER SERVICES
Call centers are essentially customer service cen-
ters that field all types of calls, from requests for
additional information about a product or service to
customer complaints. Some call centers are developed
and operated by the companies they serve. For exam-
ple, Continental Airlines operates five call centers,
each housing roughly 3,500 agents. Other call centers
are set up to offer call center services to a variety of
different enterprises. Although a telephone call re-
mains the most common method of contacting a call
center, in many cases customers are also able to use
e-mail and other Internet technologies to speak with
call center representatives.
Advances in technology have allowed call centers
to offer increasingly sophisticated services. De-
pending on how much your business can afford to
spend on call center services, you might be able to
use skill-based routing to connect your customers with
the individuals most qualified to handle their request;
record calls; allow call center representatives to access
and modify your existing customer database; and
make use of interactive voice technology to allow
callers to select various options without having to
push the numbers on their telephone key pad.
The rise of e-commerce since the mid-1990s has
had a dramatic impact on call center services, not only
changing how call centers interact with customers but
also broadening the range of services that a call center
can provide. A dramatic rise in business conducted
via the Web eventually spawned the development of
Web-enabled call centers, which offer consumers both
telephone and online service. Many businesses have
connected their call centers to their Web sites to pro-
vide more immediate customer service options to Web
surfers. Enhanced services include instant chat, which
allows online customers instantaneous access to a ser-
vice representative via a text-based communications
program. Some Web-enabled call centers also offer
Web call-back, a feature that allows consumers to
click on a specific button on a Web site if they wish
to have a customer service representative call them via
telephone in the next few minutes. Another innovative
service, interactive voice response (IVR), allows on-
line customers with a PC-based microphone to actu-
ally speak to a service representative over the Web;
in some cases, video technology enables these clients
to see the representative with whom they are in con-
tact. Although it is less immediate, Web-based call
center services also typically offer e-mail as a commu-
nication medium.
The need for improved online customer service
stemmed from the fact that many online businesses
saw potential customers abandoning their purchases
before completing a transaction due to the limited
availability of service online. In some cases, even if
the answer to a question about a product or service
was located on the Web site (in many cases in a
prominent section dubbed ‘‘Frequently Asked Ques-
tions’’), customers still chose to abandon the purchase
rather than sift through information. Many businesses
believed that offering advanced call center services
on their Web sites could help turn these lost sales into
profits. According to an April 2001 issue of Informa-
tionweek.com, ‘‘The ability of Web-enabled call cen-
ters to enhance customer service and to close sales
more quickly isn’t only appealing, it can be crucial
to the bottom line. Call center agents who use e-mail,
instant chat, and Web collaboration to interact with
customers are able to more quickly and completely
handle questions and resolve problems.’’ A Forrester
Research study cited in the article predicts that Web
sites and e-mail will each account for more than 17
percent of a typical company’s communication with
customers by the end of 2002.
Many small businesses offer informal call center
services, which essentially means that employees re-
sponsible for a variety of tasks also answer the phone.
If your business requires more formal call center ser-
vices, particularly Web-enabled ones, you might de-
cide to purchase call center services from an outside
source. Such a decision does raise issues of staffing,
training, and quality control, as you will lose some
degree of control over what you may believe is the
most crucial aspect of your business, customer service.
However, outsourcing may also give you access to
more sophisticated technology than you might other-
wise be able to afford. In 2000, the cost of infrastruc-
ture for most integrated call centers—estimated at
roughly $90,000 for a 20-agent center ($4,500 per
agent), not including integration and implementation
costs—was well beyond the reach of many small
business.
Technology firms hoping to target small and mid-
sized companies began to develop less expensive op-
tions in the early 2000s. For example, in 2001 AT&
T Corp. and Qwest Communications both began work-
ing to develop network-based call centers that would
allow small businesses to tie into an existing call
center network, eliminating the need to purchase new
equipment. Via this type of structure, calls that come
in to a networked call center, either by telephone or
by a link from a company’s Web site, are first sent
to a network server and then routed to a specific call
center that can handle the request. In 2002, call center
technology specialist Rockwell introduced FirstPoint
Business Edition, a Web-enabled call center solution
for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), at a

price of $1625 per user. According to a May 2002
article in Call Center Magazine, ‘‘the tool is powerful,
more powerful than an SMB could have hoped for at
$1600 a seat just a few years ago.’’
Gartner Group estimates that small and medium-
sized business will account for roughly 88 percent
of the call center marketplace by 2005. As a result,
technology firms will likely continue to develop new
call center services designed specifically for smaller
enterprises. Therefore, your best bet for obtaining the
call center services best suited to your business is
researching the most current options available.

CONSUMER PRIVACY ISSUES
Online privacy, both real and perceived, is a critical
factor to popular acceptance of e-commerce by con-
sumers. The theft of information such as credit card,
social security, and bank account numbers can have
dire, lasting consequences for the victim. These conse-
quences include nuisances such as unsolicited com-
mercial email (spam), junk mail, and unsolicited
phone calls from telemarketers as well as identity
theft, which can destroy an individual’s reputation
and cost him or her thousands of dollars. Unless users
are confident that their sensitive personal information
is secure from prying eyes, they will be reluctant to
make purchases over the Internet. Consumers also
hesitate if they believe e-merchants are likely to sell
their personal information to other businesses without
their knowledge. Hence it is important that online
businesses take steps to safeguard the privacy of their
customers.
What precisely constitutes an online invasion of
privacy differs greatly from person to person. Some
individuals do not object to having their browsing
behavior tracked and used for targeted marketing;
some can tolerate a mail box full of spam; others object
to any information being collected and exchanged
without their permission. Unfortunately for privacy
21

lovers, the Internet is—almost by definition—an open
system where private information can easily be uncov-
ered, and the very act of going online puts one’s
privacy at risk. Information is routed through numer-
ous computers, all of which can monitor a user’s
activities online and then pass that information to
others. Many Web sites require users to provide per-
sonal information, including name, address, and email
address, on registration forms before they are allowed
to enter.
Most commercial sites also use cookies, tiny text
files placed on users’ hard drives—usually without
their knowledge or approval—when a site is visited.
In their most benign use, cookies enable Web busi-
nesses to monitor users’ visits to their sites, remember
their identities, simplify signing in and the completion
of forms, etc. More nefariously, however, cookies
enable Web sites to track a user’s general activity
online. The information can then be used to send ads,
and occasionally spam and junk mail as well, based
on a user’s personal interests. Most seriously, cookies
provide a record of a Web consumer’s visits to Web
sites that contain sensitive or controversial materials,
such as pornography, drug information, or information
about tax resistance. This is significant in a time when
government agencies such as the FBI and the IRS
have begun buying such records from list brokers.
The greatest fear of online consumers is that credit
card numbers can be stolen. Consumers should shop
only with online merchants who maintain secure Web
sites, which reduce the risk that a hacker or another
third party will obtain information during its transmis-
sion. A secure Web site can be recognized by a closed
padlock at the bottom of the screen or a URL that
begins with https://. Nonetheless, a secure Web site
alone is not sufficient to guarantee that hackers cannot
access consumers’ information. If the e-merchant
stores the information in unencrypted form, it is at
risk from hackers.
Hackers are not the only threat to sensitive informa-
tion. Web site operators sometimes sell information—
even credit card, social security, and bank account
numbers—collected from their users. Most online
businesses have formulated privacy policies covering
the use of information they collect. These policies
vary in thoroughness and are completely voluntary.
There is no guarantee an e-businessperson will adhere
to his or her own policy. Flagrant violations have
occurred. Adherence by Web sites that display the
seal of services such as TRUSTe or BBBOnline, how-
ever, is regularly audited.
Prior notification is a fundamental issue for privacy
advocates. Consumers often do not know how their
personal information is being used by a site. Opt-in
rules are one solution to the problem. Under such
rules, no personal information could be given to third

parties without explicit permission from the consumer.
Online marketing firms, which live from the sale and
use of such information, oppose opt-in policies, main-
taining that they would make Web site use too burden-
some for Internet consumers. One study found that
84 percent of adults would be unlikely to opt in if given
a choice; hence opt-in would likely make targeted
marketing and the compilation of address lists much
more difficult. The alternative is an opt-out policy,
which would allow a Web site to use personal informa-
tion freely until a consumer instructed it not to do so.
Advocates of the rule say opt-out makes for much
more convenience surfing the Internet. Opponents say
that opt-out information is too frequently hidden away
in fine print on an inconspicuous page of a site.
A Forrester Research study conducted in 2001
found that 70 percent of those polled were ‘‘extremely
interested’’ or ‘‘very interested’’ in laws guaranteeing
Internet privacy. At the beginning of 2002, only one
such law was on the books, the Children’s Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 2000, a law that
severely limits information a Web site can request of
a preteen. That year, about 50 privacy bills were before
Congress many of which dealt with Web issues. For
instance, one would prohibit the production and use
of so-called ‘‘spyware’’—software that collects and
distributes information directly from a user’s personal
computer without the permission of consumers; an-
other would direct the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) to develop regulations to protect the privacy
of Internet users.
In February 2002 the European Union took the
first steps toward restricting the use of cookies, a
move unlikely in the United States. The computer and
dot-com industries see such legislation as an overreac-
tion that would introduce unneeded government regu-
lation. They have proposed self-regulation as an alter-
native to legislation. Legal scholars, on the other hand,
believe that effective privacy laws are virtually impos-
sible because they would violate the free speech provi-
sions of the U.S. Constitution. In the meantime, in
early 2002 the FTC began cracking down on the sale
and use of personal information without a consumer’s
consent and on the use of spam. It has also announced
that Web sites must abide by their published privacy
policies.
Privacy is an important consideration for online
businesspeople. Customers routinely abandon shop-
ping carts online rather than give e-merchants personal
information. One report estimated that nearly US$18
billion in online retail sales has been lost due to con-
cerns about privacy. The costs could go even higher:
If government believes that online businesspeople are
unfairly intruding on the privacy of consumers, it
could enact laws or regulations that severely impact
the conduct of e-business. Heavy restrictions, on
cookie use, for example, could deprive Internet busi-
ness of one of its prime advantages over bricks-and-
mortar businesses—the ability to identify and reach
users based on demographic profiles. In the end eager
sellers and suspicious buyers will have to reach some
kind of compromise.

CURRENCY ISSUES IN ELECTRONIC
COMMERCE
E-commerce, with its online stores, virtual shop-
pers, and sometimes even downloadable electronic
23
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
products, introduced a simple but unavoidable ques-
tion: How could payment be digitized as well? Credit
cards seem an obvious answer at first, but they have
problems of their own. They are not cost effective for
small purchases—so-called microtransactions—and
many consumers simply can’t get one. Debit cards
have to be physically swiped through a reader that
few own. Furthermore, purchases made with credit
and debit cards lack the anonymity of cold, hard cash,
which can only be used for online purchases if one
is willing to risk sending it through the mail. Checks
and money orders are difficult to use for international
purchases. If electronic trade is to succeed on a wide-
spread scale, a digital medium of exchange is
needed—a means for paying for things electronically,
an e-currency.
There are three general types of electronic payment
currently in use that online shoppers and businesses
can use in exchange for goods and services. The first
uses a trusted third party as an intermediary for trans-
actions, usually a bank or other financial institution
that holds the bank account numbers, credit card num-
bers, and other sensitive information of the buyer and
seller. Such transactions are electronic only to the
extent that the third party gets instructions via email.
The second type is a form of fund transfer similar to
a credit card purchase. Because sensitive information
is changing hands, the system encrypts all data before
transmission for security. This system is expected to
become popular because the model is familiar to con-
sumers. The third form of electronic payment, still
in development, largely by corporations and central
banks, is e-money.
Electronic money is value reduced to its metaphysi-
cal essence. Unlike credit cards, notational fund trans-
fers, or trusted third parties, e-money is not merely a
transfer of financial information. E-money is money,
pure and simple, like the bills we carry in our purses
and wallets. It can change hands anonymously. It can
be saved, spent, and stolen. A unit of e-money, like
physical banknotes, has a unique serial number, a
denomination, and an issuer that backs the money. All
this information is rendered digitally as a numerical
formula. If someone intercepts the code, that person
has stolen the money. E-money can be stored on a
computer or on a card, similar to some telephone
cards, with a small computer chip.
Obtaining
digital
cash,
under
most
present
schemes, would be very similar to making a with-
drawal from one’s local bank, except everything could
take place online. A customer would request a certain
number of specific denominations, which are gener-
ated by special software. They are placed in an ‘‘elec-
tronic envelope;’’ that is, encrypted to disguise the
serial numbers. The withdrawer ‘‘signs’’ the envelope
using a private encryption key and transmits it to the

so, the bank countersigns the envelope using its en-
cryption key and returns to the customer. The e-cash
can then be spent.
There are two sorts of e-money, distinguished
mainly by the financial trail they leave when spent.
With identified e-money, the identity of the original
user remains bound to the money. As a result the
trail of the currency through the economy can be
reconstructed at any time after it is spent. Anonymous
e-money, like conventional cash, leaves no such trail.
In general, though, the safeguards in place to prevent
copying electronic currency would make it possible
to trace users in case of unlawful duplication. Each
of these two types is in turn divided into online e-
money and offline e-money. The former can only be
used via a computer network and with a bank acting
as intermediary. It is stored in a computer. Transac-
tions with offline e-money do not require a bank’s
intervention; it is stored on cards known as smart cards
or electronic purses. Offline anonymous e-money is
the e-currency that most resembles conventional
money and is sometimes referred to as true digital
cash. The Center for Research in Electronic Com-
merce at the University of Texas at Austin speculates
that the smart card will become the storage medium
of choice for e-cash because the card can also be used
to store other information, such as personal identifica-
tion, house and office keys, and various personal pref-
erence files.
E-cash’s existence as pure information raises an
issue of fundamental importance, known as the double
spending problem. Digital duplication would be sim-
ple, and copies would be indistinguishable from the
original. How can this be prevented? The issue is less
critical with online cash, which is checked against
bank records when it is spent. One way offline e-cash
double spending is controlled is by utilizing tamper-
proof smart cards equipped with special ‘‘Observer’’
chips. Another tactic is to encrypt and track the e-
cash in such a way that the identity of a double-
spender is revealed when the duplicate reaches the
bank. Under such a system, it would seem, all elec-
tronic money usage would be ultimately traceable.
Nonetheless, the use of electronic cash has grown
more slowly than expected. By one estimate the num-
ber of ventures issuing e-cash or something like it
dropped from about thirty in 2001 to only ten a year
later. The most successful system was PayPal, which
established itself as a payment system for online auc-
tions. PayPal proved that in certain e-commerce
cntexts there is a real demand for e-cash. By spring
2002 it had 12 million users in 39 countries. In 2001
it generated about US$8.2 million. Three of the lead-
ing e-money firms, Beenz, Flooz, and CyberCash,
went out of business in 2001. Speculation about rea-
sons varied. Some believed that these systems did not
stick closely enough to known payment models—
notably cash and credit cards—to make consumers
feel comfortable using them. Others noted that, unlike
PayPal, the failed e-cash types were not affiliated with
established financial institutions that would inspire
consumer confidence.
Fraud was another threat. Flooz sold US$300,000
of its currency to international criminals using fradu-
lent credit cards. Even PayPal was victimized by such
a scam, a fact it revealed when it went public in
2001. A potentially critical disadvantage of offline
anonymous electronic currency is that it makes money
laundering easier because it requires no intermediary,
its use is extremely easy, it is completely untraceable,
and laundering can be done from any computer or
cell phone.
What makes for a successful e-currency?
T
It must be widely accepted and used
T
It must easy to use as a medium of exchange
T
Its value must be stable
T
Its value must be backed by a trustworthy insti-
tution
T
It must be easy to access and transport
T
It must not cost merchants that accept it, as credit
cards do The acceptance and spread of digital cash
is intimately bound up with intangibles—the faith
of its users in its value and its ability to retain its
value. A key element of that faith will be the
reliability of the issuers of e-money. Banks or
firms that try to control its use too closely are
unlikely to attract users. The acceptance of an
immaterial novelty like e-currency will also take
time. The transition to a money culture took hun-
dreds of years. However fast the spread and accept-
ance of the Internet, and even of e-commerce, it
is probably foolhardy to expect that consumers or
businesses will easily give up their attachment to
money that they can slip into their pockets or
purses.

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP
MANAGEMENT
Customer relationship management (CRM) refers
specifically to the software that companies use to
manage and track contact with their customers. Com-
ponents of CRM systems include analytic programs
that examine information on buying patterns to im-
prove services and attract new customers, sales force
software, e-mail response applications, and Web-
based customer support, among others.
CRM evolved from packaged contact management
software, which was introduced in 1990. As compa-
nies developed sophisticated telemarketing programs
and multi-tiered customer service solutions, the de-
mand for software systems to support frontline cus-
tomer contact appeared. The first packaged sales force
automation (SFA) solutions appeared in 1999, as did
customized CRM solutions. Increased customer con-
tact over the World Wide Web since 1999 has fueled
the growth of Web-based CRM solutions.
When combined with an overall business strategy,
CRM helps promote a customer-focused corporate
culture. CRM strategies involve integrating people,
processes, and technology in order to create a single
view of the customer. A successful CRM strategy is
based on quantifying the value of customer relation-
ships and creating a strategy to maximize that value.

The promise of CRM lies in enabling companies
to keep their best customers and acquire new ones.
Companies can use customer information to maximize
the value of existing relationships, to expand those
relationships, and to extend an enterprise’s brand into
other competitive markets. Objectives include keeping
high-value customers, increasing the value of moder-
ate- to low-value customers, and minimizing the cost
of customers who take away value. Used properly,
CRM can achieve the desired results of creating cus-
tomer loyalty, retaining customers, and expanding cur-
rent relationships.
Corporate spending on CRM systems reached $22
billion in 2001, a 10.6 percent increase over $19.9
billion in 2000, according to Dataquest Inc., a unit of
Gartner Inc. The company predicted that CRM reve-
nue would reach $25.3 billion in 2002 and $47 billion
by 2006. Companies that had deployed a CRM solu-
tion by the end of 2001 were considered early adopt-
ers. They were primarily large enterprises with sales of
$10 billion or more and were engaged in competitive
industries such as financial services, software, and
telecommunications.
CRITICAL FACTORS FOR SUCCESS OR
FAILURE
According to Gartner Group, some 65 percent of
all CRM projects had failed as of early 2002. Lack
of senior-level support was cited by the Data Ware-
housing Institute of Seattle as a leading risk factor to
successful CRM implementations. Many companies
that were early adopters focused on technology solu-
tions instead of the broader business strategy that the
technology can enable. In some cases CRM technol-
ogy was used to generate more sales from customers
rather than to build a long-term relationship with
them.
Companies also can improve their chances of a
successful CRM deployment by keeping it simple.
During the first phase of a CRM deployment, enter-
prises should limit themselves to a few critical areas
of change and demonstrate clear benefits for senior
management and shareholders, the company’s sales
professionals, and its customers. Senior management
and shareholders are interested in how CRM can mea-
surably increase top-line revenue growth or anticipate
order volume for key product lines. Sales profession-
als want software that enables them to spend more
time with customers and makes it easier to provide
sales quotes. CRM can benefit customers by making
it easier for them to interact with the company through
a variety of channels: telephone, Internet, face-to-
face, etc.
Companies can improve their chances of a success-
ful CRM rollout with better planning before imple-
mentation. They need to take an enterprise-wide view

and consider the impact any CRM application would
have on the overall customer service experience. In-
stead of letting CRM technology dictate how they
interact with their customers, companies should view
CRM as a tool that helps the customer service process.
Before selecting a CRM vendor, the following
steps should be considered:
T
Strategy: determine what CRM means to the enter-
prise, then develop a strategic plan.
T
Determine how much customization is needed.
T
Establish who the decision-makers will be in the
CRM process.
T
Plan for change management, including how and
when employees and clients will be introduced to
the new system, training, and demonstration of the
system’s benefits.
T
Optimize network architecture for CRM applica-
tions.
T
Finally, select a vendor.
VENDORS AND DEPLOYMENT
Many early CRM failures were due to simply se-
lecting the wrong vendor. According to a Gartner/
Dataquest survey at the beginning of 2002 and re-
ported in CRMDaily, the top two criteria in selecting
a CRM consultant/vendor were an established track
record and speed to solution. Being able to offer an
integrated-solutions approach based on applications
expertise ranked a close third. The biggest challenges
facing companies considering a CRM system were the
high cost of deployment and integration with internal
applications and processes.
The CRM marketplace may appear needlessly
complex and confusing. There are a wide array of
products, systems, and software to choose from. Com-
panies that cannot afford to buy complete CRM prod-
uct suites need to outline exactly which types of CRM
applications would suit their needs.
Ideally, a CRM vendor would work hard to truly
understand a company’s business and then find the
appropriate CRM technology to match the company’s
business goals, strategies, and processes. In reality,
companies have complained that CRM vendors often
simply provide them with CRM technology and prom-
ise that it will solve their problems.
In finding the right CRM vendor, companies must
go through a process of due diligence to select a
vendor that will work with them in advance of imple-
mentation to understand their business needs. Ideally,
the vendor would then work with the enterprise as a
partner to provide it with a customized solution.
Leading CRM vendors include market leader Sie-
bel Systems, followed by SAP AG, Oracle, and Peo-
pleSoft. Other leading vendors include E.piphany,
Salesforce.com, and Blue Martini Software.
OUTLOOK FOR CRM
Enterprises were cutting back on large information
technology (IT) expenditures for CRM systems in
2002 compared to 2001. According to a Gartner/Data-
quest survey of IT and business executives reported
in CRMDaily at the beginning of 2002, the percentage
of companies with more than $1 billion in annual
revenue that would deploy CRM systems dropped
from 35 percent in 2001 to less than 20 percent for
2002. By contrast, 35 percent of companies with sales
between $500 million and $1 billion planned to deploy
CRM systems within six months, compared to less
than 15 percent that were involved in deploying CRM
systems at the end of 2001. In terms of expenditures,
only 3 percent of the survey respondents indicated
that they would spend $10 million or more on CRM
systems in 2002, while 34 percent planned on spend-
ing less than $100,000.
CRM systems were expected to feature more multi-
channel integration, offering real-time information
sharing among different customer channels, including
customer service, field service, the Web, marketing,
and sales. This will enable companies to offer custom-
ers the same experience regardless of which channel
is used for customer contact. CRM will enable enter-
prises to create a true marketing portal through which
they can obtain a comprehensive view of each cus-
tomer.
Since CRM makes use of customer data, companies
were expected to focus their efforts more on the analy-
sis and organization of data so that customer informa-
tion can be more effectively used to implement CRM
solutions. The result will be improved customer differ-
entiation and segmentation, which will allow for more
effective and measurable marketing campaigns.
Rather than simply looking at what customers have
bought in the past and making offers based on that
behavior, an emerging CRM model will actually track
attitudes and stated preferences and opinions. Tradi-
tional CRM has measured actions, not attitudes.
Companies will recognize that customer satisfac-
tion does not necessarily translate into customer loy-
alty. Enterprises will seek to find ways of offering
customers better value for their money. They will
develop metrics to measure customer loyalty and
value-enhancing corporate performance.

CUSTOMER TOUCH POINTS
The rise of e-commerce in the late 1990s allowed
businesses to interact with their customers in new
ways. Along with the telephone and mail, businesses
could interact with clients via e-mail and Web sites.
For example, via the Web, customers could buy mer-
chandise from a company without ever visiting a store,
making a call, or mailing in an order. Also, e-mail
allowed companies to do things like notify customers
that their orders had been shipped. Along with provid-
ing a new medium for sales and communication, In-
ternet technology also brought with it added responsi-
bility. Businesses that added new touch points, which
are essentially ways in which a client can interact
with a company, were accountable for more types of
customer contact.
One of the most common difficulties businesses
face when adding new touch points in ensuring cus-
tomer service consistency. Many analysts point out
that customers expect the same level of service no
matter what their method of contacting a company is.
Therefore, launching a Web site can be a risky en-
deavor for a business that has not spent the necessary
27
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
time developing adequate Web-based customer ser-
vice for this new touch point. If an existing customer
decides to make a purchase via a company’s Web
site, a negative experience with the site could drive
the customer away from the company altogether. Sim-
ilarly, customers unhappy with how a company re-
sponds to an e-mail message might decide to contact
a rival company instead. This concern typically affects
bricks-and-mortar businesses venturing online for the
first time. If customers are used to receiving prompt
assistance when the make a phone call to a company,
they will likely expect equally prompt customer ser-
vice online.
Companies might also make the mistake of adding
new touch points without considering how they impact
other touch points, a practice that can also prove dam-
aging to customer relationships. For example, many
companies have built technology into their Web sites
that allows them to recognize customers online and
personalize their experience. For example, Ama-
zon.com greets existing customers by name and show-
cases products in which customers might be interested,
based on their previous purchases. ‘‘This can be a
good thing,’’ explains a February 2001 issue of Busi-
ness Courier Serving Cincinnati. ‘‘But beware, if this
customer interaction is not shared with other channels,
you might do more damage than good. For instance,
if a customer places an order through your Web site,
and your sales rep does not have knowledge of the
order, his or her next interaction with the customer
will most likely be embarrassing for the sales rep,
the company and the customer.’’ Similarly, customer
service representatives answering the phone might re-
ceive calls in reference to e-mails sent by customers. If
they are not prepared to deal with such calls, customers
will be left unsatisfied.
Developing consistency across all customer service
touch points is also essential for businesses hoping
to implement a customer relationship management
(CRM) system. Such a system tracks data gathered
at various touch points to help businesses better under-
stand their customers. Businesses can then use this
data for things like targeted marketing campaigns.
Many online companies use CRM technology to keep
track of which pages visitors to their Web sites view
most often. These companies are then able to send e-
mails about specific products to those potential cus-
tomers. Similarly, companies can send e-mail mes-
sages about sales or special promotions to the custom-
ers most likely to be interested in this news.
Before expanding your customer touch points, be
sure you are maximizing your existing ones. Any
activity that brings your company in contact with a
customer is a touch point, whether or not you consider
it a customer service activity. For example, sending
invoices, either paper or electronic, to customers cre-
ates a touch point. According to a May 2000 issue of

Global Best Practices, invoices ‘‘form independent
connections with customers that provide strategic op-
portunities for companies to build relationships, in-
crease satisfaction, and cross-sell. By taking full ad-
vantage of the opportunities each invoice provides to
communicate with customers, companies gain strate-
gic business advantage in the ongoing struggle to hold
on to customers.’’ As a result, it is important to see
activities like billing, which brings you in contact with
your clients, in terms of customer service.
It is also imperative to view your marketing efforts
as customer touch points as well. For example, if
you plan to embark upon something like an e-mail
marketing campaign, analysts recommend that you
consider the impact your e-mail message(s) will have
on those you contact. If your customers prefer not to
receive such messages, making that choice clear to
you should be an easily available option. In some
cases, Web sites are designed to ask customers making
a purchase if they wish to receive future e-mails about
new products, sales, etc. In other cases, e-mail mes-
sages include an e-mail address customers can use to
send a message that they would like to be removed
from a mailing list.
Most analysts recommend creating a customer ser-
vice strategy that takes into account all of your cus-
tomer touch points. Having such a strategy in place
can help business owners adding a new touch point
decide how to maintain consistent customer service
and, ultimately, retain their customer base while they
grow their operations. With the acquisition of new
customers costing an estimated 30 to 40 times more
than the management of existing customers, most ana-
lysts assert that devoting time to developing this type
of strategy is well worth the effort.

DATA INTEGRITY
Data plays an integral role in the operations of any
online business. As stated in a February 1999 issue
of E-Commerce Times, ‘‘Everywhere you turn these
days, it seems you’re dealing with a database. If you
want to be state of the art, the inventory in your Web
store should be in a database. The same is true of
your customer list, and your prospect list. The reports
delivered by Web server logs or held by your ad
agency are databases. You target ads by matching
these databases against other databases. Personaliza-
tion engines are all about databases. Even e-mail lists
are databases.’’ Because it is such an important part
of operations, preserving the integrity (accuracy and
completeness) of data is crucial for businesses. Data
integrity can be undermined by system crashes, errors
made by the individuals who input data, and computer
viruses and/or hackers.
To protect data from system crashes, you can back
it up by using something like a Zip drive or CD burner;
keeping your backed up data in a separate location
helps to ensure that it remains intact in the event of
a fire or other catastrophe. You can also use a remote
Internet-based backup service like Connected.com or
Xdrive. For a monthly fee of $17.95 per personal
computer (PC), Connected.com offers to back up and
store on the Internet the hard drive contents of five
to ten PCs. Customers who lose or damage files, can
simply log onto the firm’s Web site and retrieve the
most recent backup. Xdrive’s Workgroup is a similar
Internet-based backup service that charges a monthly
fee of $99 for up to 25 users.
To prevent data input errors, which can be as harm-
less as minor typos or as serious as incorrect pricing,
you can limit the number of individuals able to make
additions or changes to your databases. You can also
use programs that recognize common input errors and
alert users when a mistake is made. You can also limit
the number of databases you operate, which helps to
ensure that the information you present to customers is
consistent. It was data consistency that Delta Airlines
sought in 2001 when it spent nearly $1 billion to
integrate and condense hundreds of disparate data-
bases. This effort allowed the airline to provide up-to-
date and consistent information to all of its customers,
whether they were visiting a Delta display in an air-
port, calling a reservation agent, or visiting Delta’s
Web site.
One of the most serious threats to data integrity is
hacking, which typically involves compromising the
security of networks or creating malicious programs
such as viruses. The most popular forms of network

hacking are denial of service (DoS) attacks and mail
bombs. DoS attacks are designed to swamp a computer
network, causing it to crash. Mail bombs act in a
similar fashion but attack a network’s mail servers.
When eBay was attacked in February 2000, its Web
server was bombarded with fake requests for Web
pages, which overloaded the site and caused it to
crash. Network hackers also try to break into secure
areas to find sensitive data. Once a network is hacked,
files can be removed, stolen, or erased.
The malicious activities of some hackers include
the creation of viruses, logic bombs, and worms. A
virus is a program that has the potential to attack and
corrupt computer files by attaching itself to a file and
replicating itself. It can also cause a computer to crash
by utilizing all of the computer’s resources. In May
2000, e-mail systems throughout the world were inun-
dated with the ‘‘ILOVEYOU’’ and ‘‘Love Bug’’ vi-
ruses; the damage to individuals, businesses, and insti-
tutions was estimated at roughly $10 billion. Similar
to viruses, logic bombs are designed to attack when
triggered by a certain event like a change in date.
Worms attack networks in order to replicate and
spread. In July 2001, the ‘‘Code Red’’ worm attacked
Microsoft Internet Information Server systems, defac-
ing
Web sites
with the
phrase ‘‘Welcome
to
www.worm.com! Hacked by Chinese!’’
While it is virtually impossible to prevent all hack-
ing activity, you can take a number of protective mea-
sures to help preserve your data’s integrity. One of the
most common methods of protection against viruses is
anti-virus software programs such as those manufac-
tured by McAfee and Symantec. Anti-virus software
scans a PC’s hard drive for infected material and
alerts users when bad files are found. ‘‘While virus
protection should be considered a vital part of a secu-
rity plan, it is definitely not the only security a com-
pany needs to stay protected,’’ asserts a February 2002
article in Entrepreneur. Many business also use a
firewall, which acts as a deterrent to hacking by pro-
tecting private networks from the public and pre-
venting all but the most determined outsiders from
tampering with computer systems.
Other software options include Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS), content filtering software, and sand-
boxing software. Considered one of the best protection
methods for large networks, an IDS allows system
administrators to monitor network requests and detect
suspicious large-scale activity. Content filtering soft-
ware is advanced anti-virus software that reads com-
pressed files and allows information technology man-
agers to use filters to block suspicious e-mail.
Sandboxing software protects against malicious codes
by creating a protected space within a computer where
a suspicious code can run before it reaches the main
operating system.

If you run an online business that is hosted by a
third party, you should become familiar with how it
will go about protecting the integrity of your data.
Find out what sort of firewalls the company has in
place to protect against hackers and how it handles
viruses. The security measures that hosting companies
take vary widely, and it is worth your while to be
sure your host is working to preserve the integrity of
your data.

DATA MINING
Data mining is the method of using various statisti-
cal analysis tools to unmask obscured patterns in a
specified chunk of data. Considered an advanced form
of data analysis, data mining goes beyond more com-
monplace data analysis practices, such as spreadsheet
analysis and SQL (structured query language) queries.
Quite often data mining tools are used in conjunction
with data warehouses, multi-dimensional data struc-
tures that help businesses both organize and analyze
the data created during daily business operations.
DATA WAREHOUSING CONCEPTS
Data warehousing involves two main types of data:
operational and informational. Operational data con-
sists of the data businesses use on a daily basis, like
customer orders and completed sales transactions.
This data is typically stored in a relational database
and is retrieved and updated by an online transaction
processing (OLTP) system. Once operational data has
been manipulated and summarized, such as daily sales
totals excluding voided or returned items, it is loaded
into the data warehouse, another database with a dif-
ferent structure and purpose, and becomes informa-
tional data. More advanced systems integrate opera-
tional data from multiple sources in the organization.

E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
The goal of transforming operational data into in-
formational data, which in many cases involves data
standardization, is to create data that can be efficiently
and accurately analyzed. Once data is standardized,
it can be subjected to online analytical processing
(OLAP), which allows users to analyze large amounts
of data related to sales, products, customer service,
and other business operations. This is where data min-
ing tools are used most frequently. For example, data
mining might be used to help an online retailer pin-
point customer purchasing patterns, insights that
might be useful when the retailer develops its next
marketing campaign.
EMERGING DEMAND FOR DATA
MANAGEMENT
In the 1990s, business trends such as the rise of
e-commerce boosted demand for data warehousing
and data mining technology. A growing number of
companies began to gather customer data on the Web
and needed ways to distill it all down to usable in-
sights. According to an August 2001 report in the
Wall Street Journal, ‘‘data mining uses algorithms
to sift through those monstrous databases and reveal
customer usage patterns. Once marketers get their
hands on this juicy info, they can learn a range of
valuable lessons, including what works and what
doesn’t for customers on Web sites. They can also
forecast future customer moves.’’ To organize and
make use of this information, however, can be both
costly and time consuming, and throughout the late
1990s, many small and medium-sized businesses were
simply unable to afford either the technology or the
staff necessary to manage it.
However, by 2000, more affordable options began
to emerge. For example, data marts—smaller, more
focused versions of data warehouses—were created
using data warehousing principles but on a much
smaller scale, sometimes with the help of prepackaged
templates and tools. In comparison to data ware-
houses, which are measured in gigabytes and tera-
bytes, data marts are much smaller and less intricate.
Several data mining companies also began to offer
specialized data mining services to small and mid-
sized companies.
IMPLEMENTING DATA MINING
When deciding how to best manage and mine your
data, consider how involved you wish to be in the
process. You can purchase the data mining software
you need and handle everything in-house, perhaps
hiring data specialists. You can also hand off all your
data mining needs to a third party. In addition, you
might choose to outsource only certain tasks to a
specialized vendor. If you lack technical expertise in
this area and are not willing to hire a data specialist,
most experts recommend outsourcing.
Keep in mind that data mining and data warehous-
ing are closely related to customer relationship man-
agement (CRM), and many vendors offer ‘‘business
intelligence’’ suites that include comprehensive e-
business, CRM, data warehousing, and data mining
solutions. According to a reader survey published
in DM Review, some of the most popular business
intelligence vendors in 2000 were SAS, NCR Corp.,
Oracle Corp., Computer Associates, Cognos Corp.,
MicroStrategy Inc., Microsoft Corp., IBM, Informix
Business Solutions, and Hyperion. Many of these
firms offer highly complex data warehousing, data
mining, and CRM programs that are better suited
to large corporations than to smaller businesses.
One option for smaller businesses with data mining
needs is an application service provider (ASP). Many
ASPs will store your data on their servers and write
programs that help you analyze your data most effec-
tively. ASPs offering basic data warehousing and min-
ing services to existing small businesses and start-up
ventures include Exenet, Interland, ManagedOps.com,
and StorageNetworks. ASPs that specialize in data
warehousing and mining for small and mid-sized on-
line businesses include Accrue Hit List, NetGenesis,
and digiMine. For $15,000 to $50,000 per month,
digiMine will install software in your current database
that collects and compresses data before transferring
an encrypted file to its own data server. Once digiMine
gleans what it determines worthwhile from your infor-
mational data, it stores the data in a warehouse and
launches a series of algorithms that mine the data. This
entire process takes place daily, and, upon completion,
digiMine posts completed reports, including graphs
and charts, on its Web site. You can retrieve your
reports via a password.
You should determine, in detail, what you hope to
gain from data mining prior to spending money on
software, new staff, or vendor services. If you are
setting up your own data management and analysis
system, be sure you can afford the technology itself,
as well as the costs associated with operating and
maintaining such a system. When researching various
vendors, inquire about their current customers to see
if your business is similar in size and scope. Narrow
your focus to vendors who offer the products and
services your business needs. To reduce your costs,
you might consider purchasing a suite of applications
that serves a variety of your needs, including data
mining. Many firms offer e-commerce suites that in-
clude integrated data mining, data warehousing, and
similar applications specifically designed for online
businesses.

DATA WAREHOUSING
Data warehousing technology helps businesses or-
ganize and analyze the data created during daily busi-
ness operations. Two types of database processing,
online transaction processing (OLTP) and online ana-
lytical processing (OLAP), allow users to both store
and retrieve data. Stored in a data warehouse, also
known as a multi-dimensional data structure, this in-
formation can be queried and analyzed as needed.
TYPES OF DATA
The two main types of data involved with data
warehousing are operational and informational data.
Operational data, which consists of the data businesses
use on a daily basis, is normally stored in a relational
database and retrieved and updated by an OLTP sys-
tem. Once operational data has been manipulated and
summarized, it is considered informational data; this
is what makes up a data warehouse. In the process of
data warehousing, informational data is created from
operational data via transformation or propagation
tools. This process is a standardization of sorts that
helps ensure that information can be retrieved quickly
and easily at a later date. Multi-dimensional analysis,
or OLAP, is the desired result of data warehousing.
It allows users to analyze large amounts of data related
to sales, products, customer service, and other busi-
ness operations.
The informational data stored in a data warehouse
is also known as metadata, which comprises both
technical data and business data. Technical data,
31
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
which provides information about the data warehouse
itself, is used mainly by system administrators. It is
the business data that users seek most often for tasks
such as forecasting sales or predicting trends. To per-
form such analyses, the data warehouse program uses
applications known as data mining tools to interpret
data and find patterns within the information. For
example, a retail company, either online or traditional,
might use data warehousing and data mining technol-
ogy to pinpoint customer purchasing patterns and to
gather additional information about its buyers.
ORIGINS OF DATA WAREHOUSING
The concept of data warehousing dates back to the
early 1980s, when relational databases were popular.
Relational database systems were run on minicomput-
ers for OLTP. They were commonly used to operate
networks such as automated teller machines. By the
1990s, changing business trends such as business pro-
cess reengineering, an increasingly globalized econ-
omy, the growing popularity of enterprise resource
planning (ERP) systems, and the rise of e-commerce
all helped fuel demand for data warehousing technol-
ogy. Run on powerful client/server networks, data
networks that could translate OLAP, as well as read
OLTP, emerged. According to a February 2001 issue
of Strategic Finance, data warehousing is useful be-
cause it ‘‘helps with analytical tasks—from identi-
fying new market trends to evaluating customer ser-
vice performance. It provides immediate, accurate
information that’s unique to your business and pro-
duces results you can act on quickly. It can also help
plug leaks you may not know exist. Applying the right
analytical tools may reveal patterns that add up to
widespread yet traceable financial discrepancies.’’
IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Implementing a data warehouse structure within
your company can be both costly and time consuming.
Data warehousing firms targeting small companies
have developed data marts, smaller versions of data
warehouses that are streamlined to serve a specific
department and/or cover a specific topic. In compari-
son to data warehouses, which are measured in giga-
bytes and terabytes, data marts are much smaller and,
therefore, measured in megabytes. You may find that
this data structure is more appropriate for your busi-
ness, particularly if you are just launching operations.
Whether you are building a data warehouse or data
mart for a traditional bricks-and-mortar company, an
online venture, or both, you must decide how involved
you want to be in the process. You can outsource the
entire project to a qualified vendor, handle the entire
process in-house, or work in tandem with a vendor.
If you opt to hand off all or part of the project to a

vendor, a choice most analysts recommend if you lack
technical expertise in this area, you’ll be faced with
a vast choice of business intelligence vendors offering
packaged e-business, customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM), and data warehousing solutions. Ac-
cording to DM Review, the top 10 business intelligence
vendors in 2000 were SAS, NCR Corp., Oracle Corp.,
Computer Associates, Cognos Corp., MicroStrategy
Inc., Microsoft Corp., IBM, Informix Business Solu-
tions, and Hyperion. However, many of these firms
offer highly complex data warehousing and CRM pro-
grams that are better suited to large corporations than
to smaller businesses.
According to Joe Outlaw, a Gartner Group analyst
quoted in an October 2001 issue of CRMDaily.com,
‘‘Rich functionality is obviously a desirable quality
if you are a large company, but for a small company
the package then becomes too difficult to use, espe-
cially if they don’t have the support staff to maintain
it.’’ Outlaw also cautioned smaller businesses to be
sure they could handle the cost not only of the technol-
ogy itself but also of operating and maintaining the
system. In addition, when selecting a vendor, you
should investigate its current clientele to see if your
business is similar in size and focus. Concentrate on
vendors that offer the specific functions your business
needs rather than those that offer additional bells and
whistles. Finally, to save money, consider purchasing
a suite of applications that serves a variety of your
needs rather than individual programs that must be
integrated. Many vendors offer e-commerce suites that
include data warehousing applications specifically de-
signed for online businesses.
If you have already warehoused some of your own
information, you might consider using an application
service provider (ASP) to store your data on its servers
and to write programs that help you analyze your data
effectively. ASPs offering basic data warehousing ser-
vices to existing small businesses and start-up ventures
include Exenet, HostPro, ManagedOps.com, and Stor-
ageNetworks. ASPs that specialize in data warehous-
ing for small online businesses include Accrue Hit
List, digiMine, and NetGenesis. These firms focus on
‘‘clickstream’’ analysis, which means that they help
businesses use data to figure out things like who is
visiting their Web sites and which pages visitors ac-
cess most often.

DATABASES
Nearly every business uses a database of some
sort. Databases can be as simple as the electronic
address books used to maintain lists of e-mail contacts
or as complex as electronic library systems or online
flight reservation systems. Typically, some sort of
query system allows users to gain access to specific
information in a database. For example, online flight
reservation systems are often designed to accept que-
ries based on a user’s departure destination, arrival
destination, and dates of travel.
The process of storing and manipulating the infor-
mation housed in a database is known as database
management. The tools used to manage databases are
grouped together into database management systems
(DBMSs). Several types of DBMSs exist, including
those designed for personal computers (PCs) as well
as those running on large mainframe systems. Some
of the most common database applications include
Microsoft Access, which is included in Microsoft
Corp.’s popular Office suite of products for PCs, and
IBM Corp.’s DB2.
IBM Corp.’s Information Management System
(IMS), released in 1966, was the first commercially
viable database application. IMS was considered a
hierarchical database, in which standardized data rec-
ords were organized within other standardized data
records, creating a hierarchy of information about a
single entry. In the late 1960s, firms like Honeywell
Corp. and General Electric Corp. developed database
applications based on a network data model, but the
next major database breakthrough came in 1970, when
a research scientist at IBM first outlined his theory for
relational databases. Six years later, IBM completed a
prototype for a relational DBMS. In 1978, Oracle
Systems Corp. beat IBM to the punch when it released
the world’s first relational database management sys-
tem (RDBMS) using Structured Query Language
(SQL). Relational databases eventually outpaced all
other database types, mainly because they allowed for
highly complex queries and could support various

tools that enhanced their usefulness. Database applica-
tions for PCs emerged in the early 1990s. In 1993
Microsoft Corp. created Access, which competed with
FileMaker Inc.’s FileMaker Pro, a database applica-
tion initially designed for Macintosh machines.
In the late 1990s, the use of databases became
increasingly widespread as the Internet grew in popu-
larity. According to a February 1999 issue of E-Com-
merce Times, ‘‘Everywhere you turn these days, it
seems you’re dealing with a database. If you want to
be state of the art, the inventory in your Web store
should be in a database. The same is true of your
customer list, and your prospect list. The reports deliv-
ered by Web server logs or held by your ad agency are
databases. You target ads by matching these databases
against other databases. Personalization engines are
all about databases. Even e-mail lists are databases.’’
In fact, the growth of e-commerce continues to fuel
the development of new database features designed
to allow users to take advantage of various Internet-
based opportunities. At the core of many new database
developments was the adoption of XML (extensible
markup language), the language used to create Web
documents, by database application developers like
Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle as well as their smaller
rivals.
When deciding which databases are best suited to
your business, you’ll need to keep in mind that beyond
simply housing your data, an application ideally will
allow you to sift through the data in various ways.
Using a variety of different database applications
could pose future problems if you ever need to inte-
grate the data; however, finding a database program
that meets all of your database needs can prove tricky
as well. Many companies allow potential customers to
download free trial versions of their database software.
While it may prove time consuming to test various
applications, this is an inexpensive way to find a suit-
able database program.
To help you organize and analyze the data created
during daily business operations, you might decide to
use some sort of data warehousing system, although
an application this sophisticated might prove unneces-
sary at first. You can also opt to use a data mart, which
is essentially a smaller version of a data warehouse that
is streamlined to serve a specific department and/or
cover a specific topic. Another option is an application
service provider (ASP)—such as Exenet, HostPro, and
ManagedOps.com—which will store your data on its
servers and write programs that help you analyze your
data effectively. For example, an ASP can help you
write queries to generate the information you need to
analyze sales by region or by product. While gaining
control of your internal data is an important part of
managing your business, according to an April 2001
article in PC Magazine, it may only play a small role
33
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
in how you use databases. ‘‘For many companies,
internal databases are only half the story—if that. Also
essential is so-called clickstream analysis of their Web
site. This involves tracking the behavior of visitors to
a Web site, examining what they do there, recording
where they’re geographically located, keeping track
of who referred them to the Web site, and noting
which pages resulted in the greatest number of further
requests.’’ ASPs specializing in this type of database
management include Accrue Hit List, digiMine, and
NetGenesis. In the early 2000s, many leading database
firms, like Microsoft, also began targeting small and
mid-sized business markets. As database programs
become increasingly comprehensive, database options
for small business, both traditional and online, will
continue to increase.

DAY TRADING
Day trading, when an individual buys and sells
stocks in rapid succession in hopes of profiting from
short-term price movements, stems from a conver-
gence of factors in the 1990s and early 2000s. Among
the factors:
T
the rise of personal computers
T
the development of the Internet
T
the availability of real-time high level market in-
formation
T
the ability to buy and sell stocks online almost
instantly
T
the rise of the dot-com economy and the plethora
of volatile stocks it spawned
Day trading got its name because most day traders
don’t hold a share position overnight; instead, they
sell all their shares by the end of each day. This means
day traders aren’t investors in any traditional sense.
They care not for a firm’s long-term prospects or

management practices; they have no interest in putting
together stock portfolios for the long run. Day traders
are speculators who attempt to anticipate micro-move-
ments in a stock’s price—often fluctuations of mere
fractions of a point—then buying and selling large
lots of that stock in a short period—often within mi-
nutes—to take advantage of those fluctuations. It is
the direct access to up-to-the-minute market data along
with the ability to execute trades within seconds that
makes day trading possible as a lucrative, if high-risk,
undertaking.
ORIGINS OF DAY TRADING
Day trading had its origins in the U.S. stock market
crash of 1987. Because many investors were unable
to get through to their brokers on the phone to sell
stock in the panicked trading that ensued, Nasdaq
introduced
the
Small
Order
Execution
System
(SOES), a system designed to execute trades of up to
1,000 shares at the best available price within seconds.
SOES was so efficient that it operated faster than
Nasdaq’s main computer system, SelectNet, used by
Nasdaq market makers. New prices appeared on SOES
before they were registered on SelectNet. By monitor-
ing both systems, early day traders—nicknamed
SOES bandits—were able to pick off good prices on
SelectNet before market makers could adjust their
prices to SOES levels.
The rise of ECNs—electronic communications net-
works which rapidly disseminated information and
made possible quick trades—in the 1990s gave day
traders another weapon. By 1997, SOES accounted
for 17 percent of Nasdaq’s daily volume. In response
to SOES bandits and the volatility they were said to
be creating, Nasdaq replaced SelectNet with a new
system, called SuperSOES which made current
Nasdaq share information available to the entire mar-
ket. With the introduction of SuperSOES, many vet-
eran day traders left the business.
HOW IT WORKS
Day trading is performed through day-trading firms
which maintain order-routing and execution systems.
These firms have connections to the Nasdaq Level II
screens, which display real-time market data like best
bid and ask quotes and volume traded. The firms
hire their own staffs of traders as well as allowing
individual traders to use their facilities for a fee and
commissions. Trading takes place either at the firm’s
offices or from a day trader’s home via the Internet.
Day traders buy in anticipation of small changes
in price, sell after the change, and pocket the differ-
ence. It makes no difference whether a stock is going
up or down. If a price is expected to drop, day traders
sell short, borrowing shares they do not yet own,
selling them at the higher price, then buying it later
at the lower one. There is a great deal of risk involved
in all these transactions. If a share’s price doesn’t
move in the expected direction, the trader takes a
loss—potentially thousands of dollars or more. In ad-
dition, most day traders must pay commissions on
every transaction they make, which can cut deeply
into profits and add to losses.
TRENDS IN DAY TRADING
Historically, day traders have done most of their
trading in Nasdaq’s high-tech and Internet shares—
stocks that tend to experience large fluctuations in
price every day. Day trading fever was fed by the bull
market and Internet stock craze of the 1990s. When
the dot-com industry collapsed in late 2000, many
day traders, particularly non-professionals, left the
field. By the end of the 1990s, at any rate, many day
trading firms were moving away from retail clients,
that is, individual traders, toward larger institutional
clients, like mutual funds. By 2002 a significant con-
solidation was underway in the day trading industry,
with many firms being purchased by larger traditional
brokerage houses.
By 2002 the typical day trader was not the get-
rich-quick dilettante portrayed by the popular press,
but either a veteran of the exchange floor, a Ivy League
business grad, or a business professional from another
field. There was little agreement on how many day
traders were active in the early 2000s. In July 2001
Forbes magazine estimated the number at about
75,000; by contrast the U.S. General Accounting Of-
fice (GAO), using figures from industry sources and
regulatory bodies, put the number at about 5,000.
However small day traders’ numbers, the GAO
stressed the exaggerated influence day traders have
on the Nasdaq market: while making up only one-tenth
of one percent of all securities traders, day traders
accounted nonetheless for about 15 percent of all
Nasdaq trades in 2001.
REGULATION
With its lure of quick profits and its existence on
the margins of the securities industry, day trading
inevitably became a target of government and regula-
tory bodies, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). Some traders successfully manip-
ulated share prices by planting false information on
the bulletin boards and newsgroups frequented by day
traders. The customer acquisition practices of day
trading firms was another subject of SEC attention.
Regulators maintained firms were violating suitability
rules by taking clients who did not have the capital
wherewithal needed for day trading. Some traders
charged that firms encouraged customers to borrow

beyond their means to continue trading. In mid-2001
the SEC brought actions against a number of firms
for infractions including margin lending, advertising,
and short-sale rule violations. The SEC has no rules
specifying how quickly orders should be placed; how-
ever, the most common complaint received by the
commission in 2000 concerned order delays or techni-
cal systems failure that lost or delayed orders.
Despite the promise of instant wealth held out by
day trading, few traders actually become rich. The
worst case was undoubtedly that of the unsuccessful,
heavily indebted day trader who murdered a number
of workers in his day trading firm along with his
family and himself in 1999. His case was not entirely
exceptional however. According to the Electronic
Traders Association, 90 percent of all day traders lose
money.

DIFFERENTIATION TECHNIQUES IN
E-COMMERCE
Basically, there are only two ways to compete in
the marketplace. One is to do the same thing and in
the same way that the competition does, and the other
35
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
is to develop a competitive advantage that will differ-
entiate your business, and allow you to capture your
fair share of the market without spending money and
resources on head-to-head competition with your com-
petitors.
Note, however, that this doesn’t necessarily mean
‘‘sustainable’’ competitive advantage. In the con-
nected economy, it is very challenging to sustain a
competitive advantage, simply because the ability of
your competitors to copy your business model is rela-
tively easy. Moreover, it is very difficult and expen-
sive (and sometimes ineffective) to protect a business
model, even if you have a patent for it.
Therefore, your should strive to develop an advan-
tage via differentiation, and establish your business
as the leader in its particular category in the mind of
the customer, rather than build ‘‘imaginary walls’’
around your business that can never truly be protected.
Striving for differentiation in your business model and
practices, then, is a never-ending task in the competi-
tive and fast-paced e-commerce marketplace.
WHAT IS DIFFERENTIATION?
As a rule, head-to-head competition is an extremely
difficult way for a new firm to stake out a share of
the market. Business history has shown us that even
corporate giants have failed when they attempted to
overcome their competition by fighting head-to head
with them. The main reason for this outcome is that
competition does not occur in the marketplace—it
occurs in the mind of the customer. Human beings
have a limited capacity to remember all details. There-
fore, our minds tend to prioritize, recalling only the
top-rated items. When it comes to brands and products
or services, most people can not recall anyone beyond
the third place. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to
uproot an existing position from the customer’s mind.
The lesson here is that you want to differentiate your-
self from the pack, and develop an advantage that
hopefully you can maintain for a long time.
Differentiation of a product or business is thus
essential for success in e-commerce. It involves reach-
ing out to customers while highlighting the key and
advantageous differences between your firm and
others in your market. This could inlcude anything
from simple product differentiation, unique customer-
service strategies, and even wildly innovative market-
ing schemes. In a free market society, it is expected
that most beneficial products and services will have
competition in the marketplace, and thus, one needs to
find a way to effectively compete in order to maintain a
viable business.

DIFFERENTIATION—NOW AND THEN
The short answer is yes. The differentiation tactics
of the pre-connected economy are very different than
the differentiation tactics of today. Any business that
is utilizing e-commerce in one way or another must
plan on and develop differentiation based on the
unique properties of the connected economy.
In the pre-connected economy, competitive advan-
tage was largely based on the ‘‘four P’s’’ of traditional
marketing: price, place, packaging, and promotion.
Although these marketing elements are important,
they are now taking second seat to the unique proper-
ties of the connected economy: connectivity, interacti-
vity, and speed.
STARTING TO DIFFERENTIATE YOUR E-
BUSINESS
Start by analyzing your landscape. Landscape is
an overview of the elements in the marketplace that
can directly effect your business, and a decision on
how you can avoid or better yet leverage these ele-
ments to your advantage.
No enterprise operates in a vacuum, and you will
encounter competitive forces in the marketplace. Even
if your business model is unique, and even if no one
else does what you plan to do, you still have competi-
tion. For example, Amazon.com was the first to sell
books online, but its competitors were brick-and-mor-
tar bookstores.
There are three main elements in your landscape
that you want to review and analyze when defining
the last component of your vision block:
T
Competition
T
Analysis
T
Advantage
COMPETITION. Competition exists everywhere and
all the time. There are only two ways to overcome
competitive forces; one is to fight them head on, and
the other is to go around them via differentiation.
Going around your competitors simply means de-
veloping a competitive advantage that makes your
approach so unique that customers see you as the
leader in a newly created category or sub-category.
Amazon.com, for example, could not compete head on
with the existing bookstores in the brick-and-mortar
category, so they created another category: cyber

PRIORITIZING THE COMPETITION
Start by making a list of your competitors. Again,
do not just look at competitors that are doing the same
as you do, but any entity that has an effect on your
market target. Next, prioritize the list in terms of the
influence that each of these competitors has on your
market target. Number them in order of influence;
one being the most influential competitor.
ANALYZING THE COMPETITION
Once you have identified and prioritized your com-
petitors, it is time to analyze them so that you can
define your competitive advantage relative to your
competitive set. A competitive set is a collection of
your top competitors that have the greatest influence
on your target market.
The main purpose of this analysis is to identify
and pinpoint the elements that you can leverage in
order to differentiate your operation from the opera-
tion of your competitive set. This process includes
three stages:
T
List your competitive set in order of influence on
your market.
T
Define the main categories—such as advertising
savvy, customer service, branding, and so on—
that are the most important to your operation.
T
Score each of your competitors and yourself, and
sum up the result.
An analysis of the top competitors indicates that
there are differences in the strengths and weaknesses
of each one of them, and that your e-business model
can gain a competitive advantage by focusing on the
areas in which your competitors are relatively weak.
DEVELOPING A COMPETITIVE
ADVANTAGE
In order to build a competitive advantage in your
market via differentiation, you need to secure your
fair share of the market without spending money and
resources on head-to-head competition with your com-
petitors.
Based on the analysis of your competitive set, you
can begin to discern opportunities for building a com-
petitive advantage by developing and offering your
customers a business model that is interactive as well
as simple to use. Of course, you need to maintain a
satisfactory level of connectivity and speed, but your
focus of competitive advantage will be in the areas
of interactivity and speed.

You will take maximum advantage of this competi-
tive advantage by highlighting it in your branding,
marketing, sales, and promotional programs. The
value added to your customers will be the ability to
interact with them and your trading partnets in the
simplest, most cost-effective, and most user-friendly
way possible.
TROUBLESHOOTING YOUR
DIFFERENTIATION PLANS
To validate your comparative advantage, you need
to ask the following question: Are the differentiation
factors (interactivity and speed) that I am targeting
relative to the competition offering enough added
value to entice customers to use my business rather
than to others.
If your answer is yes, you have successfully devel-
oped a differentiation plan for your e-business. If you
are unable to clearly define those factors that add
value for your customers relative to the competition,
you should review the process again and refine your
approach.

DIGITAL AUTHENTICATION
In 2002, a market research survey reported that
credit-card payment fraud cost online merchants a
minimum of $1 billion a year. One example cited a
major credit-card company processing more than $900
billion in losses annually. Given this climate, digital
authentication, technology for online identity confir-
mation, has become essential to protect both mer-
chants and Internet users alike. Information theft pre-
sents the most obvious challenge to e-commerce
security. Through unauthorized access, however,
hackers can wreak havoc in many other ways, altering
content during transmission, eavesdropping on confi-
dential information, luring consumers through phony
sites, or maliciously shutting down a web page.
The online intruder may be a curious adolescent,
a software inventor challenging company security, a

foreign or corporate spy, or an outright thief. Disgrun-
tled former employees with network information may
also hack into an employer’s system for fun, revenge,
profit, or political attention. The problem is exacer-
bated as publications and conferences within the
hacker community spread information on security top-
ics by identifying systems at risk, publishing pass-
words, and sharing hacking and exploitation software.
To combat these virtual bandits and vandals, online
shopkeepers can use digital authentication systems of
passwords, encryption, and secret computer keys to
authenticate the identity of their sites’ users, ensuring
that payment information is valid and customer infor-
mation is kept secret. They may also use authentica-
tion to restrict access to authorized users, like online
magazine subscribers. For their part, customers use
digital authentication to protect their credit-card and
online-banking information.
WAYS TO AUTHENTICATE
Authentication technology falls into three cate-
gories:
T
what the user knows (a password)
T
what the user has (a token or card)
T
what identifies the user physically (i.e. a finger-
print)
PASSWORDS. The first method, what the user knows,
or basic authentication, works via online user names
and passwords. However, these elements are relatively
easy to obtain and abuse by creative password thieves.
Favored methods of stealing data include watching
users log in, posing as a phony help desk technician,
applying some one million passwords to a user name
through special applications, guessing passwords, or
catching a user unwittingly divulging information.
Online merchants have some defenses. Password
security can be improved through mixed alphanumeric
passwords, longer password lengths, mixed-language
passwords, and case-sensitive passwords. Site users
should be warned not to incorporate easily guessed
personal information like birth dates or pets’ names
into their passwords, and to use different passwords
for other Web sites. In addition, password manage-
ment strategies can include password content require-
ments, encrypted storage, limitations on the number
of unsuccessful sign-on attempts, number of pass-
words per user, number of password changes, and
management of lost passwords.
By 2002, most online purchases and financial trans-
actions were secured by the Secure Socket Layer
(SSL), which displays a padlock icon in the browser

when enabled. Embedded in many web browsers, SSL
creates a secure ‘‘tunnel’’ between a user and server
by encrypting data, allowing for server or client au-
thentication, and ensuring the integrity of messages.
However, SSL only provides security during transmis-
sion from browser to server; collected credit card
numbers and personal information are known to have
been stolen from servers’ data storage.
ENCRYPTION
KEYS,
TOKENS,
AND
CERTIFI-
CATES. The second authentication technology, proof
of identity by what the user has, features unique identi-
fiers to authenticate their holder. These include en-
cryption keys, smart cards, digital certificates, and
tokens. Many incorporate a cryptographic process
whereby information is transformed to gibberish by
a mathematical formula, or encryption key, before it
is passed to another party.
The length of encryption keys determine their rela-
tive security, while the complexity of algorithms used
in their creation ups the ante even more. Using ad-
vanced guessing techniques and tools, a 40-bit key is
fairly easy to crack, while the 128-bit keys used by
many online banks were considered secure as of 2002.
A different formula may be used for both encryption
and decryption, depending on the level of trust be-
tween parties. When different formulas are used, they
are called asymmetric, trap door, or one-way encrypti-
ons, and require a private key to decode. In this case,
two different keys are created: a public key, made
available on a key server, and a private key, which
is known only to the owner. Digital certificates, also
called digital IDs, associate a specific person to this
pair of keys and prevent their misuse by phony users.
They are issued by a third-party certification authority
(CA), using the CA’s private key.
Private keys are also used to verify a digital signa-
ture, which is considered legally binding by the federal
government. The private key confirms that the mes-
sage was sent by its signer and remained unaltered in
transit. This is done by reducing the message to a
short mathematical function, or ‘‘message digest
hash,’’ that is further encrypted with the private key.
Once sent, a message is decrypted by its recipient
using the public key. If the technology works as in-
tended, when someone uses a your public key to en-
crypt a message to you, they will know that only you,
the private key’s owner, will be able to decrypt and
read it.
Another unique identifier, physical tokens, authen-
ticate users through a two-factor process. The subject
must enter into the computer the numeric data dis-
played on the token—data which changes every mi-
nute or so—along with a password. Once the security
server determines what the data should be and matches
the password, access is granted. This system provides
an extra level of protection over simple password
security. Otherwise cumbersome token technology is
being integrated into electronic devices the user al-
ready carries, like hand-held computers. Plastic smart
cards incorporate similar technology, embedded in a
computer chip storing data and read by computing
systems.
BIOMETRICS. The third authentication technology,
identifying something about the user, relies on biome-
tric technology to authenticate individuals using
unique identifying features from the iris, retina, palm
print, voice, face scan, or chromosomes. Although
biometrics is a relatively new addition to mainstream
digital authentication products, major PC and periph-
eral manufacturers have begun integrating fingerprint-
scanning technology into their equipment.

DISASTER PLANNING
Disaster planning is the process of creating contin-
gency plans for operating or recovering a business in
the event of a major disruption. Most businesses, even
virtual ones, need to consider how they will survive

a disaster, whether it’s an earthquake, flood, burglary,
fire, death, or some other interruption.
In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September
11, 2001, businesses of all kinds began to revisit their
disaster plans, and many of those operating without
disaster plans began to create them for the first time.
The attacks underscored the vulnerability of busi-
nesses operating without an adequate disaster plan
that addresses questions such as these: Who is in
change when disaster strikes? What is the chain of
command to follow if various individuals are unavail-
able? What forms of backup communications are
available to maintain contact? What backup locations
are available to conduct business if facilities are such
down or evacuated? Although small businesses are
the ones most likely to operate without a disaster plan,
they are often most vulnerable to disaster because
they tend to operate from a single location and lack
the variety of assets typically maintained by larger
enterprises.
REDUNDANCY
Many large companies can afford to add redun-
dancy to their operations, which can lessen the impact
of many kinds of disaster. For example, to maintain
communications during storms and other natural dis-
asters, some firms purchase accounts with more than
one phone service provider. As long as the providers
aren’t sharing lines or infrastructure, there is a good
chance that an interruption in the services of one
provider won’t happen at the same time as a service
breakdown with the second provider. Many compa-
nies provide cell phones and wireless pagers to their
employees, both of which offer alternative means of
communications. Similarly, many businesses operate
multiple offices, which means if disaster strikes in
one area, other facilities are available from which
business can be conducted.
If you operate a small business that can’t afford
multiple offices and communications systems, you
can still achieve this kind of redundancy, although
you may need to be a bit more creative. One option
is finding another company with which to create a
reciprocity agreement. This type of contract allows a
small business to agree to share specified facilities
with another business in the event of a disaster. For
example, if a tornado levels your main manufacturing
plant, a reciprocity agreement with a similar business
50 miles away might allow you to maintain manufac-
turing operations with minimal interruption while your
facilities are being restored. Having this sort of
agreement in place prior to a disaster could mean the
difference between staying afloat and going bankrupt.

OTHER STRATEGIES
For e-commerce firms, in particular, disaster plans
must also include detailed strategies for dealing with
data losses. Keep in mind that along with backing up
your data by using something like a Zip drive or CD
burner, it is a good idea to keep your backed up data
in a separate location. This can be as simple a task
as taking backup tapes home with you every evening.
This way, if something should happen to your main
office, your backups will remain safe. Many e-com-
merce companies opt for backing up their systems to
remote computers over the Internet or over a private
network. This can be affordable as well as highly
reliable, and usually can be automated to occur ac-
cording to a schedule.
Firms like Connected.com and Xdrive offer an-
other option: remote Internet-based backup services.
For example, Connected.com offers to back up and
store the hard drive contents of PCs for a flat monthly
fee. These inexpensive services allow small busi-
nesses without many internal technical resources to
create effective data redundancy in case of an ac-
cident.
When preparing a disaster plan for an e-commerce
venture, you will also need to specify how you plan
to deal with server crashes, viruses, and online security
breaches. If you are paying an outside company to
host your site, find out exactly how the hosting firm
deals with such problems. If you subscribe to a shared
hosting service, find out how many companies are
sharing your server and if the firm will automatically
route your traffic to a backup server, located else-
where, if your server does crash. Ask hosting compa-
nies to explain how they go about testing their Web
sites and how often they do this. What sort of firewalls
do they have in place to protect against hackers. How
do they handle viruses? Like other businesses, your
hosting company should have a disaster plan of its
own to deal with problems like these. If you are using
your own servers to operate your Web site, you should
be able to answer these questions yourself.
Whenyouactuallysitdowntocreateyourplan,keep
in mind that the process can take several months. It can
also prove difficult. It requires you to imagine the most
likely and most damaging scenarios that could face
yourbusiness—andthetwomay notbethesame.Some
of the most damaging events are impossible to foresee
in their specifics. An effective plan will take into ac-
count physical assets such as buildings and equipment;
data assets like software systems, databases, and other
electronic files, as well as the human assets of the com-
pany’s staff and management.

E-BRANDING STRATEGIES
Establishing a brand presence for your company
is one of the more crucial steps for building an Internet
business that can maintain itself through successive
economic cycles and the ups and downs of consumer
and investor confidence. Your brand is, in many ways,
your company’s calling card, and the ability to build
a lasting brand on the Internet can give you a tremen-
dous advantage in drawing consumers and businesses
to your site.
If successful, branding can boost your company’s
market valuation via increased investor confidence
and the value of your intangible assets, aid your com-
pany in weathering downturns in market conditions
or other business crises, and, finally, strengthen your
profit margins. Your company’s brand identity is one
of its most important intangible assets in an economic
climate in which intangible assets are growing increas-
ingly valuable and mission-critical. Companies, par-
ticularly in the still emerging and fickle e-commerce
industry, ignore the power of their brands at their peril.
HOW BRANDING WORKS
E-branding refers to the practice of capitalizing on
brand recognition in the online world, and thus applies
equally to click-and-mortar firms and to dot-com pure-
plays. The key is creating and promoting a viable and
memorable brand presence in the online world, and
using that brand recognition to achieve the maximum
return on investments and optimal output from sales
and marketing channels. In other words, branding is
using your brand efficiently so as to create brand
equity, or additional value customers perceive strictly
because of the brand name. Branding, moreover, is a
crucial step toward shaping the perception of your
company among customers, other businesses, invest-
ors, and even employees within your organization.
A brick-and-mortar firm attempting to build its
online presence, for example, could begin advertising
its Web site along with its established logos on their
storefront, in their print advertisements, in their direct-
mailing campaigns, and so on. Affixing the address
of the company’s Web site to a recognizable logo or
other company marker is among the most common
methods of e-branding.
In this way, companies can not only use the Internet
to attract new business, but also to give positive rein-
forcement to existing customers, thereby improving
customer loyalty and reducing turnover. This carries
the added benefit of keeping costs down, since in
general it costs less to maintain an existing customer
relationship than to develop a new one.
And, as many analysts point out, Internet branding
can be even more important than branding in the real
world, since, in the real world, customers can simply
run across physical advertisements, and needn’t even
know the company name’s correct spelling in order
to shop there. On the Internet, such a customer would
have a much harder time finding the company in the
absence of a strong and effective e-branding strategy.
Ideally, your firm should strive to create a harmoni-
ous and symbiotic relationship between all its brand-
ing channels, including print, radio, television, bill-
boards and other physical advertisements, and, of
course, the Internet. The idea is to make discovering
your company, shopping at its physical and online
storefronts, and deriving information from and about
the firm as easy and as useful as possible, while keep-
ing costs low and maximizing the return on your
investment.
BEYOND SIMPLE NAME RECOGNITION
The other component of the e-branding strategy,
beyond simple improving recognition and drawing
customers to your storefront, is to simplify the custom-
er’s online experience at your site and make it opti-
mally useful to his or her tastes and desires. This can
be accomplished in a number of ways. For instance,
a few simple questions and a short registration form
can create a customer profile, which you can then use
in conjunction with databases and specialized software
to personalize the customer’s visit to your site by
alerting him or her to upcoming sales, matching adver-
tising to the customer’s tastes, and other means. Based
on a customer’s previous purchases or expressed inter-
ests on your site, for example, you can use your data-
bases to send out e-mails tailored to his or her particu-
lar tastes.

Successful branding usually conveys, in a very
short space, something unique and personal about your
company, something that a customer will remember
and find appealing enough to visit your Web site.
Ideally, this means that when a customer visits your
Web site, it appears that the logo and interface seem
to be addressing them personally. Thus, successful
branding means, above all, truly knowing your market
and your customers.
Your branding strategy should influence customer
preference, ease the customer’s experience in dealing
with your firm, and distinguish your company from
your competition. In a sense, then, e-branding is not
about branding the product you’re selling; rather, it’s
about branding the user’s Internet experience at your
site, making that experience an easy, enjoyable, useful,
and identifiable endeavor.
IMPLEMENTING YOUR E-BRANDING
STRATEGY
In creating your e-branding strategy, you have a
number of options, and the correct choices will be
specific to your market, capabilities, and goals. For
example, do you want to leverage an existing brand
or create a completely new brand for the online envi-
ronment? What kind of product or service is your e-
brand trying to communicate, and how will your brand
reflect that? E-branding is accomplished primarily in
the synergy between a well-designed Web site and
a comprehensive e-marketing scheme, which could
include everything from banner advertisements and
affiliate relationships to direct e-mail marketing.
In addition, e-branding has grown into an industry
in its own right. As a result, your options have ex-
panded: instead of devising and implementing your
own e-branding strategy, you can also choose to out-
source the entire range of operations to one of the
many firms specializing in e-branding services.

E-COMMERCE BUSINESS MODELS
Business models are the basic blueprints from
which you build your business, defining at the outset
what kind of business you will be running. There were
41
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
a variety of business models available to e-commerce
entrepreneurs (a few of which are described below).
Some are indigenous to the Internet economy, and
some are traditional business models adapted to the
specific demands of e-commerce. In some ways, your
business model will be dictated by the kinds of prod-
ucts and services you offer, but the unique environ-
ment of the Internet economy offers a great deal of
flexibility and room for innovation, and you should
work with and build the exact business model that
suits your firm.
BEFORE YOU BEGIN
When developing a business model for the new
economy, it is helpful to imagine a one-dimensional
continuum. On one side of the continuum is the old
economy business (brick and mortar), while at the
other extreme is the dot.com pure play—an exclu-
sively online business. In the space between the two
business models lays the hybrid business, which was
the most common in the early 2000s.
There are numerous business models along the
continuum, and their placement on the continuum de-
pends on their degree of connectivity, interactivity,
and speed. In other words, the higher the degree of
interactivity, connectivity, and speed that the business
is implementing in their operations, the closer it gets
to the purely cyber side of the spectrum.
WHAT IS THE RIGHT MODEL FOR YOUR
BUSINESS?
To answer this question, you must first define two
things:
T
What is the current status of your business? Are
you an established brick and mortar business that
wants to develop an online channel? Or are you
a startup trying to sketch out a business model
from scratch?
T
Which combination of connectivity, interactivity,
and speed is optimal for your product or service
and for your customers?
TAKING AN EXISTING BUSINESS INTO
THE INTERNET MARKET.
If you have an established business, let’s say a
store that sells office supplies, your best bet is to start
by establishing an online sales channel that will help
you feature your products on your Web site. You can
start, for example, by implementing an 80/20 ratio of
brick-and-mortar and online operations, meaning that
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

42
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
you will have a simple Web site that will offer a
description of your products, and the ability to view
them online, but with limited interactivity. Then, con-
tinue to develop and upgrade your site to allow your
customers to order online as well. Depending on your
location, customer base, and competitive advantage,
you might be able to conduct the majority of your
business online at some point down the road.
Another important element in your decision on
your business model should include an accurate as-
sessment of your customers’ needs. Before you de-
velop any e-commerce application, do some research
into the needs and wants of your customers. You
might develop a questionnaire asking your customers
what features and services that they would like avail-
able to them at your online storefront. Only then
should you start the process of determining the best
avenue for your expanding into electronic commerce.
CHOOSING THE IDEAL BUSINESS MODEL
FOR A START UP
Again, the answer to this questions depends on the
type of product or service you offer, as well as on
your potential customers. Generally speaking, it is
faster and cheaper to start a small dot.com pure play
than a brick-and-mortar business. But these lower bar-
riers to market entry also mean you will likely be one
of hundreds or even thousands of similar businesses.
The biggest advantage of a combination of brick-
and-mortar and online business—often called the
‘‘brick-and-click’’ model—is that your brick-and-
mortar supplies you with the necessary cash flow
while you are building and establishing your e-busi-
ness. Remember that it can take two to three years
(if you do everything right) for your online business
to generate operating profit. Until then, you need the
necessary capital to keep the business going.
AFFILIATE MODEL. The affiliate (or click-through)
model is characterized by a relationship in which your
company agrees to pay an affiliate company in ex-
change for advertising space and a link to your site.
Your firm pays the affiliate a small commission for
each sale that can be traced back to a customer ‘‘click-
ing through’’ from an affiliate to the your Web site.
The deal provides cash flow to affiliates and a steady
stream of traffic to the your site, cutting customer-
acquisition costs and allowing your firm to target its
desired audience.
You may opt to run your affiliate network in-house
or farm it out to third-party service that will manae
the network, issue regular checks to affiliates, and
address technical problems. The sales commission
paid to affiliates generally falls between five and seven
percent, according to Forbes although, depending on
the type of arrangement, the size of the firms, and the
click-through rates, commissions often reach as high
as 15 percent. The most common format for routing
visitors to a merchant was the ubiquitous banner ad-
vertisement, the electronic ‘‘billboards’’ sprawled
across Web pages. These provide your firm with vir-
tual storefronts all over the Web, rather than only on
your own site.
MERCHANT MODEL. The merchant model of e-com-
merce involves the establishment of an electronic
storefront on your Web site; an information-technol-
ogy infrastructure capable of receiving and processing
orders; appropriate security measures to assure the
safety, secrecy, and authenticity of transaction infor-
mation; and means for procuring payments—either
online or in the physical world—and completing or-
ders via shipping and delivery. Under this broad out-
line, however, the specific definition of a merchant
model depends on your particular market conditions,
financial ability, and technological capabilities.
COMMUNITY MODEL. The community model is a way
to develop an online presence in which you essentially
provide the space for interested individuals or bus-
ineses to congregate onlne and share information, con-
cerns, and build commercial relationships. Web com-
munities allow companies to use the Web to open
up new channels for customer support and outreach,
advertising, sales, ordering, distribution, and commu-
nication. Web communities were increasingly a key
element of business plans, facilitating one-to-one, one-
to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many lines of
communication and cooperation with such electronic
tools as forums, chat rooms, email lists, message
boards, and other interactive Internet mechanisms,
usually tailored to the particular community.
BROKERAGE MODEL. The brokerage model refer to
a variety of configurations in which your firm brings
sellers and buyers together to engage in transactions,
charging a small fee to at least one of those parties.
Examples of the brokerage model include everything
from Web sites posting simple online classified ads
and Internet shopping malls (central sites selling items
produced by many different companies) to business-
to-business exchanges, online auction sites, and shop-
ping bots.
MANUFACTURER MODEL. If you’re in the business of
building your own products, the manufacturer model
of e-commerce takes maximum advantage of the bene-
fits of e-commerce and modern information technol-
ogy, allowing your firm to build products and deliver
them to customers directly via direct Internet commu-
nication. In this case, you reduce or eliminate the
expense of relying on wholesalers and distributors to
get your products to your customers, rusulting in
higher profit margins and lower costs for your cus-
tomers.

E-COMMERCE EDUCATION AND
TRAINING
E-commerce entrepreneurs vary widely in terms
of their e-commerce education and experience. Some
are information technology (IT) specialists with mini-
mal training in business management. Others are sea-
soned business owners looking to launch online sales
for the first time. A few have backgrounds in both
technology and business, and many have experience
with neither. Entrepreneurs looking for e-commerce
education and training can turn to private companies,
community colleges and universities, associations,
and other organizations. And, not surprisingly, e-com-
merce courses and tutorials are offered via the In-
ternet.
TYPES OF E-COMMERCE TRAINING
If you are looking for a structured program that
offers certification, you can visit a site like Ed-x.com,
which allows users to search for certification programs
by keyword. One option is the University of California
Extension Online, which offers several courses cov-
ering specific e-commerce topics like marketing, busi-
ness engineering, and systems design. Classes can be
taken separately or as part of a certification program.
JER Groups, Inc. also offers online certificate pro-
grams. Instructor-led course titles include WebSite
101: E-commerce Strategies for the Entrepreneur, and
Proven Success in Building an E-Business.
If you’re simply interesting in taking a class or two,
or in offering e-commerce training to your employees,

Cardean University offers online e-commerce classes
in areas ranging from business-to-business (B2B) e-
commerce to online privacy. In a similar vein, Serebra
Learning Corp. offers online courses in strategy and
security, and the materials are also available on CD-
ROM. Another education and training provider, Ele-
mentK.com, sells annual subscriptions to its E-Busi-
ness Library to both individuals and businesses. The
firm also offers various instructor-led and self-paced
online courses covering basic concepts and managing
e-commerce. Prices vary from a less than a hundred
dollars for simple tutorial courseware to several thou-
sand dollars for live on-site training.
Many free e-commerce resources for entrepreneurs
are also available. For general e-commerce informa-
tion, the E-Commerce Times site offers a small busi-
ness section, as well as news about the industry in
general. Another site, E-Commerce News, also covers
the latest e-commerce happenings. The Education Por-
tal for Ecommerce offers news, industry reports, and
discussion forums, along with training and a certifica-
tion program. In addition, the entrepreneurial maga-
zines Inc.com and Entrepreneur.com offer e-com-
merce sections on their sites.
If you’re most concerned with a specific task re-
lated to e-commerce, such as Web site design, you
can turn to a specialized education and training site
like Session.com, which operates as an accredited
online school of design. If you prefer to learn the
basics of Web design on your own, you can visit sites
like Builder.com and WebMonkey.com. Both offer
extensive Web design and construction resources, in-
cluding various tutorials, for free. Builder.com in-
cludes an HTML primer and sections dubbed Web
Building Essentials, Graphics 101, and Streaming Me-
dia 101 in its How-To Library. WebMonkey also of-
fers a How-to Library with various sections including
Web authoring, which covers HTML basics, tables,
frames, browsers, style sheets, and tools.
Other sites offer extensive information and re-
sources on applied topics of importance to e-com-
merce entrepreneurs, such as merchant accounts,
shopping carts, and Web hosting. For example, Mer-
chantSeek.com, along with listing the lowest-priced
merchant account providers and information about
what types of services each provider offers, provides
detailed information about what a merchant account
is and whether or not you need one.
CHOOSING THE APPROPRIATE
EDUCATION FORMAT
The types of e-commerce education and training
you choose for yourself and your employees will de-
pend on a wide variety of factors, including personal
preference and learning styles, budget, training needs,

and time available for training. When IBM Corp. de-
cided to shift its focus to e-business services, it em-
barked upon a three-year training program that cost
millions of dollars. According to IBM executive Mark
Frank, quoted in a May 2001 issue of Computer
Weekly, IBM focused on creating very measurable
goals. ‘‘The objectives had to be really straightfor-
ward. We were setting targets for numbers of people
to reach specific skill levels. We had a one to five
scale where five is extremely expert. And we reported
back monthly to the board on our progress.’’ While
you and your employees might not require such a
regimented program, establishing specific goals can
improve the results of education and training. Such
goals will also assist in steering your education and
training choices.

E-COMMERCE HARDWARE NEEDS
When it comes time to begin building your e-
commerce business, the first thing you need, after a
business plan, is the actual hardware necessary to
run an Internet business. Hardware includes all the
physical equipment used in a computing environment.
Depending on the scale of your organization, this can
range from a few items to a wide array of interconnect-
ing hardware.
COMPUTER HARDWARE
The basis of your Internet business is the computers
themselves. At the heart of any computer is the central
processing unit (CPU), the component that accepts,
interprets, and performs all program instructions and
functions. Strictly speaking, the CPU is just a small
chip that would fit in the palm of your hand. But it
can’t do anything on its own. It requires a moth-
erboard, memory chips (RAM), and other compo-
nents. In order to function at all, the CPU also needs
to accept data from inputs and send its completed
tasks along to outputs. Inputs include items like the
standard keyboard and mouse, while outputs include
monitors and printers. Together, input and output com-
ponents are known as peripherals.
In addition, your computer needs internal storage
systems, like a hard disk. Hard disk drives come prein-
stalled in most computers, and you can configure your
own storage if you build your own system. However,
a standard hard drive may not contain as much space
as you need to store all the data you will use, and, at
any rate, it is important to back up important data.
Secondary or external storage devices can satisfy these
needs. Often, these items, including CD-ROM drives,
Zip drives, and so on, are sold with new computers,
but you may wish to purchase separate drives with
more power or more appropriate configurations.
Computers can be classified according to their size
and power into three general categories. Microcom-
puters include the typical desktop and portable PCs
and workstations as well as hand-held devices. Most
of these adhere to one of the two major standards:
PC-compatible or Macintosh compatible. The one you
favor depends largely on personal taste but also on
the needs of your organization. Midrange computers
are larger and more powerful, but also considerably
more expensive. They typically have multiple proces-
sors and other features to maximize speed and
throughput. Mainframes are the standard for running
high-end corporate applications and some world-class
Web sites, with tremendous storage, processing, and
networking capabilities, but can be extremely expen-
sive for smaller firms.
NETWORK HARDWARE
Network adapters and modems are devices that
allow computers and their peripherals to communicate
with other computers. Network adaptors, also called
network interface cards (NICs), allow your computer
to participate in a local area network (LAN) and trans-
mit data at relatively high speeds. The most widely
used standard for network adapters, Ethernet, comes
in a few different speeds. The standard 10/100 mega-
bits per second (Mbps) Ethernet card is by far the
most common. These adapters usually transmit at 10
Mbps, which is adequate for low-volume needs, but
can be configured to run on a high-speed network at
100 Mbps. Actual transmissions, though, can be less
than promised due to network traffic and other bottle-
necks. For advanced applications, Ethernet cards are
also available in 1 and 10 gigabit varieties.
Meanwhile, the modem translates between the digi-
tal computer signals and analog media, like phone
lines. Most often, modems connect computers-either
workstations or mainframes-to wide area networks
(WANs) like the Internet or other dispersed networks.
Modems are available as stand-alone devices and as
add-in internal cards.

A server is a computer that coordinates the interac-
tion between shared computers and other devices, in-
cluding peripherals. The configuration of your server
depends on your business size, expected level and
schedule of traffic, and security demand, among other
factors. Depending and needs of your network, for
instance, you may choose to have several different
servers handling specific functions; a file server may
act as a common storage facility for an entire network,
while a print server may coordinate all the network’s
printing activities. Particularly over the Web, a group
of servers can also be arranged to work together in a
cluster, where each server performs an identical or
complementary function, say, retrieving Web pages.
This helps manage large bursts of traffic without over-
burdening a single server and provides continuous
uptime if one server fails. In general, the server will
be the most powerful computer in a particular network,
which may mean a sophisticated microcomputer with
a high-power processor, or for larger networks, a mid-
range or mainframe computer.
A range of devices, many of which come in hybrid
forms, are used to connect different portions of a
network. Hubs act as stops on a network where circuits
are connected. Routers pass information to each other
in large switched networks, and communicate with
each other, sharing information about the network. A
router determines which path on a network a particular
stream of information will follow. It acts as a traffic
director sending data to the correct destinations within
a network. Switches, taking orders from the router,
determine the destination address, such as an IP ad-
dress or hub or server within a larger network, and
then sets up a transmission path, determining the pre-
cise course the data should take to get from the router
to its destination.
Firewalls are hardware-software combinations in-
tended to protect sensitive information, and usually
involves a two-server setup, where the firewall is
placed between the two servers so that internal data
is protected while those within the network can still
interact seamlessly with users outside the firewall.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
As always, the precise configuration will depend
on the needs of your organization. You don’t want
to over-invest in fancy, state-of-the-art hardware and
peripherals if you’re running a low-key operation,
nor should you try to run a sophisticated, ambitious
enterprise on low-end equipment. As you grow your
business from a start-up to a significant player, you’ll
want to be sure your hardware is scalable. That is,
rather than having to rebuild your network from the
ground up every time your networking needs change,
you’ll want to generate the greatest return on your
initial investment by using hardware with speed and

storage capacities that can be easily upgraded in incre-
ments as your firm grows.

E-COMMERCE INCUBATORS
Business incubators are essentially business, gov-
ernment, or academic organizations that offer support
to start-up companies in their earliest stages of devel-
opment. Like an incubator for eggs, a business incuba-
tor offers a secure environment in which fledgling
companies can grow and develop before they are
‘‘hatched’’ as independent entities.
ORIGINS OF BUSINESS INCUBATORS
Business incubators emerged in the 1970s when
universities began providing office space, materials,
equipment, and other forms of support to both students
and instructors working on business or technology
plans that university officials considered promising.
At roughly the same time, corporations willing to
invest considerable sums of money in research and
development started to use incubators to allow em-
ployees to develop innovative products ideas in-house.
In the 1980s, venture capitalists began allowing entre-
preneurs with a history of launching successful ven-
tures to work in their offices on developing ideas
for new companies. Small business organizations also
began offering entrepreneurs incubation services for
a fee.
E-COMMERCE INCUBATION
A new form of business incubators emerged in the
late 1990s as the Internet revolution took hold. At
the time, speed-to-market had become the primary
concern for Web entrepreneurs. For example, many
business analysts believed that the success of Internet

E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
auction giant eBay was due to the fact that eBay had
established itself first in the online auction market.
By the time rivals launched their own auction sites,
eBay had already secured millions of loyal customers
who weren’t likely to try a new online service. As
the Journal of Business Strategy reported in May
2002, ‘‘One way investors could enable inventors or
entrepreneurs to bring their products or services to
market at light speed was to take all the mundane
care of building a business away from them... thus
the incubator concept was copied from the R&D lab
at universities and corporations.’’ These new e-com-
merce incubators were also different from their prede-
cessors in that they operated as for-profit businesses.
To make money, they required entrepreneurs to hand
over as much as 75 percent ownership in their compa-
nies in exchange for office space, equipment like high-
speed Internet connections and PCs, staffing, and addi-
tional services.
The number of e-commerce incubators grew rap-
idly in the late 1990s, from 24 in 1997 to 213 in 2000.
Firms like CMGI, idealab!, and Internet Capital Group
focused solely on offering incubation services to In-
ternet start-ups, believing that they would be able to
cash in on lucrative dot-com initial public offerings
(IPOs) as these firms matured. However, when invest-
ors became less willing to fund unprofitable dot-com
upstarts in 2000, dot-com stock prices tumbled.
Sources of funding for e-commerce ventures began
to disappear, and many young businesses, unable to
secure additional capital for expansion, were forced
into bankruptcy. Suddenly firms like CMGI and ide-
alab!, both of which had been valued at more than
$40 billion in early 2000, found that many of the
companies in which they held large stakes were no
longer worth funding. Many analysts criticized e-com-
merce incubators for not requiring start-ups to submit
business plans based on proven business models and
for simply attempting to incubate too many different
businesses.
By the early 2000s, the number of e-commerce
incubators had decreased. In addition, those that sur-
vived trimmed their ranks to focus on only those
ventures most likely to be profitable in the near future.
For example, the companies funded by CMGI de-
creased from 80 in 1999 to 9 by the end of 2000.
However, many entrepreneurs continue to opt for in-
cubation over other forms of funding, like venture
capital or angel investments (those made by wealthy
individuals interested in funding a start-up). Ac-
cording to Entrepreneur columnist Cynthia Harring-
ton, ‘‘Angels and VCs don’t help as much on a day-
to-day basis; the incubator, however, is always there.
The incubator staff fills needed functions, freeing you
up to focus on your company’s larger goals and strat-
egies.’’
CHOOSING AN INCUBATOR
If you plan to use an incubator, be aware that if
you seek support from a for-profit incubator, you’ll
be expected to transfer anywhere from 50 to 75 percent
of your company’s equity to the incubator. Therefore,
it’s essential that you research your options carefully.
The National Business Incubation Association oper-
ates a Web site that allows you to search for incubators
by region.
Nearly all incubators will require you to submit
some sort of a business plan, which explains clearly
things like how you plan to launch operations, secure
customers, and make a profit. Be as specific as possi-
ble. The most successful business plans establish a
precise target market and are based on a proven busi-
ness model. If you are accepted by an e-commerce
incubator, you can expect your incubation period to
last roughly two to three years. When you are
‘‘hatched’’, you may still need to secure outside fund-
ing for expansion. In this situation, being incubated
will likely prove an advantage, according to a Febru-
ary 2001 issue of Entrepreneur.com. ‘‘When the incu-
bated start-up seeks capital, the valuations are typi-
cally higher because the company has a launched site
and a strong management team.’’

E-COMMERCE STANDARDS
E-Commerce standards, relating to both technol-
ogy and ethical business practices, have evolved rap-
idly since the mid-1990s as companies strive to create

universal practices that enable them to handle business
transactions across industries and on a global basis.
Use of such standards, including electronic data inter-
change (EDI), extensible markup language (XML),
and standards related to security on the Web—such as
secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security
(TLS)—has become increasingly widespread. Com-
panies also adhere to ethical codes, including those
that have been adopted by the Council of Better Busi-
ness Bureaus Inc. and its Web-related subsidiary,
BBBOnline. E-commerce standards, or ‘‘best prac-
tices’’, are typically set forth by consortiums made
up of large computer-related firms or of industry orga-
nizations and government agencies.
EDI is the exchange of business data by computer.
In 1979, the American National Standards Institute
created the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC)
X12 to develop a uniform standard for exchanging
electronic business data across industries. These stan-
dards are used for business documents including in-
voices, purchase orders, schedules, planning reports,
shipping and receiving, and financial reports. Many
EDI software packages are on the market, including
bTrade DTNgine by bTrade Inc., Baan E-Enterprise
by Bann N.V., Clearbridge Document Exchange Net-
work by Clearbridge Inc., Epicor Vantage EDI by
Epicor Software Corp., and Microsoft Corp.’s BizTalk
Server. By adopting EDI standards, you can improve
inventory management, accuracy, business relation-
ships, and customer service, as well as cut costs and
increase sales. In 2002, approximately 300,000 orga-
nizations utilized over 300 EDI-related standards.
As e-commerce became increasingly popular dur-
ing the 1990s, another standard developed, known as
XML. Created by the World Wide Web Consortium
in 1996, XML is a Web language that allows business
data to be exchanged over the Internet. Like most
standards related to e-commerce, XML has continued
to evolve, and in May 2001, the United Nations Center
for Trade Facilitation and the Organization for the
Advancement of Structured Information Standards
(OASIS) approved a new ebXML (electronic busi-
ness) standard. Companies including Oracle Corp.,
Microsoft Corp., IBM Corp., and Sybase Inc. provide
XML software, which is typically less expensive for
a small to mid-sized company than EDI.
There are also standards related to security on the
Internet., SSL was developed by Netscape Communi-
cations, adopted as a universal standard, and used for
secure communication between clients and servers.
SSL basically allows a consumer to purchase an item
online in a secure fashion. It uses public-key cryptog-
raphy, which enables information to travel over the
Internet protected from interception or modification.
The TSL standard, a new version of SSL, was devel-
oped by the Internet Engineering Task Force in the
47
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
late 1990s. Security issues are typically handled by
your Internet Service Provider. However, if you host
your own Web site, security software Entrust Technol-
ogies or from Certicom Corp., Novell Inc., IBM, Mi-
crosoft, or Sun Microsystems Inc.
Along with technology-related e-commerce stan-
dards, you should generally follow a ‘‘best practices’’
code of conduct when operating an online business.
BBBOnline’s Code of Online Business Practices in-
cludes five principles that it suggests should be fol-
lowed by both online merchants and online advertis-
ers. These principles are based on truthful and accurate
communication, disclosure, information practices and
security, customer satisfaction, and protecting chil-
dren. BBBOnline also provides a Reliability Seal that
can be placed on your Web site to inform customers
that you are a member of your local BBB and a Privacy
Seal, which is earned after you meet the BBB’s re-
quirements related to handling private customer infor-
mation.
Many organizations are involved in the creation
and development of e-commerce standards. Most of
them provide valuable information that can help you
understand the standards and how they should be used.
Some of the more popular include Microsoft’s Biz-
Talk.org, the Data Interchange Standards Association
(DISA), OASIS, and the World Wide Web Consor-
tium (W3C).
BizTalk.org was created by Microsoft in 1999 to
support XML users and developers and to provide
information on how XML can be used in your busi-
ness. OASIS, founded in 1993, also acts as a global
consortium focused on the development and adoption
of e-commerce standards related to security, XML,
and interoperability within and between marketplaces.
DISA was created in 1987 by ASC X12 to oversee
the X12 standards development process. The group
encourages cross-industry e-business standards and
provides support to e-commerce, standards, and XML
specification development organizations. W3C was
founded in October 1994 to develop common stan-
dards that promote the use of the Web. Its main op-
erating principles revolve around universal access, a
Web based on XML language, trust, interoperability,
evolvability, decentralization, and advance multi-
media.
While e-commerce standards remain subject to in-
dustry approval and adoption, such standards will con-
tinue to evolve and develop in order to facilitate In-
ternet-related business. A Gartner Group analyst
summed up the information technology industry’s mo-
tivation for creating standards in a 2001 E-Commerce
Times article claiming, ‘‘the whole point of e-business
is keeping information electronic so it moves through-
out all the trading partners. If all the partners have
different standards, the information flow stops. It’s

ELECTRONIC BANKING FOR
BUSINESSES
Through automated teller machines (ATMs) and
telephone information systems, electronic banking has
been available in some form for many years. Since
the early 1990s, many leading banks have also offered
online banking services through personal computers,
allowing users to connect, via modem, to a bank’s
private online system and view their accounts. In many
cases, these systems also allowed customers to do
things like transfer funds from one account to another
and print histories of their account activity. More re-
cently, banks have allowed customers to access their
accounts via the Internet, doing away with the proprie-
tary software and systems they had used previously.
These services let businesses conduct banking transac-
tions without having to deal with long lines or limited
branch hours.
ONLINE BILLING
During
the
late
1990s,
various
technologies
emerged to allow businesses to streamline their bank-
ing. For example, electronic bill presentment and pay-
ment (EBPP) services, offered by companies like
CheckFree Corp., began gaining popularity. EBPP
technology allows businesses to bill clients and secure
payment via the Internet. Invoices are typically trans-
mitted by an e-mail message that includes a link to
an online payment service provider’s Web site. This
site houses more detailed billing information and
allows payees to make an electronic payment with a
single click. Of course, to use this technology, clients
must be willing to create an account with an online
payment processor and grant it permission to withdraw
funds from their bank accounts. Quite often, a com-
pany’s ability to use EBPP depends upon how com-
fortable their clients are with the Internet.
VIRTUAL BANKS
Businesses that want to conduct all their internal
banking tasks online can use virtual banks, such as
Netbank. A virtual bank is one without traditional
brick-and-mortar banking operations, allowing it to
operate with much lower overhead costs. Entrepre-
neur columnist Juan Hovey explains that a virtual
bank ‘‘needs no brick-and-mortar branches, no secure
vaults, no tellers, and no managers, so it brings signifi-
cant costs savings to the game.’’ Virtual banks can
then pass these savings along to customers in the
form of lower fees and more attractive interest rates.
According to a 2002 survey completed by Bankra-
te.com, a typical Internet-based bank requires custom-
ers to keep an average of $1,240 in their interest-
bearing checking accounts to avoid a monthly fee,
while traditional banks require roughly $2,330. This
monthly fee is, on average, $7.36 at Internet banks,
compared to $10.67 at traditional banks. In addition,
the average interest rate paid on such an account is
1.84 percent at Internet banks, versus 0.61 percent at
traditional banks.
To compete with these pure-play Internet opera-
tions, many traditional banks have started increasing
their online offerings. In fact, according to a July 2001
issue of Entrepreneur, ‘‘traditional banks now offer
almost everything Internet-only institutions do, steal-
ing the convenience advantage and adding the trust
factor of an established institution.’’ The issue of trust
has proved to be an important one for online banks.
Even though Internet banks like E*Trade Bank and
Netbank have had no major security breaches and are
FDIC-insured, ‘‘handing over money to a bank that
exists only in cyberspace is too big a leap of faith for
some entrepreneurs.’’
CHOOSING A BANK
Analysts recommend shopping around to find a
bank, Internet-based or otherwise, that offers both the
rates and the services you are seeking. To start, you
might consider paying a visit to Bankrate.com, which

compiles lists of the banks offering the best checking
and savings account rates. If you prefer a bank with
a local brick-and-mortar office that you can visit on
occasion, you can search Bankrate’s database by loca-
tion to find the best rates for checking and savings
accounts in your area. Also, if you are curious abut
the financial condition of your current financial insti-
tution, Bankrate.com compiles ratings for a wide num-
ber of banks and credit unions.
Banks’ Internet-based services for small businesses
vary widely. Some offer simple account management
services, while other offer payroll direct deposit, wire
transfers, online bill presentment and payment ser-
vices, and sophisticated cash flow reports. According
to a 2002 report published by Speer & Associates,
many banks don’t do a good job of tailoring their
services to meet the specific needs of small businesses.
Therefore, it is important to ask prospective banks
specific questions about what services you can expect.
Fortunately, several analysts predict that banks will
begin increasing their focus on the online services
they offer small businesses.

EMPLOYEE RETENTION
As in any type of business, a loyal staff builds a
solid foundation for growing your e-commerce enter-
prise. Staff loyalty is often gauged by employee reten-
tion. ‘‘Churn’’ and ‘‘turnover,’’ on the other hand,
refer to how fast employees leave the company. While
some turnover is inevitable due to poor performance,
49

S O U R C E B O O K
employee relocation, retirement, and personal circum-
stances, business owners should strive to keep turn-
over as low as possible.
The average turnover for private-sector jobs in the
United States is about 12 percent a year. Research
cited by Call Center News Service found rates of 31
percent annually in call centers, and at the extreme,
123 percent in the fast-food industry. Most businesses
aim for a much lower level than either of these. It’s
critical to make good hiring decisions and then work
hard to retain those employees.
COSTS OF EMPLOYEE TURNOVER
Employee retention is especially important in tight
labor markets, when replacing positions with qualified
workers can be challenging. By 2010 the population
of workers between the ages of 35 and 44 is projected
to decrease by 15 percent. But even under the best
market conditions, employee turnover can cost a com-
pany dearly. To calculate the cost of churn, consider
the following separation expenses: costs of conducting
exit interviews with departing employees, completing
exit paperwork, severance pay, and increased unem-
ployment taxes. Add the costs of the vacancy—over-
time for other employees who must fill in, temporary
help—and the costs of recruiting a new employee,
including advertising or employment agency fees,
time spent conducting interviews, skill and medical
testing, travel and moving expenses to relocate the
newly hired worker, training and the differential in
performance between the seasoned and the new em-
ployee.
Studies have shown that vacated positions cost a
company between 75 and 150 percent of that posi-
tion’s salary. Let’s say you hire an administrative
assistant for $30,000 annually and that worker leaves,
you can expect to spend between $22,500 and $45,000
on the separation and replacement. Other research
cited by the Call Center News Service found that
turnover costs reduced earnings and stock prices by an
average of 38 percent in four high-turnover industries.
The indirect costs of employee turnover are more
difficult to quantify, but no less significant. High churn
rates affect employee productivity. Dissatisfied work-
ers are less likely to be as conscientious and productive
as satisfied workers. Employee morale suffers, too,
as workers’ stress and tension escalate when they’re
forced to step in and assume additional responsibilities
while a position is vacant or a new employee is train-
ing. Management may also be forced to scale back or
postpone projects due to vacancies or training periods,
which, though harder to attach a price to, do affect
the bottom line.
Customers don’t like turnover either; they like
seeing the same faces and talking to the same voices

S O U R C E B O O K
each time they interact with a business—online and
offline. They like dealing consistently with staff who
know their purchasing, service, and complaint history.
Studies repeatedly show that companies with low turn-
over tend to have higher customer satisfaction ratings.
STRATEGIES FOR RETENTION
There are many things employers can do to reduce
churn and retain employees. One that comes to mind
for many people is compensation. While compensa-
tion is indeed important to workers, it’s not the only
motivator. Feeling like an integral part of an organiza-
tion and being recognized for contributions are equally
if not more important than pay alone.
Still, compensate your staff fairly, even well, and
offer benefits like health care. Since health-care costs
are high, consider surveying staff to see what types
of company plans they’d like. That may save you from
offering a more expensive option when the structure
of a lesser plan is in fact more appealing to them.
Retirement plans are important to employees too. De-
pending on the legal organization of your business,
there are likely to be a variety of plans to investigate.
To motivate workers to stay, consider company
matches to their retirement plans that vest over time.
For example, if a plan is vested over five years, and
an employee leaves after three, that person receives
60 percent (20 percent per year) of the company’s
contributions.
While turnover can occur at any point in an em-
ployee’s tenure with a company, managers should
ensure that new hires are adequately trained for their
position and fully understand their responsibilities.
Assigning a seasoned worker as a mentor to ensure
they learn the ropes can be helpful in preventing new
hires from leaving.
Managers can also reduce turnover by providing
opportunities for advancement and professional devel-
opment. If there’s no room for promotion of an em-
ployee, consider assigning a special project to chal-
lenge them—and groom them for a future position.
Perks such as tuition reimbursement or paying for
job-related career development seminars go a long
way toward demonstrating to employees that you con-
sider them a valuable investment.
Consistently recognize employees for a job well
done as often as warranted, and treat all employees
equally. For example, if you recognize an employee
from one department who goes above and beyond, be
sure employees from other departments get kudos for
similar achievements. You might also consider imple-
menting a performance-based bonus plan tied to ex-
ceeding company goals. However, don’t reward sim-
ply meeting goals, and don’t tolerate poor employee
performance. When workers see others getting away
with mediocrity, or worse, resentment builds and mo-
rale falls. Instead, when faced with a poorly per-
forming staff member, provide training, encourage
change, set expectations and develop a plan for im-
provement, or terminate the relationship. Remember
to compliment staff in public, but if criticism is
needed, do it in private.
Work/life balance is important to all employees.
Consider offering flexible work arrangements such as
telecommuting, job sharing, compressed work weeks,
and even sabbaticals after a certain number of years
to reward loyalty and longevity.
Finally, be clear about individual roles and respon-
sibilities and how each position within the company
relates to others and to the company’s strategies and
goals. Be sure employees have the tools and, more
importantly, the authority to carry out their job func-
tions.

ESSENTIAL READING IN E-
COMMERCE
Both popular and academic books have been writ-
ten on all aspects of e-commerce. Some introduce
beginners to the subject, while others are intended for
seasoned e-professionals. Still others proclaim the e-
commerce gospel or document e-business wipe-outs.
This survey of titles will help you choose a few of
the most valuable, interesting, entertaining, and influ-
ential books on e-commerce.
STARTING OUT
At one end of the scale are books for the novice
entrepreneur looking to launch an e-business or curi-
ous about what it takes. Greg Holden’s Starting an
Online Business for Dummies (second edition; Wiley,

2000) describes the raw basics of Internet business
for people who know next to nothing on the topic.
His chapters include information on finding a server,
designing and setting up a Web site, putting together a
business plan, online marketing, and customer service.
The CD-ROM that comes with the book includes
valuable Web software and utilities like Winzip. It
even has a demonstration version of CyberCash Wallet
to set up a business to accept electronic payments.
Netrepreneurs with more experience will find The
Unofficial Guide to Starting a Business Online by
Jason R. Rich (Wiley, 1999) useful. This handy paper-
back covers virtually every phase of starting and run-
ning an online business. Rich is particularly detailed
about setting an e-business up on a tight budget. He
even includes a list of common online scams to watch
out for. The book is rounded out with interviews with
experts in various fields.
Beginner and pro alike can expand their knowledge
of the technology that makes e-commerce possible
with How the Internet Works (Ziff Davis, 2002) by
Preston Gralla. Relying largely on illustrations and
graphics, Gralla shows how communication on the
Internet and important aspects of e-commerce, such
as domain names, security, Web browsers, and the
like, actually work. The Web site ‘‘How Stuff Works’’
(www.howstuffworks.com) provides similar text-
based explanations of many Internet and e-commerce
concepts.
ADVANCED IMPLEMENTATION AND
STRATEGY
Jerry Cashin’s E-Commerce Success: Building a
Global Business Architecture (Computer Technology
Research Corp., 1999) is a more advanced guide to
e-commerce. Originally released as a report of the
CTR Corporation, the book is expensive but it is rec-
ognized as a indispensable overview of e-commerce.
Written originally for Web site pros, the book gives
a concise discussion of almost every issue of impor-
tance, including the core components of e-business,
software design, Web site implementation and opera-
tion, privacy issues, security, tax and legal questions,
and transaction management. Cashin also looks at the
most common mistakes bricks-and-mortar companies
make when moving into the Internet and e-commerce
trends.
Another book for e-pros, e-Business 2.0: Roadmap
for Success (second edition; Addison-Wesley, 2000)
by Marcia Robinson, Don Tapscott, Ravi Kalakota,
and Mary O’Brien is an advanced, sometimes aca-
demic, look at the e-business strategies and their im-
plementation. The book pinpoints 20 key trends in e-
business that companies can exploit to sell more of
their products and services. It explains in a detailed
51

yet practical way first how to design an effective
online strategy and then how to select applications to
further that strategy.
INSIDER ACCOUNTS
Blueprint to the Digital Economy: Creating Wealth
in the Era of E-Business (McGraw Hill College, 1998),
edited by Don Tapscott, Alex Lowy, and David Ticoll,
weaves together accounts by executives at 30 large
corporations, including Kodak, IBM, Microsoft, and
AT&T, that have implemented e-business technolo-
gies to reach corporate goals. Its contribution is to
present first-hand experiences of successful business
people who confronted the e-commerce revolution
along with their insights into its implications for busi-
ness at-large.
The digital world has its founders and visionaries
with their own ideas about what the Internet means
for business. In Business @ the Speed of Thought:
Succeeding in the Digital Economy (Warner Books,
2000), Microsoft CEO Bill Gates describes computer
networks as ‘‘digital nervous systems’’ whose mastery
will enable companies to make huge gains in effi-
ciency, growth, and profits. Gates describes how the
technology is changing business now and the changes
that lie ahead.
Lotus Corporation CEO Jeff Papows’s Enter-
prise.Com: Market Leadership in the Information Age
(Perseus, 1999) describes a market that has been
turned on its head by the Internet, altering most funda-
mental business relationships and concepts. The result
is a ‘‘market-facing enterprise,’’ in which most as-
pects of business, including customer relationships,
marketing, legal and tax issues, and security, have
been radically redefined by digital technology. Pa-
pows illustrates his claims with examples from Lotus
and other companies.
VISION AND PRACTICE
Even the term ‘‘visionary’’ seems too narrow for
Kevin Kelly, editor of Wired magazine. Kelly’s book,
New Rules for the New Economy (Penguin, 1999),
boldly proclaims the death of the old, pre-Internet
economy, maintaining that in the virtual economy
none of the old rules apply. The only constants in
Kelly’s continuously changing digitized universe are
the computer networks that hold everything together.
He outlines a series of rules for success in the elec-
tronic economy, for example, embracing decentraliza-
tion, disequilibrium, and the absence of hierarchy, all
of which will follow the spread of the Web. He follows
up with strategies a company can use to implement
them. It should be noted that Kelly’s apocalyptic view
predated the Internet crash by a year. Nonetheless, it
is a valuable look at how the e-future once looked.

Not every author who writes about e-commerce
sees in it the seeds of the old order’s destruction.
In their book Information Rules (Harvard Business
School, 1998), Carl Shapiro and Hal R. Varian ac-
knowledge the changes wrought by the Web. At the
same time they urge e-business leaders to remember
that technological changes do not alter basic economic
laws. The key to success in the new economy, ac-
cording to Shapiro and Varian, is a grounding in the
fundamentals of traditional economics. Despite its ac-
ademic tone, the work is a source of practical insights
and information on selling products on the Internet,
valuable for both students and practitioners alike.
Customers Rule! Why the E-Commerce Honey-
moon Is Over and Where Winning Businesses Go
From Here by Roger Blackwell and Kristina Stephan
(Crown, 2001) steers clear of the hype that fueled the
Internet boom. The authors describe e-commerce as
part of the evolution of business rather than a revolu-
tionary change that completely swept out the old. Like
Information Rules, the book urges business to strike
a workable balance between ‘‘electronic’’ and ‘‘com-
merce’’ in e-commerce, to reinstill old-style business
values in the e-context. They use the examples of
successful companies like L.L. Bean to support their
view that a blend of the old and new economies—
bricks-and-mortar
and
virtual—will
make
for
stronger, sturdier businesses than either one on its
own.
When John Hagel and Arthur G. Armstrong wrote
Net Gain: Expanding Markets Through Virtual Com-
munities (Harvard Business School, 1997) in the mid-
1990s, virtual communities were the buzz and were
springing up like mushrooms. Despite all its changes,
the Internet still seems at bottom to be about communi-
ties of interest, and hence the relevance of Net Gain
dimmed but little. The authors emphasize the shift in
economic power brought about by the Web and virtual
communities—groups of individuals with a common
interest which brings them together online. According
to Hagel and Armstrong, such communities create
‘‘reverse markets,’’ in which groups of buyers seek
out sellers—rather than the other way around—and
use their size and access to information to get the best
price possible. Taking it one step further, the book
describes strategies for creating and serving highly
loyal communities which in turn will bring a company
large and steady profits.
One of the most popular e-commerce books of all
time, Unleashing the Killer App: Digital Strategies
for Market Dominance by Larry Downes, Chunka
Mui, and Nicholas Negroponte (revised edition; Har-
vard Business School, 2000), describes a climate of
innovation created by the new digital reality, a climate
in which powerful and unexpected new technolo-
gies—killer apps—can be developed. A killer app is
a technological turning point which changes the world
forever, like the printing press, the Model-T, and the
personal computer. The book’s thesis is that compa-
nies can make themselves over into organizations in
which potential killer apps are recognized, nurtured,
and ultimately lead to market dominance. They pro-
pose a series of rules for designing killer apps and
illustrate them with examples from the history of tech-
nology and business.
PITFALLS
All the books above, in one way or another, preach
the gospel of e-commerce and urge its embrace. Philip
J. Kaplan’s F’d Companies: Spectacular Dot-Com
Flameouts (Simon & Schuster, 2002) looks at the
darker side of the Internet economy, the tragicomic
flops, the companies that failed. Based on an online
forum he set up as the dot-com crash was occurring,
the book documents 150 outrageous business plans
that lost millions of dollars before they disappeared.
The result is both funny and sobering.
OTHER RESOURCES
E-commerce has been growing and evolving so
quickly since its birth in the early 1990s that most
any book is a historical snapshot by the time it is
published. Readers interested in the subject should
not ignore the media that cover it regularly, including
magazines like Fast Company, Business 2.0, and
Wired, newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and
the San Jose Mercury News, and online journals like
E-Commerce Times.

ESTABLISHING AN ONLINE
NEWSLETTER
An online newsletter, also called an e-zine—short
for electronic magazine—is the virtual equivalent of
the traditional paper newsletter. An online newsletter
has significant advantages, however. There are no
printing or mailing costs, delivery is instantaneous,
and readers can respond with a simple mouse-click.
A carefully planned, well-designed e-zine can fulfill
a number of functions for an online business: It can
recruit new customers and maintain contact with es-
tablished ones; communicate about one’s business and
area of expertise; promote a business’s Web site or
notify Web users of Web site changes. An e-zine’s
uses are ultimately limited only by one’s imagination.
Effective e-zines are the product of hard work and
should be carefully planned in advance. Before the
first issue is written, an e-publisher should consider
some important questions:
T
What is the newsletter supposed to achieve?
T
What is the subject of the newsletter?
T
Who is the newsletter’s audience?
53
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
T
How broad will the scope of the newsletter’s cov-
erage will be?
T
How often will it appear?
Newsletters contain elements that enable readers
to navigate them easily. The nameplate is a short
section at the head of each issue that includes the e-
zine’s title, the date, and a volume number. The vol-
ume number changes every year. Following the name-
plate is the masthead that lists the publisher’s name,
address, phone number, e-mail address, and Web site
URL, information about advertising if relevant, and
crucial instructions on subscribing and unsubscribing.
Next, the table of contents lists the articles in the
issue. Unlike a magazine or book, the table of contents
in an e-zine does not indicate page numbers, only the
order in which the articles appear. Finally come the
feature articles, along with any ads or classifieds.
Sections should be clearly distinguished from one
another, with space and lines, to enhance readability.
There are as many different formats as there are news-
letters, and a new e-publisher should examine as many
e-zines as possible for ideas. Once a format has been
settled on, a template can be made that will speed up
the preparation of each issue and assure consistency
of appearance. Templates can be found online at a
number of e-zine sites.
E-zines come in different forms. The full text can
be sent as an e-mail, or an e-mail can be sent with a
hyperlink to the newsletter online. The latter variant
has the advantage of increasing traffic at a Web site
and possibly of increasing hits on ads there. If sent
as an e-mail, the newsletter’s text can be prepared in
text format or in HTML. Among the advantages of
text are that it can be reproduced by every Web
browser and e-mail client, and no special knowledge
of HTML is needed to prepare it.
If text is used, it should be prepared in a text editor,
such as Windows Notepad, using a fixed-width font
such as Courier New rather than proportional fonts
like Arial or Times New Roman. Not all e-mail clients
can reproduce proportional-length fonts. By using
fixed-width fonts, e-publishers can be sure their lay-
outs will look the same to all readers. Line lengths
should be limited to 60 to 65 characters, ending with
a hard return.
HTML gives an online newsletter a more interest-
ing look because graphics, such as photos and logos,
can be included. With it comes increased download
times. Nonetheless, some readers prefer text and
others prefer HTML, so if possible it is best to offer
both variants.
The size of a newsletter is a critical factor. A too-
long issue risks alienating readers through information
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

S O U R C E B O O K
overload. In addition, some e-mail clients—in particu-
lar America Online—convert e-mail over 24K into
attachments, which many readers will simply delete
rather than risk getting a computer virus. A long
HTML issue, especially with graphics, can have frus-
tratingly long download times. A length of about 12K
is considered optimal.
There are various ways to distribute an e-zine. It
can be managed from a personal or company computer
if the subscriber base is not larger than 2000 or so.
Various software packages are available that automate
the subscription process. They range from systems
costing hundreds of dollars to freeware. Internet Ser-
vice Providers (ISP) and Web site hosts frequently
provide list hosting that can be used to distribute
and administer an online newsletter. Through these
sources, the services are generally low in price or even
free of charge. For larger subscriber lists, however,
the most efficient solution is to use a company that
specializes in list services. They can be found listed
on the Web.
An e-publisher should take care selecting the list
service. A service should be available to provide help
and customer service to the newsletter administrator.
It should ensure that the subscriber list is secure and
cannot be stolen by outsiders. It should allow the
administrator easy access to subscriber lists so they
can be backed up regularly. It should process subscribe
and unsubscribe requests promptly and should be able
to deal with bounced e-mails. It should provide data
on changes in the subscriber list, especially how many
have joined or unsubscribed in a certain period.
The biggest challenge for a new online newsletter
is finding subscribers. As a start, a subscription form
should be included on the company Web site. Addi-
tional strategies include listing the e-zine on an online
list server like Yahoo Groups or submitting the news-
letter along with an attractive description to an online
e-zine directory. Directories can be found using an
online search engine. If an e-publisher joins an ad co-
op, it will provide a subscriber list in exchange for
an ad in the newsletter. Other ideas include using a
pop-up ad on one’s Web site, offering a free gift—
for example, a useful report or piece of software—in
exchange for subscribing, and encouraging readers to
forward the newsletter to friends and acquaintances.
It can be just as challenging to keep subscribers.
People are inundated with information, much of it
from their computers. Interesting original content is
the only sure way to keep readers from deleting a
newsletter unread or unsubscribing altogether. Arti-
cles should be directly related to the subject of the e-
zine. Reprinted articles are in general considered a
sign of a second-rate newsletter; at least some content
must be original. A tantalizing subject line can also
persuade readers to open a newsletter they would
otherwise have deleted. Article ideas can be sug-
gested by:
T
reader questions
T
personal experience
T
achievements or failures
T
articles in newspapers, magazines and other out-
side media
T
interesting products or services
T
interviews
The e-publisher must decide if the overall tone of
the newsletter is to be formal or informal. However,
some lighthearted material should break up serious
items. Plain, simple words and sentences are best;
articles should be concise and to the point to hold
reader interest. The entire newsletter should be copy-
edited very carefully before it is sent out. Misspelled
words and bad grammar will weaken the power of the
message and tarnish one’s image, and if they become
habitual, they will cause subscribers to leave.
A well-written newsletter will entertain and inform
readers and create bonds between them and an online
business. The medium offers readers a means of re-
sponding instantly to what they have read. Finally, it
can also help an e-publisher form and crystallize new
ideas about his or her chosen field.

FREE VERSUS SUBSCRIPTION-
BASED SERVICES
Whether or not to charge users a subscription fee
is a major decision for most electronic information
services. Relying on advertising revenues alone has
proven insufficient for many commercial sites. Be-
cause consumers have come to expect Internet infor-
mation for free, convincing them to pay is difficult.
Some firms, however, have achieved success op-
erating a subscription-based business. Like traditional
magazines and newspapers, these firms usually rely
on both subscriptions and advertising for revenue.
LEARNING FROM LARGE SITES’
EXPERIENCES
Online newspapers made their debut in the early
1990s. The Raleigh, North Carolina-based News and
Observer became the first daily newspaper to publish
the entire paper on the Internet in 1994. By the end
of the decade, major players like the New York Times,
USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washing-
ton Post had also published online versions.
The first publisher to actually make money from
an online newspaper was WSJ.com, the online version
of the Wall Street Journal. When online advertising
revenues began to plummet in 2000, WSJ.com was
able to rely on its base of nearly 600,000 paying
subscribers for revenue. In fact, subscription sales had
begun to account for more than advertising revenues
by early 2001. One reason for WSJ.com’s success,
according to some analysts, is that its subscription
includes not only access to articles, but additional
information like detailed company information and
real-time stock quotes. A major rival, the online ver-
sion of the New York Times, doesn’t charge for its
daily online edition. As the Business Journal-Portland
reported in August 2001, ‘‘Like many online publica-
tions, NYTimes.com is leery of charging for what has
already been offered for free.’’ As of that time, the
site only charged for archive searches and a few other
special features.
One of the best-known online magazines, or e-
zines, is Slate, a news, politics, and culture site pub-
lished by Microsoft. As of late 2001, roughly 2.5
55

S O U R C E B O O K
million unique readers each month visited Slate. When
the site was established in 1996, readers were charged
a $19.95 monthly subscription fee. Three years later,
however, Slate’s publishers realized that more money
was spent on efforts to recruit paying subscribers than
was actually secured in subscription fees. According
to publisher Scott Moore, quoted in a September 2001
issue of EContent, ‘‘I projected what would happen
to our audience if we made Slate free, given that we
could take advantage of the distribution power of
MSN. I modeled what that would do for our advertis-
ing potential, and it looked like there was a lot more
upside with that strategy than continuing to slug along
selling subscriptions, so that’s what we did and it has
paid off.’’ Along with traditional banner ads, Slate
also relies on larger advertisements. In addition, the
firm makes money from companies willing to pay for
a link from Slate to their sites.
The e-zine Salon was established in 1995 to cover
political and cultural issues. Because Salon relied
solely on advertising to generate revenues, and lacked
the marketing reach Slate enjoyed on MSN, it proved
especially vulnerable to the slowdown in online adver-
tising that took place in 2000. In fact, the e-zine posted
a loss of $19.2 million that year. Recognizing that
advertising sales alone were insufficient, Salon began
developing and marketing in 2001 a premium sub-
scriber-based site with increased content and no adver-
tising.
CHOOSING A REVENUE MODEL
If you’re planning to launch an online content ser-
vice, you will need to weigh the likelihood of securing
adequate revenues from advertising against the likeli-
hood of finding customers who are willing to pay. If
you plan to launch a subscription-based site, you need
to be certain that your target market values your infor-
mation enough to pay for it.
According to an April 2001 issue of Entrepre-
neur.com, a subscription-based site ‘‘is one of the
most difficult revenue models there is. Unless you
have highly specialized information of some sort, peo-
ple will expect it to be delivered for free.’’ One option
is to offer free information in addition to subscription-
based content. ‘‘This would allow a reader to have a
substantial amount of free reading material, but access
to specialized reports, for example, would be allowed
only on a for-fee basis’’. WSJ.com, NYTimes.com,
and Salon.com all make use of such a hybrid model.
Another example is Consumer Reports Online, which
charges a fee for its product ratings and reports, but
offers more general information to consumer for free,
in an effort to draw readers to its site.
One of the biggest challenges facing new online
content sellers is marketing. Before you can work on

convincing people to pay for a subscription, you must
draw them to your site. Quite often, this requires a
variety of online marketing and offline efforts. Along
with creating e-mail campaigns, forming partnerships
with other sites willing to post a link to your site, and
strategically positioning yourself with the best search
engines, you may find you also need to use direct
mail, radio and television, and print advertising. And
as customers begin to visit your site, you will need
to monitor their activity to learn what information
they value most. If you decide to offer both free and
fee-based information, it might take you a while to
find the most lucrative mix. Understand that, like the
industry giants, you will likely have to modify your
business model to stay in step with ever-changing
market conditions.

HARVEST AND EXIT STRATEGIES
Harvest and exit strategies are examples of contin-
gency planning, designed to ensure that your company
can respond quickly and effectively to a rapidly chang-
ing business climate. They allow you to get out of
the market with as much of your value and investment
intact as possible, easing the challenges of selling or
liquidating your business. In the world of e-commerce,
these needs are even more pronounced, precisely be-
cause speed and rapid evolution are the name of the
e-business game. As a result, fortunes can turn
quickly, and smart entrepreneurs prepare for the possi-
bility that the best financial option is to exit the
market.
EXIT STRATEGIES
When it comes time to exit the market, you have
a number of options. Unfortunately, one of the most
lucrative and sought-after exit strategies of the dot-
com boom of the late 1990s—buyout of a start-up
firm by a major player for huge sums of cash—is
usually not realistic. At their peak, such buyouts only
affected a minority of start-ups, and more recently the
austerity of the 2000s e-commerce environment has
meant less loose money to go around. Still, other
options abound.
The holy grail of exit strategies for e-commerce
start-ups in the dot-com boom years of the mid- and
late 1990s was the initial public offering (IPO), where
the company has accumulated enough value that it
looks attractive to investors as a lucrative, growing
enterprise. Typically, this stage is reached after a firm
scrambles for venture capital and other private fund-
ing. IPOs bring in new stockholders as the owners of
the firm. Alternatively, you can attempt to merge with
or be acquired by a stronger company, which entails
preparing your firm’s accounts and image to make
yourself attractive to potential suitors.
In the old days of the high-tech industry, selling
a firm before it went public was a strategy of last
resort. In the dot-com era, however, it became more
common, or at least more widely publicized, after
a few e-commerce founders made their living and
reputation as career entrepreneurs. They would de-
velop novel e-commerce ideas and secure venture
capital, only to sell the company before it reached
the IPO stage. Observers have noted that, for some
entrepreneurs, getting rich this way was more oppor-
tunism rather than a planned exit strategy. Neverthe-
less, some viewed it as an exit-strategy option.
If your firm’s options for acquisition or continua-
tion seem hopeless, there are still solid exit strategies
available. You can file for bankruptcy, either Chapter
11 reorganization or Chapter 7 liquidation. Next, you
may decide that attempts to find a suitor or go through
various legal maneuvers are more costly or more has-
sle than they are worth, and simply choose to close
your virtual doors and cut your losses.
Finally, according to Business Credit, in order to
minimize the damage to your reputation and that of
your managers, and if you want to transfer your assets
to an organization unburdened by your firm’s debt,
you can choose an assignment for the benefit of your
creditors. This option, an alternative to formal bank-
ruptcy, involves transferring the title and all interests
in your business to a third party, who liquidates the

property, paying the proceeds to your creditors. This
avenue can involve less paperwork and expense than
bankruptcy, while accomplishing the desired liquida-
tion of your firm.
ADDITIONAL EXIT STRATEGY
CONSIDERATIONS
In strategic partnerships with other online busi-
nesses or with brick-and-mortar firms, it can be even
more important to have a clearly defined and commu-
nicated exit strategy. Without such a plan, you may
find yourself unintentionally divulging more informa-
tion to your partner than you otherwise would, and
may also find it difficult to fully extract yourself from
the partnership and its endeavors with the maxi-
mum value.
Keeping track of your market is another key to an
optimal exit strategy. For example, if your firm is
growing and profit margins are expanding, the obvious
inclination is to keep up the pace. But higher revenue
and greater profits, Computer Reseller News pointed
out, doesn’t always mean your firm’s market valuation
will increase. In an industry where share price-to-
earnings ratios are falling, for instance, your firm’s
valuation may decline even as profits expand.
HARVESTING YOUR FIRM’S VALUE
A harvest strategy is a transition strategy en route
to an final exit from a particular market, be it with a
particular product line or with your entire business.
In a harvest strategy, the goal is to minimize reinvest-
ment in a market you are planning to exit. In the
meantime, you still try to maximize your profit-mak-
ing capabilities. In other words, you attempt to harvest
whatever is left of a market before shutting down
operations.
By slashing your spending that line of business,
you concentrate on deriving profit from what remains
to be sold, thereby leaving you stronger when you
exit the market. Thus, a harvest strategy might call
for cutting spending on assets, labor, and other costs,
while moving existing inventory out into the market
and pocketing the profits, perhaps to reinvest in a
more stable line of business.

HIRING CONSULTANTS
Think of a consultant as a hired mentor on a particu-
lar project or transition your company will be going
through. Consultants are usually external to the com-
pany, either self-employed or on staff with a large
consultancy.
DO WE REALLY NEED A CONSULTANT?
Companies hire consultants for a wide range of
initiatives. Many times companies need consultants
not only to advise them on what to do, but to actually
complete a large portion of the job at hand. Depending
on their background and expertise, consultants can
assist with information technology (IT) issues such
as selecting and installing new computer applications
and ensuring they’re compatible with existing sys-
tems. Human resources consultants can assist with
efforts related to hiring and employee retention, staff
training, developing policy and procedure manuals.
Consultants can direct grant-writing and fund-raising
efforts. They can develop marketing plans and budgets
and walk a company through the business develop-
ment and strategic planning processes. Consultants
are likewise called in when a company simply needs
an objective opinion on a problem.
Typically companies turn to consultants when they
are looking to make some kind of change—integrate
a new accounting application, a company-wide diver-
sity training initiative, a new strategic plan, a reorgani-
zation of staff. It’s important to remember that while
consultants can assist with transitions, advising a com-
pany along the way, consultants can’t make the
changes happen single-handedly; it’s also the respon-
sibility of the company and its managers.
Having realistic expectations of how a consultant
can help your company is critical to the success of
the relationship. As in any line of work, there are
unscrupulous and incompetent consultants, but unreal-
istic hopes for a panacea can cause companies to rush
to judgment about the quality of their consultants.
If the company doesn’t implement the consultant’s
recommendations or doesn’t support and maintain the
work the consultant does, the project will ultimately
fail. Perhaps this is why cynical remarks about consul-
tants persist, such as ‘‘A consultant will take your
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
watch and then charge you to tell you what time it
is,’’ or ‘‘Those that can, do; those that can’t, teach;
those that can’t teach, consult.’’ Don’t fall into the
trap of thinking that because you hired a consultant,
there’s no more work for you or your staff to do on
that particular initiative.
Consultants don’t come cheap. Rates commonly
range from $100 to up to $500 per hour or between
$700 to several thousand dollars per day. Some con-
sultants charge on a project rather than hourly basis,
and some ask for a percentage of future revenue tied
to the project they worked on. Before hiring, you must
feel confident that your investment will be worth-
while. Ask yourself if you have the necessary skills
and expertise to carry out the project among your
staff. If so, how long would it take them to complete
this project? What does their time cost, and what are
the opportunity costs, the work they won’t be able to
do if they’re completing this project? In short, is the
project the best use of your staff’s time?
FINDING THE RIGHT CONSULTANT FOR
THE JOB
If you decide to hire a consultant, there are several
ways to obtain names of prospects. Professional asso-
ciations are one place to start. Many industries have
one or more professional consulting associations, and
these often have member directories. Asking col-
leagues is another way to find consultants, as are Web
searches.
No matter how you find names, the selection pro-
cess is a telling and crucial part of hiring a consultant.
You may want to develop and send out a formal
request for proposal (RFP) or simply contact the
names you’ve found. Once you make contact, you can
request background information about the consultant’s
experience and schedule an interview.
Assemble a team for the interview, drawing on both
managers and staff who will work with the consultant.
Make sure you ask each candidate the same questions
so that you can make an accurate comparison after
the interviews are completed. In addition to questions
about the consultants’ experience, be sure to ask about
relationships with vendors and objectivity. Informal
but positive working relationships with software ven-
dors, for example, may mean that the consultant will
have greater expertise—and ready technical support—
in a particular application. On the other hand, financial
arrangements with vendors could compromise a con-
sultant’s objectivity.
Also pay attention to how prospective consultants
communicate, in both sharing and listening to infor-
mation, and how they seem to ‘‘click’’ with your staff.
A personality that fits well with your organization is
important to a successful relationship.
During the interview, also be sure to ask about
consultants’ work processes. How will the project
unfold? How will the consultant communicate up-
dates? What will they need from your staff in order
to get the job done? How consultants respond will
also help you determine if they truly understand your
company’s challenges and project objectives.
Before hiring, ask for references, and be sure to
call them. Ask why the consultant was hired, if expec-
tations and objectives were met on deadline, whether
the consultant worked well with staff, and whether
the reference would hire the consultant for a future
project.
CLOSING THE DEAL
Once you’ve decided on a particular consultant,
be sure to reiterate your budget and time frame, the
scope of your project, key staff, and payment arrange-
ments, including amount and dates of payment. All
of these details should be formalized in an agreement.
To ensure a smooth working relationship, keep the
lines of communication open, and be honest with your
consultant about your expectations and needs through-
out the project. Stick to deadlines or, if that’s not
possible, work with the consultant to modify your
initial plan. Perhaps most importantly, be open to the
changes you initiated by hiring the consultant and the
benefits their work may bring.

INSURANCE ISSUES FOR ONLINE
FIRMS
One reason businesses use insurance is to protect
themselves against loss from things like natural disas-
ters, thefts, and other liabilities. Most property insur-
ance policies cover physical damages, such as
smashed windows or broken computers, and the ef-
fects of those damages, such as loss of sales. However,

the less tangible threats many online businesses face,
such as computer viruses, hackers, or server crashes,
can also have a devastating impact on operations, yet
these things are quite often not covered by traditional
policies.
EMERGENCE OF INTERNET INSURANCE
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, as the number
of online businesses soared, many insurers began of-
fering Internet insurance. One of the first was IN-
SUREtrust.com, which began indemnifying e-com-
merce ventures in late 1999. Early the next year,
American International Group Inc., one of the largest
U.S. insurance groups, launched several insurance
products designed to protect Internet businesses. In
July 2000, another insurance giant, Lloyd’s of Lon-
don, joined forces with Counterpane Security Inc. to
develop an insurance program that protects businesses
from attacks against computer hackers. For small busi-
nesses, these policies ranged from $2,500 to $15,000
per year, and they covered Internet-related damages,
such as data loss due to viruses and costs associated
with security breaches caused by hackers.
Most businesses protect themselves and their data
by scheduling regular system backups and keeping
those backup files at a separate location. Most online
businesses also use firewalls and encryption software
to protect against hackers and viruses. However, none
of these methods is fail-safe. In 2002, experts esti-
mated that more than 58,000 computer viruses were
in circulation. While leading anti-virus vendors like
Norton Utilities allow customers to download virus
updates on a regular basis, the continual emergence
of new virus codes leaves even the most vigilant busi-
nesses susceptible.
In March 2002, Newsfactor reported ‘‘the damages
to small businesses, which can’t afford the downtime
or the sophisticated technology experts to keep up
with the onslaught, are mounting. Even more discon-
certing to the small business operator could be the
looming issue of legal liability.’’ Many experts believe
that company security measures will be evaluated in-
creasingly in legal terms, and those found lacking
could be held liable for putting other systems at risk.
PROTECTING YOUR INVESTMENT
To determine if your business needs Internet cover-
age, also known as e-commerce insurance or hacker
insurance, you need to consider what risks your com-
pany faces on a daily basis. Along with considering
how something like a server crash or virus could
negatively affect your operations, think about the im-
pact those sorts of disasters might have on your cus-
tomers. A February 2001 issue of BuyerZone.com
warned that you may need this type of insurance ‘‘if
59
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
your business uses email or has a Web site that hosts
transactions, posts content, hosts advertising for other
businesses, or contains confidential information. Es-
sentially, if there is any conceivable way that a client
could contend that the performance of your Web site,
products, or services affected his or her business and
sue you for it, you need to think about Internet in-
surance.’’
As with most types of insurance, several different
types of Internet coverage exist. To protect yourself
from litigation by clients claiming to be damaged by
a breakdown in your services—perhaps caused by a
virus that shut down your servers for several hours—
you can purchase liability coverage. However, if you
are at determined to be at fault for the problems that
causes injury or damage to your client, you can still be
found liable unless you also hold errors and omissions
(O&E) coverage. This coverage is usually more appro-
priate for business selling services online than those
simply selling products. Some insurers also offer con-
tent coverage to protect a business owner from the
risks involved in posting content, including advertise-
ments, on a Web site. Potential issues include copy-
right infringement, defamation, and false advertising.
When choosing an insurance carrier, be sure to
research your options. To get a better understanding
of how your risk level appears to insurers, you can
request a risk assessment first. This type of evaluation
will pinpoint areas that seem particularly susceptible
to hackers and viruses. Spend time familiarizing your-
self with the language of the coverage different insur-
ers offer. Because Internet insurance is still a relatively
new offering, standards have yet to emerge. As a
result, you will find significant differences in the level
of coverage offered. For example, some companies
offer to offset any lost revenues resulting from some-
thing like a virus attack, while others will only reim-
burse lost profits. Knowing exactly what types of
damages are covered and to what extent will prevent
you from being unpleasantly surprised in the future.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ONLINE
The digital age has turned the realities of intellec-
tual property (IP) upside down. Computers have made
the reproduction of articles, books, music, and images
simple and cheap; they can be distributed throughout
the world instantaneously and virtually without cost
by means of the World Wide Web. Yet, as barriers
drop for would-be authors and artists, they also drop
for illegal reproduction and distribution of intellectual
property produced by others. Thanks to digital tech-
nology and the Internet, unlimited numbers of perfect
copies of a work can be created and made available
24 hours a day to anyone in the world with access to
a computer and the Internet.
CHALLENGES TO PROTECTING
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN
CYBERSPACE
Copyright holders are interested in devising legal
and technical means to protect their online IP. This
search has created a variety of new challenges for
U.S. copyright law, which has tried for over two centu-
ries to balance private and public interests in intellec-
tual property. Under established law, IP producers
receive a time-limited monopoly after which the mate-
rial enters the public domain, where it can contribute
to progress in the arts and science.
Because of changing technology, intellectual prop-
erty producers wish to strengthen existing copyright
laws to protect their work against digital theft. The
alternative they see is the potential disappearance of
their market as soon as the first copy is sold. Civil
libertarians, librarians, researchers, and consumers, on
the other hand, worry that over-strengthening copy-
rights could lead to sweeping limitations in access to
items of the world’s intellectual and cultural heritage.
The degree to which existing law applies to the digital
realm is just beginning to be established.
Legal or not, copying has become an established
feature of life online. Recipes are copied from Web
sites, articles from online archives, songs in MP3
format, software is downloaded, although the rights
to all are owned by third parties. Esther Dyson has
urged IP owners to recognize a fundamental fact:
‘‘Intellectual property that can be copied easily proba-
bly will be copied.’’ Still, the right to control copies
of one’s work is perhaps the most fundamental right
a copyright holder possesses. Here too, though, elec-
tronic realities change the rules: in the digital realm
merely to access a work is to copy it. Software is
copied from the hard drive into memory before it can
be run; Web pages are copied from a remote computer
to one’s own computer before they can be viewed.
At first glance it seems that restricting the right to
‘‘copy’’ would make works completely unavailable
to computer users.
BEST DEFENSES
Technical solutions provide one answer. For exam-
ple, downloadable versions of software can be primed
to stop working after the demonstration period has
elapsed. Other technical solutions are more controver-
sial. IP can be encrypted so that files can be accessed
only with permission—which might only be granted
following the payment of a fee. Or they might be
encrypted so a file can be read, but not printed or
saved to disk, limiting the ability to share information
with others.
The U.S. courts have gradually begun to rule on
online IP questions. In 2001 the Napster MP3-sharing
network was closed down when an appellate court
ruled it had knowingly abetted the illegal copying of
thousands of pieces of copyrighted music that were
being downloaded on a daily basis. Around the same
time, in the Tasini decision, the Supreme Court ruled
that the New York Times had to pay thousands of
freelance writers whose work for the paper had been
licensed without their permission to the Lexis-Nexis
database.
New laws have been put forward, too. The Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, passed in 1998, made it
a crime to develop, share or sell technology that cir-
cumvents copy-protection technology. As a result, one
academic was threatened with prosecution if he even
published research about music protection software.
Another major piece of legislation, the Consumer
Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act, in-
troduced in the Senate in 2002, would require any
distributor of digital media technology to include
copy-protection software with it. Another bill, the
Collections of Information Antipiracy Act, would pro-
vide special protection to online databases.
Other U.S. government agencies have begun policy
changes on their own without congressional input.
The Library of Congress has been an active participant
in the issue of Internet radio, while the Patent Office
has gradually broadened the focus of patents to include
business methods such as Amazon.com’s one-click
shopping.

Databases represent an important laboratory for
online IP. Their digital contents can be accessed by
libraries and other users who have purchased a license
to do so. The license, however, can defeat the purpose
of the library or archive as a repository of intellectual
and cultural records. When library buys a book, it
owns it as long as the book lasts; when a database
subscription lapses, the institution retains nothing ex-
cept computer screens. Any archiving of a database’s
digital holdings is usually prohibited without the pro-
vider’s authorization. Licensing transforms intellec-
tual property from a non-virtual product to a digital
service. Furthermore, a licensing agreement is a pri-
vate contract over which the public has no control. It
can omit elements of copyright law intended to serve
the public, such as the fair-use clause, a portion of
copyright law that permits limited reproduction of
copyrighted materials when specific criteria are met.
E-COMMERCE AND INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY
Intellectual property issues affect e-commerce in
a variety of ways. Protecting IP has real costs like
developing or buying protection technology, and pay-
ing lawyers. The costs spread out as competing firms
try to imitate successful products without infringing
on IP rights. Some companies do without either legal
or technical protection, relying instead on innovative
business plans to eliminate the need for IP protection
altogether. For example, some companies give their
software away free-of-charge but sell complementary
products or services, such as manuals or service con-
tracts.
Some IP conflicts will be difficult to sidestep. For
example, as long as there is no internationally binding
treaties defining IP rights, they can be flaunted with
impunity. A small country, that was not party to any
trademark treaties, for example, could permit a com-
puter company to use the Microsoft trademark and
broadcast its advertising around the world via the
Web.
IP online poses many formidable problems. Laws
vary from nation to nation, but the Internet spans the
globe. As information gluts the Web, it becomes
harder to distinguish what is reliable and legal in a
given context. In the end, many IP producers—writers,
musicians, photographers, artists—will have to come
to terms with the competing desires to see their work
distributed and to be paid for it, in a vast forum of
tens of thousands, if not millions, of other creators.
As Esther Dyson has written, ‘‘Our old ideas about
intellectual property are going to be revised in a world
where content is abundant and rich people’s attention
is increasingly scarce.’’

INTERNET JOB CREATION
Finding qualified employees proved difficult in the
boom economy of the late 1990s. One of the industries
hardest hit by the scarcity of job candidates was infor-
mation technology (IT). Not only were established IT
firms competing with each other for the best employ-
ees, they also faced competition from a slew of dot-
com upstarts, which were able to attract talent by
offering lucrative stock options and the chance to work
with cutting-edge technology in a casual environment.
In the early 2000s, however, the bankruptcies of nu-
merous dot-com firms, coupled with a weak economy,
helped to fuel unemployment, particularly in North
America. As a result, businesses of all kinds found it
easier to recruit a growing pool of IT candidates,
particularly those experienced with e-commerce.

S O U R C E B O O K
According to Tracy Tang in a July 2001 article in
Entrepreneur, savvy business owners could make the
most of this sudden shift in the e-commerce sector
by using online recruitment sites like Monster.com.
‘‘These unemployed workers are flocking to the Web
to find you—and you should, too, to find experienced
employees for your Web business.’’ Along with post-
ing a database of resumes that you can search, many
employment sites also offer additional services. For
example, Monster.com serves businesses looking to
fill a position quickly with a ‘‘Post Your Job Now’’
option that offers to instantly post a job opening and
leave it up for 60 days for $305. The firm also offers
job description templates to help users craft the job
advertisements that will be most likely to help them
attract the best candidates for a position. Other ser-
vices include a job distributor that posts your opening
on specific career sites and an automated screening
system that queries applicants and analyzes the results
to pinpoint those most qualified for a job.
Despite the weak economy, or perhaps because of
it, not all Internet-based ventures found it easy to
attract talent in the early 2000s. The stock market
remained sluggish, which meant dot-com start-ups
could no longer offer attractive stock-option packages.
In addition, many dot-com employees who found
themselves out of a job after the dot-com meltdown
sought more stable employers. At the same time, be-
cause investors demanded profitability, many of the
dot-coms that did survive found that they could no
longer offer the generous expense accounts and casual
work environments that used to attract many IT
workers.
FINDING CANDIDATES
If you’re looking to find new employees for an e-
commerce venture, you can go about it in several
ways. You can simply outsource the entire process to
a recruiter, who will supply you with resumes and
other materials for qualified candidates. Some even
offer interviewing services. Another choice is to han-
dle recruitment in-house, placing advertisements in
the classified sections of newspapers and industry
journals and visiting college job fairs. A cheaper op-
tion often is to make use of online job boards such
as Monster.com and Hotjobs.com. According to Tang,
hiring an employee by traditional recruiting methods
costs, on average, eight times as much as hiring over
the Internet.
While the large job boards certainly attract many
job seekers, there are drawbacks to posting your open-
ing where millions of prospects might see it. Some
employers complain about being overwhelmed with
responses. If you would rather narrow your audience,
many smaller, focused job sites exist. If you are not
sure about where to find them, AIRSDirectory.com
is one source. The site’s job boards allow you to
search by industry and by geographical area. Selecting
the ‘‘Technical’’ category and the subcategory of
‘‘Web’’ produces a list of sites that post Web-related
jobs. Along with simply listing various sites, the AIRS
site also indicates the specific industry focus of each
site, the geographic area covered by each site, whether
or not the site posts resumes, and if there is a charge
for accessing its information. For example, both Com-
puterJobs.com and EcommerceEmployment.com are
fee-based sites that focus on e-commerce and post job
seekers’ resumes. The International Web Designers
Database is a free site that specializes in design skills
and also posts resumes.
CHOOSING EMPLOYEES
When selecting potential employees for interviews,
experts recommend that you pay close attention to
the corporate culture of the companies where they
were previously employed. Candidates who have
worked in highly conservative and structured environ-
ments might have a hard time adapting to a position
with, for example, a more flexible business that ex-
pects employees to handle multiple tasks that can
change frequently. However, if the reason a person
left such an environment was to find something more
flexible and dynamic, he or she might prove to be a
good fit. Also, keep in mind that e-commerce technol-
ogy continues to change at a rapid pace. Candidates
who have demonstrated an ability to learn new skills
quickly may prove to be a good choice even if they
lack experience with a certain type of technology.
This is particularly true of prospective employees with
personalities that would fit well with your day-to-day
work environment. While finding employees with the
skills you need is certainly an important aspect of
recruitment, many human resource experts assert that
finding the personalities that will thrive in your corpo-
rate culture is equally significant.

LEGACY SYSTEMS, PROCESSES,
AND PEOPLE
Legacy systems are older computer systems, such
as mainframes, that businesses have invested substan-
tial resources in. Businesses contemplating upgrading
from a legacy system to an Internet-based system must
consider not only the cost of the new technology itself,
but also expenses related to revamping its processes
and retraining its staff. Quite often, a complete over-
haul of a legacy system is unnecessary as several
software vendors have developed applications that add
Internet functionality to legacy systems. In some
cases, business might opt to purchase a new system
that is able to import data from a legacy system.
The options for upgrading legacy systems contin-
ued to grow in the early 2000s, particularly as the
economy weakened and businesses proved less willing
to spend money on new technology. Companies of
all kinds looked for cost effective ways to squeeze
the performance and integration they desired from
their existing technology. As a result, software ven-
dors increased their offerings of products that helped
businesses modernize existing systems. If you are
planning to take on such a task for your business, you
will find it worthwhile to research what is proving to
be a multitude of modernization choices.
TYPES OF LEGACY SYSTEMS AND
APPROACHES TO INTEGRATION
In the early 1990s, many major corporations began
upgrading their legacy mainframe systems with the
new client/server-based enterprise resource planning
(ERP) systems developed by industry leaders like SAP
AG, PeopleSoft Inc., and J.D. Edwards & Co. Tradi-
tionally, these proprietary ERP systems linked the
legacy accounting, human resources distribution,
manufacturing, and other back-end business processes
that do not directly involve customers for businesses
of all sizes. In the late 1990s, ERP vendors also began
working to include in their system the front-end busi-
ness processes that do involve customers, such as
customer relationship management, supply chain
management, and e-commerce. When the Internet be-
gan to replace client/server platforms, ERP firms be-
gan working to enable their technology to operate via
the Web. Although some industry experts believed
that the Internet’s growing dominance as a business
platform would render the $20 billion ERP industry
obsolete, others believed that ERP and e-commerce
technology vendors would likely work together to
create new e-business applications.
As client/server ERP systems were growing in pop-
ularity in the 1990s, a new technology emerged known
63
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
as enterprise application integration (EAI). This tech-
nology increased the amount of integration that could
take place between different applications and data-
bases. Many businesses in the late 1990s found them-
selves operating not only ERP systems, but also cus-
tomer relationship management (CRM) systems,
portions of legacy systems, and others. And in cases
when companies merged, two proprietary ERP sys-
tems needed integration. EAI companies offered prod-
ucts that facilitated this type of integration, as well as
products that integrated legacy systems with the Web.
Companies that sell products designed to enhance
legacy systems include WebMethods, BEA Systems,
and Tibco Software. BEA, for example, sells distrib-
uted processing system Tuxedo and application server
WebLogic, both of which allow legacy systems to
handle Web-based applications. Upstart Jacada offers
Java-based technology that ‘‘allows companies to
layer a Web interface on an old mainframe application
at a cost of a few hundred thousand dollars, rather
than the few million it could take to strip out and
rewrite the old system for the Net,’’ writes Business
Week columnist Amey Stone.
IMPLEMENTING LEGACY UPGRADES
Beyond simply putting new technology in place,
however, upgrading a legacy system also means con-
vincing employees comfortable with the legacy sys-
tem to embrace the new technology and the impact
it will have on their daily tasks. To move from a legacy
system to an Internet-based system successfully, you
will need an employee base that is open to change.
According to an April 2002 issue of Business Week,
‘‘creating an atmosphere in which change becomes
the norm is often more crucial than the technology
itself, analysts say.’’ If at all possible, cultivate this
attitude well before a major implementation of new
technology by actively teaching your employees how
to deal with change. One way to do this is implement-
ing small changes leading up to a major change. Along
with accepting change, your employees must also be
capable of learning new skills.
Using in-house employees when upgrading your
computer system and processes is not your only op-
tion. You might also hire new information technology
(IT) employees or outsource certain tasks. Having a
specified leader, whether this person is an existing
employee or a consultant of some sort, heading up
your system overhaul is also recommended by many
analysts.

LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS OF E-
COMMERCE
In e-commerce, as in traditional business, laws
establish norms of conduct which promote honesty
and fair play and provide methods for addressing dis-
putes. E-commerce’s technological, organizational,
and commercial innovations have also introduced new
legal problems that existing business laws don’t cover.
For example, the contracts, facilities, and even prod-
ucts of e-commerce frequently exist only in the virtual
realm. Electronic business crosses state and national
borders effortlessly and invisibly, introducing juris-
dictional, tax, and international trade problems. Fur-
ther complicating matters, e-commerce technology
can change so quickly that new laws are left quickly
obsolete.
E-commerce’s new business structures raise a
number of unique legal questions. Traditional busi-
nesses perform most functions in-house, including
production, marketing, sales, order fulfillment, ware-
housing. E-commerce, on the other hand, relies more
on outsourcing—contracting out many essential busi-
ness activities to third parties. Outsourced activities
might include any or all of those listed above as well
as others unique to e-commerce, such as Web site
development and Web hosting. Outsourcing elimi-
nates many traditional employment agreements and
relationships,
substituting
short-term
contractual
agreements. Besides breeding a different kind of com-
mercial-personal relationship, outsourcing created a
business culture in which more than ever outsiders
are intimately involved a business’s affairs and may
even have competing stakes in it. The issues include:
T
Controlling contractors’ use of customer data
T
Determining property rights to the company’s Web
site when outside developers and contract opera-
tors are involved
T
Negotiating
and
enforcing
confidentiality
agreements with outside contractors
The online relationship between retailer and cus-
tomer poses other questions:
T
Does electronic delivery of a product (software,
for example) satisfy the seller’s obligation the
same way a material product sold in a store or by
mail does?
T
How should international e-tailers deal with local
or national laws that affect, possibly even prohibit,
their products?
T
How can buyer complaints be redressed when pur-
chases are made online?
IMPORTANCE OF CONTRACTS
In the absence of established law, e-commerce
must depend heavily on contracts to clarify such ques-
tions and bring a degree of certainty to business. The
best contracts will be exhaustive ones that cover as
many contingencies as possible, spelling out responsi-
bilities, rights, and a method of dispute resolution.
The best e-commerce contracts, some experts antici-
pate, will eventually provide the basis for new e-
commerce law. Because e-commerce is still evolving,
in practice there is no such thing as a boilerplate e-
commerce contract. Nearly all are drawn up with a
view to the unique features of a particular deal or
relationship.
TERMS-OF-USE AGREEMENTS
A notable exception is the contract governing the
use of an e-commerce Web site. These contracts—
usually included as a separate page of a Web site—
serve a variety of purposes, including defining and
limiting the liability of the Web site owner and setting
terms of sale. Frequently they are drawn up so use of
the site implies acceptance of the terms, but as with
much in e-commerce law, courts do not necessarily
enforce these clauses. To increase their enforceability,
some Web site operators require users to click an ‘‘I
accept’’ button under the contract’s terms or to indi-
cate acceptance even more clearly by typing the words
‘‘I accept.’’ Without such an explicit agreement, a
key to making Web site contracts binding is stating
prominently—preferably on the opening page—that
use of the Web site is governed by certain terms
and restrictions. Those terms can then be listed on a
legal page.
LEGAL PAGES
An effective e-commerce legal page includes cer-
tain key elements:

T
Terms of sale, including return and refund policy,
delivery and return information, technical or cus-
tomer support information, and possibly an option
for customers to reject the terms
T
Copyright and trademark notices informing visi-
tors that their right to use material on the site is
limited by law
T
Disclaimers of responsibility for errors and omis-
sions on the site, such as typographical errors, out-
of date information, pricing errors
T
Disclaimers of implied warranties which reduce a
merchant’s liability for product performance
T
Limit of liability for the damages visitors can
claim, for example, for profits lost as a result of
use of information posted on Web site
T
Disclaimer of responsibility for material posted at
linked Web sites
T
Guidelines for online behavior, for example the
posting of material that is obscene, libelous, or in
violation of copyright, trademark, or other proprie-
tary rights
T
Privacy policy indicating how customer informa-
tion is used and shared
Since e-commerce is to a large extent based on
such ‘‘paperless contracts,’’ it is expected that these
virtual contracts will eventually be upheld as binding.
DOMAIN NAMES
Domain names, one of the most valuable assets
of an e-company, are one area where e-commerce-
specific laws have been put on the books. Early in
the rise of the Internet, so-called ‘‘cybersquatters’’
registered potentially valuable domain names, often
the names of established large companies, and sat on
them until the company paid for them. Cybersquatting
was made illegal. A company with a trademarked
name now has a stronger legal claim to a related
domain name than do others. There are still questions:
If companies in two industries have the same name,
which is more entitled to the domain name? Should
domain names be covered under property law as ‘‘vir-
tual property’’?
OTHER CONCERNS
Other legal problems in e-commerce persist. On-
line exchanges—Web sites used by groups of compa-
nies in an industry to secure volume prices on supplies
and services, sell equipment, post prices, and ex-
change information—raise serious as yet unaddressed
antitrust questions. For example, is information-shar-
ing on exchanges anti-competitive behavior?
65
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
Another troublesome issue is the elastic use of the
term ‘‘partner’’ by e-businesses. ‘‘Strategic partner’’
is a buzzword that can mean anything from a partner
in a formal joint venture to a company who has al-
lowed its name to be used in advertising. Nearly all
of these uses, however, are very different from the
established legal term ‘‘partner’’ which under partner-
ship law carries with it a set of specific responsibilities
and liabilities which most ‘‘strategic partners’’ would
be unwilling to shoulder.
A separate problem is when cash-poor dot-coms
use stock or stock options to pay for goods and ser-
vices. In the wake of the partial collapse of the dot-
com economy such practices are not as common as
they once were. However, it is likely they are in
violation of securities law.
E-commerce is such a fundamentally new and dif-
ferent way of doing business that many of the legal
forms needed to regulate it have not yet been invented.
The questions for both lawmakers and business people
are: To what degree can laws devised for traditional,
bricks-and-mortar business be adapted for the new
economy? Where established law is inappropriate,
how can new legislation be devised that is comprehen-
sive and fair for both businesses and consumers? As
e-commerce evolves, so must answers to these ques-
tions.

LIMITATIONS OF ONLINE
ENTERPRISES
When planning an online business, many entrepre-
neurs focus on the advantages the Internet offers, like
its wide reach and easy accessibility. Even though
early concerns about online transactions—the reliabil-
ity of Internet connections, customers’ willingness

E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
to use credit cards online, and processing returned
merchandise—have largely been resolved, limitations
still exist, some universal and some company- and
industry-specific. As a result, entrepreneurs must con-
sider potential disadvantages of online operations as
they plan their businesses.
One of the Internet’s biggest shortfalls is that online
shoppers can’t pick up, touch, and try on products.
Keep this in mind when deciding what to sell online.
Quite often, sized items like clothing and shoes can
pose a problem, although several online retailers have
done so successfully by devising creative solutions
to the problem. For example, Landsend.com built a
feature called Your Personal Model that allows users
to enter their physical dimensions and view pictures
of what a person their size and shape might look like
in certain clothing. The site also offers Outfits Online,
a tool that allows an online customer coordinate 4,750
different outfits; this feature capitalizes on Internet
technology to offer services beyond what a customer
might be able to do in a physical store.
If you are planning to sell a product on the Web that
appears, at first glance, better suited to a retail store,
you will likely have to do more than simply offer the
merchandise for sale online. Automobile manufactur-
ers like Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
struggled to sell cars online in the late 1990s early
2000s. According to a January 2001 issue of E-Com-
merceTimes,‘‘thatautomakersanddealersareoffering
a new way and place to buy a car is not enough to drive
online sales.’’ After realizing this, Ford and GM began
exploring incentive programs for online shoppers,
‘‘banking on convenience and innovation to assuage
consumerdoubtsaboutbuyingcarsonline.’’Bothauto-
makersbeganexperimentingwithprogramsthatwould
allowcustomerstoplacecustomizedordersforvehicles
via the Internet and receive delivery at their homes
within two to three weeks.
One reason it’s difficult to sell large, expensive
merchandise such as automobiles and furniture online
is the logistics involved in getting the product to the
customer. While offering free shipping might entice
shoppers to make a purchase, you may find yourself
unable to turn a profit without passing these costs
along to your customers. At the same time, you might
find consumers unwilling to pay costly shipping
charges for something like furniture when retailers in
their area are willing to deliver it for free. Many
analysts believe the best products to sell via the In-
ternet are those that can be easily shipped, for instance,
books and CDs. Along with modest packaging and
shipping costs, customers have the added benefit of
knowing exactly what to expect when they order such
a product. While smaller products like jewelry and
wine might also seem reasonably easy to ship, keep
in mind that costs tend to rise for products that are
more valuable, fragile, or perishable.
These limitations are not insurmountable, but they
are issues you must be aware of and able to overcome
profitably. For example, the leading grocery chain in
the United Kingdom, Tesco, circumvented delivery
problems by creating a new service that allows cus-
tomers to order and pay for groceries online. But rather
than handle the logistics of scheduling the delivery of
perishable items, Tesco asks customers to pick up
their own groceries, which have been gathered and
bagged for them. According to a March 2002 issue
of E-commerce Times, this service ‘‘saves huge
amounts of time for many customers and carries negli-
gible infrastructure costs for the company because it
makes use of existing stores.’’
Also keep in mind that the Internet marketplace
grows increasingly competitive every day. If you are
planning to sell a product offered by many online
businesses, such as electronics, you will face intense
competition. To see if this limitation exists for your
business, you can conduct a few simple searches on
the product or products you are planning to sell. Are
a large number of businesses selling the same products
online? Are the businesses selling those products large
corporations that will likely be able to purchase stock
from manufacturers less expensively than a smaller
rival? If the answer to either of these questions is yes,
you will need to decide if it is possible to differentiate
yourself and devise strategies for doing this. Inc.com
writer Chris Malta recommends selling ‘‘the products
people use but don’t find every time they open a Web
browser.’’ Whatever products or services you decide
to offer online will likely face certain limitations, and
recognizing these issues will allow you to develop
more effective business strategies.

M-COMMERCE
Although there are some questions pertaining to
landscape, technology standards, and the ultimate

M-device, it is clear that for those companies that are
involved in the process, M-commerce is going to be
a reality, and sooner rather than later.
Overall, there is a fairly clear sense of direction
on the purpose, benefits, technology, and markets as-
sociated with M-commerce. M-commerce is going to
be a global practice, yet in different parts of the world
it might take different shapes.
Younger, active, mobile, and higher-income people
are likely to be the first to experiment with M-com-
merce, they are being targeted by M-commerce com-
panies. Moreover, travelers and mobile professionals
are at the forefront of this market segment.
Money can be made from M-commerce providing
that companies apply lessons learned from the intro-
duction of e-commerce on the Internet. The focus
should be on value added rather than on discounts
and freebies.
MAPPING OUT THE EARLY M-COMMERCE
MARKET
The demographic and lifestyle profile of the M-
commerce early adapter, according to the Cap Gemini
Ernst & Young Center for Business Innovation, will
include the following elements:
T
Young. The range of ages vary according to the
analysts, but in general it will be people in their
twenties and thirties who drive M-commerce in
its early years.
T
Active and mobile. The more active the person,
the more likely he or she is to use M-commerce.
In particular, this includes mobile professionals.
T
Higher income. New technology tends to be rela-
tively expensive in the introductory stage of its
cycle. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that
early adapters will have higher than average in-
comes to acquire it. Over time, however, the price
of the technology will go down, and as a result,
people with lower incomes will be able to acquire
such technology. A successful M-commerce strat-
egy will try to jump on the emerging market, but
with an eye toward long-term stability.
T
Risk takers. New technology can be intimidating
to the average person. Especially in its early stages
when it is still complex and not optimally user
friendly. Therefore, a characteristic of the early
adapters will likely be a high degree of risk taking
in terms of trying new technologies.
FOCUS ON MOBILE PROFESSIONALS AND
‘‘TECHIES’’
There are two groups of people that were identified
as target markets more then any other groups:
67
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
T
Travelers. The value proposition of M-commerce
has a high correlation with the needs of business
travelers, and therefore the business travel segment
will be the first to adapt to the M-commerce trend.
Naturally, those people who are away from their
‘‘permanent’’ environment will appreciate the
need to stay in touch, receive information, and
conduct transactions while on the road.
T
Techies. As a group, Techies cut across demo-
graphic lines. Yet, they have one major attribute
in common: the urge to acquire and explore new
technologies. To attract these customers, you neet
to demonstrate why your particular m-commerce
service will be both useful and exciting.
REVENUE MODELS FOR M-COMMERCE
As an infant technology, there are few tried-and-
true revenue models to base your business on, but a
few models were emerging in the early 2000s that
seemed poised for stability.
One type of revenue model is push advertising.
Advertising revenues can become a valid revenue
model providing that it will be used in a localized-
short-wave environment. For example, when a cus-
tomer is in a regional area utilizing your particular
m-commerce service, he or she could receive an ad
or coupon for a local restaurant, and directions for
how to get there.
A different revenue model involves a transaction
fee. iMode of Japan charges users a transaction fee
whenever he or she plays a game on their mobile
device. Transaction fees will take the form of ‘‘micro
payments,’’ whereby a charge is applied to the cus-
tomer only for what he or she uses. Thus, if a user
plays a game for ten minutes, they will be charged
only for those ten minutes.
M-COMMERCE STANDARDS
Many of the wireless protocols and platforms that
exist today are suitable to serve as a standard platform
for M-commerce. Nevertheless, the many entities (car-
riers, device makers, enablers, etc.) can’t agree on
which standard to adopt. This is the main reason North
America is lagging behind the European Union and
the Asia-Pacific region in its ability to provide ad-
vanced M-commerce applications. In the meantime,
it becomes slightly risky for your company to dive
too strongly into any particular form of m-commerce
service that utilizes one or another protocol or plat-
form, as the standardization of others may render your
service oboslete.

M-COMMERCE SERVICES
It seems that M-commerce services will be intro-
duced in stages. The first stage will be the information-
based services, which are relatively easy to implement
because they do not require the infrastructure and
sophisticated technology needed to purchase actual
goods through mobile devices. Purchasing of goods
and e-cash functionality will follow at a later stage.
Information-based transactions, rather than pur-
chase of tangible items, will be the first to reach
critical mass on mobile devices. These information-
based transactions include messaging, usaully short
messaging and e-mail involving pagers or mobile tele-
phones; limited financial information, such as up-to-
the-minute stock-trading or bank-account informa-
tion; and travel-related information, such as flight
schedules, weather reports, directions to specific desti-
nations, along with the ability to review and modify
travel itineraries.
CUSTOMER PRIVACY
Protecting and respecting the privacy of consumers
is a major issue in e-commerce, and was in fact an
imediment to faster e-commerce growth in the 1990s
and early 2000s. On the one hand, m-commerce ser-
vice providers need to know where customers are at
any given time in order to provide effective location-
specific information based on that knowledge. On the
other hand, providers must be careful not to project
an image of intrusiveness. Wireless providers will
have to find ways to give consumers almost total
control over their degree of privacy. Security, quality,
and ease of use will have to find the right balance.
SELLING YOUR M-COMMERCE SERVICES
The main value proposition of M-commerce in the
short run isn’t the type of features or services that it
provides, but its ability to provide these services to
people while away from the home or office. M-com-
merce provides value added in the form of greater
time efficiency, which is a strong proposition these
days. Time is the single most precious commodity,
and M-commerce is one way people can utilize their
time more efficiently. Thus, you should position your
m-commerce services in such a manner that it high-
lights these key advantages, rather than trying to com-
pete in the m-commerce realm directly on the turf of
established e-commerce services.

MANAGING CHANGE
The Internet revolution of the late 1990s challenged
the change management capabilities of businesses of
all kinds. Many existing companies began to develop
Web sites as marketing tools, while others began to
sell their products and services via the Internet. Some
companies even abandoned their ‘‘bricks-and-mor-
tar’’ operations altogether to focus solely on online
activities. In addition, dot-com companies like eBay,
Amazon, and Yahoo! began to garner significant atten-
tion as their Web traffic exploded and stock prices
soared. When the dot-com industry began to collapse
in 2000 and the North American economy weakened,
many of the firms that had wholeheartedly embraced
Internet technology were forced to scale back their e-
commerce operations and rethink management strate-
gies. At the same time, however, the Internet contin-
ued to present opportunities for companies able to
identify and serve various niche markets. The busi-
nesses that proved the most nimble at responding to
these rapidly evolving market conditions tended to be
more successful than those that struggled to implement
changes.
CHANGING STRATEGIES
The e-commerce industry remains a highly unsta-
ble one. Whether you are creating a brand new online
business, simply developing a Web site as a marketing
tool for your existing business, or planning to offer
your existing products and services via the Internet,
the one thing you can be certain of is continual change.
To best handle the volatility of the e-commerce arena,
you should consider carefully how the rapid pace of
change in this industry will impact the following activ-
ities:
T
Developing and modifying a business strategy
T
Training employees
T
Adopting new technology
T
Handling customer relationships

DEVELOPING AND MODIFYING A BUSINESS STRAT-
EGY. To create an effective e-commerce strategy,
you must first develop goals. What do you wish to
achieve via online operations? You should decide why
you are going online and what benefits the Internet
can provide to your business. You also need to identify
your target market. Are you going to target existing
customers or try to attract new ones? Other topics
to consider include advertising methods, competition,
and market conditions. One of the most important, and
often overlooked, issues in developing an effective e-
commerce strategy is how to manage change. A small
business might follow a business strategy that proves
successful during the first year of operation yet be-
comes obsolete shortly thereafter. A study done by
Andersen Consulting and the Economist Intelligence
Unit in July 2000 predicts that by 2005, more than
half of Web-based initiatives will operate on plans
that last no longer than 12 months, a practice that
forces companies to revisit their strategies on a regular
basis. At the same time, however, implementing too
many changes can exhaust both employees and man-
agement. Being able to link planned changes directly
to concrete goals is a key component of effective
change management, as is the ability to clarify exactly
how changes are going to be implemented.
TRAINING EMPLOYEES. The most successful e-com-
merce ventures have employees who are open to
change and able to learn new skills quickly. If, for
example, your company has decided to sell products
online for the first time, employment issues to consider
include deciding whether to use existing staff, hire
new information technology (IT) employees, create
new departments, or outsource related tasks. In each
case, employees must be able to work effectively in
a continually evolving environment that might include
having to work with new short-term independent con-
tractors or taking on new responsibilities themselves.
ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGY. No matter how many
individuals you employ, or plan to employ, their abil-
ity to adapt to new technology is crucial. As your
company grows, the adoption of new technology will
likely prove critical. In some cases, this might mean
upgrading from an analog modem to a high-speed
Internet connection. In other cases, you might decide
to begin utilizing wireless technology. To manage
changes like these effectively, you will need employ-
ees willing and able to undergo necessary training.
While finding qualified IT employees proved difficult
in the late 1990s, by the early 2000s, the bankruptcies
of numerous dot-com firms had helped to fuel unem-
ployment, particularly in North America. As a result,
businesses found it easier to recruit individuals used
to working in a fast-paced, high-technology environ-
ment. According to Tracy Tang in a July 2001 article
in Entrepreneur, savvy business owners could take
69
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
advantage of this abrupt change in the e-commerce
landscape via online recruitment sites like Mon-
ster.com. ‘‘These unemployed workers are flocking
to the Web to find you—and you should, too, to find
experienced employees for your Web business.’’
CUSTOMER
RELATIONSHIP
MANAGEMENT. Change
management is also important to consider while devis-
ing customer service strategies. As Web consumers
demand higher levels of customer service, enterprises
that offer products and services online must be able to
quickly and effectively respond to customer demands.
Businesses with effective change management prac-
tices in place will find it easier to adapt to evolving
demands and run less risk of losing customers. Ac-
cording to Jeff Pulver, an E.phiphany business devel-
opment executive quoted in an October 2001 issue of
CRMDaily.com, companies ‘‘must undergo a transfor-
mation that places the customers at the center of all
activity. Core business processes must be reconfigured
to reflect the new strategy.’’ To make such a change,
businesses must change with the needs and wants of
their clients, and how they manage this change is
crucial to their success.

MANAGING AND EVOLVING A
GLOBAL PRESENCE
When the Internet began to evolve into a medium
for commerce in the 1990s, businesses gained access
to a new international marketplace. A simple Web
site could bring together buyers and sellers from all
over the world. Some industry pundits predicted the
Internet would break down the last barriers to a truly
globalized market across nearly all industries.

Indeed, the rise of e-commerce did help to foster
the globalization of many markets. However, despite
certain gains globally, the majority of online buyers
lived in the United States. In fact, the United States
accounted for nearly 75 percent of global e-commerce
in 2000. And while e-commerce become more com-
monplace in Western Europe and Japan in the early
2000s, online shopping had yet to take hold in many
less industrialized parts of the world. The reasons
ranged from weak economic conditions and the lack
of necessary technology to cultures and traditions that
place less emphasis on consumerism. Still, industry
analysts predict e-commerce will continue to grow
and reach new parts of the world, albeit at a slower
pace than many had previously anticipated.
INTERNATIONALIZE YOUR SITE
Opportunities via the Internet do exist for small
businesses wanting to expand their borders. Globaliza-
tion experts recommend that a business first ‘‘interna-
tionalize’’ its Web site and then localize versions
of it for each culture the company plans to target.
According to Inc.com writer John Mulligan, interna-
tionalizing a site means preparing it for translation
into different languages. If you have yet to design
your site, it may be worthwhile to spend time and
money up front to ensure that it will be able to handle
multiple languages, even if you do not plan to expand
internationally for several years. Creating an interna-
tionalized site from scratch is typically much less
expensive than changing an existing site to handle
international operations. If your site design is being
done in-house, you will need to consider how format-
ting and wording will impact translation. If you are
outsourcing, be sure to select a designer experienced
in creating international sites.
LOCALIZE YOUR SITE
Once your site is internationalized, you can turn
your focus to localization, which means modifying
your site to the extent that it ‘‘takes into consideration
cultural
and
linguistic
conventions,
translation,
changes in graphics, adaptation of documentation, re-
sizing of dialog boxes, resolution of hot-key conflicts
(hot keys are keys or key combinations that cause
some function to occur in the computer), quality assur-
ance of user interface, etc.—all geared to a specific
country,’’ says Mulligan. To gain an understanding
of how other online companies have localized opera-
tions, you can visit their sites and look at how the
pages are linked together and how similar or different
the design is for each page targeting a different
country.
Along with ensuring that your site will function
in different countries around the world, you must also
consider how your site will be received by different
cultures. Many countries, including Germany, the
United Kingdom, and Japan, use credit cards less
frequently than the United States. If credit cards are
the only type of payment your site accepts, you will
reduce your prospects in certain areas dramatically.
Also think about what kind of an impact various
graphics, like flags and symbols, will have on potential
customers. Even color can be an issue. Some cultures
associate certain colors with things like death or war.
PLAN FOR LEGAL REQUIREMENTS
Selling merchandise abroad can also be complex
from a legal standpoint. Even the most diligent efforts
to understand laws related to things like taxes can
leave a business owner uncertain, or simply unaware,
of his or her legal obligations. For example, some
countries do not allow online businesses to use
‘‘cookie’’ technology to track visitors, a common
practice for Web-based operations in the United
States. Other countries do not allow the sale of certain
controversial products, an issue plaguing Yahoo!,
which came under fire in the early 2000s for selling
Nazi-related merchandise to customers in France. Ac-
cording to Global Cyberspace Jurisdictional Project
chairman Thomas Vartanian, as quoted in a November
2001 issue of E-Commerce Times, ‘‘The problem is
that there are an infinite number of laws that might
be applicable to any given Web site, and most of them
you don’t even know about.’’
LOCALIZATION SERVICES
One option for small business owners wanting to
localize their site for specific country is to hire a
localization service, such as Accurate Translation or
Excel Translations. Firms like these will not only help
you to translate your Web site and modify it to make
future translations easier, they will also help you en-
sure that your site appeals to the culture you are tar-
geting. Many localization experts also understand the
legal issues surrounding international sales from one
country to the next and can help you avoid pitfalls.
However, services like these, particularly translation,
can be quite costly, so you should weigh the pros and
cons of globalization before investing considerable
resources in such an effort.

MANAGING INDUSTRY LIFE CYCLES
IN E-COMMERCE
If you have ever stopped to consider why almost
every tube of toothpaste is offered as a solution for
‘‘tartar control’’ or ‘‘whitening’’ or otherwise ‘‘im-
proved,’’ you may have formed some ideas about
product and industry life cycles. The idea of a life
cycle, a time spanning from a product’s earliest pur-
chases to its maturation and decline, is considered
conventional wisdom in consumer-product marketing.
Companies like Procter & Gamble, which sells a great
deal of toothpaste, have made manipulating life cycles
and new product introductions a core of their business
strategy.
The basic idea behind a life cycle is that every
product (or, an industry as a collection of related
products) goes through a series of adoption stages.
The most common model of this process, proposed
as early as the 1960s, contains five successive stages
of buyers: innovators, early adopters, early majority,
late majority, and laggards. Majority here refers to
share of the possible market for the product, which
is not the same as the entire population of consumers
or businesses. These adopter categories were first
coined by sociologist Everett M. Rogers in his 1962
classic Diffusion of Innovations and have been widely
cited in marketing texts and business publications
ever since.
The next assumption in life cycle theory is that
buyers act differently at each stage. Innovators are
commonly thought to be affluent and to purchase out
of sheer curiosity or whim. At the other end of cycle,
laggards are thought of as less affluent and highly
risk averse, motivated more by what they perceive as
the practical uses of the product. If you’re a marketer,
your strategy is to convey the appropriate messages
to each group depending on who is most likely to buy
at the current stage of the cycle. If your product is
new and you’re targeting innovators, for example,
your marketing would be flashy and would emphasize
the path-breaking creative aspects of your product.
71
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
Alternatively, if you’re trying to persuade the stereo-
typical adoption laggard, your message should suggest
stability, value, and utter simplicity.
The idea of a life cycle has been heavily shaped
by observing how people buy physical products. Much
less work has been done on services; and very little
research at all has been done on e-commerce life
cycles, but some marketing analysts believe a similar
process is at work in these cases. Thus a closer analogy
than toothpaste might be software versions. Most peo-
ple are aware of the long chain of new versions of
operating systems and software applications that are
unleashed on a regular basis. A casual observer might
conclude that the software firm has simply made lots
of improvements and fixed a few bugs. But chances
are that timing also plays a big role in the decision
to release a new version. Software publishers are care-
ful not to cannibalize their existing products by crank-
ing out new versions. At the same time, when one
version is reaching a high level of market penetration,
the company has a huge incentive to bring another
version to the market.
So what does it mean when online sales or subscrip-
tions are flat or falling? Is the life cycle over? Ac-
cording to life cycle theory, this isn’t necessarily the
case. If a product fails shortly after its introduction,
the theory holds that it never made it beyond a certain
stage, perhaps never past the innovators. Geoffrey
Moore, an author and marketing consultant, is famous
in marketing circles for his claim of a so-called chasm
between reaching early adopters and graduating to
success with the majority of buyers. He believes many
products fail because they are unable to bridge the
gap between the needs of a small, fickle niche market
and the vast majority of more pragmatic buyers. Along
with a bevy of other marketing strategists, Moore
counsels that specific tactics can help companies cross
the chasm.
On the other hand, if your site has a long successful
stint and then declines, however, it is assumed to be
reaching the end of its life cycle. This is considered
normal and, in many cases, inevitable. Usually in this
case all of your competitors’ products are experiencing
a similar malaise. One strategy at this point is to make
the remaining sales as profitable as possible, perhaps
by cutting costs and even raising prices if the competi-
tive environment will allow it. At the same, a major
thrust of your product development and marketing
efforts should be to launch a replacement or substitute
product that will bring customers back into the market
and start the cycle anew.
Standard accounts of industry life cycles portray
the early stages as being full of innovation and the
latter stages, especially for the dominant players, as
being less innovative. Research on patent activity
across different industries suggests this isn’t always
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
true. On the contrary, innovations, as measured by
patents, appeared much more evenly distributed
among companies of different sizes and industries of
different maturities. One insight to take from this is
that innovation should be considered a strategic tool
at all stages of the life cycle.
Some e-commerce watchers have suggested that
early consumer e-commerce sites of the late 1990s
reached their peak as stand-alone sites and had to
innovate by integrating multiple providers’ content,
becoming aggregators or umbrella sites. This was the
strategy at Amazon.com and Global Sports, for exam-
ple. Efforts at online customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM) have also tried to reduce life-cycle vola-
tility by building a lasting relationship with each client
which transcends the life cycles of individual products
or services.
Life cycles may also be influenced by other eco-
nomic events. In the technology downturn of the early
2000s, many technology life cycles were expected to
last longer than initially projected because businesses
and consumers were slowing their spending. This con-
trasts with the late 1990s, when, amid torrid technol-
ogy spending, cycles seemed to end almost as soon
as they had begun.

MANAGING INVENTORY
Managing inventory is the process a business uses
to obtain, organize, track, and replenish necessary
stock. Businesses that sell any kind of tangible mer-
chandise have inventory. For example, manufacturing
companies must keep track of the materials they need
to assemble their products, as well as the finished
products. Retailers and wholesalers must order the
products they plan to sell and know when to replenish
their stock. If a company manages its inventory well,
it is usually able to avoid either running out of mer-
chandise or becoming overstocked, both of which can
prove quite costly. Inventory management can also
help decision makers determine things like which
products are sold most often and at what times demand
reaches its peaks.
REASONS FOR USING INVENTORY
CONTROL TECHNIQUES
While inventory management at large corporations
tends to be more complex than at smaller businesses,
it is no less important for small companies. In fact,
small businesses are less likely to be able to handle
the financial repercussions of inadequate inventory
management. Businesses with too much inventory will
find themselves paying excess fees for storage. As a
result, they may have less cash available for opera-
tions. Businesses with too little inventory might alien-
ate customers by being out of stock too often. Finding
a balance between these two extremes is the goal of
inventory management.
Electronic inventory management systems used at
big companies are quite often complex and costly. By
contrast, some small businesses opt to keep track of
inventory manually. According to recommendations
published in the October 2000 issue of Inc.com, ‘‘it’s
to your benefit to implement a scaled-down version
of the same inventory/order fulfillment management
tools used by large corporations.’’ By having a more
sophisticated system in place, you will be able to
grow your business without having to revamp your
inventory management processes. Also, using an ex-
isting inventory management system upon which to
model your own procedures might help you to avoid
problems that might arise if you decide to develop
your own system. Finally, if you eventually decide to
outsource inventory management, ‘‘the transition to
a fulfillment house will be far easier if your system
adheres to standards other than the ones that only you
understand.’’
PUTTING INVENTORY MANAGEMENT IN
PLACE
Creating an inventory management system for a
business, even with a model to follow, involves con-
siderable research. You will likely find that you need
to purchase inventory management software. Be sure
to investigate your options as price and functionality
can vary substantially. Many small business owners
purchase a point-of-sale (POS) software system,
which tracks each sale as it is completed. This allows
inventory data to remain as current as possible. In
addition, because information is gathered and stored
electronically, you can run various reports on the data
to glean valuable information about your customers
purchasing patterns.
One option that allows online retailers to bypass
completing the task of managing inventory is having

manufacturers ship finished products directly to cus-
tomers who make purchases online. According to En-
trepreneur.com columnist Juanita Ellis, if your manu-
facturers are agreeable, ‘‘you can request that when
orders are placed at your site, they’re fulfilled and
distributed with your company’s shipping information
and logo. You’ll need to address product returns and
customer services. However, you won’t have to main-
tain inventory.’’
OUTSOURCING INVENTORY
MANAGEMENT
Should you choose to outsource inventory manage-
ment tasks, you will find that a wide number of fulfill-
ment companies offer services including inventory
management, packaging, shipping, return processing,
and credit-card transaction processing specifically for
small online businesses. For example, Ifulfillment.-
com, Fulfillmentplus.net, and Ifulfill.com each offer
such services. Ifulfillment.com serves both business-
to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B)
ventures and offers standard fulfillment services, such
as inventory management, packaging and shipping,
and return processing. All three firms offer compre-
hensive services that handle the fulfillment process
from the moment a customer clicks on a ‘‘Buy Now’’
icon until the merchandise is delivered, ensuring all
the while that your inventory is adequate. Also, many
Web hosting companies offer inventory-related fulfill-
ment services. While these services can be somewhat
limited, depending on the hosting company, they may
be suitable for small online businesses.

MARKETING PLANS FOR ONLINE
ENTERPRISES
The marketing aspect of any business is critical to
its success. It’s even more critical for an e-business,
because cyberspace is much more crowded that physi-
cal space. Your marketing plan is vitally important,
because it outlines the scope of your market, as well
as the activities you need to perform to capture your
fair market share.
Your e-marketing activities should include the fol-
lowing three elements:
T
Size
T
Selection
T
Targeting
ANTICIPATING YOUR MARKET
No matter how good your product or service is, it
won’t become prosperous if the size of your potential
market isn’t large enough to support it. Therefore, the
first order of business is to determine the size of your
target market and whether there is room for your
product or service to thrive and make your business
profitable.
This stage requires some research; there are many
ways to conduct research on different market seg-
ments. Some of the best sources with which to start
are:
T
Trade organizations related to your business
T
Government reports and statistics
T
Consulting firms that cover your area of interest
After you find out the size of your market, present
your information in a way that is simple and easy
to understand. The ideal approach is to use a graph
showing the total market as it relates to your target
market. Keep in mind that it is impossible for one
company to acquire the entire market, as this would
constitute a monopoly.
USING MARKET DATA EFFECTIVELY
Once you determine and validate that the overall
size of your market is sufficient to support your current
and future business needs, proceed to the next stage
to refine your targeting effort.
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
At this stage, narrow your focus to the specific
target market you are planing to service. Break down
the entire market into different categories. Let’s as-
sume that your new enterprise focuses on online book-
ings for hotels only. In this case, knowing that the
total number of online travel bookings is large doesn’t
tell you much. You need to find out the exact size of
the hotel booking market.
An additional benefit of targeting is that you obtain
statistical information on all other segments of your
market. You might find it necessary to make modifica-
tions to your plan if some segments become more
promising than others in their size and growth po-
tential.
TARGETING POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS
Targeting is a function of deciding on a specific
target market and defining the link between the need
of this market target and the products or services that
you provide. When you decide to target a specific
market segment, you must also keep in mind the need
and value you defined. In other words, when you have
a choice in selecting a market target, choose the one
that most closely matches your vision. This will ensure
a reasonable connection between your customers and
your plans.
EFFECTIVELY MARKETING TO YOUR
CUSTOMERS
The next stage is to outline the activities related
to marketing your e-business. Since you are building
an e-strategy, your focus will be on e-marketing. How-
ever, this does not mean that you won’t need to imple-
ment traditional marketing practices.
The first thing to remember about e-marketing is
that when you enter the connected economy, you are
just one out of millions of e-business sites. If you
don’t practice basic e-marketing activities, your e-
business will be lost in the jungle of the World
Wide Web.
POSITIONING. Optimize your site based on the need
and value that you are providing, and on the market
that you have selected. The most important aspect of
site optimization and positioning is the perspective of
the customer. This means that when you are selecting
meta tags and keywords for your site, always think
about what keywords your client will use to search
for your services.
You can find out what keywords your potential
customers are using by contracting the services of a
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) firm. This service
will let you know what keywords people use when
they search for your type of online service. You should
design and insert keywords and meta tags reflecting
the properties of interactivity and simplicity (in addi-
tion to other features, such as value, services, and
so on).
OPTIMIZATION. Optimizing your site is just the first
stage. Now that your site has all the proper keywords
and meta tags, it’s time to move to the next stage—
posting search engines and directories.
Positioning is an art unto itself, and usually requires
a professional familiar with this area. Most search
engines and directories post manually (someone must
fill out the application form and submit it to the search
engine or directory).
When your business is just starting, it is impossible
to know which search engines or directories are going
to be the most suitable for you. At this point, select
the most visible companies. Later, when you receive
tracking reports, you may wish to make some changes.
OTHER TACTICS
Everything we’ve done thus far falls under the
‘‘passive
marketing’’
category.
We’ve
laid
the
groundwork to receive customers into your site, but
we have not yet done anything to ‘‘push’’ customers
in that direction.
In order to push customers to your Web site, first
develop programs that will promote your site and
entice potential customers to visit. There are many
ways to practice such programs, but you need to deter-
mine what is most suitable for your e-business.
The most successful e-programs are very carefully
and elaborately planned, and narrowly and specifically
targeted. The first order of business is to determine
what kind of a program you want to initiate. Let’s
assume that you are thinking of developing a direct-
mail piece that will entice customers to log-on to your
site and book their next cruise with you.
Your target market in this case includes those cus-
tomers who are very likely to book cruise trips online.
Your form of media is direct mail. In this case,
you should contact a direct-mail house and obtain
statistics on the demographics and lifestyles of past
cruise-line customers. From that, you can pull all po-
tential new customers to match this profile. First, you
should make a market test in one geographic area,
and monitor the return rate.
Lastly, you need a promotional offer. For instance,
you could offer a 10 percent discount off the cruise
rate to those customers who log on to your Web site
and book their trip within a specified period after
receiving the mailing.
The point is that a well established and well bal-
anced e-business-marketing program is one that com-
bines traditional- and cyber-marketing elements, lev-
eraging all the benifits of the former in order to build

the latter, and creating a way where online and physi-
cal marketing schemes reinforce each other. The tradi-
tional components include elements related to the se-
lection and targeting of your market segment. The
electronic components include activities that make
your e-business more visible in the messy world of
e-business and put your business in front of as many
potential online customers as possible.

MERCHANT ACCOUNTS
Merchant accounts are an essential component of
credit card transaction processing. Each time a con-
sumer makes a purchase using a credit card, two types
of banks are involved: a card-issuing bank and an
acquiring, or merchant, bank. A card-issuing bank is
one that issues credit cards to consumers. When a
consumer uses a credit card to purchase a product or
service, an acquiring bank, also known as a merchant
bank, obtains approval from the card-issuing bank at
the time of the transaction. To accept credit cards
as a method of payment, you must first establish a
merchant account by forming a relationship with an
acquiring financial institution. This relationship en-
ables you to process transactions and obtain cash from
credit card purchases via a merchant identification
number.
For several decades, credit card transactions have
taken place either in retail outlets or by mail or tele-
phone order. The rise of e-commerce in the late 1990s
created a new medium for credit card payments: the
Internet. A basic online credit card transaction begins
when a consumer selects for purchase goods or ser-
vices offered on a Web site and completes a merchant
commerce application. Once a commerce application
is complete, the site sends it to the acquiring bank by
way of real-time online processing software, which
allows for real-time transactions. (Real-time transac-
tions are either accepted or declined immediately after
the commerce application is completed.) After receiv-
ing the commerce application, the acquiring bank
sends a request for credit card authorization to the
75
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
acquiring processor—a company that provides credit
card processing, billing, reporting, and settlement ser-
vices. The acquiring processor sends the request to the
card-issuing bank, which responds with an approval or
denial code that is forwarded to the acquiring bank
and then to the merchant. This entire process usually
takes 10 to 15 seconds.
While approval is nearly instantaneous, consum-
ers’ cards are not charged at the time of purchase.
Rather, the card-issuing bank puts a hold on the card
for the transaction amount. A merchant’s batch—all
the credit card transactions processed during a speci-
fied time frame—is typically settled at the end of the
business day. At this time the acquiring bank processes
the charges. It typically takes an additional day or
two for the bank to deposit credit card sales into your
merchant account.
Although this process sounds complex, for most
business owners, accepting credit card payments via
the Internet is simply a matter of establishing a mer-
chant account and purchasing online credit card pro-
cessing software to facilitate the process. To ease
consumer fears regarding the risks involved in using
credit cards online, most software companies have
incorporated secure electronic transaction (SET) spec-
ifications, which support credit card payments over
the Web, into their processing software. Many pro-
grams also use address verification service (AVS)
technology, which checks the first four numbers of
the street address and zip code given by a consumer
at the time of purchase. Unless the billing address
given by the consumer matches the billing address on
file with the card-issuing bank, the transaction is not
processed.
To obtain a merchant account for your online busi-
ness, contact your financial institution of choice. Most
acquiring banks will ask for an explanation of your
operations, such as what types of products and services
you offer and how you deliver them to customers.
Communicating about how you conduct business will
help you and your financial institution determine
which transaction processing model to use. If you have
already established a merchant account for traditional
credit card transactions, you will need to obtain a
separate identification number, known as a terminal
ID, for Internet transactions.
The fees charged and services offered by merchant
account providers vary widely. Some providers charge
one-time application fees, while others do not. Nearly
all providers charge a small fee per transaction as well
as a merchant discount fee. A merchant discount fee,
or discount rate, is the percentage of sales that a mer-
chant pays to credit card companies to process transac-
tions. Typically, merchant discount rates—which are
based on factors such as sales volume, average receipt
size, industry, and risk—range from 1 to 4 percent.

For online transactions, you should expect to pay a
higher merchant discount rate than for traditional retail
transactions due to a perceived higher level of risk.
In a traditional retail transaction, the retail merchant
typically makes contact with both the credit card and
the consumer and is not held responsible for potential
fraud. An online transaction, however, is completed
without the customer and credit card present, leaving
you accountable for any wrongdoing. This makes you
more vulnerable to chargebacks, which happen when
a consumer disputes a credit card transaction. If a
card-issuing bank issues a chargeback to a consumer,
you will be charged the cost of the transaction. A high
level of chargebacks might prompt an acquiring bank
to suspend your merchant account, eliminating your
ability to process credit cards.
By the early 2000s, most merchant account provid-
ers allowed clients to either rent or purchase a compre-
hensive merchant account ‘‘solution’’ for credit card
transaction processing. Many of these solutions in-
clude all of the software and support necessary to
allow a business owner to begin accepting credit card
payments within a few days. While the vast number of
these merchant account solution providers can prove
overwhelming, researching various options is your
best bet for finding the right merchant account for
your business. For starters, you might consider paying
a visit to a site like MerchantSeek.com, which pro-
vides a current listing of the lowest-priced merchant
account providers as well as information about what
types of services each provider offers.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
Although they differ in the fine details, mergers
and acquisitions are closely related business transac-
tions to sustain and grow your business. An acquisition
is the purchase of one company by another. The pur-
chase may be paid in cash, shares of stock, debt as-
sumption, or a combination of methods. Typically,
the acquiring company takes managerial control of
the business it buys, although sometimes an acquired
business is given leeway to operate as a fairly autono-
mous subsidiary. A merger, meanwhile, unites two
companies into a new entity, often with a new name.
But even in cases where two companies agree to a
merger of ‘‘equals’’, one typically ends up in a more
powerful position. In fact, many analysts argue that
mergers of equals simply don’t exist.
Among Internet-based companies, merger and ac-
quisition activity heated up in the late 1990s. Dot-
com upstarts saw mergers and acquisitions as a way to
gain instant access to new customers and to strengthen
their position in new markets. For example, online
auction powerhouse eBay bought Paris-based iBazar
for $112 million in 2001 to expand its presence in
Europe. At the same time, many traditional companies
used mergers and acquisitions to gain quick access
to new technology, as KB Toys did when it bought
Brainplay.com in 1999 rather than build its own online
sales operation. One of the largest Internet-related
mergers, the $183 billion marriage of AOL and Time
Warner Inc. to form AOL Time Warner Inc., tried to
secure AOL’s position for the long run as an integrated
Internet and consumer media player.
Industry analysts predict the pace of Internet-re-
lated merger and acquisition activity will remain
steady throughout the early 2000s. Gaining access to
new technology, securing new customers, building
market share, and creating economies of scale are
some of the most common reasons for consolidation
deals like these. According to a January 2002 issue
of CRMDaily, PeopleSoft’s 2002 acquisition of An-
nuncio Software reflected a widespread belief among
online players that ‘‘if you lack the resources or the
will to build a tool or application you crave, then the
next best thing is to buy the company that has already
figured it out.’’
Should small business owners follow suit and pur-
sue a merger or acquisition? According to a May 2002
article in Entrepreneur.com, it depends on who your
prospects for partnering are. ‘‘Obviously, selecting
the right business is key to the success of the combina-
tion. The right business should have elements that
combine well with yours. Your business and the other
business should possess unique strengths that enhance
the performance of each other’s contribution to the
new combined business’s bottom line.’’ Ideally, a
merger or acquisition will allow you to increase reve-
nue by selling your products or services to a new
customer base and/or selling new products and ser-
vices to your existing customer base. A deal might also
allow you to consolidate and streamline operations to
cut costs.

To figure out whether a deal is worth pursuing,
you will have to conduct extensive due diligence, a
careful inquiry into your target’s history, finances,
competitive position, and business practices. Often,
attorneys and accountants need to be involved in this
detailed review. They can advise not only on the fit-
ness of the target company, but also on the legality
of the deal.
While you may not have a legal team at your
disposal, you can still conduct extensive research on
your own. Consider carefully the risks of the transac-
tion. What difficulties might a merger or acquisition
pose for your current operations? How disruptive
would such a deal be? Will you alienate existing cus-
tomers? Also investigate the weaknesses of the other
company and be honest about your own. Moreover,
calculate whether the deal will generate enough addi-
tional revenue or savings to offset the time and money
you will spend on integration.
One of the biggest stumbling blocks to mergers
and acquisitions for small private companies is valua-
tion, or deciding what a company is worth. To keep
matters consistent and open, EntreWorld’s Margaret
Heffernan recommends agreeing ahead of time on a
basis for valuation, such as market comparisons or
revenue multiples. ‘‘On that basis,’’ she says, ‘‘rela-
tive ownership, stock-option pricing and other aspects
of ownership can be calculated in a transparent
manner.’’
Once a merger or acquisition is completed on pa-
per, you will need to spend considerable time integ-
rating the two businesses. Experts believe this process
takes at least one year. Along with dealing with opera-
tional issues, expect to face human resources issues
as well, particularly if layoffs are part of your integra-
tion plan.
As with nearly any business task, if integration is
something you would rather hand off to a third party,
a wide variety of consultants specialize in this area.
They can not only negotiate mergers and acquisitions,
but also oversee the integration afterwards.

METATAG STRATEGY AND DESIGN
Metatags, also known as meta tags, are an essential
part of a well-designed Web site. They are not seen
by visitors to the site, but they are read by search
engines, spiders, and similar indexing programs. They
can affect where a Web site will appear on a keyword
search. With the explosive growth in the number of
Web sites, Web users have become more dependent
on search engines to find relevant sites. As a result,
metatag strategy has evolved into a field called search
engine optimization (SEO). Search engine optimiza-
tion means getting your Web site listed at the top
of search engine results when users enter a related
keyword in one of the major search engines.
WHAT ARE METATAGS?
Metatags are simply words that are embedded in
a Web site but are not visible to users. They typically
follow the site’s heading. Every Web site has a head-
ing. The heading begins with the title of the Web site.
The title may be followed by a short comment of a
few sentences. The comment is useful for search en-
gines that don’t use metatags.
The first metatag is the description. The description
applies to the page to be displayed in search results.
Experts recommend that metatag descriptions be lim-
ited to a few sentences, with 150 characters as the
maximum recommended length. The description
should contain complete sentences and employ good
grammar. The description should not include the key-
words under which the site is to be listed. Some search
engines display the description in their displayed re-
sults.
The second metatag is a list of keywords. Five to
seven keywords are recommended, as more tend to
dilute their impact on search engine rankings. Key-
word Wizard (www.keywordwizard.com) has com-
piled a list of the top 5,000 keywords by collecting
information on live searches from major search en-
gines and tabulating the results.

USING KEYWORDS TO IMPROVE SEARCH
ENGINE RESULTS
According to an August 2001 post to Search Engine
Forums (http://searchengineforums.com), most search
engines no longer read most metatags. Rather, rank-
ings are based on keyword density for the page, the
title tag, the headline tags, and link popularity. Thus,
writing keyword-rich content can be more effective
in optimizing search engine placement than spending
a lot of time with metatags.
SEO experts recognize the importance of using the
right keywords in Web page copy, not just in metatags.
One recommendation is to develop compelling copy
for end-users and to incorporate keywords that are
relevant to the site. The use of these keywords will
typically improve a site’s rankings in search engine
results for queries using those keywords. This copy,
unlike metatags, is visible to the user.
The critical factor is using keywords that not only
represent what your site is all about but that also match
keywords that people are using in conducting Web
searches. A couple of resources that can help with the
search for the right keywords are Keyword Wizard and
WordTracker (www.wordtracker.com). WordTracker
is a paid service that offers a free trial at its Web site.
It is a database service that ranks keywords based on
whether or not people are actually using them and
how many other sites are using the same keywords.
Keyword Wizard offers a list of the top 5,000 key-
words currently in use.
Once you have determined the most effective key-
words, these can be incorporated into the Web site’s
descriptive copy, which users will read, as well as
into its meta description tags, which are invisible to
users but are sometimes picked up by search engines.
Experts recommend using the keywords at least three
times in descriptive copy and incorporating them into
headlines and subheads whenever possible. Hyper-
linking the keywords will help them get noticed by
search engines. Hyperlinking keywords is more effec-
tive in text-based page navigation links than in image
links, such as buttons.
PAY-FOR-PLACEMENT SEARCHES
Many search engines have adopted the practice of
offering pay-for-placement search results. Companies
typically pay a fee to list or link their sites to specific
keywords. During the first three quarters of 2001, paid
keyword placements accounted for 4 percent of online
advertising revenues. They represented the fees that
online search engines charge advertisers to list and/
or to link their company sites to specific keywords or
phrases. The fees are often generated through a bid-
ding process, with the highest bidder for a particular
keyword appearing at the top of the search results for
that keyword. Overture Services, formerly known as
GoTo.com, was considered the market leader in offer-
ing ‘‘paid inclusion’’ in search engine results.
According to a mid-2001 survey done by Jupiter
Media Metrix and reported by eMarketer, pay-for-
placement ad spending ranked the highest among five
types of online advertising in terms of effectiveness
and satisfaction. Companies were more satisfied over-
all with pay-for-placement search results than with
opt-in e-mail, paid inclusion, cost-per-click banner
ads, and cost-per-thousand banner ads.
Another factor highlighting the importance of
search engine results was the fact that Web searching
was a major online activity. According to a U.S. De-
partment of Commerce survey released in February
2002, the top five activities of U.S. Internet users
were:
T
e-mail (84 percent)
T
product/service
information
searches
(67.3
percent)
T
news, weather, sports (61.8 percent)
T
playing games (42.1 percent)
T
product/service purchases (39.1 percent)
In a February 2001 survey by the NPD Group,
some 55 percent of more than 2,000 U.S. respondents
said their online purchases originated with search
listings.
OTHER TECHNIQUES FOR IMPROVING
SEARCH ENGINE RESULTS
There are several other tools and techniques that
can be used to improve search engine results. They
include:
T
Adding links from other sites. These can include
larger, high-traffic sites that are relevant to your
business as well as paid listings in directories.
T
Purchasing a program that adds search capabilities
to your site and indexes it on a regular basis. These
programs are useful for sites that make frequent
changes. One example is the Search Partner pro-
gram available from FastSearch.com.
T
Subscribing to the SubmitDirector service, which
provides charts, graphs, and analytics that allow
you to see your site the same way search en-
gines do.
T
Using Web positioning software for home page
creation that also automates submitting your Web
site to various search engines as well as reporting
functions.

In short, using the appropriate keywords in meta-
tags is only one step toward optimizing search engine
results. It should be part of an overall strategy that
incorporates as many tools and techniques as possible
to drive traffic from keyword searches to your site.

MULTILINGUAL ISSUES IN E-
COMMERCE
A great advantage of the Internet is that it gives
companies, regardless of size, a global reach. How-
ever, international markets present problems of their
own, and one of the most vexing is language. The
typical company Web site in the European Union
can usually display the same page in four or more
languages. By contrast, at the beginning of 2001, only
35 Fortune 100 companies had Web sites in languages
other than English. In 2001 85 percent of all Web
sites were written in English, although only 45 percent
of Internet users spoke English as their native lan-
guage—and the percentage of English native speakers
drops with each passing day.
Doing business in more than one language can
have clear benefits for a company. By one estimate
it can increase a firm’s revenues by as much as 300
percent, and by 2003, according to Forrester Research,
79
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
Europe and Japan will account for about half of all
e-commerce revenues. A firm’s customers are more
comfortable using a Web site in their native language
and tend to remain at such a site twice as long as they
stay at sites other languages. Nothing shows a firm
to be global more than a multilingual Web site. Finally,
a multilingual Web site is an important courtesy to
foreign customers, one that builds trust and confidence
and lays the foundation for a long-term relationship.
Translation of a Web site into a foreign language
is not a straightforward task—it can be fraught with
peril. For example, the Pepsi-Cola slogan ‘‘Come
alive with the Pepsi Generation’’ was translated into
Chinese unwittingly as ‘‘Pepsi brings your ancestors
back from the dead.’’ The best way to avoid such
errors is to develop a Web site in neutral English,
without slang, colloquialisms, or word play. Prepara-
tion makes translation easier and assures consistency
among all translations of a company’s Web site. Some
companies first develop a model Web site that incor-
porates specific elements recommended for all its for-
eign language pages; other optional material—for ex-
ample certain press releases of more narrow interest—
can be omitted by local or regional offices.
Translation is best done by native speakers who
grasp the various senses of all words and are also
familiar with the cultural background and business
practices of the target market. Finally, translations
should be checked and double-checked by native
speakers. Because language variants are spoken in
different parts of the world—for example, one form
of Spanish in Spain, another in Latin America—the
language on foreign language pages should also steer
clear of local dialect, colloquialisms, slang, etc.
Translation of the English text is only the first step.
There are a multitude of nonverbal Web site elements
whose significance in a foreign culture must be taken
into consideration. For example, familiar icons such
as the hand-up palm-out ‘‘stop’’ sign or the thumb-
up OK sign are considered obscene in some countries.
Color can also carry unintended, possibly alienating
meanings. Green is sacred in the Middle East, for
example, and it is considered sacrilegious to use it in
connection with money, while in parts of Asia, to
write a person’s name in red is to wish him or her dead.
Other apparently simple Web site elements must
be translated too, or companies risk customer confu-
sion or resentment. When Americans write December
1, 2002, numerically, the order is month-day-year:
12-01-2002. In Europe it is written day-month-year:
01-12-2002. Similarly the address fields on the order
pages of most U.S. Web sites can accept information
only in United States format. How should international
customers respond if their locale doesn’t have street
addresses or postal codes or if there is no field for a
country? Forrester Research found that in 2001 75
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
percent of American Web sites able to take online
orders could not accept international addresses. Web
sites looking to attract a multilingual clientele should
also take other factors into consideration: weights and
measures, currency, ways of writing time, etc. There
are so many apparently insignificant items to take into
consideration that consultancies have arisen in the
e-commerce sector that specialize in designing and
maintaining multilingual, multicultural Web pages or
in performing ‘‘cultural audits.’’
If a page is translated but international users area
not able to find the translation on the Web site, it is
pointless. A language gateway is needed or users will
be lost. Some sites use flags to indicate their multilin-
gual pages. This can be problematic. Mexicans, Ar-
gentineans, Colombians, Chileans, and many other
nationalities besides Spaniards can be expected to
access a site’s Spanish pages. Plus, too many flag
icons quickly eat up space on the screen. Alternatives
include the word ‘‘welcome’’ in each target language
or a pull-down menu listing the languages.
Translating a Web site can alter the layout of a
Web page too. When English is translated, the text
almost always gets longer or shorter. European lan-
guages can take 10 percent more space than the En-
glish equivalent, while English text gets shorter when
translated into many Asian languages. Length affects
more than the text on a page. If an English command
fits perfectly in a graphic element—a command bar,
for instance—the German translation will almost cer-
tainly overflow the graphic, throwing the page lay-
out off.
Global companies must consider becoming com-
pletely multilingual. Unless the multilingual site is
only intended as a prestige item, multilingual staff
will be needed to deal with e-mail and phone inquiries
that come in foreign languages. If such services are
not available, a company should clearly say so on its
Web site.
The transition to multilingual e-business can be
tricky, and it is best to make a slow transition, con-
verting to one language at a time and using the experi-
ence garnered from one transition to make future con-
versions smoother. It is expensive to set up a
multilingual site. A Web site with pages in six lan-
guages can cost 20 percent more to set up than a
single-language site, and that’s if the site is designed
from the ground up as multilingual. Adding languages
to an existing English site can add as much as 50
percent to the original cost. Once up, multilingual
sites cost at least 10 percent more to maintain. They
can cost time as well. Jupiter Media Metrix estimated
that multilingual site planning takes up to ten months.
Another expense is compatible software. One of the
greatest challenges for a site going multilingual is
adapting software to accept languages other than En-
glish. Unlike Western European languages, whose
character sets are supported by most software, some
Asian languages use over 6000 different characters,
which cannot be reproduced by most software pack-
ages. Combining just English, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and
Arabic character sets, not to mention Chinese or Japa-
nese, can call for expensive, complicated modifica-
tions. The basis for the modifications is Unicode, a
‘‘super character set’’ that is able to represent most
of the world’s languages.
Despite their expense, multilingual sites can save
a company money in the long run. According to the
Aberdeen Group, customers are less likely to return
goods they purchased from a Web site in their own
language. In addition, if users can read the site’s FAQs
and access account data in their own language, they
are far less likely to make customer service calls to
a company, a major source of expense. Aberdeen
Group found that every customer service call can cost
a company US$30 to US$60; A Web site visit, how-
ever, costs only about US$1.
Multilingual sites have rewards as well as costs
for a company, and they must be set up with care. A
good site, once in place, can increase a firm’s market
many times over.

MULTIMEDIA IN E-COMMERCE
Multimedia Web applications are one of the prizes
of Web design and fulfill some of the Internet’s most
valuable potential. They allow companies to deliver
elaborate information to their customers and Web-site
users in the most sophisticated fashion by combining
text, graphics, audio, video, and graphic animation,
often all at once.
However, the decision whether to include multime-
dia features on your site isn’t clear-cut. Multimedia
carries with it all sorts of considerations and draw-
backs, so entrepreneurs need to take their business
needs into consideration before reaching a decision.
You should ask, will my customers truly benefit from
multimedia? Will multimedia features add value to
my Web site? What is the customer base I am trying
to reach? And are my customers likely to have Internet
connections fast enough for multimedia?
DELIVERING AUDIO FROM YOUR WEB
SITE
All methods of Internet-based audio delivery are
similar: an audio source is converted to an encoded
digital signal and compressed so as to speed delivery
and consume less room on hard drives. Streaming
audio live to your users generally involves installing
an audio server, software that manages all the requests
for audio content on your site.
Using one of the many streaming audio software
applications on the market, you encode the audio
source by selecting a target bandwidth—usually 14.4
Kpbs or 28.8 Kpbs for most users—and identify
whether the source is a live audio stream or an existing
digitized packet. The application then encodes and
compresses the file so that it is fit for transmission in
the format you desire.
It’s important to obtain your audio selections from
the highest quality source available, because compres-
sion removes a great deal of the original signal in
order to create a more manageable file. With a higher
quality starting point, the encoder can more easily
analyze the data involved and the compression will
preserve the most meaningful content.

ADDING VIDEO
Video is an even more glamorous multimedia ap-
plication, but faces the same difficulties as delivering
audio files. Later versions of the leading Web
browsers include plug-ins that greatly expand the us-
ability of video clips and streaming video, but band-
width and quality considerations still abound.
Deciding exactly what kind of video you want to
stream to your users can be tricky. On the one hand,
you’ll want high quality so your firm doesn’t seem
amateurish and so your customers receive quality ser-
vice. On the other hand, the more sophisticated the
video file, the more data is will require, and the more
space it will consume. This leads to excessive dow-
nload times, which may lead users to abandon the
video altogether and make them frustrated with
your site.
Once you decide to include video on your Web
site, you must digitize, edit, and upload your video
source for transmission. The three main file types used
for Web video are AVI, MPEG, and QuickTime. AVI
is a video format for Windows programs and is the
least common. MPEG and QuickTime, however, are
used very widely. Designed for CD-ROMs and video
games, MPEG boasts very high output quality, but
MPEG files consume more space than QuickTime
files. In addition, MPEG requires special hardware
designed specifically to digitize and video into MPEG
and to play back MPEG files. Thus, MPEG comes with
a higher price tag. QuickTime digitizing hardware
is cheap compared with MPEG hardware, and the
software-based editing process is also cheaper than
its MPEG rival. However, compared with MPEG,
QuickTime suffers lower quality.
As with audio, your original video source should
be of the highest quality available. After digitizing it,
you can edit and manipulate it with widely available
software. The various compression schemes again of-
fer you the choice of the greatest balance between
quality and manageability to suit your and your users’
needs. Finally, you simply upload the files as you
would any HTML or graphic files, and set up your
server so that when your multimedia files are dow-
nloaded, users’ browsers will know to launch what-
ever applications or plug-ins they need to access
the file.
USING MULTIMEDIA EFFECTIVELY
As for how best to render multimedia on your Web
page, the most sophisticated methods move beyond
simple HTML hyperlinks to multimedia files to a
more
seamless
integration
involving
extensible
markup language (XML) and its multimedia standard,
Synchronous
Multimedia
Integration
Language
(SMIL). These languages harness the powers of rich

media, which refers to the delivery of various formats
of multimedia from a single source via all transmission
methods, such as broadband, wireless, and telephone
lines. XML, poised as the lingua franca of e-com-
merce, is embedded with these rich media capabilities
and specifically gears them towards e-commerce,
while SMIL is designed to synchronize the delivery
of all manner of multimedia content, including video,
audio, animation, graphics, and text in the desired
combination and timing.

NETWORK TOPOLOGIES IN E-
COMMERCE
When setting up the computer systems for your e-
commerce enterprise, you need to figure out how your
computers will be configured in relation to each other.
Your computer systems need to communicate with
each other in some fashion based on how many people
are working together and what kinds of computer
files and resources they share. The way they are tied
together in your computer network is known as a
network topology. There are three primary topologies
common to most computer networks, and you can
either adopt one of them or combine different elements
of each.
STAR NETWORKS
The oldest and most common topology is the star
network. In this configuration, a central computer,
often a powerful one, resides at the figurative center
of your network, and connects individually to a num-
ber of smaller workstations, thereby centralizing the
network communications between the individual com-
puters. The star network is the topology of choice
for mainframe-based networks, where the mainframe
links hierarchically to a series of microcomputers
point-to-point and acts as the host computer for them.
In this case, the mainframes perform the bulk of the
work, while the workstations generally just send and
receive data to and from the host.
RING NETWORKS
Ring network topologies are similar to star net-
works except for one crucial difference: there is no
central mainframe or host computer to which the
workstations are connected. Instead, the workstations
all connect to each other as if in a closed loop. More
expensive than the alternatives, ring networks are
probably the least common network topology. How-
ever, one advantage of the ring architecture is that,
within smaller local area networks (LANs), data flows
are much more fluid and change directions with
greater regularity. A ring architecture allows for con-
nections to be quickly and easily rearranged to account
for the more dynamic data-traffic demands. This flexi-
bility in the configuration of data flows also allows for
greater adaptability, so that as you begin to combine
network topologies, you can pick and choose the most
effective entry points and hubs for connecting the ring
with the outside network.
BUS NETWORKS
Bus networks take their name from urban bus sys-
tems, and function in much the same way. In this
topology, workstation microcomputers are connected
to each other via a single high-speed cable that runs
through each computer station. The computers thus
constitute ‘‘stops’’ along this cable route, and along
this route data stops at each computer to drop off and
pick up data. Thus, like ring networks, the bus network
topology features no central host computer.
POOLING TOPOLOGIES
Depending on the size and complexity of your
company, you can also combine a few different topol-
ogies, creating a larger topology out of two or more
smaller configurations. For instance, you can combine
several different star networks via one bus configura-
tion, where the bus runs through the individual star
networks’ hosts to drop off and pick up data. Thus,
while the star networks feature individual worksta-
tions connected point-to-point with their particular
hubs, the bus cable runs through the successive hubs
to combine the different networks. This method is
known as ‘‘daisy chaining’’ the topologies together.
Similarly, star networks can be combined into a large
ring network via a high-speed fiber-optic backbone.
In this method, the hubs of the individual star networks
can act as, or plug into, a hub in a circular chain.

MANAGING AND OPTIMIZING YOUR
NETWORK TOPOLOGY
The bottom line is that your network architecture
needs to be strong and resilient enough to ensure
business continuity, avoiding outages and hang-ups.
Customers in the fast-paced e-commerce market are
notoriously impatient with downtime, perhaps seeing
it as a sign of shoddy IT practices, and so your network
topology should be designed not only for efficient
data sharing, but for durability, as well. Thus, effective
management of your internal network architecture is
a crucial component of your customer service opera-
tions, both in keeping the network running and in
ensuring the greatest possible speed and efficiency of
data flows through your organization and between
you and your customers.
This also impacts your method of data backup.
While you many wish for the convenience of storing
information in a central mainframe computer, the loss
of that information due to a mainframe crash or severe
virus of some kind could be devastating. To ward off
such possibilities, many firms opt to back up their
data using network-based methods such as online disc
mirroring, where information is sent via your wide
area network (WAN) to various remote data centers,
protecting your information by dispersing it.
At the most basic level, a physical map of your net-
work is useful to analyze and manage the data flows
through your company’s network infrastructure. These
maps are what give the star, bus, and ring networks their
names, as the layouts rendered on a map will visually
resemble those structures. You need to be able to clearly
visualize the exchange patterns in your organization, and
zero in on trouble spots to figure out the most effective
way to overcome data-transmission bottlenecks and other
information-flow inefficiencies.

ONGOING INTERNET MARKETING
Some may say that the road to achieving your
ultimate goals for success and profitability begins with

E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
having an e-business. Your future Internet prosperity,
however, depends on your ability to market that e-
business through online and traditional marketing
methods.
Cyber space is a very crowded place. Currently,
there are nearly 250 million Internet users and millions
of websites. As such, the challenge every e-business
must face is finding a way to stand apart from the
crowd.
There are two main tactics to utilize in making
your e-business more visible to potential customers: e-
marketing and traditional marketing. To be successful,
you must use both tactics in your e-business. In this
article we will focus only on the e-marketing compo-
nent of your online marketing plan.
E-marketing refers to any digitalized marketing
activity. This means the entire process of marketing
your services is done exclusively through electronics.
There are a few kinds of e-marketing methods, and
each type fulfills a different function in your overall
e-marketing campaign.
WEB SITE OPTIMIZATION
Web site optimization refers to the structure and
content of your Web site. Preferably, you should fulfill
this function while you are constructing your site. If
necessary, however, it can be incorporated after your
site is constructed.
Web site optimization includes the insertion of
keywords and meta tags. Keywords are the words
most likely used by your customers when they search
for the product or service you provide. It is critical
to remember that keywords are not what you, as a
business owner, assume your customers are using, but
rather what your customers are using when entering
keywords in the search engine. The only way to find
these keywords is to purchase special software that
searches the Web. This software will find and list
keywords people use when they search for your type
of online service.
Once you have obtained a list of keywords for your
product or service, incorporate them into the text of
your Web site. Remember that search engines and
directories don’t read images. Therefore, your key-
words must appear in a textual format.
Another form of Web site optimization is the use
of meta tags. These phrases reside in the back-end of
your Web site (where they are invisible to the user),
and include short descriptions and sentences with the
most-used keywords for your product or service.
Here, again, it is better to insert your meta tags
while constructing your Web site—although like key-
words, they can be added after the construction of
your site. But be aware of the disadvantage: Every

S O U R C E B O O K
time you make a change in your keywords or meta
tags, you need to resubmit your site to search engines
and directories.
SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO)
SEO is fairly complex and time-consuming pro-
cess. Generally speaking, most people looking for a
product or service on the Internet use a search engine
or directory to find information. The main difference
between search engines such as Google and directories
like Yahoo! is that search engines find and rank web-
sites using special software (sometimes called ‘‘spi-
ders’’), and any Web site can register. With directo-
ries, Web sites are reviewed and evaluated by
personnel, and they make the decision which site to
include in their listing.
The basic rule of SEO is that if the search engine
doesn’t list your site in the first ten positions, your
chances of being ‘‘discovered’’ are minimal. In other
words, most people will only see the first page of links
output by the search engine (the first ten listings).
Most search engines and directories have two sec-
tions in their first-page listings: the paid or sponsored
customers (usually the first three listings); and Web
sites that scored the highest in terms of matching
the keywords and meta tags you incorporated into
your site.
To be in the first three listings, you need to buy
your way in, which usually costs quite a bit of money.
Search engines and directories use different methods
for generating revenues from top positioning. One
method is to ‘‘sell’’ words. For example, if you are
in the business of selling sunglasses on the Web,
you can ‘‘buy’’ the word ‘‘sunglasses.’’ As a result,
anyone who enters ‘‘sunglasses’’ in their search will
see your Web site listed first. Typically, you can buy
a keyword for a period of three to six months.
Another way to buy into the top three listings is
to bid for words—often sites allow you to bid for
keywords. In this method, you bid a certain amount
of money for each word, and every time a visitor uses
that word, your Web site will appear in the top three
positions. Once the visitor clicks on your site’s hyper-
link, you’re charged the amount you bid. For example,
if you bid $1.00 for the word ‘‘sunglasses,’’ you will
be charged $1.00 every time someone uses the word
to link to your Web site (you must open an account
with the search engine first).

ONLINE AUCTIONS
Like a traditional auction, an online auction allows
potential customers to bid, via the Internet, what they
are willing to pay for products and services. The high-
est bid submitted by the auction deadline, as long as
it has met any minimum threshold set by the seller,
wins the auction. The highest bidder is legally obli-
gated to complete the transaction by sending payment
to the seller, who ships the product once the payment
is received. Online auctions can last anywhere from
a few days to a few weeks, and the length of time is
usually determined by the seller.
A BRIEF HISTORY
The history of online auctions is essentially the
history of eBay.com, which was founded in 1995
by 31-year-old Pierre Omidyar after his girlfriend, a
collector of Pez candy dispensers, expressed interest
in trading with other nearby collectors. Believing that
he could use the Internet to facilitate a trading system
of sorts, Omidyar built Auction Web, which allowed
sellers to briefly describe merchandise, set minimum
bids, and choose the length of the auction. Interested
buyers could submit a bid for an object. When the
auction expired, the highest bidder was able to pur-
chase the object for the bid price. The buyer and
seller were required to handle payment processing and
delivery. Although Auction Web offered no search
engine and no guarantees, traffic began to surge. To
make money, Auction Web began charging a small
commission based on the final price of each item
listed for sale. By mid-1996, the site had roughly
5,000 users.
Because of concerns that the anonymity of the
process left both buyers and seller with no recourse,
Omidyar created the Feedback Forum, which allowed
buyers and sellers to rate one another. In September
1997 he changed his site’s name to eBay.

POPULARITY GROWS WITH
TECHNOLOGY
Traffic continued to grow exponentially. By the
end of 1998, the number of registered users climbed
to 1.2 million and by the end of 1999 to 10 million,
with daily visitors averaging nearly 2 million. eBay
listed more than three million items for sale. Despite
competition from the likes of Yahoo! and Ama-
zon.com, which launched their own auction sites,
eBay continued to thrive in the early 2000s. According
to a May 2001 article in BusinessWeek Online, this
was because ‘‘in the world of Pez dispensers, critical
mass counts. If you want to sell something, you want
to go to the place where you’ll find the most buyers.
Because eBay built its storefront first, it quickly
achieved critical mass. Even when Yahoo! offered
sellers commission-free auctions and Amazon offered
buyers quality guarantees on merchandise purchased
through its auctions, the crowds failed to come. eBay
had already won the war.’’ It is this critical mass that
makes online auction platforms like eBay so attractive
to online entrepreneurs seeking a wide audience.
SELLING YOUR GOODS
Small business owners listing their goods on a site
like eBay gain immediate access to a huge base of
potential customers. In addition, because eBay, Ama-
zon.com, and other auction sites offer to help entrepre-
neurs create their own storefronts, you can launch
online operations with minimal investment in technol-
ogy. Businesses willing to spend extra dollars can
purchase more prominent listings in certain sections
of an auction site. According to Entrepreneur writer
Julie Vallone, ‘‘entrepreneurs can get lost in a huge
marketplace like eBay... so it pays to find ways to
improve access to buyers through marketing services
offered by the sites.’’
While eBay is the largest online auction site, other
options do exist. In April 2002, eBay drew 24.3 mil-
lion visitors, while its largest rival, Ubid, secured 3.6
million, which is not a trivial amount. While you
reduce your overall exposure by choosing a venue
like Ubid over eBay, you might prefer the less frenzied
bidding pace a smaller marketplace affords.
One downside to online auctions is that customers
typically expect to find bargains, which means you
will likely have to price products on the lower end
of the scale. However, several analysts believe an
auction format’s lower pricing point is offset by the
many benefits such a format affords small businesses.
Auctions allow you to sell excess inventory rather
than simply discard it. They also allow you to test
the market for new products and to determine what
customers are willing to pay. If you already operate
an online business, posting some of your merchandise
85
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
at an auction site might also allow you to build a base
of repeat customers who, satisfied with your products
and services, visit your Web site directly to make non-
auction purchases.
If you decide to sell products via an auction site
like eBay, be prepared to spend considerable time
listing the items and answering numerous e-mails
about them. The responsibility for billing, payment
processing, and shipping also rests on your shoulders.
If you’re willing to pay someone else to handle these
tasks, however, you can use services like those offered
by PayPal or Ifulfill.com. ‘‘Finally, be vigilant about
what you post, how you post, and how you present
yourself and your products to online customers,’’ Val-
lone advises. ‘‘Keep in mind that, in linking up with
an auction, you’re placing your business in front of
a worldwide audience of demanding customers.’’

ONLINE CONTENT MANAGEMENT
AND PROVISION
Online content is the mix of text and audio and
visual material available on a Web page. While Web
developers invest considerable time and resources in
the underlying technology that drives a Web site,
equally important to a site’s success is the content it
posts. As with most tasks associated with operating
a Web site, you can develop and manage content
yourself, you can hire a qualified individual to handle
this for you, or you hand it over to a Web development
company. For businesses looking to outsource con-
tent-related tasks, CNET.com offers an extensive list
of Web developers and their specialties.
PLAN YOUR CONTENT AREAS
Whether you are planning to develop and manage
your own content or to outsource it to a third party,
you will need to decide what type of content to include
on your site. Before you make this decision, content
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

86
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
strategist Barry Zeger recommends developing a thor-
ough and concrete understanding of your mission,
brand, and customers. This insight will ‘‘not only
allow your start-up to operate more strategically, but
it will also aid in the crafting of Web site content
that’s consistent, credible, and agreeable to everyone
who works on it.’’ Before getting to the specifics, it
is also a good idea to outline which sections you want
to include on your site. It might prove worthwhile to
examine rival Web sites, as you may find an appealing
organizational model to use for your own content.
If you intend to sell products or services online,
you will probably want to post extensive information
about your offerings. What information do your poten-
tial customers need to know before making a pur-
chase? Examples of relevant information include
product features, warranty descriptions, return poli-
cies, price, and delivery policies and procedures. To
make the purchase decision easier for your customers,
you can also include comparisons to rival products
and services that highlight your advantages. Many
online businesses also include sections with customer
testimonials and frequently asked questions, although
some experts caution that too much of this type of
information might overload potential customers. Quite
often, the organization of the information is as impor-
tant as the information itself. Visitors should be able
to access it if they wish, but they should not have to
wade through fine details to get to basic information.
Along with product information, most online busi-
nesses also include content about the company itself.
For example, you might write a company history or
compile a list of company milestones. You can also
include short biographies about your top managers.
It is also important to include your company’s physical
address and phone number. In addition, public compa-
nies typically offer extensive information to potential
investors. Again, be careful not to overwhelm visitors
with too much information. It is typically most appro-
priate for this type of content to be easily accessible
via a link, which allows visitors to choose whether
or not they need to view it.
MAKE THE SITE READABLE
Along with the information itself, tone, style, and
presentation are also important considerations when
developing online content. If you are selling snow-
boards, surfboards, and related accessories to teenag-
ers, the tone of your content will likely be less formal
than if you are selling diamond engagement rings.
Although the tone will vary depending on your cus-
tomer, a simple, straightforward writing style is typi-
cally most suitable. When deciding how to present
the information, choose a format that showcases infor-
mation in short, easy-to-read chunks, rather than bury-
ing it in long paragraphs. You might consider using
bulleted lists for product features and reasons to
choose your company over rivals.
KEEP VISITORS COMING BACK
To entice customers to return to your site on a
regular basis, you will also need to include information
that is updated on a regular basis. One way is to add
a news feed to your site. To get one, contact a news
compiler such as iSyndicate, Reuters, or Screamin-
gMedia. In most cases, the provider will supply the
coding you need to present their news on your site.
They will also provide options for limiting the news
to relevant topics, perhaps by keyword or predefined
category. This will help make sure the news is mean-
ingful and appropriate to your visitors.
Other forms of regularly updated information in-
clude weather updates, stock tickers, search engines,
chat rooms, and bulletin boards. SmallBizManager.-
com lists various sources of free Web content for
small businesses. Depending on your area of expertise,
you might also consider writing a regular column or
newsletter. For example, if you are planning to sell
plants and gardening supplies online, many of your
visitors might be interested in how-to articles related
to gardening or calendars of local gardening events.
MANAGE AND TRACK YOUR RESULTS
Managaing content is an ongoing process and com-
mitment. To continue drawing new and repeat visitors,
your site should be as up-to-date as possible. You can
also gauge the effectiveness of existing content by
keeping track of which pages visitors to your site view
most frequently, how long they typically spend on
each page, which links they tend to select. Various
tools are available for this type of traffic tracking.
You can also ask customers to comment on your site’s
content. Whichever evaluation method you use, keep
in mind that the key to effective content management
is ensuring your content is in line with your market-
ing goals.

ONLINE FREELANCING
As the Internet and e-commerce make it possible
for companies to market and sell to customers around
the world, it allows workers to apply for jobs and
work for employers anywhere via their computers.
These online workers go by many names—teleworker,
free agent, contract professional, Netrepreneur, and
most commonly, electronic freelancer or e-lancer. E-
lancers represent another step in the globalized, down-
sized corporate culture of the twenty-first century, in
which company staff are cut to the bone and workers
are hired on a temporary project basis.
E-lancers frequently never set foot in the compa-
nies they work for. Unlike workers with day jobs,
they must continually plan for the next job; they must
provide their own benefits and pay their own taxes.
However, they are also able to choose when, where,
how, and to an extent for whom they work—a degree
of freedom the traditionally employed might envy.
The first e-lancers in the 1990s were programmers,
Web designers, and other information technology (IT)
professionals. IT workers remain the fastest-growing
segment of online freelancers in the world. It is quickly
spreading to other fields, including writers, editors,
translators, accountants, marketing specialists, law-
yers, data entry personnel, and salespeople.
E-commerce insiders maintain that the number of
e-lancers is booming, but hard figures are not easy to
come by. The U.S. government reported that 11.5
million Americans were self-employed in 2000 but
did not indicate how many worked primarily via the
Internet. A large number of U.S. workers might be e-
lancing as early as 2005, according to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor, and two important online brokers of
e-work, eLance and Guru.com, experienced rapid
growth in the early 2000s. E-lancing is clearly an
international phenomenon with much anecdotal evi-
dence of programmers in India, Asia and Eastern Eu-
rope telecommuting with U.S. firms. Illustrating the
importance of international workers, eLance.com, a
leading online job board for e-lancers, is set up to pay
workers in their local currency.
E-lancing may not be catching on at the same rate
the world over, however. One Austrian study released

the paradoxical finding that in Europe, a greater per-
centage of regular company employees—rather than
freelancers—are teleworkers. One reason e-lancing is
taking root more quickly in the United States is that
European cultures have a stronger commitment to
company employment and place a high premium on
face-to-face contact while forging an employment re-
lationship.
E-LANCE MODELS
Online labor brokers have been founded to bring
together firms and e-lancers—often referred to in this
context as service providers or vendors. Different bro-
ker models have arisen. Some serve all e-lancers,
regardless of industry; others cater to individual pro-
fessional groups, such as IT workers or writers. Some
are set up as online communities run more or less by
members; more commonly they are pure commercial
enterprises. Traditional employment agencies like
Kelly Services have also become active online bro-
kers, having discovered that the Web enables them to
recruit within hours rather than days. Methods for
selecting service providers vary from site to site. Some
are simple bulletin boards where firms can post new
jobs or where e-lancers can post their resumes in hopes
of attracting an employer. Some sites require e-lancers
to put themselves up for auction, an idea pioneered
by a group of IT professionals in 2000 with the forma-
tion of bid4geeks.com. However, with the lion’s share
of auctions on such sites getting no bids whatsoever,
this concept has been slow to catch on.
A more popular version of the auction enables e-
lancers to bid on jobs posted by companies, a concept
Heather Stone, president of online broker myjob-
search.com, called ‘‘the beginning of the transition to
the e-lancer economy.’’ Typical of such sites and one
of the leading online job brokers is eLance. Founded
in 1999 and launched in earnest in 2000, eLance serves
employers and workers of all kinds in over 140 coun-
tries. After e-lancers register at the site and pay a
subscription fee ranging from US$360 to US$1200,
they are entitled to bid on jobs posted on the site.
Besides quoting their price, bidders also post their
qualifications and experience. A feedback forum pro-
vides evaluations given by previous employers. The
forum provides an incentive for e-lancers to do their
best work as well as an additional means for employers
to evaluate potential workers. In addition to the sub-
scription, eLance, like traditional employment agen-
cies, also takes 10 percent of the e-lancer’s paycheck.
BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS
Online freelancing enables self-employed people
to find jobs all over the world and do them in their
own homes, jobs that without the Internet they never

S O U R C E B O O K
would have known about. Online labor brokers are
by and large easy to use and often low in cost. E-
lancing provides the freedom to decide when, where,
and how long to work, and what jobs to take. Sex,
ethnic, and age discrimination are virtually nonex-
istent.
There are a number of disadvantages, however,
that e-lancers must consider. First, there is no guaran-
tee you will find work online. Competition is fierce,
with hundreds of qualified workers available for most
jobs, and some e-lancers who post resumes never
receive any inquiries from employers. Like all self-
employed people, e-lancers are required to pay more
out-of-pocket taxes because there is no employer cov-
ering a share. E-lancers have to track their own taxes
and pay in quarterly installments; they must find and
pay for health insurance, vacation, and retirement
packages on their own.
Worst of all, e-lancers have to do without the hu-
man contact that comes with a regular job—there’s
no boss looking over one’s shoulder, but there are
also no co-workers to talk with. Theorists like MIT’s
Thomas Malone—who coined the phrase ‘‘e-lancer
economy’’ to describe the changes wrought by online
freelancing—believe that bodies similar to medieval
guilds will eventually arise to fill this need. Online
communities and chat rooms already exist, but it is
not clear to what extent such virtual relations can
really substitute for direct contact with a real person.
Some groups, like the National Writers’ Union, orga-
nize branches throughout the country that in turn orga-
nize regular social as well as professional get-togeth-
ers for members.
There are also pros and cons for companies. As
the e-lancer economy takes hold, firms will presum-
ably have greater ability to obtain top talent from
around the world. Organizations will be able to
streamline, use their resources more efficiently, and
focus on core competencies. Projects can be adapted
quickly to changing needs and new technologies. On
the down side, managers will have to select help with-
out face-to-face contact, losing important intangibles
in the hiring process.
The human factor may be the wild card that most
inhibits the growth of the e-lance economy. Karsten
Gareis, a European researcher, believes that the e-
lance economy will not develop as a volatile open
market in which ‘‘lean’’ companies drive down e-
lancers prices—the laissez-faire model favored by
many U.S. thinkers. Instead, Gareis wrote, the e-lance
economy will come to favor stable relationships built
up between firms and small pools of workers with
whom they have worked before and trust. Pools will
change as new workers enter and older ones leave,
but there will be continuity. Under this scenario, a
firm’s e-lancers will be as important as an asset as
their permanent staff were towards the end of the
twentieth century, and rather than cutting fees compa-
nies will offer trusted, proven e-lancers better pay and
benefits to increase their loyalty to the firm. As with
traditional employee-company relationships, loyalty
and trust will be uppermost.

ONLINE PROFILING
Online profiling is collecting information about
Internet users and their online behavior to create a
profile of their tastes, interests, and purchasing habits.
Online profiling is a more sophisticated, efficient, and
powerful version of traditional demographic segmen-
tation studies done by marketers. With online profiles,

your firm can learn to anticipate individuals’ likely
tastes and potential spending desires, and allow your
marketing and Web strategies to capitalize on them.
HOW TO PROFILE
To build an effective customer profile, the first
thing you need to do is design a database that can
put the information gathered on your customers to
profitable use. Such a database will organize the data
you gather and help you draw conclusions about your
customers’ behavior and interests. The design stage
involves creating categories of information pertaining
to your customers and identifying how those catego-
ries relate to each other. These categories will allow
you to quickly manipulate and aggregate data in your
analysis. In the end, you want to systematize the data
so you can make reasonable predictions about custom-
ers’ tastes and needs.
You can use either reactive or nonreactive methods
to collect Internet data on your customers. Reactive
means that the customer is aware the data is being
collected, allowing him or her to react in some way.
Nonreactive data collection, on the other hand, pro-
ceeds without customer knowledge. There are advan-
tages and disadvantages to each approach. By collect-
ing customer data with their knowledge, you build a
relationship of trust with your clients and can perhaps
develop a more cooperative and comprehensive inter-
action with them over time. On the other hand, the
knowledge that data is being collected may cause
customers to curtail their natural surfing habits or
avoid online shopping. Nonreactive data collection,
meanwhile, has the advantage of appearing less intru-
sive, so customers have no impetus to change their
behavior. However, collecting and using customer in-
formation in secret poses ethical and potential public-
relations difficulties, which can damage your firm’s
reputation and make customers wary of your site.
You can collect nonreactive customer information
in a variety of ways. Many firms maintain Web log
files, the records of all requests for pages or files on
your site. You can also find information using com-
mon gateway interface (CGI) files, based on a protocol
designed to communicate with Web forms, recording
the kinds of services and products requested by the
user. One of the more elaborate methods is to use
software applications designed specifically for online
profiling, such as cookies. Cookies are coded identifi-
ers that are placed on a user’s computer when a page,
such as a banner advertisement, is loaded. The files
can help you identify which pages a person visits and
how often. From these practices you can reach some
general assumptions about customers’ online behav-
ior, and tailor your marketing schemes accordingly.
Reactive data-collection involves requesting infor-
mation from the user such as name, e-mail address,
89
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
address, and other personal details. In addition, you
can ask descriptive questions to obtain information
on shopping habits, income, sex, education, occupa-
tion, and other sociographic data.
PROFILING CONCERNS
Customer profiling does come with pitfalls. As
with many activities related to the Internet, customers
and other Web users are often wary of businesses that
engage in online profiling, seeing such practices as a
violation of their privacy. Privacy concerns are among
the chief factors limiting e-commerce, as customers
refrain from making purchases online lest the trans-
mission of personal or financial data be taken out of
their control, potentially falling into unwelcome
hands. This, in turn, can tarnish your company’s repu-
tation and diminish the your customers’ trust.
Thus it is extremely important to be open about
your profiling practice. This will help avoid any suspi-
cion of impropriety, while also clearly explaining your
profiling policy to your customers so they can feel
safe shopping at and giving information to your site.
Many companies include a link on their Web site to
their privacy policies, which are carefully crafted to
assure their customers that information collected on
them is used to help meet their needs. The policies
spell out exactly what will and will not be done with
accumulated information.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2000
issued a report on online profiling calling for the
practice to be informed by five ‘‘core fair information
practice principles’’: notice, choice, access, security,
and enforcement. According to the report:
T
Web sites need to disclose their profiling practices.
T
Consumers should have the chance to opt out of
the practice or have a say in how the information
is used.
T
Once information is collected, individuals should
have access to their profiles
T
Profiles should be secured from unauthorized
viewers
T
Enforcement mechanisms should be in place to
ensure that Web sites meet their own requirements
regarding their profiling practices
While critics charge that online profiling represents
a potentially dangerous breach of individual privacy,
proponents argue the practice is pro-customer because
it ensures companies can meet customers’ needs. At
any rate, according to many analysts, online profiling
is less a choice than a necessity for Internet businesses;

it is less an issue of whether to profile customers online
than of how companies implement such practices.

ONLINE SOURCES OF MARKET DATA
One of the most revolutionary effects of the In-
ternet has been to put timely market data within almost
anyone’s reach. Up-to-the minute stock prices can be
obtained around the clock on virtually every search
engine and news site on the Web. Online information
on bonds, commodity futures, options, foreign stocks,
currencies, and other markets are also now common-
place.
The amount and quality of financial information
available on the Web is astonishing. Thanks to up-
to-the-minute information from virtually every market
in the world, even novice investors have begun to
seek their fortunes online. If you’re a beginner, most
financial sites also include background, glossaries of
financial terms, descriptions of the various equities
and instruments, and how each fits into a balanced
financial portfolio.
GENERAL SOURCES
PCQuote.com is a one-stop site for many financial
markets, including stocks, options, and futures. In
addition to detailed current quotes on New York Stock
Exchange
(NYSE),
Nasdaq,
and
Amex
stocks,
PCQuote provides intraday and historical charts, com-
pany earnings, company profiles, and insider trading
disclosures. It also includes links to brokers of all
kinds. Finally, the site is designed in ‘‘experience
tiers’’ for novice, experienced, and expert users. Like
most sites that specialize in financial information,
many sections of PCQuote.com are proprietary—they
can be accessed only after a subscription fee has
been paid.
SmartMoney.com is a unique source of stock mar-
ket information. The site is home to one of the most
comprehensive and accessible collections of consumer
investment information on the Web. It includes the
‘‘Stock Sifter,’’ which enables investors to screen
stocks based on their own criteria, as well as for-pay,
real-time price updates from the NYSE and Nasdaq.
SmartMoney.com’s centerpiece, however, is its ‘‘Map
of the Market,’’ a world map in which continents are
industrial sectors and countries are companies. As you
move the cursor over a country—colored green or red
depending whether its stock is up or down—a small
window with news, stock quotes, earnings estimates,
analysts’ recommendations, and other information ap-
pears. SmartMoney updates the Map of the Market
and its other financial maps automatically over the
course of the day.
Yahoo! Finance has established a leading place
among the portal sites. In addition to current stock
quotes, the site has a comprehensive set of research
tools that include earnings reports, company profiles,
annual reports, and analysis. Furthermore, Yahoo! Fi-
nance boasts 23 international Web sites, including
major financial centers like the United Kingdom, Ger-
many, Japan, and Singapore. Each provides quotes on
local shares.
Traditional sources of stock information have also
established a presence online. Standard & Poor’s Web
site includes its influential indices of performance for
various equity markets: the S&P 500, the S&P Global
100, the S&P Europe 350, the S&P Asia Pacific 100.
It also displays the S&P Canadian and Australian
indices, as well as non-equity indices for commodities
and credit, and the S&P JJ Kenney/PERFORM Index.
INSTANT QUOTES
Because stock prices can change radically within
minutes, or even seconds, brokers and investors need
the most current information along with nearly instan-
taneous access to markets. Nasdaq provides streaming
feeds of quotes from its so-called Level II boards
that make stock price information available to remote
computer users at the same time it appears on the
computers of Nasdaq market makers. The service is
expensive, however, and is primarily used by brokers
and professional traders.
COMPANY REPORTS
For company research, Hoover’s Online and Dow
Jones Interactive are among the best. Hoover’s in-
cludes news, financials, and company profiles. Most
of the content is available only to Hoover’s subscrib-
ers. Likewise Dow Jones Interactive includes full-text
articles from the Wall Street Journal and hundreds
of other business publications, along with analysts’
reports, historical data, and profiles of thousands of

public, private, and foreign firms. Dow Jones Inter-
active can only be accessed by subscribers.
For those unable or unwilling to pay for financial
research, one free site is a gold mine. The U.S. Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR database
contains thousands of annual, quarterly, and occa-
sional reports filed by large publicly traded compa-
nies. The filings include detailed information about
company finances, stock offerings and splits, execu-
tive compensation, insider trading, and other topics.
Similar information can also often be found on the
investors’ pages of individual companies’ Web sites.
The SEC offers the filings—which range from around
1995 to the present—in both HTML and PDF formats.
The site includes tutorials on finding information and
explanations of the various reports companies must
make to the SEC.
INTERNATIONAL DATA
More and more, stock exchanges are transforming
themselves into completely virtual entities with most
trades no longer taking place on trading floors but
only on computer screens. Nearly all exchanges, in-
cluding the NYSE, Nasdaq, London, Tokyo, Singa-
pore, and Frankfurt exchanges, have Web sites which
provide current stock prices. A comprehensive list
of the Web sites of international stock exchanges is
available on the Yahoo! Finance site. Most major
foreign exchanges provide quotes and other informa-
tion in English. A good additional source of informa-
tion on the Japanese economy can be found at the
English language pages of Nikkei Net Interactive.
BONDS AND DERIVATIVES
Comprehensive information on all sorts of bonds
can be found at Investing in Bonds. The site allows
investors to sort municipal, corporate, and treasury
bonds by a variety of criteria, including credit rating,
maturity, state, and volume. The site also includes a
wealth of educational resources for the beginning bond
trader. BradyNet is the most complete source of infor-
mation about emerging market bonds, such as those
issued in developing countries in Asia, Eastern Eu-
rope, and Latin America. The leading futures market
in the United States, the Chicago Board of Trade,
posts quotes on futures in a variety of areas, including
grains, metals, livestock, swaps, financial instruments,
Dow Jones products, X-funds, and AIG products.
Real-time quotes are also available together with news
and educational information on futures.

ONLINE TRANSACTIONS
Online transactions take many forms. In business-
to-business (B2B) transactions, businesses conduct
transactions with one another. For example, if Micro-
soft Corp. purchases office supplies from Office Depot
online, both firms are engaged in a B2B transaction.
Business-to-consumer transactions (B2C) take place
when businesses and consumers conduct business on-
line, such as when individuals buy tickets from Ticket-
master.com. Person-to-person transactions (P2P) are
online interactions between two individuals, like those
conducted on online auction site eBay. Although these
three types of transactions are the most common, other
forms do exist. For example, when individuals submit
their taxes electronically, they are completing an on-
line transaction.

S O U R C E B O O K
Not all online transactions involve payment, but the
majority do. In a B2C transaction, the most common
method of payment is by credit card, which involves
a series of smaller transactions. Similar to traditional
credit card payments, online credit-card payments
make use of a merchant bank that processes and com-
plete transactions. After an online purchase order is
submitted, sellers use real-time online processing soft-
ware to transmit the customer’s credit-card informa-
tion to its merchant bank. Upon receipt of the informa-
tion, the merchant bank sends a request for approval
to an acquiring processor, which transmits the request
to the bank that issued the credit card to the customer.
The card-issuing bank then transmits an approval or
denial code that makes its way back to the seller who
initiated the process.
Online B2C payment transactions quite often also
make use of check cards, which withdraw money
directly from a client’s checking account. Customers
using check cards on the Internet simply enter their
check-card number as they would a credit-card num-
ber. Accepting check cards is very similar to accepting
credit cards; in fact, the transaction processing meth-
ods for both are nearly the same. Despite the complex-
ity involved in these types of transactions, they are
usually completed instantaneously.
The payment process for a B2B transaction can
differ from that of a B2C transaction, particularly if
the business making the sale uses an invoicing system
to bill its business clients. In this case, the payment
transaction might make use of electronic bill present-
ment and payment (EBPP) technology, which allows
businesses to bill clients and secure payment online.
Such an online transaction typically begins when a
business e-mails an invoice, which includes a link to
an online payment service provider’s Web page, to a
client. The client can then visit the Web site to view
more detailed billing information and submit an elec-
tronic payment by clicking a button that automatically
debits their checking account. This type of automated
payment transaction can only take place, of course,
if clients have previously agreed to allow the online
payment processor to withdraw funds from their bank
accounts.
To complete P2P payment transactions, many indi-
vidual buyers and sellers use PayPal, the leading P2P
payment service, which handles roughly 50 percent
of the payments processed via eBay. Both parties
must be members of PayPal for the transaction to be
completed. To make a payment, members can e-mail
funds to any other PayPal account holder via an auto-
mated e-mail message titled ‘‘You’ve Got Cash!’’
Individuals making payments can stipulate whether
they want the funds charged to a credit card or with-
drawn from a bank account they have agreed to allow
PayPal to debit. PayPal also allows users to set up
PayPal accounts from which they can make and re-
ceive payments.
If you are interested in making use of online pay-
ment processing, you can either contact a bank to set
up the necessary accounts and obtain the software you
need to handle these types of transactions, or you can
contact a payment processing provider like PayPal.
Other popular service providers include BillPoint,
Check Free, or Web Pay. Each of these companies
handles payment processing somewhat differently, al-
though the end result, allowing consumers and busi-
nesses to complete online payments, is the same.
Still, a transaction is not completed just because
payment has been made. Goods and services must
also be delivered to the customer. In some cases,
delivery can actually be completed online. For exam-
ple, customers might be able to download purchases,
such as software. Or they simply may print a copy
of an e-ticket for their flight reservation. Customers
purchasing an online subscription to something like
the Wall Street Journal might receive their password
via email. In these cases, the transaction is completed
electronically, as soon as customers receive for what
they have paid.
Most online transactions, however, involve some
sort of physical packaging and shipping. Many small
businesses decide to handle their own packaging and
shipping operations. Upon receipt of an order, they
package the goods and either take them to a branch
location or drop box of a shipping company like UPS
or FedEx, or they scheduling pickups with one of
these firms. Other companies use a fulfillment com-
pany, such as Ifulfillment.com or Fulfillmentplus.net
to handle tasks like packaging and delivery for them.
Some fulfillment companies oversee payment pro-
cessing as well as packaging and shipping.
The options for handling online transactions are
varied, so you will likely need to do some research
before deciding what option is best for your business.
As your business grows, be open to changing how
you handle online transactions in the interest of cost
savings and efficiency.

OPERATING SYSTEMS
An operating system is the software program that
allows all the parts of a computer system to function.
It controls everything from accepting input from a
mouse or a keyboard to sending files to a printer.
Operating systems are also known as the platforms
upon which various applications run. Microsoft Win-
dows is one of the most popular operating systems,
particularly for personal computers (PCs). On a PC
equipped with Windows, only applications written for
Windows will run. Similarly, machines using Unix,
Linux, or other operating systems can only run pro-
grams designed for that system. Therefore, when se-
lecting an operating system, it is important to consider
what types of programs you wish to run to determine
which systems best suits your needs.
DETERMING BUSINESS NEEDS
If you’re simply purchasing a PC to compose word-
processing documents, maintain financial spreadsheets
and a customer database, run an email program, and surf
the Internet, you may find yourself more concerned with
the memory and processing speed of the machine than
with your choice of operating system. The great majority
of PCs come equipped with Microsoft Windows, and for
individual users, investigating other options simply may
not prove worthwhile. However, if you are looking at
more sophisticated machines, like network servers, your
operating system choice involves higher stakes. Not only
are such machines more expensive, but the specialized
operating systems which run them, like Unix and Win-
dows NT, usually cost much more than their desktop
equivalents.
COST VERSUS PERFORMANCE
One increasingly popular business operating sys-
tem is Linux. Because Linux is a based on an open
source code not owned by any corporate entity, Linux
users are not subject to licensing fees. In fact, you
can simply download Linux via the Internet for free;
however, you may find yourself needing to hire techni-
cal expertise to help you get your Linux system up
and running. Quite often, any costs associated with
using Linux are related to either hiring such individu-
als or to purchasing the operating system from a Linux
vendor, like Red Hat, which offers technical support,
manuals, and related services for a fee. There are
actually many different versions of Linux available,
and not all share the same features. Still, the product’s
low cost makes it an attractive option for many small
businesses. According to a May 2002 article in Busi-
ness Week, ‘‘In the server-appliance business, mostly
93
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
targeted at small-business and home-office users who
want to easily network a few machines, Linux is
quickly becoming the de facto operating system due
to its low price—$0 per copy.’’
Along with cost is the issue of performance. If you
are running an online business, the reliability of your
operating system could very well determine your suc-
cess. Online customers are easily frustrated when
servers shut down, systems experience bottlenecks,
and other problems arise. Completely avoiding these
types of problems is impossible; rather, your goal
should be to deal with these problems as effectively
as possible. According to Mike Hogan in Entrepre-
neur, the low cost of using a Linux operating system
allows small business owners to create ‘‘redundancy
in different physical locations. Linux lets you decons-
truct your work flow and spread its parts among
servers worldwide. In this way, your site can more
efficiently balance network loads and weather every-
thing from a local power outage to a distributed denial
of service attack.’’ If this process sounds like a more
complicated one than you are prepared to tackle, you
can outsource the task to an application service pro-
vider (ASP) who will operate your site on its Linux
servers. As of mid-2002, more than half of all Web
sites used the Linux operating system.
Critics of Linux point out that the number of soft-
ware programs written for the operating system are
more limited than they are for more mainstream sys-
tems like Windows and Unix. They also point out
that many businesses find it necessary to either have a
Linux expert in-house or hire a consultant for technical
support. However, leading software companies like
Veritas, SAP, and IBM have unveiled Linux versions
of their best-selling programs. In addition, technology
giants like Oracle Corp. began making use of Linux
for their corporate intranets. Equally important to the
mainstream acceptance of Linux was Amazon.com’s
decision to begin powering its Web servers with Li-
nux, reportedly saving $17 million.
If you decide to allow a Web hosting company to
run your Web site on its servers, chances are you won’t
be involved in the details of managing the operating
system. If, however, you plan to purchase and operate
your own servers, you must choose an operating sys-
tem will run those servers. The growing popularity
of Linux does not necessary mean it’s the best choice
for every business. Research a variety of server and
operating system options—many servers come with
operating systems already installed—and compare the
pros and cons of each to determine which package is
best suited to your business.

OUTSOURCING OPTIONS
When deciding to launch a new business venture,
entrepreneurs are faced with many decisions regarding
how to handle specialized tasks, such as accounting,
recruiting, and technology management. In some
cases, entrepreneurs decide to handle the majority
of these tasks internally, either overseeing operations
themselves or hiring qualified individuals to do so.
Another option for new business owners is outsourc-
ing: paying another business or an independent con-
tractor
to
handle
specific
tasks.
Outsourcing
agreements can be temporary or ongoing, and in many
cases they offer small businesses a relatively inexpen-
sive means of gaining access to the expertise they
need to launch, maintain, and expand operations. With
new developments in e-commerce technology emerg-
ing on a regular basis, you will likely find it beneficial
to regularly revisit your outsourcing decisions to be
sure you are taking advantage of options that might
prove less expensive and more efficient.
TO OUTSOURCE, OR NOT TO
OUTSOURCE
Some small business experts advise entrepreneurs
to ‘‘decide what you are good at and outsource every-
thing else—i.e., focus your company on your core
competency, and let someone else do the rest,’’ ac-
cording to a March 2002 article in Entrepreneur.com.
Others caution against overuse of outsourcing because
it may put too much operational control into the hands
of others. Issues to consider are cost savings, timing,
and the reliability of the business or independent con-
tractor being hired. Does outsourcing actually save
the company money? Will it allow the company to
complete an important task or offer improved services
more quickly? Is quality likely to be compromised?
Is the business or independent contractor likely to
remain in business?
The technical expertise required to operate an on-
line business prompts many online entrepreneurs to
outsource various tasks. As the E-Commerce Times
advised in May 2002, ‘‘When you want something
done right, there are times when doing it yourself is
not the best option. Even the best companies need to
recognize the limitations of their operations expertise
and know when to outsource certain e-business func-
tions.’’ If you are planning to launch a new Internet-
based business, or if you are planning to take your
business online for the first time, you may have al-
ready considered outsourcing some or all of the fol-
lowing tasks: Web site development and hosting, pay-
ment processing, order fulfillment, and call-center
services. While it is possible to purchase these services
separately, in many cases, e-commerce specialists of-
fer solutions which bundle together several services.
WEB SITE DEVELOPMENT AND HOSTING
One of the first tasks you will be faced with as an
e-commerce entrepreneur is deciding how to build
and host your own Web site. If you are technologically
astute or willing to hire technical staff, you might
save money by developing and hosting your own site.
Keeping it in-house will also allow you to maintain
more control over your site. However, the majority
of Internet start-ups outsource this type of work to
one of a vast number of Web developers. While some
Web-hosting companies limit their services to simply
housing your site, many offer Web site design, con-
struction, and maintenance services. Before hiring
such a company, be sure you know exactly what ser-
vices you expect to be rendered and how much they
will cost. It is also a good idea to review other sites
created by Web development companies, particularly
those for businesses similar to yours in size and scope.
PAYMENT PROCESSING
If you plan to operate an online business, you also
have to decide how you want to process payments.
You can obtain the necessary accounts and purchase
the necessary software, or you can outsource this pro-
cess to a third party. Many banks offer online credit-
card processing solutions, which handle online pay-
ment processing for small businesses. By opting to
outsource payment processing, you can dramatically
reduce the amount of work involved in setting up a
payment-processing system for your business. Tech-
nology companies like Verisign, Authorize.Net, and
PayPal also offer comprehensive payment processing
solutions specifically designed for small businesses.
One place to begin researching various payment-pro-
cessing
outsourcing
options
is
MerchantSelec-
tion.com, which provides ratings and reviews of pay-
ment processors.

FULFILLMENT
Many online ventures also outsource fulfillment
services, including packaging, shipping, managing in-
ventory, and processing returned merchandise. Com-
panies specializing in fulfillment for smaller online
businesses include e-fulfillment.com, Ifulfillment.-
com, and Fulfillmentplus.net. Each of these firms of-
fers different services and charges different fees. As
a Juanita Ellis advises in Entrepreneur.com, ‘‘Before
you select a fulfillment company, be sure you’ve gath-
ered all the information needed to make the best
choice. You’ll want to know the cost of distribution,
warehousing and customer service. In addition, get at
least three customer references you can call directly
to find out their experiences with the company.’’
CALL-CENTER SERVICES
Customer-service centers that field all types of
calls, from requests for additional information about
a product or service to customer complaints, are
known as call centers. Some companies operate their
own call centers, but many rely on outside call centers
that serve numerous different businesses, all transpar-
ent from the customer’s perspective. If you believe
your business would benefit from call center services,
particularly Web-enabled ones, you can turn to an
outside source. Experts cite concerns over outsourcing
customer service tasks like call-center services due to
issues related staffing, training, and quality control.
However, outsourcing can also give small businesses
access to more sophisticated technology than they
might otherwise be able to afford.
Outsourced call-center services are out of reach
for most small businesses. By one estimate in 2000,
infrastructure alone cost roughly $90,000—or $4,500
per agent—for a 20-agent center. Still, less expensive
options began to emerge in the early 2000s. Hoping
to target small and mid-sized companies, AT&T Corp.
and Qwest Communications have explored network-
based call centers, a cheaper alternative to traditional
call centers because they use a single network and
eliminated the need for costly infrastructure. Call-
center
technology
specialist
Rockwell
offers
FirstPoint Business Edition, a Web-enabled call center
solution for small- and medium-sized businesses at
$1,625 per user.

P2P EXCHANGE
P2P, which stands for both ‘‘person-to-person’’
and ‘‘peer-to-peer,’’ is a direct online communication
between two individuals or personal computers (PCs).
Using tools like instant messaging, online auctions,
and online classified ads, P2P is a way to share infor-
mation and conduct purchases between private indi-
viduals. A person-to-person transaction happens, for
example, when someone in Colorado uses an online
auction site to sell an antique vase to a resident of
California. Peer-to-peer networks are a major means
for conducting person-to-person exchange. These sys-
tems, such as the defunct music-swapping service
Napster, enable file sharing between PCs. In contrast
to traditional client/server networks, which give PCs
access to information stored on a server, peer-to-peer
networks allow PCs to communicate directly with
each other, reducing or eliminating the need for a
server.
PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKS
While peer-to-peer networks have yet to gain wide
acceptance in businesses, to many analysts this sort of
decentralized file sharing is promising. A September
2001 issue of Inc.com gives this example: ‘‘Say a
New York City manufacturing company is looking to
negotiate a new sales contract with its Texas vendors.
Instead of relying on e-mail, faxes, or phones to nego-
tiate and exchange information, a company using P2P
software can interact in real time, allowing staff to
move important documents, communicate with virtual
whiteboards, and coordinate calendars, all without
ever leaving the office.’’ However, critics of peer-to-
peer technology argue that granting direct access to
PCs could pose a serious security threat to businesses.
In fact, many analysts assert that peer-to-peer net-
working will not become mainstream until security
issues, such as the ease with which hackers can access
such a system, are addressed.
Peer-to-peer technology raises legal issues as well.
In Napster’s case, fears of copyright infringement
eventually shut down the music-swapping service
after a tumultuous legal battle. For similar reasons,
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
many Napster rivals were forced to shutter their opera-
tions as well. However, new peer-to-peer networks
have continued to emerge. In April of 2001, a group
of investors led by Intel Corp. gave Ian Clarke $4
million to develop commercial applications for
Freenet, the peer-to-peer network he launched on the
Internet in March 2000. Another entrepreneur, Chris
Kitze, used peer-to-peer networking technology to
create Yaga in the early 2000s. Unlike Napster and
Freenet, both of which bucked conventional copyright
laws, Kitze hoped to use Yaga to secure payment for
copyright holders. The premise behind the business
model is that owners of songs, videos, books, and
other digital content will allow Web surfers to dow-
nload files directly from their PCs. Yaga will provide
the portal that brings buyers and sellers together and
offer the payment tools to facilitate these P2P transac-
tions. As of early 2002, however, Kitze had yet to
convince many big-name content owners to use his
service.
PERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSACTIONS
Person-to-person transactions, like those con-
ducted on online auction site eBay, allow individuals
to exchange goods and services. Although online auc-
tions also allow businesses to peddle their wares, they
were first designed to facilitate sales between two
individuals. To make money, companies running on-
line auctions typically charge a commission on each
transaction completed. Unlike many other Internet-
based business models, the online auction has proven
highly successful, due in part to the lower overhead
costs associated with operating such a business, partic-
ularly for online auction giant eBay. In fact, eBay’s
success has made it difficult for rivals to create their
own viable online auctions. As the June 2002 E-Com-
merce Times reported, ‘‘In the online auction sector,
eBay is not just king of the hill, it owns the mountain.
Some challengers to the throne have stepped forward
in the past few years, but all have been trounced.’’
Even though eBay is the largest online auction site,
it does have a few rivals. Its largest competitor, Ubid,
secured 3.6 million unique visitors in April of 2002.
While this number pales in comparison to eBay’s 24.3
million visitors that month, it does indicate that other
auction sites can attract a decent amount of traffic.
Some analysts recommend that entrepreneurs who
want to create a person-to-person business like eBay
target niche markets, limiting themselves either to
certain products or to certain geographical areas.
You might consider developing another kind of
person-to-person site. For example, Intellibarter,
founded in December of 1999, allows individuals to
post merchandise they would like to trade. Sellers are
able to set values for their merchandise and then use
what they earn selling their merchandise to purchase
other goods or services listed on the site. Like online
auction sites, online bartering sites make money by
charging a commission on each transaction completed.
They also operate with minimal overhead. However,
keep in mind these sites are also susceptible to the
same sort of consumer fraud that has plagued online
auctions. If you plan to develop this sort of business,
you will need to decide whether or not to offer some
sort of guarantee to the individuals who use your site.
To complete person-to-person payment transac-
tions, buyers and sellers use P2P transaction technol-
ogy. While this technology is used most frequently
for online auction purchases, individuals also use P2P
payments for making charitable donations and sending
money to a friend or family member. PayPal is the
most popular P2P payment service, handling roughly
50 percent of the payments processed via eBay. PayPal
members are able to e-mail funds to any other PayPal
account holder via an automated e-mail message titled
‘‘You’ve Got Cash!’’ The funds can be charged to a
credit card via an online form at the PayPal site, or
they can be withdrawn from a bank account, once the
user is properly verified. If you are planning to create
a P2P business that will require payment processing,
you can contact a company like PayPal, BillPoint, or
WebPay to set up a system on your site.

PACKAGE MANAGEMENT
A key difference between online business ventures
and more traditional retail operations is how customers

actually go about getting the merchandise they pur-
chase. In some cases, customers can simply download
what they have bought. For example, many online
software companies allow customers to download
software programs as soon as they pay. Online maga-
zines permit clients to download articles once they
agree to pay a fee. Similarly, online brokerages allow
clients to make trades online after they deposit money
and complete registration forms. In many cases, how-
ever, online businesses sell merchandise that must
be packaged and shipped to clients. How businesses
manage this process can have a direct impact on cus-
tomer satisfaction.
In the late 1990s, when e-commerce was just begin-
ningtotakehold,manyonlineventuresweremorecon-
cerned with securing new customers than with making
a profit. As a result, many offered free shipping. By
the early 2000s, however, profitability became a key
concern for Internet-based businesses. Companies
found that they simply had to pass shipping charges
along to customers if they were going to stay afloat.
Some firms even began to view shipping as a way
to secure additional profits, marking up shipping
prices. According Entrepreneur in February 2002,
‘‘Online marketing analysts offer several suggestions
on how to handle shipping and handling fees. Because
the majority of consumers review these costs prior to
making a purchase, it’s advisable to consider these
charges as a break-even proposition instead of a way
to make money.’’ The reason is simple: customers
know enough about shipping charges to know when
firms are tacking on extra dollars to boost profits. The
article cited a Datamonitor study that indicated nearly
70 percent of online purchases were abandoned before
completion in 2001. Datamonitor said many custom-
ers abandoned their purchases because they believed
shipping and handling costs were too high.
In some cases, it makes sense for businesses to
base shipping charges on package weight, particularly
if the products shipped tend to be heavy. In other
cases, shipping fees can be based on the amount of
money a customer spends; this model allows a busi-
ness to offer free shipping to those who spend over
a certain amount, a method for enticing customers to
purchase more than they might have first intended.
However, this model might prove problematic if a
customer spending $200 on lightweight draperies gets
charged the same shipping and handling fees as a
customer spending $200 on a heavy wooden table.
Along with determining what to charge, you must
also decide to either handle packing and shipping
internally or to contract a fulfillment company to man-
age the process. Quite often, this decision depends
upon the number of packages you ship, as well as the
cost of the merchandise. If you are planning to sell
large quantities of goods to a handful of businesses,
97
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
you might find that using a fulfillment center proves
cost effective because merchandise can be shipped at
bulk rates. However, if you’re selling inexpensive
items, such as used CDs, to a wide variety of individual
consumers, using a fulfillment center might prove
too expensive as the per-item fulfillment cost might
actually be higher than what you are charging for a
CD. If you are shipping a small number of goods,
you might also find that fulfillment centers are not very
cost effective. Industry experts recommend keeping
fulfillment costs under 10 to 15 percent of merchan-
dise sales. In some cases, outsourcing might allow
you achieve this goal, while in other cases, handling
package management yourself might be the better
choice. You will need to research both options to
determine which best suits your business.
If you decide to undertake your own package man-
agement, you’ll need to work with a shipping company
like FedEx or UPS. You can download software from
both of these firms that will allow your customers to
track their shipments online. You will be responsible
for keeping track of orders, packaging goods, and
either taking them to a branch location or drop box,
or scheduling pickups.
Should you choose to outsource package manage-
ment tasks, you will find that a wide variety of fulfill-
ment companies offer services ranging from packag-
ing, shipping, and return processing to inventory
management, stock replenishment, and credit-card
transaction processing. If you are already using a Web-
hosting company, you can check to see if it offers
any package management services. While these ser-
vices can be somewhat limited, depending on the host-
ing company, they are quite often more than adequate
for small online merchants.
Companies specializing in fulfillment for smaller
online businesses include Ifulfillment.com, Fulfill-
mentplus.net, and Ifulfill.com. Each of these firms
offers different services and charges different fees.
Ifulfillment.com serves both business-to-consumer
(B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) ventures.
Along with standard order fulfillment, inventory man-
agement, and return processing, the firm also offers
package management services for perishable items
such as frozen food, flowers, and wine. To get an idea
of what fulfillment services might cost, the firm’s
Web site contains a Quote Wizard that allows users
to input weekly sales figures, the average number of
goods shipped per order, and similar information.
Fulfillmentplus.net also offers a wide range of or-
der-fulfillment services. It differentiates itself from
rivals by allowing customers to personalize orders by
selecting options like gift wrapping and greeting
cards.

Meanwhile, IFulfill.com offers comprehensive ser-

ment customers click on a ‘‘Buy Now’’ button until
the merchandise is at their doorstep. Like its rivals,
IFulfill.com offers more limited service options for
budget-conscious customers. The firm’s Fulfillment
Only Service is designed for small online merchants
looking for package-management services only.
Before contacting a fulfillment company, it’s a
good idea to decide which services you would like
outsource. Figuring this out ahead of time will allow
you to focus your research efforts. As a June 2000
issue of Entrepreneur.com advises, ‘‘Before you se-
lect a fulfillment company, be sure you’ve gathered
all the information needed to make the best choice..
you’ll want to make sure the fulfillment company of
choice delivers products in a timely manner, quickly
responds to you and your customers, and handles re-
turns efficiently.’’

PAYMENT SYSTEMS
One of the most important things to consider when
setting up an online business is how customers are
going to pay for their purchases. According to Net-
preneur writer Melissa Campanelli, ‘‘Payment pro-
cessing systems lie at the heart of all e-commerce
operations. Your site won’t survive unless customers
can pay for their items with minimal disruptions and
maximal convenience.’’ Online shoppers pay for their
purchases most frequently with a credit card. To ac-
cept credit card numbers as payment, you must use
online credit card processing technology that pro-
cesses payments via platforms like the Web. In an
effort to protect personal information like credit card
numbers, most payment processing systems include
secure electronic transaction specifications, address
verification programs, and other fraud screening tech-
nology.
Accepting credit card payments via the Internet is
quite similar to accepting credit card payments in a
more traditional retail setting. Online merchants must
work in conjunction with an acquiring, or merchant,
bank to process and complete transactions. For exam-
ple, after a consumer at a book e-tailer like Ama-
zon.com completes a purchase order, Amazon uses
real-time online processing software to transmit the
customer’s credit card information to its merchant
bank. Once the merchant bank receives the request,
it seeks credit card authorization from an acquiring
processor, which handles credit card processing, bill-
ing, reporting, and settlement services. The acquiring
processor transmits the request to the card-issuing
bank—the bank that issued the credit card to the con-
sumer—which responds with either an approval or
denial code that is forwarded to the merchant. Typi-
cally, despite its complexity, this entire process is
completed in less than 15 seconds.
If you would like to accept online credit card pay-
ments, you will need to establish a merchant account
and purchase an online credit card processing system
to facilitate the process. To obtain a merchant account
for your online business, you can apply for one at a
bank of your choice. Most merchant banks will ask
for specific information about how you conduct busi-
ness and will work with you to determine which trans-
action processing model to use. The fees charged and
services offered by merchant account providers vary
widely. Many providers charge one-time application
fees. Nearly all providers charge a small fee per trans-
action as well as a merchant discount fee, which is a
percentage of sales that typically ranges from 1 to
4 percent. To familiarize yourself with the options
available, you might consider using a site like Mer-
chantSeek.com, which provides a current listing of
the lowest-priced merchant account providers as well
as information about what types of services each pro-
vider offers. If you have already established a mer-
chant account for traditional credit card transactions,
you will still need to obtain a separate identification
number, known as a terminal ID, for Internet transac-
tions.
Many banks also offer online credit card processing
solutions, which handle payment processing for you
and even include additional features like online shop-
ping cart technology. By opting to purchase such a
service, you can dramatically reduce the amount of
work involved in setting up a payment processing
system for your business. Companies like Verisign,
Authorize.Net, and PayPal also offer comprehensive
payment processing solutions specifically designed

for small businesses. While most require that you have
a merchant account, PayPal and a few other online
payment processing firms allow you to bypass the
time and cost involved in securing such an account.
In some cases, payment processors might offer free
trial periods for their payment processing services.
For example, as of May 2002, Verisign offered a
free 30-day trial of its Payflow Pro service to online
business owners looking for a payment processing
solution. Ratings and reviews of various payment
processors
are
available
from
MerchantSelec-
tion.com.
Credit cards are not the only online payment option
businesses can offer customers. Check cards, typically
issued by large credit card companies, pull money
directly from a customer’s checking account, allowing
customers to pay for purchases without the expenses
associated with a credit card. Customers using check
cards on the Internet simply enter their check card
number as they would a credit card number. Accepting
check cards is very similar to accepting credit cards;
in fact, the transaction processing methods for both
are nearly identical. If you are able to process online
credit card payments, you should be able to process
online check card payments as well at no additional
cost. Another option, Internet checks, makes use of
the automated clearing house (ACH) network. While
they are similar to check cards in that funds are pulled
directly from a consumer’s checking account, the gate-
way used to settle Internet check transactions is very
different. As a result, check card funds are usually
deposited into a merchant’s account in two or three
days, while Internet check funds take 10 to 14 days
to close.
Many payment processing solution providers offer
various payment processing capabilities that allow you
to accept credit cards, check cards, and Internet
checks. Additional services include the ability to ac-
cept international payments and protection against
credit card chargebacks, which happen when a con-
sumer disputes a credit card transaction. When decid-
ing which payment processing services you will offer
your customers, a February 2002 issue of Entrepre-
neur.com recommends that you ‘‘keep in mind that
today’s service-conscious consumers expect conve-
nience, and the more payment options you offer them,
the more likely you are to win their business.’’

PERFORMANCE METRICS
The processes a business uses to evaluate the per-
formance of various business practices are known as
performance metrics. In the world of e-commerce,
performance metrics typically have to do with Web-
site performance and how users interact with Web
sites. To determine how well a Web site serves cus-
tomers or how quickly various pages load, most com-
panies use tracking software. Tracking visitors with-
out their active participation using cookies and IP
addresses is known as passive tracking, while asking
visitors to supply personal information via an online
registration form is known as active tracking. Perform-
ance metrics at many online firms include both types
of tracking.
Many analysts advise that conducting some sort
of Web-tracking activity is essential to the success
of online businesses. According to Netpreneur writer
Melissa Campanelli, ‘‘you can’t effectively maintain
your site without tracking visitors. Once you know
specific areas of the site most viewed by visitors and
which search engines they’re using to reach your site,
you can modify your site’s focus.’’ Site analysis can
also offer specific information about the behavior of
your visitors that might prompt you to make changes
to the site itself. For example, if you determine that
customers tend to abandon an online purchase when
asked for their home phone number, you might decide
to eliminate that question from your order form. Or
if tracking analysis reveals that the majority of your
visitors leave a page before it finishes loading, you
may decide to pare down graphics or anything else
that might be slowing it down.
If you wish to conduct performance metrics on
your Web site, you can pursue one of several options.
If you use a Web-hosting company to maintain your
site, you can check to see if it offers performance
metrics services in addition to hosting. In many cases,
this is an ideal choice for small businesses because
it is inexpensive and eliminates the need purchase

pany. However, if your Web host doesn’t offer these
services, if their services are too limited, or if you
simply want more control, you can purchase a Web-
tracking software program. In many cases, all you
need to do to run Web-tracking software is place an
HMTL marker on each page of your site.
Many products are available to analyze Web traffic.
In addition, many companies offer Web-tracking soft-
ware and services tailored to small businesses. For
example, NetIQ’s WebTrends Log Analyzer is able
to analyze site traffic in real time. Created for sites
with a single server, Log Analyzer is designed for
small online businesses with fairly simple needs. The
program pulls from the server’s log files information
about visitor patterns, visitor paths, and basic demo-
graphic information about visitors, such as their geo-
graphic location. The software can also determine
which site or keyword search led visitors to your site.
The firm also offers more advanced product suites for
sites using more than one server. Depending on which
option you choose, you’ll pay anywhere for $700 to
$10,000 annually to license a high-end WebTrends
product. If you would like to try the software before
making a purchase decision, you can download a free
trial version from NetIQ’s Web site.
Another Web tracking option for small businesses
is iLux Enterprise 2000, which constructs a visitor
database and analyzes visitor behavior. Basic reports
include content viewed, referral sources, search engine
sources, visitor patterns, and visitor profiles. iLux En-
terprise can also generate customized reports. Other
companies, such as InfoVista, offer similar perform-
ance software tools that are relatively inexpensive. If
you are most concerned about how your site per-
forms—as opposed to what users are doing at your
site, how they got there, how long they stay there, and
where they go when they leave—Keynote Systems
provides a service that simply tests various Web pages
from a variety of locations to determine their load
time and reliability. This service costs from $295 to
$995 per month. Less expensive (and less comprehen-
sive) services are also available.
Regardless of which service you use, incorporating
performance metrics into your online business plan
is a wise idea. According to the November 2001 In-
ternetWeek, ‘‘There are many tools and techniques
to help e-businesses better understand how visitors
interact with their site, how well sites are designed to
achieve business goals, and how quickly sites perform
page downloads and other tasks. Experts recommend
that companies keep an eye on all those things.’’

PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES IN
E-COMMERCE
A product life cycle is the entire cradle-to-grave
evolution of a particular product, from its initial design
to its final abandonment. Life-cycle management in-
cludes all the processes along the way your company
uses to get the most out of the product line, such as
assessing market demand, sharing upgrade informa-
tion with suppliers, projecting future sales and market
conditions, and improving customer satisfaction with
the product. The keys to successful product-life-cycle
management are knowledge-based planning and coor-
dination with all entities involved in the product’s life
cycle, particularly other businesses you work with
to design, manufacture, coordinate, and deliver your
products.
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
Supply chain management is one of the key compo-
nents of managing life cycles in the age of e-commerce
and sophisticated information technology. Supply chain
management involves using the Web and related infor-
mation technologiesto coordinateand optimizethe flow
of supplies and equipment as your firm goes about its
operations. By building streamlined supply networks
and coordinatingwith suppliersto improvesupply chain
efficiency, you reduce the cost and time involved in
bringing your products to their destinations.
Traditionally,supplychainmanagementincludedlo-
gistical concerns, such as inbound supply shipping and
outbound product shipping, keeping production opera-
tionsfunctioningsmoothlywithallnecessaryequipment
and components, and order fulfillment. In e-commerce,
higher-level planning has dictated that supply chain
managementsystemstakeintoconsiderationeveryfacet
oftheproduct’slife,fromitsinitialideathroughtheengi-
neering and design stage, from customer service and re-
pair issues to its final discontinuation.
Supply chain management carries the additional
benefit of the maximum level of transparency. In other

words, all design planning, orders, requests, and com-
munications are readily accessible to all parties, which
both increases the efficiency of the product life cycle
in itself and streamlines accountability, pressuring all
parties to boost their performance and making trouble-
shooting less cumbersome.
A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS
For the most efficient modeling of a product’s
life cycle, your firm needs extensive market data,
particularly a mix of current demand along with sales
forecasting—preferably several forecasts based on
various potential industry scenarios. Thus, it’s in your
interest to involve your suppliers and other partners
as early in the product’s planning process as possible,
allowing for greater and more efficient coordination
from the ground up. Analysts coined the phrase collab-
orative product commerce (CPC) to describe the joint
efforts by partnering firms to design a product and
move it through its various stages in getting to market,
and this CPC practice is increasingly important as the
e-business environment creates new and more press-
ing demands and pressures on companies.
A ramp-up—the process of getting a product or
service ready for full-scale launch—is crucial to an
efficient product life cycle, and can best be accom-
plished by working and sharing information with all
relevant parties, including suppliers, as early in the
design process as possible. In this way, there can be
the greatest degree of coordination, to ensure that all
components will be ready and perfectly fit when your
company is ready to fit them into the finished product
during assembly.
SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS
System compatibility and extranets are an integral
part of a strategic partnership. Life-cycle-management
tools, including computer-aided design (CAD) sys-
tems, which are designed to allow companies to share
information on products with other firms and suppliers
as well as between departments within the company,
are becoming an enormous industry in their own right.
The proliferation of extranets and business-to-busi-
ness exchanges has provided an infrastructure where
effective product-life-cycle management is at your
fingertips. They help ensure that the tools to effec-
tively measure demand, assess the competition, coor-
dinate with suppliers and other partners, and gather
and share relevant data are readily available.
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, which
include everything from product catalogs to order files
to inventory databases, are another vital component
of product-life-cycle management. One common prac-
tice is to take these back-end databases and integrate
101
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
them into a company-wide Web portal, which can
also be shared with suppliers and partners. This way,
companies can communicate across secure networks
exactly what design specifications they need, the pre-
cise quantity of supplies and the exact timing of their
shipment, the latest demand information for the great-
est possible coordination, and all relevant shipping
and order-fulfillment concerns.
Increasingly, software vendors are designing appli-
cations for sharing sophisticated design information
over the Web and over extranets, so that high-level
product planning and design can be shared among
partners in real time, improving efficiency. If suppliers
are able to view the original CAD file, for instance,
they are able to more quickly and cost-effectively
modify their own processes in accordance with those
design specifications. In other words, CPC processes
allow a smoother, more continuous ramp-up, reducing
costs, adding value, and increasing speed and cus-
tomer satisfaction.

PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
Product management is a crucial component of
most general marketing strategies. While their job
descriptions vary from organization to organization,
they are typically responsible for overseeing a particu-
lar product’s life cycle, including product creation and
development, promotion, pricing, and distribution.
Smaller companies may not hire separate product
managers; rather, product management may be one
of many tasks handled by a business owner or general
manager. Regardless of the size of a business, how-
ever, how products and services are managed deter-
mine whether or not they meet the needs of clients
and earn a profit for the business.
PIONEERS OF PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
Procter & Gamble (P&G) is widely credited for
pioneering the concept of product management in the
early 1930s. At the time, the company’s Camay brand
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
soap was not performing as well as its highly success-
ful Ivory brand soap. In an effort to boost its sales,
P&G executives hired a product manager to focus
solely on its Camay brand. This targeted approach
proved successful, prompting other consumer pack-
aged goods firms to manage their products in a similar
manner. The concept evolved throughout the 1950s
and 1960s. Marketing classes began to teach business
students the four ‘‘P’s’’ of marketing: product, which
involves the creation and development of a product;
place, the markets in which the product will be sold;
price, how much the product will cost; and promotion,
how the product will be marketed and sold. As market-
ing trends evolved throughout the 1970s and 1980s,
so did popular product-management strategies.
In the early 1990s, most product managers relied
on traditional marketing and sales channels, such as
television ads and retail outlets, to promote and sell
their product or brand. The rise of the Internet as a
marketing and selling medium posed new challenges
for product managers. As customers were offered an
increasing array of product choices in virtually every
market, established companies began paying more at-
tention to maintaining product and brand identity,
while start-ups tried to establish their own products
and brands. To stay competitive, many product man-
agers felt compelled to market and sell their products
on the Web. As portrayed in an August 2001 issue
of Business Week, ‘‘for companies in almost every
industry, brands are important in a way they never
were before. Why? For one thing, customers for every-
thing from soda pop to software now have a staggering
number of choices. And the Net can bring the full array
to any computer screen with a click of the mouse.’’
UNDERSTANDING YOUR MARKET
To successfully manage a product, you must first
understand the needs of your customers. For example,
if you are considering selling a product via the In-
ternet, you need to know first if the customers you
are targeting tend to shop online. Conducting market
research is considered easier for smaller businesses
than industry giants because management is quite of-
ten in much closer contact with customers. You might
begin by simply soliciting feedback from current or
potential customers via mail, the telephone, a Web-
based feedback form, or e-mail. Along with determin-
ing what customers want, how often they want it,
where they want it, and how much they are willing
to spend, you can also use market research to learn
more about your competition, potential niches for new
products or improvements to your existing products,
and past, current, and predicted trends in the market
you serve. Along with gathering your own data, you
can contact organizations such as chambers of com-
merce and business associations, which often compile
data on various industries.
Once you have completed market research for your
product, you are ready to begin developing a market-
ing strategy. You may decide to differentiate your
product from its competition by selling it less expen-
sively or via a different medium. As an example,
Amazon.com uses both strategies to sell books online.
You may offer additional services along with your
product. You might also consider adding features to
your product, or developing a new product, based on
what your customers want. The marketing strategy
you choose will also depend upon the market you are
targeting. For example, if you are marketing your
product to retirees on a fixed income, you might tend
to focus more on pricing issues.
DEFINING YOUR GOALS
Before you begin marketing a product, you also
need to create specific objectives. Do you want to
increase sales to existing customers? Secure new cus-
tomers? Expand into new territory? Creating objec-
tives and quantifying each objective will make it easier
to measure your success later and to determine which
medium—newspaper, radio, e-mail—will help you to
achieve your goals. If online marketing and online
sales are part of your marketing mix, be sure that you
are placing your online tool, be it a Web site or a
banner ad, ‘‘where people who have a specific need
are likely to go and look for it,’’ advises Gregg Fisher,
a strategic services director for Icon Medialab, in a
January 2001 issue of Chief Executive.
To determine the success of your product manage-
ment activities, periodically revisit your objectives to
see if they have been met. To keep pace with changing
market trends, you will likely need to develop new
objectives on a regular basis. As a result, it is important
to maintain contact with your customers to ensure that
you are continuing to meet their needs. For more
information about product management, you can join
a trade association like the Association of International
Product Marketing Managers or the Product Develop-
ment and Management Association.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
Programming languages let you communicate a
set of instructions for a computer to carry out. Each
programming language has its specific vocabulary—
or set of keywords—and set of rules for entering
instructions—the grammar or syntax. Since comput-
ers operate according to binary systems—or data
bits strung together in sequences of ones and zeros—
programming languages are precisely laid out to
harness the power of computers’ computational sys-
tems while making them intelligible to humans.
Most languages act as a sort of translator between
human language and the ones and zeros of machine
language, often through several layers of language
hierarchy. While there are thousands of programming
languages floating around on the world’s computer
systems, only a handful have achieved widespread
use. The types of programming languages you will
employ in your business depends on the kind of
business you’re running and the nature of its internal
operations.
In the beginning were simple machine languages,
starting with assembler, which used abbreviations for
all basic operations to manipulate the ones and zeros
of machine code. Assembler represents the most basic
computer instructions. Unfortunately, as a result the
assembler language was different for each computer,
and so to make a program operate with two different
computers, a higher-level language is required that can
adapt to different machines’ instructions and interpret
between the two.
CATEGORIES OF PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGES
One way of classifying programming languages
is according to their functionality. The primary
strength of Fortran (Formula Translation, the earliest
programming language) is in its ability to perform
numeric computations, and thus finds favor in com-
puter operations in engineering, the sciences, and
mathematics.
Cobol and Basic are simpler languages, and are
thus ideal for use by nonprogrammers for designing
103
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
simple computer functions. Languages such as Java
and C are for object-oriented programming, while
Delphi builds on the simple Pascal language and inte-
grates it with object-oriented programming capabili-
ties. Object-oriented programming languages are built
by combining different objects in the program and
instructing them to interact with each other via visual
icons and interfaces to create a particular desired out-
put. Thus, these are fairly common programming lan-
guages for designing Web sites.
Some languages, such as Snobol, SQL, APL, and
Prolog, are used primarily to simplify the rendering
of specific data types. For example, SQL is used to
write database queries and functions, while Prolog is
used to simplify strings of logical expressions. Still
other programming languages, such as Simula and
GPSS, are commonly employed to create simulations
based on hypothetical scenarios.
In addition to their functionality, programming lan-
guages have grown to become associated with particu-
lar user communities, according to Computerworld.
Cobol is the language most commonly associated with
business operations, and is thus one of the languages
that entrepreneurs tend to find most useful. Prolog
and Lisp tend to be used for computer science and
artificial intelligence. Basic and Pascal are excellent
for teaching computer programming. The various C
languages are associated with systems software.
SGML and PostScript are strongly favored in publish-
ing operations. And HTML and Java are universal
languages on the World Wide Web.
COMMON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
FOR E-COMMERCE
Cobol (Common Business Oriented Language)
first emerged in 1959 and has undergone a series
of updates over the years. Cobol was devised in the
interests of academics, manufacturers, and businesses
who agreed that a common business language was
needed to facilitate computers communication across
a wide spectrum. It is a fairly simple language with
tremendous capacity for data processing. As a result,
businesses have widely adopted Cobol, which is
transparent enough so programming errors are easy
to identify and eliminate. In the early 2000s, e-
commerce developers were discussing ways to up-
date Cobol so that users could use the language in
an HTML-based Web interface, indicating that Cobol
would likely continue to dominate business-oriented
computer programming languages in the era of e-
commerce.
C and its variations are primarily geared toward
the development of software, including e-commerce
applications. C is exceptionally adaptable, with tre-
mendous capabilities for both high- and low-level

functions. C-based programs carry the added benefit
of using up very little memory on your computer. An
enhanced version of C, known as C, is widely used in
familiar desktop applications, including spreadsheets,
word processors, interpreters, and project manage-
ment suites. C is especially useful because most hard-
ware manufacturers offer drives with C interfaces, and
a large proportion of the world’s programmers know
the language. However, while a valuable tool for sim-
pler programs, C may be inadequate for more complex
applications, and it lacks the object-oriented capabili-
ties of C. As of the early 2000s, C was the most
advanced software development programming lan-
guage in wide use. It allows you to retain access to
low-level machine language while developing sophis-
ticated applications, and it is compatible with every
computer platform.
One of the most popular languages for the Web
and for e-commerce in particular is Java. Java applica-
tions are intended to be platform independent, so in
theory they can run on almost all PCs and worksta-
tions. The object-oriented Java language is based on
C structures, but is simpler than C. It consumes less
memory on your computer and renders updating and
troubleshooting simpler. Java was designed specifi-
cally for use on the World Wide Web.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Innovation is the key to staying ahead of the game
in e-commerce, and successful companies continually
engage in new projects, whether to design a new prod-
uct, to implement a new business practice or operating
procedure, or any other new endeavor. Project man-
agement is the science of keeping projects focused, on
schedule, and profitable. Project managers are charged
with keeping costs down and logistical problems under
control, reinforcing the project’s goals, keeping all
those working on the project motivated and focused,
and seeing that the project reaches its ultimate goals.
The research firm Gartner Group reported in 2002
that half of all information technology projects failed
to meet their objectives, while Boston-based Aberdeen
Group Inc. estimated that fully 30 percent were aban-
doned before completion, and 90 percent of those
completed were delivered behind schedule.
MAPPING YOUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT
STRATEGY
Without clearly defined project management pro-
cesses and procedures, a series of slight inefficiencies
can quickly add up and send a project’s budget spiral-
ing out of control. Thus, clearly codified processes
need to be implemented and enforced from the outset.
These codes can include everything from the format
and direction of communications within the project
to the operating rules of meetings.
The discovery process is the initial stage of the
project. During discovery, you find out exactly what
it is you have to work with, what needs to be done,
what obstacles might be in the way, what support you
can expect, what resources are at your disposal, and
what kind of people and expertise will be available
for the project. In the discovery process, you also
begin building relationships between all the parties,
outline the criteria for the project, begin delineating
strategies and processes for setting the project in mo-
tion, and getting a feel for the overall environment
within which the project will be conducted.
Over time, your projects need credibility if they
are to gain the team’s buy-in, and, ultimately, if they
will succeed. To achieve credibility, you need to dem-
onstrate that your project is worth doing, will add
value to the firm, is well-grounded, well-planned, and
well-executed. At the outset, you should spell out for
all project stakeholders what a successful completion
of the project will look like and what it will do for
the firm.
A few staples of project management continue to
flourish in the e-commerce era, including daily pro-
gress reports; continuous feedback; strictly codified
routines, processes, and methodologies; and strict, in-
flexible budgeting. Techniques like these allow proj-
ect managers to keep a close eye on the project team’s
progress, and ensure that their work doesn’t stray too
far away from its intended purpose. Because individu-
als working on disparate, narrowly focused problems
tend to break off onto their own paths, it’s important
to assign a taskmaster to oversee the project and make
sure each individual keeps their work directed at the
project’s goals.
A good project manager is close enough to the
project’s demands and employees that he or she can
have intimate knowledge of the process and of the
employees’ concerns. On the other hand, the project

manager should have enough familiarity with larger
company priorities—and a stake in the firm’s suc-
cess—to keep the project on track without pitting the
team against the management.
The organized flow of information through the
project team is a final key element in successful project
management. Knowledge management is sharing
knowledge and information in an efficient and produc-
tive manner, and aims at the elimination of redundancy
within the project. Employees can build on accumu-
lated knowledge to devise solutions to new problems,
rather than continually starting from scratch. To aid
this process, you may wish to quantify and classify
your firm’s problem-solving techniques and ap-
proaches to various business situations, and take an
inventory of the expertise existing among its em-
ployee ranks.
SOFTWARE
A bevy of software packages to aid in project man-
agement are available. These packages can assist man-
agers in keeping tabs on and organizing all the pro-
cesses and concerns involved in the project. Project-
and resource-tracking software, for instance, lets you
organize tasks in a hierarchical list, and under each
task and subtask you define the resources, budget,
employees, and assignments. In addition, you can en-
ter priorities for which tasks need to be completed first,
and then configure how best to allocate all available
resources toward that end. Time-tracking software
allows for detailed overviews of where time is being
spent and lost on your project, so you can spot and
weed out inefficiencies. Bug-tracking and version-
control software helps you keep track of all the soft-
ware and hardware being employed in by all members
of a project team, so you can coordinate your systems
and applications for the greatest efficiency. This can,
for instance, ensure that all members of one committee
are operating with the same version of a particular
software application, and that no one is using equip-
ment that is incompatible with the project needs.
But as analysts repeatedly point out, project-man-
agement software does not make for good project
management. Rather, they are mere tools that, in the
hands of a strong project manager with a sound strat-
egy, can help generate increased efficiency and
meet goals.

PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS VERSUS
OUT-OF-BOX APPLICATIONS
Proprietary systems are those developed and
owned by a company. For example, Amazon.com’s
one-click checkout technology is a proprietary system
that the online retailer developed in 1997. Similarly,
the auction Web site developed and enhanced by eBay
founder Pierre Omidyar in the late 1990s is considered
a propriety system. Out-of-box applications, on the
other hand, refer to ready-to-use programs that a com-
pany can purchase in place of developing its own
proprietary systems. For example, a company wanting
to sell products online might buy an out-of-box appli-
cation that allows its existing Web site to conduct e-
commerce. Another firm might decide to purchase an
out-of-box system that includes the Web site itself, as
well as e-commerce functionality. Out-of-box systems
are also known as turnkey systems.
CHOOSING YOUR APPLICATION
DEVELOPMENT MODEL
As an online entrepreneur, you will likely face
several situations where you must decide whether to
build a proprietary system or purchase an out-of-box
or turnkey solution. Most analysts recommend that
beginners use a turnkey solution rather than tackling a
task like Web site development themselves. However,
even if you plan to build your own Web site, you
might find yourself in need of various out-of-box
applications. For example, if you operate an online
business and would like to begin accepting credit
cards, you might contact a bank to obtain the necessary
merchant account. You might also turn to a company
like Verisign, Authorize.Net, or PayPal for a compre-
hensive payment-processing solution aimed at small
businesses. And rather than trying to develop your
own shopping-cart technology, you might opt to pur-
chase an out-of-box shopping-cart solution from a
specialized vendor like VirtualCart. Often Web-host-
ing firms provide a variety of out-of-box applications
that cover the most common online business needs,
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

S O U R C E B O O K
including credit-card processing, shopping carts, and
Web-site tracking.
When you first launch your venture, Inc.com writer
Delilah Obie recommends that you ‘‘determine the
level of technical expertise necessary to set up and
maintain a storefront using a turnkey solutions, and
consider whether you and your staff have the skills
to design and implement an e-commerce Web site
using various components or whether you need a full
turnkey solution.’’ A full turnkey solution is one that
presents you with a ready-made site. Issues to consider
include how unique a design you desire for your site,
the amount of time you are willing to invest in site
development and maintenance, and what your plans
are for future growth. While full turnkey solutions
allow you to get up and running quickly with minimal
hassle, it is important to be sure that they meet your
current expectations and future needs.
TURNKEY SOLUTIONS
The most comprehensive turnkey solutions are
those offered by firms like Vstore.com. These online
vendors offer everything from products to sell and
fully functioning online storefronts to order fulfillment
and customer service. You simply select which of the
products you want to sell on your site and handle the
marketing. You make money by earning a commission
on the products you sell. Instant e-commerce store-
fronts like these allow even the most inexperienced
entrepreneurs to gain familiarity with online market-
ing. However, as Entrepreneur.com reported in May
2001, ‘‘These sites are all cut from the same mold—
so there are thousands of other sites out there that
look just like yours. The key to success here is to
market your site better than everyone else.’’
Yahoo! offers a more flexible turnkey solution for
small businesses. The cost is $49.95 per month, plus
nominal fees related to the number of products on your
site, transaction processing, and the like. In addition, if
you already operate a Web site, you can use Yahoo!
to build a storefront and host the e-commerce portion
of your online operations. To allow you to test this
service, Yahoo! offers a free 30-day trial.
The key to finding a turnkey solution that is right
for your business is extensive research. If you are
considering using a solution like the ones offered by
Yahoo! and Vstore.com, visit sites run by each vendor
and compare prices and functionality. Contact online
entrepreneurs using these services and ask for their
recommendations. Try to locate a site similar to the
one you envision and find out what it takes to create
such a site. Investing time in research will allow you
to make a more informed decision, and many experts
agree that finding the best method for launching your
e-commerce venture is crucial to its success.

RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI)
METRICS FOR E-COMMERCE
SERVICES
ROI is an estimate of the return—net profit or
financial gain—on an investment. ROI metrics, or
measurements, are generally utilized to gauge the
profitability of a project or investment. Many busi-
nesses, information technology managers, and Web
site managers use ROI analysis to determine whether
a project, investment, or purchase will yield a suitable
return. As companies adopt e-commerce strategies,
new metrics have evolved that can help managers
measure the success of their Web-based businesses.
Traditionally, companies have measured ROI using
general and well-known methods of financial analysis.
A 2001 Internet Week article states that ROI ‘‘mea-
sures the up-front capital outlay and its associated
costs—overhead, taxes—against the revenue it gener-
ates. A respectable ROI calculation then factors in
how much the return is being eroded over time by
inflation or the cost of borrowing the money for the
investment. ROI calculations yield a ratio or percent-
age, usually on an annual basis, such as ‘the invest-
ment will return 10 percent annually for four years.’’’
While using this traditional method of ROI calcula-
tion, most companies have also adopted new methods
of measurement as a result of adding e-commerce
services to business plans. These new measurements
tie in with conventional ROI analysis but focus heavily
on Web site traffic and online consumer behavior.
While measuring the success of an online business
venture can be tricky, use of new e-commerce-related
metrics—often called e-metrics—is necessary to re-
main successful among your competitors and to deter-
mine the ROI of your e-commerce efforts.
Many companies believe that customer retention
is key to securing profits. As such, many use consumer
data generated from their Web sites to improve cus-
tomer retention and loyalty and, in turn, ROI. There
are 10 standard customer-related e-metrics that you
can use as part of your ROI analysis, including reach,

acquisition, conversion, retention, loyalty, duration,
abandonment, attrition, churn, and recency.
The reach metric refers to the percentage of poten-
tial buyers that you are reaching. For example, if there
are 500 total potential buyers for your product or
service and you place an online ad that 100 potential
buyers will see, your total reach is twenty percent.
Acquisition is related to gaining customer activity or
participation on your site. Conversion is then turning
that acquired customer into a buyer. Retention focuses
on keeping customers and encouraging future pur-
chases, while loyalty is measured by the number of
pages a customer views, the frequency with which a
customer views your site, or the length of his or her
visit to your site.
The duration metric refers to the total time spent on
a site divided by the number of visits. Abandonment is
measured by how often a customer leaves a Web
shopping cart before completing a purchase. Attrition
is the percentage of customers who stop buying from
your site and go elsewhere to make their purchases.
A churn rate, or change in customer base, is deter-
mined by dividing attrition by the total number of
customers. Recency refers to how recently a customer
has visited your site or made a purchase.
After these metrics are calculated, they can be used
in ROI analysis to determine the success or failure of
e-commerce activities. Say, for example, that you
want to determine the per-customer costs related to
an online advertising campaign. Your acquisition cost
would be equal to the total advertising and promo-
tional costs divided by the number of click-throughs,
or visits, to your site. To figure out your cost per
conversion, you would divide your total advertising
and promotional costs by the number sales completed.
Once these metrics are determined, you can figure out
the ROI of your advertising promotion.
If you choose to perform ROI analysis yourself,
there are many software products on the market, in-
cluding CIOView Corp.’s ROInow software package,
that allow you to determine ROI. These products can
analyze costs and benefits, provide reports, and often
provide benchmarks for typical expenditures. You can
also choose to hire a consulting firm that will perform
the analysis for you and then suggest plans of action
based on the results. Many large computer-related
firms including Intel Corp. also provide information
on their Web sites about calculating ROI for e-com-
merce services.
Overall, e-metrics and determining ROI for e-com-
merce is a hot industry topic. Target Marketing of
Santa Barbara, California, hosted the E-Metrics sum-
mit in June 2002. The forum was dedicated to measur-
ing Web site success, a signal that development of
ROI metrics for e-commerce services will continue
to evolve. Jim Sterne and Matt Culter, authors of the
107

S O U R C E B O O K
industry white paper E-Metrics: Business Metrics for
the New Economy, summed up the industry’s motiva-
tion for developing e-metrics, claiming, ‘‘e-business
is constantly generating new business models, new
types of partnerships, and new ways to succeed. To
keep up, companies require new metrics—e-metrics—
to calibrate their success. Indicators of e-commerce
effectiveness are necessary to reveal whether a firm’s
Web efforts are paying off.’’

SECURING FINANCING
Financing of some sort is required to launch nearly
all new businesses. Many entrepreneurs decide to use
their personal savings, personal lines of credit, or loans
from friends and family members. Some new business
owners avoid seeking venture capital from outside
sources because most venture capital firms actually
purchase a portion of the company they are funding,
and as a result, they quite often take control of the
firm’s strategic development. However, many entre-
preneurs are willing to give up a certain degree of
control in exchange for outside funding.
EARLY SUCCESS
For U.S.-based Internet start-ups, securing financ-
ing proved relatively easy in the mid- and late 1990s
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce
108
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
because of widespread interest and financial specula-
tion in e-commerce. As a result, venture capital firms
that focused exclusively on Internet markets emerged.
E-commerce entrepreneurs could also turn for support
to dot-com incubators, firms that allowed start-ups to
grow in-house before venturing out on their own.
Many venture capitalists and private investors awaited
their return in the start-up’s initial public offering
(IPO), when shares were released on the public market
and prices sometimes skyrocketed.
CONFIDENCE FALTERS
In 2000, though, investors began to temper their
funding of unprofitable dot-coms. When dot-com
stock prices tumbled as a result, sources of funds for
e-commerce ventures began to evaporate. Unable to
secure additional capital for expansion, many young
businesses were forced into bankruptcy, further un-
dermining the stock prices of remaining Internet ven-
tures. A weakening economy exacerbated the prob-
lem, and venture capital firms and banks grew
increasingly reluctant to invest in new Internet ven-
tures. As a result, compared to the 1,634 companies
that had raised $23.9 billion in venture capital funds
during the third quarter of 2000, only 540 companies
raised $6.7 billion during the same period in 2001.
SEEKING FUNDING
If you are looking to secure funding for your busi-
ness, be aware that funding options are certainly more
limited for e-commerce start-ups than they were in
the late 1990s. Banks and venture capital firms are
quite often skeptical about the potential success of
online ventures. These organizations continue to fund
Internet start-ups, albeit at a much more reserved pace.
As a November 2001 BusinessWeek Online article put
it, ‘‘So here’s how it works these days: The right
company with the right technology and management
in a potentially hot market is going to get a reasonable
amount of money—but probably not much more than
it needs to achieve liftoff. That’s venture capital to-
day—the way it was before the Internet bubble began
to inflate.’’
Your company’s stage of development will deter-
mine what type of funding you seek. For example,
companies that have not yet launched operations seek
seed funding. Those that have recently opened for
business apply for early stage investing. Established
businesses seeking funds for additional growth can
ask venture capitalists for expansion stage financing.
In addition, you can always consider looking for a
wealthy individual willing to fund a start-up; these
individuals are known as angel investors.
PLANNING TO BE FINANCED
No matter what type of funding you seek, you will
need to submit a business plan that details exactly
how you plan to launch operations, secure customers,
and make a profit. Be as specific as possible. The most
successful business plans establish a clearly defined
target market. Also, the online companies most likely
to secure funding to are those with a business plan
based on a proven business model. Lending institu-
tions want to see that your venture can produce sales
regardless of whether you are able to sell advertising
on your site, generate high levels of traffic, and so on.
According to PricewaterhouseCoopers venture capital
director Kirk Walden, as quoted in the February 2002
E-Commerce Times, non-core sales like advertising
are no longer considered an acceptable source of pro-
jected revenues in a business plan. ‘‘Your revenues
can’t come from anywhere other than selling the prod-
ucts you’re designed to sell.’’
Quite often, if a funding institution likes your busi-
ness plan, they will ask that you to present your ideas
in person as well. According to a November 2001
article in E-Commerce Times, ‘‘a live or semi-live
demonstration of the product that lets the client ‘do
some of the driving’ works best’’ to help potential
funders understand exactly how your business will
work. It also indicates that you understand this as
well. Rather than using buzzwords or catch phrases,
it’s best to explain yourself in clear, straightforward
language.
Along with a solid business plan and a convincing
presentation, most funding companies are also looking
for concepts that are ripe for current and future market
conditions. A fast-growing market is ideal. For exam-
ple, after the burst of the dot-com bubble, online lux-
ury-item merchants continued to secure funding be-
cause investors believed that the individuals able to
afford those items were not likely to be affected by the
recession. As a result, jewelry e-tailer BlueNile.com
secured a $7 million round of financing from Besse-
mer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &
Byers, and other venture capitalists in 2001. In addi-
tion, Winetasting.com secured a $5 million loan from
an individual investor. While luxury e-tailers were not
the only online companies securing financing in the
early 2000s, their success does reflect the importance
venture capitalists place on favorable market condi-
tions.

SECURITY IN E-COMMERCE
SYSTEMS
Most experts agree that the ultimate success of e-
commerce depends on the effectiveness of its security
systems. Without adequate security, retail customers
will be unwilling to share sensitive personal informa-
tion, such as credit card numbers, online, and contracts
in business-to-business e-commerce may be neither
valid nor enforceable. If confidence in the safety of
doing business online is lacking, people will do busi-
ness by traditional means rather than electronically.
The risk of financial loss is high in insecure e-com-
merce. A Computer Security Institute and FBI study
found that losses attributable to cybercrime totaled
approximately US$378 million in 2001. Another study
found that more than US$700 million in e-tail sales
was lost because of online fraud and that online losses
due to fraud were 19 times higher than comparable
losses for traditional retailers. And cybercrime is on
the rise at the same time that many other forms of
crime have been declining. Despite all these concerns,
however, for many e-commerce companies security
is far down on the list of priorities; over 50 percent
of businesses allocate less than 5 percent of their
information technology (IT) budgets to security.
The primary purpose of e-commerce security is to
ensure that unauthorized persons—competitors, hack-
ers, business partners, or customers—are not able to
gain access to sensitive information in a company’s
computer systems. Without good security a company
will be vulnerable to a number of threats. Web site
defamation is one of the most common. The pure
financial cost of a Web site defaced by hackers might
be low, but intangible costs, like the damage done to
a firm’s image, can be high. Poor security can also
lay a firm open to more malicious and costly mischief
like denial of service attacks in which hackers over-
load a server with information requests until it shuts
109
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
down. Lax security can leave sensitive information,
such as trade secrets, current R&D projects, customer
lists, and financial data, open to the prying eyes of
hackers or industrial spies. Poor security can even
make a company vulnerable to lawsuits. When Micro-
soft’s computers, for example, were hacked, a virus
was embedded in the code for a product that was
subsequently introduced on the market. Microsoft
would have been liable for any damages that occurred
as a result. Finally, security breaches also inevitably
become public knowledge. When they do, a com-
pany’s reputation suffers and customer confidence de-
clines.
Each area of e-commerce must be addressed by a
particular form of security. The most common security
systems include firewalls, password access, and virus
scan programs. Firewalls regulate access between
computer networks, in particular between a com-
pany’s computers and the Internet. Firewalls can be
set up at varying levels of security: depending on the
company’s needs, they can be configured to block all
access from the outside except e-mail or to allow more
kinds of access. A firewall system can also be used
as a home for a company’s Web site, where a firm’s
public information—downloadable files, bug fixes,
investor files and the like—is stored. One way a fire-
wall controls access is by means of a password system.
The main benefits of passwords are their familiarity
to most computer users and their ease of use. A virus
program is used inside the firewall to identify and
eliminate dangerous computer viruses that might be
introduced via e-mail attachments or floppy disks.
The effects of a virus can range from annoying practi-
cal jokes to the destruction of valuable files and soft-
ware to the implementation of hidden programs that
transmit valuable company information to industrial
spies.
These three types of protection are widespread and
effective forms of e-commerce security. However,
they illustrate the inherent limitations of any security
system. Firewalls can only prevent access from an-
other network, they cannot prevent employees from
giving out valuable information or office visitors from
stealing a floppy disk. New viruses appear daily, and
a virus detection program is only effective if it is
updated regularly. Employees must also be trained to
check any questionable files they receive. Passwords
are too often obvious—a user’s name, for example—
and workers are frequently casual about sharing them
with others.
Increasingly sophisticated security systems are be-
ing developed that serve similar functions while pro-
viding higher levels of security. An important ad-
vanced security technique is encryption, which
encodes data in a form that is nearly impossible to
crack. It is already used to protect credit card informa-
tion, to create electronic money for online purchases,

S O U R C E B O O K
and to generate completely unique digital signatures
for electronic contracts. Another new technology, bio-
metrics, identifies individuals using physical charac-
teristics such as fingerprints, retinal patterns, and
voice. Even encryption and biometrics cannot fill an
e-business’s every security need. They have been de-
signed to provide particular, limited kinds of protec-
tion. Ultimately, any e-business will need a suite of
security programs rather than a single security system.
Perhaps the most critical security issue for e-com-
merce is the security of online payments. The safety
of credit card information is the leading cause of
concern among consumers. Most e-commerce sites
use Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) security policy with
specific goals, and security specialists to implement
it. The policy is critical: not only does it reduce the
risk of security violations, it provides the basis for
legal action if a violation takes place. No computer
system can be 100 percent secure. However, planning,
training, and vigilance will improve any system im-
measurably.

SERVERS
Servers are a key component of networks. The
term server can refer to hardware or software or both,
but usually it describes a central computer that per-
forms special tasks for remote users. The early servers
used in basic client/server networks acted as host com-
puters, storing data shared by the clients within the
network. Clients consisted of other computers or re-
mote devices that were able to access the server to
send and receive information.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, computers and
networks were used for increasingly diverse functions.
Consequently, technologists developed different types
of servers to manage different types of resources. For
example, increased computer use generated a demand
for computer-file-storage devices, which prompted the
development of file servers. Printer servers were able
to link several machines to a limited number of print-
ers. In addition, database servers emerged to process
database queries and to give computer users more
control over various types of data.
When businesses of all kinds began to embrace
Internet technology in the late 1990s, many enterprises
began to use application servers to allow current infor-
mation to be delivered to clients over a corporate
intranet or the Internet. Companies often link their
application server to a Web server, which enables
content to be transferred over the Internet. When a
Web server receives a request for a Web page from
an Internet user (essentially, when a user clicks on a
link or enters a Web address), it finds or creates the
Web page and loads it, allowing the user to view it
in his or her Web browser. Web servers communicate
with Web browsers through the hypertext transfer
protocol, or HTTP, an international standard for data
communication.
To run an online business, you either need to install
Web server software on your own machine or purchase
Web server space from a hosting company. If you
111
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
allow another company to host your site, you can
choose to share server space with other Web sites,
which is the least expensive option and quite often a
reasonable one for small businesses. For example, in
2002 many hosting services charged small business
customers $20-50 a month for a basic shared hosting
plan. You can also lease a dedicated Web server, one
that serves your site exclusively. While this option
typically offers your site more storage space and re-
serves more bandwidth for your site traffic, it is also
more costly.
According to a February 2001 issue of Entrepre-
neur, ‘‘With Web hosting companies as common as
banner ads these days, most Net start-ups prefer to
let a hired hand do the dirty work rather than mess
with it themselves. But e-commerce services add up,
and getting the features you want can involve a lot
of hassle and moolah.’’ If you consider yourself tech-
nologically savvy, or plan to hire such an individual,
you can typically save money by hosting your own
site. You will also have much more control over
your site.
To host your own site, you need to select a Web
server. It will consist of hardware, often a specially
equipped PC or a specialized server appliance, and
server software to manage your Web site and retrieve
pages as users request them. First, you need a machine
that has the disk space, memory, and processing capac-
ity to handle the site traffic you anticipate. If you
expect high levels of traffic, you will need to invest
in more than one machine. Large Web sites have
dozens of servers working in tandem in order to deliver
a high-volume, sophisticated service.
After choosing hardware, you will also be faced
with a variety of software options. Most server appli-
ances come installed with a popular operating system
like Windows 2000 or Red Hat Linux. These systems
typically prove more than adequate as a platform for
your online business. Next, you will choose the Web
server program itself. A Web server is often supplied
with the server operating system, but you might
choose another based on performance or other needs.
The Apache Software Foundation offers one of the
most popular Web server programs for free. Apache
is run most often on Unix and Linux machines and
is considered very stable. Microsoft bundles its Web
server with server versions of Windows.
The final step is making sure you have a fast and
reliable connection to the Internet. Your server must
be reachable on the Internet around the clock in order
to maintain an effective online presence.

SHARED & CO-SPONSORED SITES
In the minds of some budding entrepreneurs, run-
ning their own e-commerce business conjures the im-
age of a solitary cowboy riding on the wide open
prairie. As a practical matter, however, you will find
many cases when both new and established businesses
benefit from cooperative relationships, whether with
suppliers, customers, complementary businesses, or
even competitors. The benefits can include lower risks
and costs for the individual firms and unique market-
ing opportunities through co-branding and cross-pro-
motion.
TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS
As with other sorts of joint ventures, shared and
co-sponsored Web sites make sense when there is a
strategic fit between the participating companies. One
example is when two unlike businesses have a vested
interest in a single outcome, such as if a large online
retailer partners with a major package-delivery service
to build a special site for their combined customers.
The logic here might be that easy delivery will benefit
both companies by increasing sales or customer satis-
faction.
Other times, co-sponsors may be in related lines
of business, perhaps newspapers and television, and
the goal is to combine the unique strengths of each
in order to reduce costs. The result might be an enter-
tainment news site featuring content from both
sponsors.
Still another approach is a partnership of unequals,
where one company is well-known in a market and
the other is relatively unknown. Here the lesser-known
company benefits from the association with a recog-
nized brand, easing its entry into new markets. For
its part, the better-known company may receive side
revenue or access to technology or specialized skills
it lacks. In all cases the key is to harness each partici-
pant’s strengths so that all will gain.
CHOOSING A GOOD PARTNER
E-commerce firms often have a range of potential
partners. Since some will be more compatible—and
the results more profitable—than others, e-commerce
businesses benefit from developing standards and cri-
teria, either formal or informal, that help identify the
best matches. The conventional wisdom of brand mar-
keting applies here: if customers have bad associations
between two brands, even ones that are strong in their
own right, it can damage both. To appreciate this
insight, you need only consider the prospect of
Haagen-Dazs teaming up with Pennzoil.
Often co-sponsorship depends on both (or multi-
ple) parties having something unique to contribute
besides their brand names. Valuable assets brought to
the arrangement may be content for the site, personnel
to develop and manage it, hardware and infrastructure,
mutual linking with established sites (cross-promo-
tion), or financial backing. These assets matter both for
the initial building of the site as well as its continuing
upkeep. Potential partners must also examine possi-
bilities for future engagements beyond the joint site
at hand. If there are deep complementary skills and
assets, a co-sponsored site may be a platform for any
number of larger joint ventures, as a San Antonio
newspaper and TV station found after they first joined
forces on the Web in 1999. The two media outlets
gradually stepped up their involvement and, in the
process, created their city’s most visited local site.
MANAGING SHARED SITE DEVELOPMENT
If you decide to produce a co-sponsored site, you
should be prepared for a healthy dose of coordinating
diverse resources, managing schedules, and otherwise
proactively guiding the process. Since an ordinary
self-produced Web site requires all of these skills, you
can expect that it will be all the more complicated
when people at different firms are responsible for
different parts of the project.
Among the decisions you will have to make are
whether to create a whole new stand-alone site, or
whether to embed the co-sponsored site within one
or more existing sites. In many cases this decision
will be minor from a technical standpoint, so the ad-
vantages mainly apply to the marketing strategy. As
a rule, the shared site will get more traffic if it is
integrated into existing sites that already receive many
visitors. But it may also make sense to host the shared
site under its own domain, particularly if it’s a periph-
eral activity. It’s also logical to have the shared site
stand on its own if your intention is to create a large
new audience or a highly developed shared brand
independent of its sponsors. The latter examples apply
if your company wishes to treat the co-sponsored site
as a separate marketing channel and is not seeking
cross-over from existing customers.
A related aspect to consider is whether your co-
sponsored site will be a long-term venture or a one-
time event. Naturally, this choice can influence the

total amount of investment going into the site, but also
frames the scope of what such a site might include. For
instance, when a group of high-profile technology
firms launched a fund-raising site to collect relief
money for terrorism victims, their site was primarily
a response to a short-term crisis. The stand-alone site
was designed very simply, with a small number of
pages and a form for online donations by credit card.
The sponsors, including Amazon.com, AOL Time
Warner, Cisco Systems, eBay, Microsoft, and Yahoo,
linked to the site in various ways from their own e-
commerce and corporate sites. They likewise con-
ducted separate publicity efforts on behalf of the fund-
raising site. Other short-run sites have included infor-
mation sites amid pending corporate mergers and
sporting-event sites like Olympics promotions. By
contrast, a site shared between AOL Latin America
and Banco Itau, a major Latin American bank, was
created in 2001 as an ongoing, client-facing finance
portal. That site included a range of sophisticated
applications for banking customers and content inte-
grated from multiple sources.
SHARING RISKS AND GAINS
The goal of any partnership is to share resources
and benefits so that each side gains from the transac-
tion. E-commerce vendors have innumerable potential
partners, so the task is to come up with criteria for
selecting the best ones. A series of logistical decisions
follow, including how to structure the site, how to
coordinate the efforts of the partners, and how to
manage it all for the long term.

SHOPPING CART SOFTWARE
Like traditional shopping carts at the grocery store,
electronic shopping carts allow customers to collect
the items they wish to purchase prior to actually check-
ing out. While in a traditional store, check-out takes
place at a cash register, at an online store, payment
is typically made via a real-time credit-card transac-
tion, and merchandise is then shipped to the address
113

specified by the shopper. Along with handling the
checkout process itself, most online shopping-cart
programs handle multiple functions such as
T
allowing shoppers to review the products or ser-
vices items they have selected for purchase
T
letting shoppers remove items from their cart
T
offering information regarding the availability of
these products
T
asking shoppers if they wish to check out or to
continue shopping
T
displaying individual product prices, shipping
charges, sales tax, and the total bill
T
accepting and confirming contact, billing, and
shipping information
Shopping carts have been used by Web-based busi-
nesses since the mid-1990s. Many of the first online
shopping carts were criticized as unwieldy and diffi-
cult to use. According to an August 1998 issue of PC
Week, ‘‘Visibility is the first problem. Sites should
not hide their shopping carts on separate pages. This
design makes shoppers either delay all analysis and
reconciliation to the end of their visit or flip back and
forth between item pages and the shopping cart. Why
should you have to wonder whether you already put
the item in the cart or what your total bill will be?’’
One of the most important developments in shop-
ping-cart technology came in 1997 when Ama-
zon.com developed its one-click method. According to
Electronic Business writer Marc Brown, Amazon.com
developed the technology in an effort to reduce the
number of sales lost to customers frustrated with on-
line checkout processes that included completing
lengthy personal information forms. ‘‘Amazon.com
captures the buying impulse immediately by storing
this information in a database, assigning the customer
a unique I.D., and storing the I.D. in a cookie on
the customer’s computer. The next time the customer
visits, the I.D. is automatically read and used to locate
the customer’s record.’’ From that point on, an Ama-
zon.com customer is able to make a purchase simply
by clicking on the ‘‘Buy Now’’ icon located next to
each product.
In December 1999, Apex Interactive Inc. devel-
oped a new shopping-cart program that addressed
some of these concerns. Apex’s drag-and-drop shop-
ping-cart technology allowed shoppers to drag images
of products or services they wanted to buy into a
separate shopping-cart window that remained open
while customers continued shopping. This window
displayed each item the buyer selected along with its
price. When a buyer added or removed a new product
from the cart, the total bill was recalculated.

Rather than trying to build your own from scratch,
you may opt to simply purchase a shopping cart pro-
gram. To buy an existing package, you can contact a
specialized vendor, such as VirtualCart. Shopping-cart
programs offered by companies like VirtualCart can be
integrated into your existing online store operations.
You can also choose to use an e-commerce solutions
provider like One World Hosting, which offers to not
only host online businesses, but also to supply various
applications, suchas shoppingcarts, necessaryfor con-
ducting e-commerce. Like One World, many estab-
lished Web hosting services offer one or more shop-
ping-cart systems to fit various needs.
Despite advances in shopping-cart technology, a
study conducted by e-commerce consultant Creative
Good in 2000 indicated that 43 percent of online
shoppers who planned to make an online purchase
ended up abandoning the transaction for reasons rang-
ing from slow page load time and confusion regarding
the check-out process to being unable to locate the
product they wanted. More than 40 percent of these
frustrated online shoppers had placed items in their
shopping cart before they left the site. In those cases,
the top three reasons for aborting the transaction were
complicated account creation procedures, unclear er-
ror messages, and vague distinctions between paths
for new and returning customers.
Along preventing abandoned shopping carts, you
might also need to deal with shopping-cart hacking. In
some cases, hackers have been able to use the HTML
editing features available on most browsers to change
the price of a product before buying it. In 2001, nearly
one-third of all shopping-cart applications were unable
to prevent this type of price switching activity, and the
Internet Fraud Council estimated that fraud took place
in 11 percent of all online purchases.
Despite these problems with shopping carts, how-
ever, the number of online stores continues to rise, as
does the number of online shoppers. Because shop-
ping-cart technology is a key component of e-com-
merce, advances that increase security and decrease
lost sales continue to emerge. In addition, a growing
number of companies have started to develop less
expensive shopping-cart programs for operations of
all sizes. For example, in 2002 Aestiva LLC developed
Aestiva Cart Pro, a program designed to offer many
of the features typically seen on larger sites like Ama-
zon.com and eBay to businesses with a much smaller
budget. To take advantage of these new developments,
plan to spend considerable time researching your op-
tions before selecting the shopping-cart technology
that will best suit your venture.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT MODELS
Software development models are formal methods
for organizing and managing the process of creating
software. These schemes for organizing the labor of
software coding have existed throughout the history
of software, but specific models have gained and lost
favor in different eras. Models are likewise selected
based on the type of project at hand and the expected
resources needed to complete it. In the e-business era,
for example, some developers argued that traditional
software models didn’t adequately describe the fast
pace and interactive qualities of designing an e-busi-
ness application. Instead, they offered new models
which they believed better addressed these facets of
Internet-related software development.
The basic question a software development model
tries to answer is: how do I optimize my staff and
resources in order to produce the best software possi-
ble in the shortest time and for the lowest cost? Of
course, no model can guarantee you will reach these
lofty goals, but models offer techniques for pursuing
them. A more modest question is, how do I go about
organizing the complex relations and processes
needed to produce a software application? The answer,
some would argue, is to choose the right model.
Before looking at some of the particular models
that have been used to organize software development,
it helps to understand broad changes in the philosophy
of software development since the 1970s, when some
of the first large-scale methods were codified. Some
have labeled the 1970s to mid-1980s the project-ori-
ented stage, when developers were mainly concerned
with managing the intricacies of software design with-
out drifting too far afield in project scope or failing
to produce the software that was originally intended.

Under these models, the lion’s share of the develop-
ment cycle was devoted to producing code according
to a fixed plan. Relatively little time was given for
planning and designing at the front end of the process,
or testing at the back end.
In the 1980s, so-called process models gained a
large backing as a result of successful Japanese and
European experiments. Process models paid more at-
tention to design, to measuring achievements, and to
ensuring the quality of the finished product.
In the 1990s, with the advent of object-oriented
programming and the rise of Internet technologies,
newer models aimed at rapid development and auto-
mation gained popularity. Often centered on devel-
oping early prototypes and reusing code structures,
these methods remain popular today. In addition to
emphasizing efficient mass-production of program
code, recent methods have also tried to capture inter-
active and evolutionary qualities of the development
process. They try to find ways to allow changing or
reshaping the project late in the development cycle
without losing previous work and without delaying
completion of the project. When software vendors
have done this successfully, it has been key to their
competitive strategy. In essence, it is an attempt to
ensure software features will be well-received and
time-to-market is very short, two goals usually at odds
with one another.
WATERFALL MODEL
Probably the best-known model of software devel-
opment is the waterfall model, first used in the early
1970s in U.S. military-related endeavors. It is a rela-
tively linear model that orders the development cycle
into these steps:
T
Document the system concept
T
Record its functional requirements
T
Divide the work into components
T
Design, develop, and test the components
T
Bring the components together and test them
T
Deploy and manage the system
This model, also known as the system development
life cycle model, emphasizes an orderly transition
through each step, with a sign-off by key decision
makers at each stage to prevent sliding backwards
when disagreements arise or people change their
minds. Indeed, the name stems from the metaphor that
once water passes over a cliff, there is no turning back.
While it has been roundly criticized and seems
outdated to many, the waterfall model continues to be
used. Various developers have proposed ‘‘modified’’
115
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
waterfall approaches as well as approaches by other
names that subsume the waterfall model as one of
their techniques. Many have claimed specifically that
the waterfall model isn’t appropriate for the pace of
Web design, yet it still claims adherents among e-
commerce developers. It also appeals to managers
who want a strong handle on what is being developed
and are uncomfortable with the lack of clear direction
other models appear to suffer. Waterfall models are
considered most appropriate when the end users of the
system are well-known, such as with internal business
systems.
EVOLUTIONARY MODELS
Several more recent development models empha-
size the evolutionary nature of software production.
They try to articulate more of a cyclical or iterative
process of developing software that incorporate new
information—most importantly, customer feedback—
into the plan as the project progresses. These models
depend mightily on prototyping, or building simple
working versions of the software starting at the earliest
stages of the process. In fact, according to the evolu-
tionary prototyping model, the entire development
process is essentially aimed at fine-tuning the proto-
type to a point where it is acceptable to the customer
and competitively viable. In theory, this can mean
dropping planned features if users are satisfied without
them. Likewise, it raises the possibility of adding new
features that were not originally intended.
An evolutionary strategy was perhaps most fa-
mously used by Microsoft in the mid-1990s when it
developed version three of its Internet Explorer. Fac-
ing an uphill struggle against the popular Netscape
browser, Microsoft employed a fluid and interactive
development process that allowed it to obtain cus-
tomer feedback quickly, and more importantly, incor-
porate the feedback into its product over just a few
months. In-depth, actionable responses from custom-
ers are key to making this process succeed. In the
end, the new browser proved to be more acceptable
to users than earlier versions, and using various tactics
Microsoft was able to unseat Netscape for browser
dominance.
Similar methods have been adopted directly for
Web site development. Such site designs attempt to
create a core set of functions that can be launched to
users quickly, and then refine the functions and add
new ones as users share their experiences.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
The field of supply chain management is undergo-
ing dramatic changes due to the advancement of tech-
nology, the proliferation of the Internet, and consumer
behavior and preferences. In the digital age, supply
chains are electronically interconnected and opti-
mized, allowing for such efficiency and value-added
benefits as just-in-time inventory and mass customiza-
tion. Even though technology and the Internet are
viewed as helpful tools in increasing the efficiency
of the supply chain, there are still some major chal-
lenges in the optimal implementation of these tools.
On the information side, the issues of forecasting
demand remains of the highest priority because it is
viewed as the beginning of the cycle. If forecasting
is wrong, so are the remaining phases in the supply
chain. Two additional challenges are systems and peo-
ple. We are faced with a ‘‘Babylon Tower’’ of systems
that makes collaboration very challenging. At the
same time, human nature always favors familiarity,
and it takes time and effort to create new comfort
zones.
Just-in-time (JIT) inventory systems are a good
idea that have proven themselves in many industries.
Nevertheless, the transformation to just-in-time inven-
tory is neither simple nor easy. It requires a coordi-
nated effort on the part of people, systems, and strong
partnerships.
Ironically, the greatest beneficiaries of the mass-
customization process are the delivery and shipping
companies. Increase in shipping along the supply
chain spectrum, as well as between the manufacturer
and the consumer, implies higher shipping costs. Some
of this incremental cost will be paid by the consumer,
and some will be offset by the increase in process
efficiency.
CHALLENGES IN SUPPLY CHAIN
MANAGEMENT
No matter what the product is or the stage an entity
fulfills in the supply chain, the most challenging task
is forecasting demand. Demand is the beginning of
the cycle, and everything done afterwards relies on
this information.
Forecasting demand includes elements such as his-
torical information, market trends, and changes in
materials that make up the product. Moreover, you
need to find out the lead time. The shorter you can
make your lead time, the more accurate the forecast
can be because the project need not be too far into
the future.
CRITICAL AREAS IN SUPPLY CHAIN
MANAGEMENT
Technology and the Internet have provided the
supply chain with the key to operate in a real-time
environment. However, we are not there yet, mainly
because there are two major challenges to overcome—
a Babylon Tower of systems and human behavior.
SYSTEMS. Currently, there are different systems all
over, and each entity in the supply chain needs differ-
ent information for their purpose. The fact that each
entity along the supply chain spectrum uses different
systems and needs different information makes the
notion of collaboration almost impossible.
Another system-related issue is the accuracy of the
data. Keeping the data up to date is a challenge. There
are problems with continuity of data, meaning that
the same material is sometimes described differently
by different entities in the supply chain.
PEOPLE. Regardless of the efficiency and functional-
ity of a given system, it is human behavior that needs
to be dealt with if a supply chain is to become more
efficient. One issue is trust, and willingness on the
part of the trading partners to share information. The
biggest challenge is a cultural one. The technology
exists, but the behavioral change required from the
customer and the supplier is often quite large.
Fear also plays a role in this area. Brand companies
have the ability to share very detailed information
with their suppliers and partners along the supply
chain. However, they are afraid that competitors might
get access to this information and take advantage of it.
The notion that everyone is going to share information
with everyone else is somewhat naive.
EXPECTATIONS OF ‘‘JUST-IN-TIME’’
SYSTEMS
Ensuring that you have the right components in
hand at the right time, with minimal excess inventory,
can produce high efficiency results, but it takes careful
planning and to master the complexity of implement-
ing such an environment. It is possible to have an
efficient inventory system for direct components,
which will become part of the finished product, and
at the same time have an inefficient inventory system
for the indirect parts, such as tools and machinery.

COSTS OF MASS CUSTOMIZATION
The Internet, e-commerce, mass-customization,
and other elements of the new economy have created
a need for increased shipping and delivery. This in-
crease effects all the entities involved in the supply,
as well as the end user.
The underlying reasons for the increase in shipping
and delivery are evident. More customers can now
order an item directly from the manufacturer or distrib-
utor, and in many cases one single item is shipped to
a single customer as opposed to bulk shipping to a
store. Moreover, if this item is customized, it is very
likely that it has created increase in shipping along
the supply chain.
The ability to mass-customize is one thing, and
the willingness of consumers to buy such products is
another. Generally speaking, consumers do not see
value in the customization of commodity-like prod-
ucts. On the other hand, consumers have accepted
mass-customization of higher ticket items. Over time,
though, we should expect the bar to be lower for items
that consumers will desire to be customized.
FUTURE OF SUPPLY CHAIN
RELATIONSHIPS
The Internet, which provides greater speed and
connectivity, will create varying degrees of relation-
ships amongst businesses. Suppliers and manufactur-
ers will interact on two or three levels. The highest
level, strategic partnership, will be reserved for suppli-
ers that provide an instrumental contribution to the
manufacturer, and the relationship will be maintained
on a personal level. The lowest level will be with
commodity suppliers, and will be based with on the
‘‘deal’’ rather than on the relationship.
Entities involved in the supply chain process
should expect to find themselves in two or three types
of relationships with each other. Suppliers that provide
the highest value-added components to their manufac-
turers can expect a strategic alliance based on personal
relationships. Those that produce commodity-like
components are more likely to be ‘‘best deal’’ type
of providers, which will be easily replaced with com-
petitors.

SUPPLY LOGISTICS
At the heart of any effective supply logistics strat-
egy is communication and collaboration with all your
suppliers. This involves constant interaction via ex-
tranets, online business-to-business exchanges, and
other specialized communication networks, as well as
the sharing of databases, order schedules, and even
design planning documents, preferably over real-time
electronic networks. Collaboration, in other words, is
the key to success in optimizing your supply logistics.
Perhaps the most ambitious goal for e-commerce en-
trepreneurs looking toward the most effective logistics
strategy was to move their supply logistics beyond
pure overhead to a source of actual strategic advantage
over their competitors.
First, you need an accurate assessment of your
overall logistics costs. This seems obvious, but ac-
cording to Industry Week, this simple measurement
often remains elusive to companies, concerned as they
are simply with getting their supplies ordered and
delivered. In order to accurately assess your costs
and justify them, the optimal solution is complete
transparency across the entire supply chain.
Supply chain management links all elements of
the supply chain, from manufacturing and shipping
partners to order schedules and inventories, in a central
system. This system can be monitored from several
different angles and shared with all relevant parties
for optimal efficiency. Supply chain management will
allow you to make the right decisions at the right time
as to when to order and ship supplies for your product
lines. This increases speed and diminishes costs due
to excess shipping and inventory, as decisions are
based on the most comprehensive supply and demand
knowledge. In an age of increased outsourcing and
complex webs of business relationships in the global
economy, supply chains have become particularly
convoluted, making them difficult for individual firms
to control. The proliferation of electronic business
relationships, in the forms of extranets and online

S O U R C E B O O K
business-to-business exchanges, thus makes supply
chain management both tempting and technically fea-
sible.
The layers of potentially useful information are
many. By integrating comprehensive databases of
components into the supply chain management sys-
tem, your firm can cut costs at almost every corner.
For instance, by detailing all the components that
goes into a completed product, you can monitor each
individual component to determine its optimal produc-
tion and shipping level, and determine which compo-
nents are moving below peak efficiency. Such infor-
mation can help bring your entire supply chain into
equilibrium for the greatest level of profitability.
CATEGORIES OF SOFTWARE FOR SUPPLY
LOGISTICS
A wide variety of tools for streamlining supply
logistics are on the market, from comprehensive sup-
ply chain management suites to applications for spe-
cific tasks, such as transportation management sys-
tems
(TMS),
warehouse
management
systems
(WMS), demand planning and scheduling (DPF) sys-
tems, and advanced planning scheduling (APS) sys-
tems. Web-based applications can track supply ship-
ments through entire supply chains to allow just-in-
time delivery, where supplies roll in only when they
are absolutely needed, greatly reducing inventory.
OUTSOURCING SUPPLY LOGISTICS
OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
Depending on your personnel, time, and resources,
you may also opt to outsource your supply logistics
operations to a third-party, and there is no shortage
of such firms. Third-party logistics (3PL) providers
cater to all kinds of companies and needs, some taking
on only limited functions, others taking over logistics
operations entirely.
As with any outsourcing relationship, 3PL con-
tracts try to weigh the disadvantages of the loss of
direct control against the benefits of the third party’s
expertise in the field. Ultimately you need to deter-
mine whether the overall cost of a third-party relation-
ship is worth that loss of control, and whether those
expenses are made up in lower costs elsewhere. 3PL
firms need to demonstrate that they add value to your
company beyond simply taking over the hassle of
coordinating the supply chain for you. If you choose
to contract with a 3PL, it’s important to maintain your
focus on generating the maximum return on invest-
ment, which calls for a high level of transparency in
the 3PL’s processes so that you can see that the cost
and time savings you’re seeking are being realized.
In addition to savings in labor, inventory, and trans-
portation and the reduction of cycle time in the supply
chain, 3PLs can add value by employing higher levels
of supply chain visibility, flexibility in their schedul-
ing, high-level technologies and logistics process in-
novation, economies of scale that allow for greater
leverage in relationships with shippers and transporta-
tion companies, and global access.
THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE
To the extent that your company procures supplies
from international affiliates, you’ll need to either de-
velop or contract with a 3PL that enjoys mature inter-
national relationships and stable transportation opera-
tions. In a competitive e-commerce environment
where every dollar counts, the boosted cost of shipping
freight, longer hours spent at borders, and higher insur-
ance premiums add up in a hurry, adding greater pres-
sure to streamline your supply logistics operations,
particularly where international commerce is con-
cerned.

TRANSFORMING BUSINESS
STRATEGIES
Beginning in the mid-1990s and likely continuing
in the coming decades, the global economy is undergo-
ing a gradual convergence of two modes of economic

production—the traditional bricks-and-mortar econ-
omy and the online e-commerce marketplace—rather
than a fast transition.
The important thing to remember during this transi-
tional period is that you must plan and conduct your
business in both of these economies. At some level,
your business, if it is to remain viable, must effectively
plan and optimize its operations for its interaction
with each of these economic environments, and sketch
out the optimal balance of these operations for your
needs and the conditions of your particular market.
Thus, a winning strategy for the transformation
from a bricks-and-mortar enterprise to an online busi-
ness will allow the business owner to carefully assess
the conditions in the physical and virtual economies,
and devise a formula that allows you to leverage your
strengths in both areas to maximum competitive ad-
vantage and symbiosis.
THE NATURE OF TRANSFORMATION
In effect, all the transformations you need to ready
your business for competition in the e-commerce mar-
ketplace fall under three broad categories: connectiv-
ity, interactivity, and speed.
Connectivity refers to the ability to put interested
parties in touch with one another. In the traditional
economy, connectivity was limited to a company’s
size and physical place of business, or its distribution
reach. In the online economy, there is no such limit.
Anyone can become a participant, as long as he or
she has access to the Internet. Think about your own
business, and outline how your enterprise is going to
leverage the unique properties of connectivity.
Interactivity is the ability to interact directly with
a source in real time. For example, when you are
watching television, you are experiencing a non-inter-
active media because you can’t interact with the source
(one-way communication). When you read or view
the news online, however, you can interact with the
source by voicing your opinion via email, or search
for additional information on the same subjec. In the
connected economy, customers expect instant gratifi-
cation and information. So your business needs to
provide your customers with an opportunity to ask
questions or obtain additional information in realtime
through your Web site—regardless of their geographi-
cal location or time of day.
Speed has always been a value in business; the cen-
trality and level of speed in the Digital Age, however,
is so great as to constitute a qualitative transformation
fromthetraditionaleconomy.Speedisacentralcharac-
teristicoftheconnectedeconomybecauseitallowspar-

119

S O U R C E B O O K
which the information flows from the reporters to the
press and then to the newsstand is very slow. On the
other hand, on the Internet you can immediately view
up-to-the-minute news and information.
Here, too, you need to think of how best to leverage
speed and satisfy your clients’ needs for instant gratifi-
cation. As the pace of contemporary economic and
social life accelerates, consumers expect the same
from their service providers. Your business must pro-
vide customers with what they need in the shortest
amount of time possible.
In order to transform to and take advantage of the
online marketplace, then, your most obvious strategic
options for transforming your business to the con-
nected economy are to capitalize on and excel in one
of these key areas. That is, you need to differentiate
yourself in the interactivity component of your e-
business, or excel in the speed of your delivery or
other dealings with your customers, or specialize in
the simplicity of your Web site and user interface and
other forms of connectivity.
TRANSFORMING A STRATEGY OR
OPERATION
The key to a successful transformation of your
business is to understand that you will always operate
in a competitive environment. As a result, you must
first consider your competition before deciding on the
tactics of your transformation, and base your transfor-
mation strategy on this context of a constantly compet-
itive environment. This may seem obvious, but it’s
crucial to keep in mind, as your optimal transformation
strategy as conceived in a vacuum may put you at a
competitive disadvantage in the short run, thereby
rendering your overall strategy useless.
Begin by identifying and prioritizing your competi-
tors, and then analyze them and define your competi-
tive advantage in relation to your competitive set. A
competitive set is a collection of your top competi-
tors—only those possessing the greatest influence on
your target market.
The main purpose of this analysis is to identify
and pinpoint the elements you can leverage to make
your operation different from the operations of your
competitive set on your road to transforming your
enterprise for the e-commerce environment. This pro-
cess includes three stages: listing all your competitors
in their order of rank in your market; defining all
those factors that have an impact on your market in
their order of influence; scoring each competitor, as
well as yourself, in each category.
In the course of this analysis, you will beging to
delineate your strengths and weaknesses relative to
those of your competitors, and thus the broad areas
in which you can begin to eke out a competitive

advantage in your transformation strategy will begin
to emerge.
For instance, if you discover that none of your
competitors is particularly strong on the interactivity
portion of the online competitive environment, then
your obvious strategy is to focus your transformation
strategy around building quality interactivity with
your customers, and strongly promoting this differ-
ence from your competitive set to your target market.

USING PRINT MEDIA TO SUPPORT
ONLINE MEDIA
While establishing an online presence is perhaps
the most crucial and obvious step toward building
a profitable e-commerce business, you should also
consider using print media to attract business. Relying
too much on the online medium can seriously hinder
your firm’s ability to draw new customers and take
advantage of all available opportunities to generate
business. Avoiding traditional media, such as print,
can lead to tremendous lost potential. Moreover, if
you don’t move to capitalize on this advertising chan-
nel, your competitors may, and could edge you out
of the market in the process.
Now that the dot-com craze is over, and customers,
businesses, and investors alike are looking for compre-
hensive, integrated business models, your firm might
benefit from print media support. No matter how es-
tablished your brands, stitching together your online
presence and a traditional print campaign to advertise
your site is crucial to bringing in new online customers
and building brand presence.
Technology can help you get the most out of your
content, whether in print or online. Extensible markup
language (XML), the lingua franca of e-commerce,
is perfect in this regard, because it acts as a meta
language that instructs machines how to interpret data
in different contexts. So information generated with
XML coding can be easily reformatted to suit online
media, such as e-mail and your Web site, and print
media in all its formats.
Once you decide to use print media to promote
your firm, you are faced with a dizzying array of
choices. It’s up to you to figure out which options
best suit your firm’s purposes and budget. Print media
options range from newpaper and magazine advertise-
ments to direct-mailing campaigns to mail-order cat-
alogs.
For each kind of print media campaign, there are
numerous considerations, and each must be aligned
to accomplish your firm’s goals. To begin with, you
must have a clear understanding of your target audi-
ence: What kinds of media are they likely to use
frequently and respond to? Will the cost of reaching
one demographic group through medium X outweigh
the cost of attracting another demographic through
medium Y? How important is each demographic
group to your long-term sales? Where can you cut
costs, and where is it best to spare no expense? Should
you produce glossy brochures for a direct-mailing
campaign, or will your particular target audience re-
spond equally well to a simple text letter that points
to your more comprehensive and interactive Web site?
In other words, you must determine what is required
to reel customers into your Web site, where the focus
of your business is.
Another consideration is to be sure to maintain
seamless compatibility of information between your
online and print media channels. This is done best
when both your online information and your print
channels originate via common databases and text
programs. That way, you only need to format them
for their different channels after the fact. The main
difference, of course, is that print can’t be changed
on a moment’s notice like your Web site can. Thus,
it’s crucial that any print media support does just that:
it must support the online medium by referencing and
pointing readers to your online site, where the most
up-to-date, interactive, and useful data can be found.
This seamless integration of your online and print
media channels is known as channel harmony. That
is, you bring your various outreach and sales channels
into a symbiotic relationship by systematizing them
and making them, effectively, communicate with each
other for the customer’s benefit.
All things being equal, you’re best off trying to
steer customers garnered through a print channel, such
as a catalog, to your Web site to make their purchases,
if only because processing orders via the Web is much

cheaper than with call centers and paper forms. More-
over, since e-commerce is your business, your print
media should try to encourage customers to take ad-
vantage of your online storefront, the heart of your
operations, while still trying to draw in as many new
customers via print as possible.
In catalogs, especially, it’s important to vigorously
promote your Web site. Simply appending your site
address and an e-mail address to the pages isn’t
enough. If you want to drive customers to your Web
site, it’s vital that you give them a reason. This could
involve entire pages devoted to advertising just the
Web site itself, showcasing the offerings that await
customers online and providing instructions on how
to place orders over the Web. You should explain
the advantages of using the Web and provide other
information that highlights the unique character and
importance of your Web site.
Still, you don’t want to go through all the trouble
of creating print media only to sell it short. Some
customers prefer to make purchases offline, and for
them your print media should stand on its own. This
is particularly true of catalogs. While touting your
Web site, you don’t want to defeat the purpose of
having a catalog to begin. You should take steps to
outfit your organization to handle mail and call-center
orders from the catalog or other print media as required
in order to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.

VOICE COMMERCE
A system of advanced speech technology, voice
commerce (or v-commerce) lets computers understand
and respond to natural human speech via telephone.
Essentially a ‘‘voice Web page’’ used in tandem with
Internet Web sites, v-commerce uses speech recogni-
tion technology to allow customers to interact with a
business’ Web site to place orders, check status, or
121
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
obtain information by simply speaking into the tele-
phone. These technologies also allow callers to access
e-mail, traffic information, news, sports scores, stock
prices, and travel information, putting Web-based in-
formation in the hands of customers anytime, any-
where.
These systems, called voice portals or ‘‘vortals,’’
are attractive to businesses wanting to save on labor
costs and improve customer service. By using these
systems, call center staffing can be reduced by direct-
ing calls to the interactive voice portal, a system whose
accuracy rivaled that of human agents by 2002. Effi-
ciency is also increased; voice applications’ direct
integration into a company’s Web site eliminates the
need for separate databases, and numerous calls may
be handled simultaneously, increasing call volume
while reducing customer attrition through lengthy on-
hold times.
What sets v-commerce apart from general e-com-
merce is customers’ use of mobile phones. By 2005,
over 45 million American cell phone owners will
access voice portals regularly, predicts the Kelsey
Group, a new economy research and analysis organi-
zation. For instance, a customer with a computer,
Internet connection, and landline phone might choose
the computer to access a company’s Web site. But
once the same client is out of the office, Internet
accessibility is largely available via wireless devices
like palmtop computers and cell phones with text
messaging. But since these devices are inappropriate
for use while driving, and their tiny screens and minis-
cule touch pads are difficult to maneuver, v-commerce
has emerged as a logical market.
Despite its high-tech applications, v-commerce can
also target low-tech customers. Customers with no
Internet access at all can telephone familiar businesses
like Amazon.com, opening a new customer base to
online companies. The systems can even be accessed
by old-style pulse phones that do not generate touch
tones. Consumers in this sector benefiting from speech
recognition technology include the elderly, children,
drivers, and the blind and otherwise disabled as well
as travelers separated from their computers.
Although many voice portals are merely an addi-
tion to a company’s sales platforms (store, catalog,
and Web site), others rely on advertising for support.
Some voice portals offer advertisers ‘‘per-hit,’’ fee-
based audio spots, charging higher rates to target spe-
cific audiences. For accurate billing, the voice portal
must install the capability to count the number of hits
for each three-to-five second spot.
Simple voice recognition systems have been in
place for many years. American Airlines and United
Airlines use speech recognition to convey flight arrival
times. Sears uses speech recognition to connect callers

S O U R C E B O O K
to the right department without delay; its system han-
dles 200,000 calls daily and paid for itself in 90 days.
Other systems include more complex, interactive
services. Office Depot’s v-commerce number takes
orders over the phone, recording quantity and color
for future orders; the company reports that 5 percent
of its retail catalog sales are handled through speech
recognition at an average savings of 88 percent per
call.
In addition to taking orders, voice portals can also
facilitate delivery, return, and exchange. In the case
of United Parcel Service, voice recognition handles
half of its incoming calls at up to 90 seconds faster
than calls with human interaction. These v-commerce
interactions include order placement, issue and review
of tracking numbers, and product availability.
Another service-oriented application involves au-
tomated oil-change reminder calls for clients who
agree to participate. Jiffy Lube’s two-way phone sys-
tem lets customers tell the computer to connect them
to a service center, send the reminder to their home,
or even shop for the company’s products. Since many
provide their cell numbers, they are likely to receive
the call in their cars, allowing them to confirm the
timing for an oil change with their mileage.
V-commerce technology has evolved rapidly, im-
proving on some familiar interactive telephone tech-
nologies. Interactive voice response (IVR) systems,
in which customers respond to voice prompts using
push button touch tones, force customers to wade
through layers of voice menus to find information. But
with the addition of Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) engines, IVRs can bypass touch tones in favor
of vocal recognition and communication.
Voice commerce comprises three technologies.
With speech recognition, the caller’s words are trans-
formed to text, while text-to-speech (TTS) translates
written words to speech. Using speech recognition,
customer commands are input as text, as if the client
were interacting with the Web site via computer key-
board. The computer then answers customer queries
by converting its text response into audible speech.
Lastly, speech authentication can identify individual
callers by ‘‘listening’’ to their unique voices, eliminat-
ing the need for Personal Identification Numbers
(PINs) or passwords.
Although ASRs use complex algorithms to trans-
late mispronunciations and mumbles, problems still
affected speech recognition in 2002. These included
background noise from cell phones, confusion over
homonyms, echo, traffic noise, sudden noise activat-
ing speech recognition, and unusual user accents.
However, ‘‘barge-in’’ technologies have developed
that allow callers to speak over outbound voice
prompts, while speech-enabled scripting languages
like VoiceXML are starting to extend Internet capabil-
ities to the telephone by creating audio dialogue.
Companies can opt for multilingual speech applica-
tions for regional populations—Spanish services for
large Hispanic communities in New York, Florida,
Texas, California, and Puerto Rico, for example.
These technologies are expanding internationally,
with numerous systems operating in Scandinavian
countries,
Italy,
France,
Germany,
and
Central
America. Development of a new language ASR engine
requires data from about two thousand native speak-
ers, while a new TTS platform translates text to speech
by using significant data from just one speaker.
Some larger Internet companies—Yahoo.com,
America Online, and Priceline.com—have developed
their own voice portals. America Online bought its
own voice portal company (Quack.com) to develop
the AOL by Phone service, which provides Web-based
telephone e-mail and news headlines. But others find
it more efficient to outsource, purchasing voice portal
development and maintenance services from compa-
nies like BeVocal, TellMe, NetByTel, HeyAnita, and
VocalPoint Technologies.

WEB PORTALS
By the year 2000 portals had evolved from directo-
ries and search engines that helped people find places
on the Internet to sites that offered their own content
and services. They were attracting large numbers of
visitors, which made them attractive to advertisers
and to merchants seeking to sell online. Media Metrix
reported 47 million unique visitors to Yahoo!, 39 mil-
lion to MSN, and 31 million to America Online in
June 2000. In terms of online shopping, the top portal
shopping site in June 2000 was Yahoo! Shopping, with
5.8 million unique home-based visitors, according to
Nielsen/NetRatings. AOL’s Shopping Channel drew
more than 3.4 million unique visitors, slightly more
than 4 percent of all Internet users. Other popular
shopping portals in mid-2000 included AltaVista, with
2.6 million unique visitors, and The Microsoft Net-
work’s (MSN’s) shopping section, with 1.2 million
unique visitors. Portal features such as specialized
search engines and the ability to comparison shop
were cited as reasons for attracting online shoppers.
Large online retailers were able to gain access to
portals’ audiences through banner ads, affiliate pro-
grams that linked to their sites, and storefronts set up
within the portals’ boundaries. Some e-tailers were
spending as much as $20 million in six months to
advertise on the major Internet portals. Others paid
large sums to become preferred vendors at the larger
portals.
Smaller retailers could also participate through
storefront business models made popular by Yahoo!
Shopping, which attracted small business e-tailers.
These models made it possible for small businesses
to establish a retail presence on the Web. Other sites
offering online storefronts to smaller merchants in-
cluded Amazon.com, with its Z-shops, and the now-
defunct Excite’s Freetailer storefront service.
The dot-com shakeout of 2000 caused many e-
tailers and portals to terminate or renegotiate their
arrangements. With statistics showing that non-portal
referrals accounted for a much higher percentage of
merchant sales than referrals from America Online,
Yahoo!, and other portals, the major portals began
upgrading their shopping destinations in mid-2000.
Yahoo! added a My Shopping personalization feature;
MSN redesigned and relaunched its eShops destina-
tion; and AOL added a Quick Checkout feature.
123
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
Reports of online shopping during the 2000 holiday
season indicated that portals and online shopping
malls posted higher growth rates than individual e-
tailers. AOL reported an 84 percent increase to $2.5
billion in holiday sales over the previous year, while
Yahoo! and Lycos said their sales doubled. Individual
e-tailers, on the other hand, had an average growth
rate of 40 percent, according to the Yankee Group.
The Yankee Group also found that 57 percent of
online consumers begin their online shopping trips at
a portal or a portal-based mall. To reinforce their
image as the place to begin online shopping, portals
were developing a critical mass of goods and services.
To be successful in the long run, portals needed to
attract well-known brand e-tailers. At the time it was
recognized that specialty brand name e-tailers as a
group were generating more sales online than portals.
While a February 2001 study based on 2000 data
by Booz-Allen & Hamilton found that nearly 98 per-
cent of all U.S. Internet users had visited a portal,
they only spent 2 percent of their time at a portal
engaged in shopping. In terms of time spent at portals,
users spent an average of one hour and thirty-one
minutes per month engaged in shopping activities at
portals, compared to four hours and forty-one minutes
searching at portals.
PORTALS FACED CHALLENGES
In 2001 portals, like other Internet sites, were fac-
ing steep drops in advertising revenue. A March 2001
study by Consumer Reports Online suggested that
portals were not efficiently transforming Web surfers
into shoppers. The study rated Yahoo! above average
but found that other portals, including AltaVista, Sho-
p@AOL, and Excite@Home’s Shopping, were too
confusing and poorly organized. The Consumer Re-
ports findings were backed up by another study from
Forrester Research, which found that online shoppers
rarely went to intermediary sites to help them find
what they wanted. As a result, Forrester predicted that
there would be a shakeout among shopping intermedi-
aries. The research firm forecast that portals would
evolve into e-commerce brokers by 2005, offering
retailers a selling platform that would enable mer-
chants to reach, convert, and provide services to more
customers.
Portals were seen as being less effective, too, as
Internet users became more sophisticated and savvy.
Many Internet brands were becoming well-known
household names, making it easier for online shoppers
to bypass search engines and portals. Still, consultants
were recommending that online merchants incorporate
portals into their marketing strategy. AOL and MSN
were still effectively driving millions of Internet users
to e-commerce sites. Portals were especially effective

E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
in the case of first-time Internet buyers, whose num-
bers were growing.
Retailers hoping to profit from affiliating with por-
tals were advised to select partners that had the scale,
service, and speed required to offer innovations for
consumers. That meant affiliating with major portals
such as AOL, MSN, and Yahoo! rather than with
comparison shopping sites, product review sites, and
smaller portals. The ability of major portals to attract
traffic was supported by a mid-2001 study by Jupiter
Media Metrix, which found that four Web sites—
AOL, Yahoo!, MSN, and Napster—accounted for
more than half of all time spent online by U.S. Internet
users. A similar study by Nielsen/NetRatings found
that one in three Americans visited a portal site every
day, giving portals an audience reach of more than
92 percent.
During the 2001 shopping season, it appeared that
portals and Internet shopping malls were attracting a
larger share of online shoppers than major e-tailers.
Nielsen/NetRatings reported that shopping sites at
portals attracted 36 million visitors in one week during
the holiday shopping season, compared to 35 million
attracted to individual online retailers. While portals
often forwarded traffic to independent retailers, they
also offered shoppers the chance to compare prices
and selections from different merchants. They also
offered access to many smaller retailers that otherwise
would not have been able to maintain a presence on
the Web.

WEB RINGS
The networked universe of e-commerce offers
businesses endless opportunities for interconnecting
and sharing commercial relationships. Web rings are
Internet-based commercial relationships in which
companies, groups, individuals, consumers, or other
common interests are linked together via a succession
of inter-referencing Web sites.
Web rings share a common theme among their
participating sites. They pool the interest in individual
sites for the common good of all participating sites.
For instance, a database-software Web ring might link
together companies, researchers, and others for the
common benefit of all members. Users of the sites
also benefit by gaining access to a wider collection
of information on whatever topic the sites cover.
Companies in e-commerce turn to Web rings to
help build emerging industries, attract new customers,
and forge business relationships and strategic partner-
ships. If you decide to participate in a Web ring, it
carries the added benefit of drawing finely targeted
visitors to your site, because users traveling through
the ring are more likely to be interested in your offer-
ings than the average Internet surfer.
Web rings can thus simplify subject searches on
the Internet, making searches more efficient and less
subject to trial and error. Rather than forcing users to
wade through hundreds of sites to find the handful that
actually pertains to their interest, Web rings interlock
many of those sites together, so that users, once they
find their way into the ring, can simply skip from one
relevant site to another. Web rings thus constitute their
own small Internet of subject-specific Web sites.
HOW WEB RINGS WORK
Web rings usually have as their starting point a
ring home page, which explains what the ring is about,
when and why it was created, a description of how
the ring works, an explanation of the ring’s basic rules
and requirements, a copy of the navigation bar, and
instructions for interested sites that wish to join.

A site’s Web ring affiliation is typically marked
by an icon and navigation bar at the bottom of its
pages. Sites agree to include a common navigation
bar in order to create consistent and equitable linking
between all member sites. The navigation bar, pro-
vided to members as a standard HTML fragment, can
be downloaded from the ring’s home page or requested
from the ring master. The HTML fragment might
include links such as ‘‘Next,’’ which takes users to
the site following yours in the ring; ‘‘Previous,’’
which links to the site preceding yours; ‘‘Random,’’
which leaps to any site on the ring as determined
randomly by the ring master’s computer; and ‘‘Next
5’’ and ‘‘Previous 5,’’ which displays a list of the
next or last five sites in the ring so users can select
only those they think will be most useful.
YOUR WEB RING STRATEGY
Creating a Web ring is fairly easy. You can begin
one from scratch by directly contacting owners of
other sites. With their collaboration, you can decide
how you want to set up the ring, what other firms or
groups you want to join, what the purpose of the ring
should be, and what rules ring members are to follow.
Alternatively, a number of Web-ring specialty sites
popped up in the late 1990s and early 2000s, offering
a set of established formats and tools for devising a
new Web ring, registering it, and reaching out to
others. At first, Web-ring specialty sites simply lived
off advertising revenue while offering their Web ring
services for free. By the early 2000s, however, com-
petitive pressures had caused the sector to change its
tactics, and currently most such sites offer value-added
services, including e-commerce solutions, along with
their Web-ring hosting, set-up, and maintenance ser-
vices.
Web rings are controlled, monitored, and main-
tained by a ring master, who is responsible for the
overall look and feel of the ring. This involves estab-
lishing and enforcing rules for participation, such as
adhering to professional standards and maintaining
courtesy toward other members of the ring. The ring
master ensures that all ring applicant sites adequately
relate to the ring’s subject, sees to it that the site installs
that ring’s code and navigation scheme correctly, and
accepts, rejects, and revokes membership as he or she
sees fit. In addition, the ring master is charged with
setting up the navigation scheme of the ring, determin-
ing the order of sites in the ring and devising an overall
image and navigation bar for use by all members.
Setting up your own ring and acting as its ring master,
then, gives you the greatest degree of control over the
ring’s evolution and operation, but it also entails more
time and energy.
Initially, getting other sites to join your Web ring
will involve seeking out prospective sites, contacting
125

them, explaining your ideas, and providing them infor-
mation on how to join. A well-designed Web ring,
however, will usually see such work diminish over
time, as the ring takes on a life of its own. As word
spreads around the Internet, new sites should seek to
join of their own volition.

WEB SITE DESIGN
In the late 1990s, companies all of kinds began to
develop Web sites to advertise their products, to build
brand recognition, and to sell their products. In some
cases they hired a Web design expert to oversee the
process, and in other cases they simply farmed the
project out to a Web development firm. To make the
Web site design and development process as easy as
possible, software companies like Adobe and Mac-
romedia began to develop comprehensive Web site
design programs. As a result, a growing number of
businesses began to develop their own Web sites with-
out hiring internal specialists or outsourcing the proj-
ect. Entrepreneurs planning to launch an online ven-
ture need to consider carefully which option is best
for them.
Outsourcing the project to a Web design firm is
certainly the path of least resistance for most small
businesses. In many cases, you can use a single com-
pany to host, design, and manage your Web site. For
example, Colorado-based Verio Inc. is a leading Web
hosting company that also offers customized Web
solutions, including design services, to businesses of
all kinds. Digital Work Inc. also offers both hosting
and design services at prices ranging from $34.95 per
month to $194.95 per month, depending on the options
you choose. Some companies charge an initial set-up
fee ranging from $1,500 to $5,000 for a basic Web
page and then levy a monthly fee for hosting services.
CHOOSING A WEB DESIGNER
Choosing a Web designer can be difficult due to
the sheer number of companies and individuals offer-
ing such services. Webdesign.thelist.com offers an

online database of Web designers that you can search
by services, name, or location. Also, if you find a
Web site you like and you want to know who built
it, you can use Whobuiltit.com, which maintains a
database of 44,000 Web sites, including information
about who designed each. Entrepreneur columnist
Melissa Campanelli recommends doing your home-
work before selecting a designer: ‘‘Check out a list
of the sites the company’s worked on and look closely
at its own site. Ask about arrangements for main-
taining the site, and make sure your new designer is
interested in your company and its goals.’’ For exam-
ple, if your goal is to grow traffic significantly within
a few months of your site’s launch, your designer
should be able to tell you how this will impact your
site’s performance and what steps you can take to
maximize bandwidth. Keeping goals in mind during
the design and development process can eliminate
many future problems.
WEB DESIGN SOFTWARE
While most experts agree that large, complex Web
sites are best left to professional designers, many do
acknowledge that small-business owners can design
their own successful sites. According to a September
2001 issue of E-Commerce Times, regardless of
whether a company chooses to hire a Web developer
or design its own site, it is vital that it carefully plan
the site’s layout, content, and security features. If you
decide that you are not interested in paying somebody
else to design your site, be it another company or a
specialist you hire as an employee, you’ll need to
purchase your own Web design software. You can
expect to pay about $300 for popular programs such
as Dreamweaver by Macromedia, which also offers
online training for an additional $100, or pGoLive by
Adobe.
Once you’ve become comfortable with your Web
design software, you’ll need to begin planning your
site’s organization. Many analysts caution against un-
derestimating the importance of this, pointing out that
the structure of the information is as important as the
information itself. Visitors who cannot find what they
want quickly and easily are likely to simply go else-
where. To find an effective and appealing organiza-
tional structure, it might prove worthwhile to examine
rival Web sites.
Along with the organization and placement of tex-
tual information, you must also decide what types of
graphic and audio enhancements you will use on your
site. Keep in mind that many Internet users have dated
PCs that might be overwhelmed by too many high-
tech enhancements. If you’re determined to include
multiple graphics and/or audio features on your site,
you can also offer visitors the choice to view your
site in HTML only. Some experts recommend using
images under 12KB in size to allow all users to load
them quickly. Business Start-Ups writer Karen Solo-
mon recommends that designers ‘‘trim the fat off
graphics, animations, blinking text, dancing babies
and smiley faces that serve no purpose other than
looking cool.’’ Solomon also advises against using
front door pages and reminds designers to clean up
obsolete links and to be sure that photographs are
saved in the JPEG format, while graphics are saved
as GIF files. This type of design maintenance can help
improve site performance.
TEST AND TWEAK
Finally, once your initial design is completed, it
is important to test your site from as many different
computers as possible. You want to be sure that indi-
viduals with different Web browsers and different
connection types can access your site as you intended.
You can also ask friends and family members for
feedback on how easy your site is to navigate and
how appealing it is to view. As with most online tasks,
be prepared to continually tweak your site’s design
to meet the evolving needs of your customers.

WEB SITE INTERACTIVITY
At its essence, interactivity is the level of meaning-
ful interaction between a company and its users via
the firm’s Web site. A highly interactive Web site
gives users opportunities for effective communication
with the company, often allowing virtual conversa-
tions or data transmissions to occur in real time. This
way, customers can have a satisfying experience deal-
ing with your company regardless of the constraints
of distance or time. In an interactive environment,
one-directional, static information gives way to a more

fluid model, where user participation actively modif-
ies the form and content of the information presented.
As competitive pressures in e-commerce mount,
customers expect efficient and seamless interactivity
at your virtual storefront. Sites that make customers
feel like they have communicated effectively with the
company are more likely to build customer loyalty
over time.
THE INTERACTIVE BUSINESS MODEL
In general, the more interactive a Web site, the
more it fulfills the Internet’s potential as a communica-
tions medium. The Internet surpasses other media,
such as print and television, because it can not only
disseminate information about your company, but it
can also move beyond the one-way conduit of infor-
mation to create a comprehensive virtual meeting
place. In this virtual space you can interact with your
customers directly, taking advantage of powerful tele-
communications developments, while also providing
instant access to a storehouse of valuable information.
Incorporating these two features—two-way communi-
cation and data management—is the foundation of
interactive Web sites. It can also be a key to drawing
customers to your site, boosting their loyalty to your
firm, and reaching optimal efficiency within your e-
commerce business.
Interactivity means leaping beyond the basics of
HTML. While hyperlinks and e-mail are forms of
interactivity, today’s Web shopper has come to de-
mand much more. Interactivity can be as simple as
normal Web-based forms, which are often used to
complete orders or compile electronic profiles of your
customers. Live customer support Customer service,
live is another increasingly important component of
Web site interactivity.
Customer service strategies in the e-commerce era,
in particular, demand interactivity. Providing a wealth
of information for your customers is essential, but not
enough. You need to give your customers effective
and easy ways to communicate with you, so their
precise concerns are addressed quickly. E-mail and
Web forms are the most widely used methods of inter-
active customer service, and such customer submis-
sions should be answered immediately with an auto-
matic-response confirmation message, assuring the
customer that their query was received and that some-
one will answer them shortly.
A value-added way to provide interactive customer
service is to create a central space where customers
can help each other. One useful method is to put user
forums on your site, where they can simply log on
and share their concerns with others who can provide
their own feedback. Postings can be classified and
127
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
subdivided dynamically as your customers’ needs dic-
tate. Generally, these forums are moderated by some-
one in your firm, who can provide input where neces-
sary while also gauging customers’ attitudes towards
your company. If you use this information to make
improvements, you can provide better service overall.
This method is particularly valuable in that it capital-
izes on existing customer relationships at minimal
cost.
TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF
INTERACTIVITY
However, while building interactivity is often de-
sirable, even necessary, it’s important to remember
that not every Web surfer enjoys access to the latest
technologies. So while your designers may feel
tempted to include interactive applications with the
latest bells and whistles, you need to keep the needs
of basic users in mind. High-tech interactivity won’t
succeed if you wind up alienating a significant portion
of your potential customer base that can’t utilize those
tools. There are a few ways around this problem. First,
you can create separate links on your home page
pointing users to one of multiple Web sites you’ve
created geared toward different technological capabil-
ities. Second, you can provide a text-only version of
your site, which works in a similar manner but in this
case bypasses graphical interfaces altogether, so that
users can opt for just the information they want with-
out waiting for excessively long download periods.
And third, depending on the technology you’re using,
you may be able to detect the user’s capabilities and
automatically direct them to a suitable version of
your pages.
Interactivity extends to your company’s internal
processes as well. For instance, as requests and ques-
tions are coming in, they need to go somewhere in the
firm in an organized fashion so they can be processed
quickly. Your visitors will no doubt be frustrated if
they take time to use your interactive forms, but never
get a timely response. Routing is a simple practice of
organizing and distributing incoming messages ac-
cording to their characteristics. For instance, if the
incoming data is a customer-service query, it probably
should be routed directly to customer-service staff.
Alternatively, an order submission may be routed si-
multaneously to your shipping department and to ac-
counts receivable or billing. No matter how you
choose to organize your business, and regardless of its
size, routing incoming interactions to their appropriate
handlers ensures faster response time. This should
diminish internal confusion, improve customer satis-
faction, and eliminate wasted time and energy.

WEB SITE LIFE CYCLES AND
MAINTENANCE
Similar to any piece of software, Web sites follow
a series of phases in their so-called ‘‘usable lives.’’
For e-commerce sites, the nature of those lives is also
changing based on increasingly nuanced marketing
objectives laid out for them. A typical site life cycle
starts with basic planning and design, and ends with
up-keep and administration. Below are some of the
most common steps:
T
Planning and requirements gathering
T
Preliminary design and specification
T
Detailed design and coding
T
Testing and revision
T
Launch
T
Maintenance and upgrades
From this list, you might assume that the planning
through launching steps consume the most time and
resources; for many sites, however, maintenance and
regular updates are central to their effectiveness and
receive ample attention. The best life cycle plans take
into account the site’s ongoing maintenance needs
after the initial launch. One estimate is that mainte-
nance requires about 20 percent of the initial develop-
ment costs. Web users, much like newspaper or maga-
zine readers, often expect continually refreshed
content. Ultimately, if the business needs for the site—
like driving traffic and generating sales—change con-
siderably over time, the site may require a redesign and
relaunch. Ideally, life cycle planning also considers
market and technology signals that suggest when a
site’s useful life is limited.
Web watchers commonly cite an evolutionary path
for the kinds of sites companies launch. The first and
simplest of these are called brochureware, essentially
static non-interactive pages that are posted once and
then left alone. The next stage is more like a magazine
or small online community, providing basic interac-
tion and periodic updates, while more advanced sites
incorporate interactive applications, perhaps for on-
line transactions or other customer needs. The most
sophisticated sites are a complicated, user-specific
conglomeration of content and applications originat-
ing in diverse locations and presented as a seamless
yet dynamic interface.
While these models can help place you on a general
continuum, keeping your site current can mean many
different things depending on your content, your cli-
ents, your competitors. Certainly, on a national news
site, visitors expect the content to be refreshed every
few hours, if not minutes. For a local news site, that
standard might be slwoed to include just daily updates.
Some Web consultants recommend that smaller sites
be updated at least once a quarter in order to maintain
a sense of fresh content and keep the site’s visual
material current. Others say monthly or weekly is
more appropriate. With some exceptions, sites that
haven’t had a graphic overhaul within one to two
years may be perceived by end-users as looking out-
dated due to technology changes.
One way to organize updates and maintenance ac-
tivity is to create a maintenance plan. There is no set
form the plan should take, but some get fairly formal
and lead to content management systems. Either way,
the purpose is to begin serious thinking about the
ongoing requirements of operating the site. The re-
quirements may be technical, such as how to support
increasing traffic loads, or strategic, such as how to
make the site the top performer in its category—
and keep it there. Planning also needs to account
for logistical issues like personnel hours needed to
maintain the site.
More elaborate sites usually have back-end mainte-
nance tools built in so that content specialists at the
company, say, marketing staff, can readily change text
and images in predefined places on the site without
requiring a programmer’s intervention. These content
management systems store site information in data-
bases and often include a user interface customized
for the particular needs of the company. They also
provide support for advanced problems like version
control, ensuring there is clear documentation of what
is the currently approved content versus previous con-
tent or work in progress.
Not all maintenance is aimed at making sites more
complex, however. In the late 1990s and early 2000s,
as Flash and other multimedia technologies gained
sway, many well-funded sites rushed to include bits
of animation and sound. No doubt some visitors were
impressed with their technical prowess, but many Web
users insist on practical, useful features instead of

those that merely waste time and clog bandwidth.
Some of the largest sites have learned to design their
sites ‘‘down,’’ focusing on the quality and efficiency
of the user experience. This movement includes a
heavy emphasis on intuitive user interfaces and sim-
ple, informative designs. The idea is to hone the site for
the particular needs of its main visitors—and possibly
customize it for each one.
As with site development and hosting, maintenance
and life cycle management can be outsourced to spe-
cialty firms. Often, if an outside team develops the
site, they will include a bid for ongoing maintenance
as well. Many Web consultants believe outsourcing
is a wise approach because it greatly increases the
likelihood the work will get done. Often times, special-
ists also have skills and inside knowledge that allows
them to do a better job than a company could do on
its own.
Of course, some maintenance is more technical in
nature and, as such, doesn’t involve content or cur-
rency. A common problem, with small sites in particu-
lar, may occur up when the site operator assumes it
will work continuously without interruption. As server
addresses and other system features change, the site
may become saddled with broken links and haphazard
functions. Browser upgrades can change the way
pages display and functions execute, as well. Web
site operators need methods of keeping their services
up and the existing functions working. Along with
third-party service vendors, developers can create test-
ing and monitoring tools for making sure the site is
operating properly.

WEB SITE USABILITY
Because online customers place a premium on
speed and convenience, Web site usability is an abso-
lute must for the e-commerce entrepreneur. No matter
how well thought-out your Web design, no matter
how savvy your marketing scheme, no matter how
sophisticated your technologies, and no matter how
useful your products and services, if your customers
129
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
find your Web site cumbersome, slow, or too advanced
for their equipment, you won’t manage to grow a
successful e-commerce enterprise. Customers in the
fast-paced, high-expectation Internet economy are no-
toriously fickle, and won’t show much loyalty to a
company that doesn’t take care to implement a usable
Web site.
A brief usability checklist would ask the following
questions:
T
Is the site user-friendly, with a logical order and
page layout that allows for easy navigation?
T
Do all the links work as expected? Do all the pages
on the Web site load quickly and without errors?
T
Is the customer able to find everything she is look-
ing for?
T
Are the advanced tools, including shopping carts
and registration and order forms, functioning
smoothly?
T
In general, then, does the site do what you intend?
And can your customers figure it out instantly?
You must approach usability from the standpoints
of page design, site design, and content design,
and ensure that each of these most fully exempli-
fies and complements what you are trying to com-
municate and the Web experience you want to
provide.
Studies find that Web users will wait an average
of eight seconds for a Web page to load before giving
up and heading for another site. In addition, customers
tend to remember which sites they found problematic
and unusable, and can be unforgiving; those compa-
nies lacking usable Web sites thus run the risk of
losing interested online customers forever. Forrester
Research found that 27 percent of all Web transactions
were abandoned before the purchase was completed,
usually because of cumbersome ordering processes or
technical problems. BizRate.com, meanwhile, re-
ported that 75 percent of the respondents to their
survey abandoned their online shopping carts before
completing a purchase.
MAKING YOUR SITE USABLE
Knowledge of your customer base and their techni-
cal capabilities is the first requirement in designing a
usable Web site. It’s crucial to keep in mind that your
customers’ capabilities, not those of your firm, should
drive your design. It does no good to implement so-
phisticated design if your customers can’t use it easily.
Therefore, your site design must be implemented with
the lowest-end users in mind; it must take into consid-
eration customers who have the oldest browsers, slow-
est Internet connections, and so on. So, for instance,
‘‘How To’’ Topics in E-Commerce

130
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
while designers may wish to showcase complex inter-
active graphics, low-end users with limited connectiv-
ity speeds may find that such graphics take an impossi-
bly long time to load, and abandon the site altogether.
You must therefore consider a cost-benefit analysis,
and decide whether the more sophisticated design is
worth the potential business lost.
One of the simplest steps your firm can take to
improve the usability of your site is to provide a forum
on your site for users to supply their feedback about
their experience on your site, and then use those sug-
gestions to further tailor the site to your customers’
needs. This carries the dual benefit of streamlining
your site’s overall usability while also potentially im-
proving your relations with your customers by seeking
out their input and incorporating customer suggestions
into your firm’s operations.
Usability also encompasses how the information
on your site is organized, and how easy it is for the
user to navigate through your site and find what he
or she is looking for. The information architecture of
your site, then, is a key component of your site’s
usability. When a user visits your site, for example,
you should make it possible for them to find exactly
what they’re looking for in as few clicks as possible,
preferably without ever having to backtrack in their
browsing. Your home page should be easily digestible,
and the steps the user needs to take towards his or
her final destination should be immediately obvious.
Before you take your site live, it’s advisable to
do usability testing. Your designers should test your
company’s site on both Macintosh computers and PCs,
as well as successive generations of the major Web
browsers, as slight variations in configurations and
readings between the systems and software can cause
pages to look and function differently, and you must
be sure that on each computer your message appears
as you intend.
In the testing stage, it is best to view the site as
objectively as possible. More accurately, it should be
viewed from the perspective of a customer, possibly
meaning bringing in a focus group of outside users
to wade through the site, monitoring their progress
and digesting their feedback. This group of test users
should be a cross-section of your customer base, and
individual profiles of those users and their progress
in the testing phase should be carefully documented
so that, in the final design phase before taking the site
live, you are able to accommodate as many potential
customers and users as possible.

XML AND METADATA
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a language
designed to make Web-based documents easy to cre-
ate, manage, translate, and transfer via the Internet.
Essentially, XML is a metalanguage, which means
that it describes other languages. In the case of Web-
based documents, XML defines a simplified version
of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML),
an international standard for text markup systems that
had previously proven too complex for mainstream
use. When applied to databases, XML facilitates the
exchange of data between different computer systems
by defining different data structures in such as way
that they are not tied to any particular programming
language. To facilitate such an exchange, XML docu-
ments contain both data and metadata, language that
describes the data. Because it is extensible, XML is not
tied to a fixed format like hypertext markup language
(HTML), which uses specific codes, or tags, to tell
the different pieces of a Web site what to do. Instead,
XML allows users to design their own markup lan-
guages, while also ensuring the compatibility of text
and data between different applications and different
organizations.
Improving compatibility between different types
of company information has been a goal of many
technology companies for quite some time. In fact,
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) technology was
developed as a solution to this problem. However,
many analysts point out that EDI is simply too expen-
sive for most small and mid-sized businesses and too
limited for large enterprises. A May 2002 issue of
Computer Weekly describes XML as ‘‘a kind of Elec-
tronic Data Interchange for all.’’
The World Wide Web Consortium, a Web stan-
dardization organization, first conceptualized XML in
the mid-1990s. Along with several programmers, the
Consortium began working on ways to use SGML for
Web-based documents in the same manner in which
HTML had been used. Microsoft Corp. was one of

the first companies to embrace XML. The firm began
planning to upgrade its SQL Server to support XML
in 1997. Other database giants, such as Oracle Corp.
and IBM Corp., followed suit with their own plans
for XML. According to an October 2000 article in
InformationWeek, ‘‘XML is one of the primary areas
that all the major database vendors have scrambled to
embrace. Why is XML so important? XML facilitates
communications between systems that normally don’t
speak the same language. Because of its self-describ-
ing nature, XML provides a way to pass information
between dissimilar systems with some level of confi-
dence that it will be properly interpreted on the
other end.’’
One area in which XML is predicted to prove
particularly lucrative is streamlining supply chains
for manufacturers. Some analysts estimate that new
developments based on XML will save manufacturers
across the globe as much as $90 billion per year. One
firm already reaping these benefits is Maytag Corp.,
which began using XML to tag its product specifica-
tion data in 2001. Prior to adopting the new technol-
ogy, Maytag programmers had to download the data
from the firm’s mainframe system and then manually
key it into a spreadsheet program before they could
send it off to their retailers. Now ‘‘Maytag’s main-
frame zips out the specs to retailers and trading part-
ners,’’ explains Business Week columnist Jim Kerstet-
ter. ‘‘Their XML-savvy computers automatically pick
out each spec and insert it in the proper column. The
price information, for instance, will wind up in the
price column, no matter whether the price column is
named, or whether the document is an Excel spread-
sheet or an entry from for a database from Oracle
Corp.’’
One downside to XML is that for it to truly revolu-
tionize supply chain processes, each industry must
131
G A L E
E - C O M M E R C E
S O U R C E B O O K
develop a standard set of tags. Because the companies
within each industry tend to be intense rivals, working
together on such a process poses issues of trust as
well as other problems. As of mid-2002, these prob-
lems had prevented most industries from developing
standard XML tags. As a result, many small online
businesses continue to use HTML to build their Web
sites, and many have opted not to purchase the XML-
ready database products offered by firms like Micro-
soft, Oracle, and IBM. If you are hoping to use XML
to integrate and streamline your operations, several
options exist. For example, NetLedger Inc. released
smbXML in November 2001. smbXML works in con-
junction with Oracle Small Business Suite and is de-
signed to link different applications to a single Oracle
database. When considering the pros and cons of vari-
ous XML tools, keep in mind that many analysts
consider XML a relatively new technology; in fact,
some small business experts recommend waiting for
the concept to mature a bit before investing consider-
able resources in this new technology.

helps to provide customer service with on-line access to all
customer information from any area, in detail or summary
form. This makes it quicker and easier to answer questions

operator’s fingertips. Customer searches may be conducted
on name, either phonetic or alphabetic-based, or across
home, office or fax phone numbers, or on any other field
in the customer record. Searches can be customized by using
commands such as ‘‘contains,’’ ‘‘includes,’’ or ‘‘equals.’’
Most customer service activities can be done on-line, from
changing an address and address standardization to custom
or form letters and a vast number of reports. A free-form
notation capability tracks contact with customers, and as-
sures that relevant information is always available. An on-
line ‘‘tickler’’ file alerts operators when follow-up calls are
due. Each customer’s preferred method of communication
mail, fax, e-mail or phone can be designated on their record
and all communications will default to that method, if one
is not specified.

Founded: 1995. Description: The EDI package will help
simplify the business flow by seamlessly linking Oracle
applications with the various EDI transactions from different
Trading Partners. The package consists of Procedures for
reading data from flat files into Oracle Applications, cleaning
the data and then sending it through the Oracle Standard
Interfaces into Oracle Applications. Additionally it keeps
history of the original transaction and allows changes to the
transactions before being processed by Oracle. At each of
the processing stages, emails could be sent to an email group
if there are any interface errors. There are design documents
that would depict everything from the table mappings to
issues that the client will encounter and need to address
thereby giving the advantage of jumpstarting each interface
and allowing the client to begin addressing critical issues
from day one. These transactions can be grouped based on
where they come from. Transactions coming from Trading
Partners can be grouped as the Core EDI transactions and
the transactions coming from the Warehouse Management
System can be grouped as the Additional EDI Transactions.

Staff: 700. Description: E.piphany Dialogs, a multichannel
customer interaction solution that provides agent scripting,
interactive selling, Web self-service, and customer surveys.
At the core of E.piphany Dialogs are real-time customer
analytics that bring all customer touchpoints to life. Real-
time data-mining and arbitration algorithms determine and
predict the optimal path and content of a customer dialog,
based on the individual customer’s history and behavior.
Injecting customer intelligence into the customer interaction
enables the user to manage, churn, and reward loyal custom-
ers consistently based on facts. For example, a loyal high-
value customer that is a risk to churn can be taken through
the contact center script in a way that allows the telemarket-
ing agent to make a special retention offer that is much
more likely to convince the customer to stay put. For loyal
customers to remain loyal, their expectations must be met
consistently time after time. The dialogs used for customer
service, telemarketing, and Web self-service can be modeled
easily using an intuitive graphical drag-and-drop methodol-
ogy that enables the hassle-free capture and distribution of
valuable information. Customer satisfaction increases be-
cause customers experience consistent treatment across
touchpoints and are able to resolve their issues with the first
contact.

Discount Program allows discounts in two general catego-

Purchase Discount Method applies a total discount as a
separate line item in the basket based on the total amount
purchased. The Per Item Discount Method applies a discount
directly to the product price. If the Per Item Discount Method
(Price Method) is selected, the storeowner sets the actual
price of the product per item. This is a good choice if all
of the products in the site are the same price. The discount
is then set to apply a price per product based on the number
of products purchased. If the Per Item Discount Method
(Percentage Method) is selected, the storeowner sets the

Founded: 1995. Description: HSOE (High Speed Order
Entry) can be best described as a bolt-on or addition that
resides over the Oracle Apps Order Entry System. It was
designed for those companies who have very high order line
item transaction volumes. Since speed and throughput are
the main issues in the high transaction volume environment,
the HSOE product was designed to streamline the entry
process for sales orders and line items. In-house Customer
Service representatives can tap into its features, like on-
line quantity checking, at entry time. HSOE is intended
to supplement the Order Entry System, by allowing OE
customizations, to meet client-specific needs. Among its
chief features is that it can be run on a disconnected client,
like a laptop, with the mobile sales force. This is made
possible by its synchronization feature.

ited number of hotels per event and an unlimited number
of room types per hotel. Each room type is defined with a
separate price structure, description, and starting inventory
per night of the block. As a room is sold, the nightly inventory
of the room type confirmed is adjusted for the dates of the
transaction. Portions of the room block may be set aside
from general inventory as a sub-block under the control and
guarantee of a group leader. A variety of reports, confirma-
tions, and invoices can be generated. It is so tightly integrated
with Registration Manager that the two applications link to
the same name and address records, and share common
accounting ledgers, reports, and work areas.

supplier to offer a B2B eCommerce solution to their custom-
ers, significantly reducing the load on customer service call
centers and greatly enhancing customer service. The Product
Returns application enables customers to submit Return Ma-
terial Authorizations for approval by the supplier. RMA
requests are quickly created by referencing past orders or
invoices. Once submitted, customers can check the RMA
status and suppliers can provide instructions to the customer,
(i.e. pick up date, return instructions, authorizations to de-
stroy, etc.). The Accounts Receivable Inquiry application
provides customers with the ability to view and access valu-
able accounts receivable information. The eApprovals appli-
cation provides the ability to create a set of sophisticated,
rules-based, buyer workflows that automate the internal or-
der-approval process. Orders are routed through a defined-
approval hierarchy, and multiple levels of approval are sup-
ported, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized purchasing.
Lastly, the Customer Administrator application streamlines
the user administration process for both suppliers and buyers,
reducing customer support costs while increasing buyer ac-
cess, flexibility, and ease-of-use.

network to gain access to and make effective decisions re-
garding quality, cost and availability of components from
their manufacturers and distributors. Manufacturer Compo-
nent Management defines the commodity components and
their manufacturers for each item on the bill of material, and
facilitates information sharing with all partners to enhance
‘‘Design for Supply Chain’’ objectives - whether at new
product introduction or at any point in the product lifecycle.

very mobile, often under time pressure and managing multi-
ple opportunities at the same time. Sales and Marketing
Portals aggregate content into a single workplace in order
to increase the amount and speed that up to date information
can be accessed. The benefits of collaborative Sales and
Marketing Portal are: Sales managers are more productive
because they can reuse best practices, presentations, and
contracts more efficiently, cross-functional communities of
expertise are created where ideas can be shared and dis-
cussed, feedback from the sales teams is immediately shared
with other sales teams and directly marketing, and engage-
ment spaces are created around specific strategic opportuni-
ties and information to be cross-linked as needed.

Founded: 1976. Description: SAS/CONNECT provides the
essential tools for sharing data, applications and applications
intelligence across multiple computing environments. It ac-
tually gives the user control over where and how to execute
each part of an application. It works by using 3 main applica-
tions. The first is enterprise data access which provides
transparent access to enterprise-wide data in virtually any
format or location. Local clients can simultaneously connect
to multiple data sources on different platforms and can com-
bine diverse data sources from different platforms. Data can
be extracted for local processing or accessed interactively
on a remote platform. The second is applications partitioning.
Remote Computing Services provide dynamic relocation of
applications logic so applications developed on one system
can be moved easily or even divided for execution on multi-
ple systems. The third is peer-to-peer communications. Pro-
gram-to-program communications on all platforms let PCs,
workstations and mainframes act as clients and servers, re-
moving the hierarchical distinction between desktop and
host computing resources.

Description: Staffware Process Monitor provides a whole
new level and depth of insight for business analysts and
users by allowing them to intelligently and proactively man-
age their business processes. Using a graphical interface,

the SPM provides key performance metrics and detailed
status reports on entire business processes (e.g., how long
it took to process a claim). For even more detail and insight,
the Staffware Work-In-Progress Manager (SWIP) provides
reports and audits on specific case data and queue status
(e.g., to view total values of each claim processed). Both
tools can be set up to show historical data. Staffware Process
Monitor (SPM) determines and analyses business perform-
ance data across organizations and across systems in an
intuitive fashion. SPM supports decisions for optimization
of business processes and improves return on investment
(ROI) in the Staffware Process Suite and other IT solutions
such as ERP. Information about process performance is
gathered from the data within the Staffware Process Engine
databases that result from process execution. With SPM,
managers can quickly and reliably make process decisions
that make critical improvements in operating results. T

Founded: 1979. Description: E-business applications must
provide intelligent messaging and automated workflow to
effectively support a collaborative environment. As the ‘‘ner-
vous system’’ for the digital-to-enterprise connection, Syte-
Line Workflow Automation connects, automates and stream-
lines work processes in an enterprise business system.
SyteLine Workflow Automation automates business pro-
cesses to include decision-making based on user-defined
rules. Everyday processes are automated and resources can
be refocused to deal with only exceptions to the rule. For
example, orders can be received, processed and confirmed
in a matter of seconds. Only orders that are exceptional have
to be reviewed. SyteLine Workflow Automation provides
the communications capability for synchronizing the supply
chain and keeping all customers, suppliers and business
partners informed of transactions. For instance, immediately
after customers place an order, your suppliers and business
partners can receive critical order information using the
communication path of their choice: e-mail, EDI or fax.
