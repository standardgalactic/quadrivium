Supervisor’s Foreword
The discovery of superconductivity in Fe-based materials in 2008 boosted the
researches in high-Tc superconductivity. Although the high-Tc superconductivity in
copper oxides (cuprates) was discovered in 1986, no consensus has been achieved
on the microscopic mechanism in spite of considerable efforts. The discovery of
Fe-based superconductors (FeSC) provided a new route to high-Tc superconduc-
tivity. Since superconductivity in both cuprates and FeSC arises from doped
antiferromagnets, unveiling the interplay between superconductivity and magnetic
order, spin dynamics, and related exotic phases are essential for understanding the
microscopic origin of high-Tc superconductivity.
The aim of this thesis is to reveal this interplay between superconductivity and
other orders and their dynamics in a speciﬁc electron-doped iron-pnictide system
BaFe2−xNixAs2. Using high-resolution X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and
inelastic neutron scattering (INS), Xingye Lu studied the phase diagram and the
spin excitations of BaFe2−xNixAs2. In his ﬁrst work (Chap. 4), he used
high-resolution X-ray and neutron diffraction to establish a detailed structural,
magnetic, and electronic phase diagram of BaFe2−xNixAs2. The magnetic and
orthorhombic structural order parameters reveal a strong magnetoelastic coupling,
which was expected to lead to a quantum bicritical point near optimal doping.
However, the emergence of an incommensurate antiferromagnetic order close to
optimal superconductivity strongly modiﬁes the electronic properties and pre-
empted the purported quantum critical point. This work clariﬁes the quantum
criticality and its connection to superconductivity in electron-doped BaFe2As2
systems. To further investigate the nature of the short-range incommensurate
magnetic order, he exploited neutron resonance spin-echo technique, cold, thermal,
and polarized neutron triple-axis spectrometers to study the slow dynamics of the
incommensurate magnetic order, and determined its cluster spin glass nature
(Chap. 5). These two works have settled the doping evolution of the magnetic
ground states and their effects on the electronic properties of this system.
After determining the phase diagram of BaFe2−xNixAs2, Xingye used INS to
investigate the newly discovered electronic nematic order located between Ts and
TN (Ts [ TN) in the phase diagram (Chap. 6). This study is difﬁcult because it will
v

need to be performed on large detwinned crystals (*0.2 g). After putting great
efforts, he developed a method to prepare sample and designed a detwinning device
that can detwin large single crystal. His INS studies on BaFe2−xNixAs2 ﬁnd that the
low-energy spin excitations evolve from C4 symmetry (with equal intensity for the
excitations at (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1)) to C2 symmetry (with intensity difference
between the excitations at (1,0,1) and (0, 1, 1)). The onset temperature of this
spin-excitation anisotropy (T) is well above Ts and coincident with that for the
resistivity anisotropy of uniaxial-stress detwinned BaFe2−xNixAs2. They also show
similar doping dependence and therefore indicate that they are intimately correlated
or share the same origin. This is the ﬁrst study of this type and inspired many
follow-up works.
In the third part of this thesis, he unveiled the direct correlation between
low-energy spin excitations (including spin resonance) and superconductivity, and
the persistence of the diffusive high-energy spin excitations (paramagnon)
throughout the phase diagram, using the state-of-art time-of-ﬂight neutron scatter-
ing spectrometers in ISIS (Chap. 7). This work provided solid evidence that the
low-energy spin excitations are correlated with the formation of cooper pairs. The
systematic work was based on large amount of single crystals (*100 g of single
crystals in total for three dopings) and careful INS experiments. This impressive
sample growth work was done within several months by Xingye and his colleagues.
Besides the important discoveries discussed above, this thesis contains a brief
introduction to FeSC and a relative detailed introduction to the principles and
techniques associated with neutron scattering. Both parts are easy to follow by
non-experts. Overall, the work of Xingye has broadened considerably our under-
standing of the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in FeSC.
Through his dedication, patience, and hard work, he was able to accomplish a
tremendous amount of work within a relatively short period. I believe his thesis sets
a new standard of excellence in condensed matter physics and will be appreciated
for many years to come.

Chapter 1
Motivation and Overview
1.1
Superconductivity
Superconductivity refers to a phenomenon of exact zero resistivity of certain material
(termed “superconductor”) when it is cooled below a critical temperature (supercon-
ducting transition temperature Tc). It was discovered in mercury by H. Kamerlingh
Onnes in 1911 (Fig.1.1a) [1], soon after he liquiﬁed Helium and obtained very low
temperature (<4.2 K). The other basic phenomenon for superconductivity is the per-
fect diamagnetism discovered by Meissner and Ochsenfeld in 1933 (Meissner effect
[2]) (Fig.1.1b), which shows that magnetic ﬁeld (B) in a superconductor is expelled
while the superconductor is cooled below Tc. Zero resistance and Meissner effect are
basic criteria of a superconducting state and serve as the starting point for developing
theories of superconductivity [3].
Phenomenological theories concerning the electrodynamics of superconductivity
were developed by London in 1935 [4] and improved by Pippard in 1953 [3]. In
1950, Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory of superconductivity was proposed based on the
Landau theory of second-order phase transition by treating superconducting wave
function as an order parameter of superconducting state. London theory and GL
theory introduced several important concepts such as critical ﬁeld (Hc), penetration
depth (λ) and coherence length (ξ) of superconductivity and have achieved great
success in the studies of superconductivity [5, 6].
In 1946, F. London proposed that superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum
phenomenon, in which he suggested that all the superconducting electrons are in one
quantum state of a wave function (ψ) [6]. This idea was demonstrated by the develop-
ment of microscopic theory of superconductivity. In 1957, J. Bardeen, L. N. Copper
and J. R. Schrieffer established the quantum theory for superconductivity (BCS the-
ory) in a mean-ﬁeld theoretical regime [7], where superconductivity is suggested to
be driven by electron-phonon coupling. Because of the attractive interactions caused
by electron-phonon coupling, electrons close to Fermi surface tend to form binding
electron pairs (Copper pairs). The Copper pairs condense into a superﬂuid state and
lead to the perfect conductivity [7].

The condensation redistributes the electron density of states close to Fermi sur-
face and open a superconducting energy gap, which protects the superconducting
state against impurity scattering and other weak perturbations. Within the coherent
length, superconductingstatehas uniformenergygapandphasefactor, indicatingthat
superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon. Basic macroscopic phe-
nomena of superconductivity include zero resistivity, Meissner effect, abrupt change
of electron speciﬁc heat, magnetic ﬂux quantization in a superconducting ring and
Josephson effect [5, 6, 8].
Besides revealing the weak-coupling nature and calculating various basic proper-
ties of the conventional superconductivity in many metals and simple alloys, the BCS
theory also unveiled the s-wave symmetry of the superconducting state. Another
major contribution made by BCS theory is some basic concepts and methods in
describing superconductivity. For example, the description of the superconducting
energy gap and pairing symmetry introduced by BCS theory can be applied to non-
BCS superconductors.
In BSC theory, the pairing mechanism is electron-phonon coupling. Since the
strength of the electron-phonon coupling depends on Debye frequency and controls
the superconducting transition temperature Tc, the Tc of conventional superconduc-
tivity has its upper limit. McMilan predicted that the highest Tc driven by electron-
phonon coupling is about 40 K [9]. Thus far, the highest Tc of BCS superconductors
is 39 K for MgB2 [10]. Before 1986, the highest Tc achieved is 23K of Nb3Ge [11].
In 1986, Bednoz and Müller discovered novel superconductivity with Tc above
30K in copper oxides [12], which triggered numerous exploration of high tem-

1.1 Superconductivity

perature superconductors. The highest Tc record was improved frequently within a
short time. Several classes of copper-oxide high temperature superconductors with
Tc above 77K were discovered [3, 13–17]. Compared with conventional BCS super-
conductors, cuprate high temperature superconductors exhibit more exotic features
and cannot be described by BCS theory. The superconductors described by BCS
theory is termed “conventional” superconductors, whereas all other superconduc-
tors are called “unconventional” superconductors. Three classes of unconventional
superconductors have been discovered and received extensive studies: copper-oxide
superconductors, iron-based superconductors and heavy-Fermion superconductors
[18]. Iron-based superconductivity was discovered in LaOFeP (Tc = 8 K) by Hosono
in Tokyo Institute of Technology [19]. In 2008, the same group discovered super-
conductivity with Tc = 26K in LaFeAsO1−xFx [20], which is the beginning of the
intensive studies of iron-based superconductors. Later, Hosono [21], Chen [22] and
Wang [23] improved Tc to above 40K via substituting La by other rear-earth ele-
ments or applying hydrostatic high pressure. Using high-pressure synthesis method,
Ren et al. obtained Tc = 55K in Sm[O1−xFx]FeAs, which is a record of Tc in bulk
iron-based superconductors [24, 25].
Since the discovery of superconductivity, the research associated with supercon-
ductivity focus on four aspects: (1) exploring novel superconductors with higher Tc;
(2) understanding the properties of superconductivity using both phenomenological
and microscopic theory (such as GL and BCS); (3) establishing the microscopic
theory for unconventional superconductivity; (4) applications of superconductors.
Though three decades have been past, no consensus has been achieved on the micro-
scopic origin of the unconventional (or high temperature) superconductivity.
1.2
Scope of This Thesis
In spite of great progress in the research of cuprate and iron-based high-Tc super-
conductivity [17, 18, 26–32], the underlying microscopic pairing mechanism for
superconductivity remains elusive and is still an important frontier of modern con-
densed matter physics. Because of the failure of BCS theory in explaining high-Tc
superconductivity, new microscopic mechanisms are required [33, 34]. Since the
optimal superconductivity appears at the border of the antiferromagnetic instability,
spin ﬂuctuations persisting in optimal and overdoped regime of high-Tc supercon-
ductors could play an important role in driving superconductivity [32, 35–41].
In neutron scattering studies of high-Tc superconductivity, a ubiquitous spin-1
resonance mode in low energy spin excitations [42] was discovered in the supercon-
ducting state of numerous unconventional superconductors and shows a universal
ratio between resonance energy and Tc (and energy gap) [34, 43–49]. The temper-
ature dependence of the spin resonance is coincident with that for superconducting
gap. With increasing doping, the intensity of the spin resonance follows the doping
evolution of superconductivity [50, 51]. On the other hand, high energy spin exci-
tations persist throughout the whole phase diagram in various systems and could

Motivation and Overview
be a context for the emergence of superconductivity. Therefore, spin ﬂuctuation is
deemed as a leading candidate for mediating cooper pairs. Understanding the origin
of the magnetism and its relationship with superconductivity is crucial for revealing
the microscopic origin of high-Tc superconductivity. In iron pnictides, the micro-
scopic origin of the magnetism itself is still under debate, as well as its correlation
with superconductivity. In order to clarify this issue and improve our understanding
on these questions, we perform detailed neutron scattering studies on electron-doped
BaFe2−xNixAs2 for its magnetic order and spin dynamics, from which we can reveal
the origin of the magnetism and the correlation of the spin excitations with high-Tc
superconductivity. The research of this thesis consist of three parts listed as follows.
(1) (Chapters4 and 5) Neutron diffraction and high resolution x-ray diffraction
have been applied to study the doping range near optimal superconductivity to estab-
lish a detailed electronic phase diagram and to reveal the effects of short-range
incommensurate magnetic order on optimal doping region. The evolution of the
antiferromagnetic order and the orthorhombic lattice distortion with temperature
indicates a strong magnetoelastic coupling in this system, with which theoretically
Ts and TN tend to converge near optimal doping and form a quantum bicritical
point. However, the zero-temperature transition is preempted by the formation of the
incommensurate order in the region 0.088 < x < 0.104, resulting in a ﬁnite value
of TN ≈Tc + 10K above the superconducting dome around x ≈0.1. Our results
imply an avoided quantum critical point, which is expected to strongly inﬂuence
the properties of both the normal and superconducting state [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110,
257001 (2013)]. Given the signiﬁcant effect of the incommensurate order on super-
conductivity, we use various techniques with different energy resolutions ranging

(2014)].
(2) (Chapter6) Neutron scattering study of uniaxial-pressure detwinned
BaFe2−xNixAs2. In this work, nematic spin correlations in the uniaxial-strained
tetragonal of BaFe2−xNixAs2 have been revealed by inelastic neutron scattering. In
the paramagnetic tetragonal phase, an in-plane resistivity anisotropy was observed
in the BaFe2−xTxAs2 (T =Co, Ni) iron pnictides. Inelastic neutron scattering is used
to show that low-energy spin excitations in these materials change from four-fold
symmetry to two-fold symmetry at temperatures corresponding to the onset of the
in-plane resistivity anisotropy. Since both resistivity and spin excitation anisotropy
vanishes near optimal superconductivity, we conclude that the nematic spin corre-
lations is intimately connected to the resistivity anisotropy or they have the same
origin [Science 345, 657–660 (2014)].
(3) (Chapter7) Magnetic spin excitation spectra in overdoped regime have been
studied by time-of-ﬂight neutron scattering. Previous results for parent compound
(x = 0) and optimal doping (x = 0.1) show that the spin excitations below
100 meV are strongly modiﬁed by doping while the higher energy part does not
changed. We studied the evolution of the spin excitations in overdoped regime
(x = 0.15, 0.18, 0.3). The intensity of the spin resonance mode decreases linearly
with doping. The low-energy spin excitations also decrease with doping and form an
∼50meV spin gap in x = 0.3, while the high energy spin excitations evolve slowly.

1.2 Scope of This Thesis
5
Our results suggest that both high-energy spin excitations and low-energy spin exci-
tation coupled with itinerant electrons are important for the superconductivity in iron
pnictides [Phys. Rev. B 88, 144516 (2013). Nat. Commun. 4, 2874 (2013)].
We provide an introduction for iron-based superconductivity in Chap.2 and prin-
ciples and techniques of neutron scattering in Chap.3. In the end of this thesis, we
summarize our research and give an outlook for future studies of iron-based super-
conductors.

Iron-Based Superconductors
Since Hideo Hosono discovered electron-doped iron-pnictide superconductor
La[O1−xFx]FeAs [1], scientists discovered various iron-pnictide superconductors
containing FeAs layers and iron-selenide superconductors consisting of FeSe (and
interstitial) layers. In the July of 2008, Johrendt group in the University of Munich
suggested that BaFe2As2 in ThCr2Si2 structure could be a parent compound of iron-
based superconductivity [2], and later discovered an optimal superconductivity with
Tc = 38 K in potassium doped BaFe2As2 [3]. Meanwhile, Jin’s group in the Institute
of Physics in Beijing revealed Tc = 18 K superconductivity in LiFeAs [4]. Wu’s
group in Taiwan discovered the superconducting system based on FeSe [5]. After-
wards, superconductivity was achieved via carrier- or isovalent-doping in these sys-
tems [6–11]. According to the stoichiometric ratios of their chemical constituents,
the main families of iron-based superconductors described above are denoted by
‘1111’, ‘122’, ‘111’ and ‘11’, respectively. Iron-based superconductors are the sec-
ond class of high-temperature superconductors after cuprates. Their charge-carrier
dopingphasediagramsaresimilartothoseforcuprates,whiletheirparentcompounds
are poor metals instead of Mott insulators (Fig.2.1). The comparison between iron-
based and copper-oxide superconductors will provide new methods and insights for
understanding high-Tc superconductivity [12]. In the studies of iron-based supercon-
ductors, many universal features among different families have been revealed. In this
chapter, we will introduce some of these universal features that are associated with
the studies of this thesis.
Figure2.1 are schematic phase diagrams of copper-oxide and iron-based high-
temperature superconductors [12]. Iron-based superconductivity is usually induced
by doping charge carriers into its antiferromagnetic (AF) parent compound, which
can be realized via element substitution in FeAs or its adjacent layer in various
systems such as La[O1−xFx]FeAs [1], Ba1−xKxFe2As2 [3], BaFe2−xTxAs2 (T = Co,
Ni) [6, 7], NaFe1−xCoxAs [8]. Superconductivity can also be induced by isovalent
doping such as replacing Fe by Ru in BaFe2−xRuxAs2 [9], As by P in (Eu/Ba)Fe2-
(As1−xPx)2 [10, 11] and Se by Te in Fe(Se,Te) [5]. The doping gradually suppresses

the structural and magnetic phase transitions and induces optimal superconductivity
at the border of structural and AF instability (Fig.2.1). Besides doping, applying
hydrostatic pressure is also efﬁcient in inducing or enhancing superconductivity
in some systems [13]. Thin ﬁlms of some systems also exhibit superconductivity
enhancement [14].
2.1
Basic Properties
2.1.1
Structure and Magnetic Structure
As shown in Fig.2.2, iron-pnictide superconductors with layered structure consist of
FeAs layers and interstitial layers, while iron-selenide superconductors are formed
by stacked FeSe layers [15]. Within the FeX layer (X = As/P, Se/Te/S), four X ions
surround one Fe2+ and form a tetrahedron (Fig.2.2e). The geometry of the FeX4 tetra-
hedron dominates various electronic properties of iron-based superconductors [16].
Parent compound of iron pnictides usually undergoes a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic
structural transition (Ts), and a subsequent (or simultaneous) paramagnetic-to-AF
transition (TN). The tetragonal and orthorhombic unit cells of iron pnictides (122,
111, 1111 systems) are shown in Fig.2.2f, where the orthorhombic unit cell are
rotated by 45◦and enlarged relative to the tetragonal unit cell (ao ≈bo ≈
√
2aT ).
The magnetic ground state is a colinear stripe order (C-type) with magnetic wave
vector k = (1, 0, 1)ort = (1/2, 1/2, 1)tet [17–22]. Compared with iron pnictides, iron
selenides show different structural and magnetic transitions. Fe1+yTe exhibit a simul-
taneous tetragonal-to-monoclinic structural and magnetic transition (Ts = TN ≈70

Since we focus on the studies of BaFe2−xNixAs2, we now turn to discuss the
magnetic and structural properties of BaFe2As2 in detail. At high temperature,

Iron-Based Superconductors
BaFe2As2 shows tetragonal structure with space group I4/mmm and lattice para-
meters a = b = 3.963 Å, c = 13.02 Å, as shown in Fig.2.2. As cooling,
BaFe2As2 undergoes a structural transition and a subsequent magnetic transition
(Ts ≈TN + 0.2 K ≈138 K) [24]. The system enters an orthorhombic phase below
Ts and then an AF state below TN, with space group Fmmm and lattice parame-
ters a = 5.615 Å, b = 5.574 Å, c = 12.95 Å at base temperature. The AF order
of BaFe2As2 is a C-type colinear stripe order with magnetic vector k = (1, 0, 1)
in the orthorhombic notation and (1/2, 1/2, 1) in the tetragonal notation (Fig.2.2).
Relative to the tetragonal state, the orthorhombic unit cell are rotated by 45◦with
ao =
√
2aT . The other parent compounds of the 122 system such as CaFe2As2,
SrFe2As2 and EuFe2As2 have similar structural and magnetic properties [22, 25],
though they show different lattice parameters, magnetic moments and structural
and magnetic transition temperatures. The main difference among these 122 parent
compounds is the order of the structural and the magnetic phase transitions [26].
BaFe2As2 exhibits second-order structural transition, as indicated by the gradual
onset of the orthorhombic lattice distortion δ = (ao −bo)/(ao +bo) in Fig.2.3a [24],
and ﬁrst-order magnetic transition that induces a hysteresis and a jump of δ via strong
magnetoelastic coupling (Fig.2.3a). With increasing electron doping, the tempera-
ture difference between Ts and TN is enlarged and the magnetic transition becomes
second order (Fig.2.3b) [24]. The others, however, show simultaneous ﬁrst-order
structural and magnetic phase transitions in undoped and underdoped regime [21,
22, 25, 26]. The order of the structural and magnetic phase transitions, and whether
they occur simultaneously, have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the electronic properties
close to the transitions.
In the tetragonal state, electronic properties within ab plane of the doped
BaFe2As2 systems show C4 symmetry, as dictated by the structural symmetry and
revealed by experimental studies. Similarly, samples in the orthorhombic phase

should exhibit two-fold (C2) electronic properties. However, the tetragonal-to-
orthorhombic structural transition results in twinning, as shown in Fig.2.3c. Four
kinds of domains formed with their ao axis aligned along four different directions
below Ts and hinder the measurements of the intrinsic electronic properties along ao
and bo axes [27]. To measure the intrinsic electronic properties, the ﬁrst step is to
obtain a detwinned, single domain crystal. Tanatar et al. in Ames Lab [28] and Chu
et al. in Stanford university [29] independently developed mechanical detwinning
devices that can apply uniaxial stress for crystal detwinning. Their resistivity mea-
surements on BaFe2As2 and BaFe2−xTxAs2 (T =Co, Ni) revealed strong resistivity
anisotropy between ρa and ρb [29, 30]. ρa is smaller and shows metallic behavior
below a characteristic temperature T ∗, while ρb behaves like an insulator below T ∗.
T ∗is much higher than Ts, indicating that this electronic anisotropy persists in the
tetragonal state. The electronic anisotropy in the tetragonal state of uniaxial-pressure
detwinned Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 is a solid evidence for the emergence of an electronic
nematic in iron pnictides [29]. Similar electronic anisotropy in the tetragonal state
has also been observed in uniaxial-strained BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 but absent (or much
weaker) in Ba1−xKxFe2As2, suggesting that it is easier to induce such anisotropy
by doping FeAs layer [31, 32]. In addition, resistivity measurements on detwinned
CaFe2As2 and SrFe2As2 reveal vanishingly small resistivity anisotropy above Ts
and therefore suggested that the electronic nematic is sensitive to the order of the
structural transition [28, 33]. To study the electronic nematic in iron pnictides, we
use neutron scattering to study the magnetic order and spin excitations in uniaxial-
strained BaFe2−xNixAs2. We shall discuss the details in Chap.6.
The strong electronic anisotropy in the tetragonal state of uniaxial-strained Ba-
(Fe1−xCox)2As2 implies that the electronic properties of underdoped iron pnictides
are susceptible to structural changes. Indeed, various studies have suggested that the
electronic properties of iron pnictides are sensitive to the distortions of the FeAs4
tetrahedron. To be speciﬁc, the anion height (AH) and the bond angle α of the FeAs4
octahedron (Fig.2.2) are correlated with the superconductivity in iron pnictides. As
shown in Fig.2.4a, Mizuguchi et al. summarized AH and Tc for many iron-based
superconductors. As increasing AH, Tc ﬁrstly increases and then decreases, forming a
peak at AH = 1.38 Å [34]. Subsequently, Lee et al. plotted the relationship between
Tc and α, as displayed in Fig.2.4b. This plot suggests that a system containing
undistorted FeAs4 tetrahedron (α = 109.47◦) exhibits higher Tc [35]. The structural
effects above suggested that superconductivity can be induced by charge carrier
doping as well as chemical pressure generated by element substitution. On the other
hand, element substitution would induce impurity scattering, which is detrimental
to superconductivity. Therefore, the emergence of superconductivity is driven and
affected by various factors and cannot be simply explained by charge carrier doping.

Electronic Structure
Because of the common FeAs layer, iron pnictides exhibit similar Fermi surface
topology. Compared with the single-band copper oxides, iron based superconductors
are multi-band systems. Their Fermi surfaces usually consist of hole pockets around
 point and electron pockets around M(X) point.
Figure2.5 shows the Fermi surface and band structure of LaOFeAs and LaOFeP
calculatedbyLDAandmeasuredbyangle-resolvedphotoemission(ARPES),respec-
tively [36–38]. The Fermi surface of LaOFeAs includes two hole pockets at the center
of the Brillouin zone () and two electron pockets at zone corner (Fig.2.5a). Some
of the Fermi pockets show strong dispersion along kz while the others are more two
dimensional (Fig.2.5b). Since the hole pockets at  show similar size to the electron
pockets at M, Fermi surface nesting between them could occur with nesting vector
k = (1/2, 1/2)tet = (1, 0)ort [36]. As suggested by theoretical calculation, the per-
fect Fermi surface nesting tends to induce an AF spin density wave ground state with
wave vector k = (1/2, 1/2)tet [36]. Subsequently, neutron diffraction measurements
on LaOFeAs conﬁrm the existence of the AF order in LaOFeAs [17]. Figure2.5c
depicts the contributions of different orbitals to the total electron density of states of
LaOFeAs. The density of states close to Fermi surface are dominated by the orbitals
of iron, while the p orbitals of As lie 3 eV below the Fermi surface. Therefore, the
electronic properties of the system depends on the electron hopping between Fe ions.
Figure2.5d are band structures along high symmetry directions. The blue and green
dashed curves are the band structures for 3.5 pm larger and smaller anion heights,
respectively. Note the anion height for LaOFeAs is 130 pm. The change of the anion
height induces similar band shift to that caused by charge carrier doping. As we have
discussed in last section, the anion height has signiﬁcant effects on the electronic

properties of iron pnictides. Figure2.5e–f are Fermi surface and band structure of
LaOFeP measured by ARPES, which is consistent with the results of LDA calcula-
tion [38]. The consistency between LDA results and the band structure measured by
ARPES suggests that the system shows strong itinerancy and weak (or intermediate)
electron correlations. However, as we shall discuss later, the real situation is more
complicated.
As suggested by LDA calculation, 122 system exhibits similar Fermi surface
topology and hosts two hole pockets at  point and two electron pockets at tetragonal
zone corner (X point) [39]. As increasing charge carrier doping, the Fermi level shifts
gradually, which changes the Fermi surface nesting condition. LDA calculation also
suggests that the anion height decreases with hole doping. This can be ascribed to
the enhanced attraction between Fe2+ and As3−after the injection of holes into the
Fe2+ sites and the decrease of the radius of Fe ions after hole injection.

Phase Diagrams
In this section, we will describe the phase diagrams of doped BaFe2As2 systems and
discuss the emergence of the AF order, the orthorhombic lattice distortions and the
superconductivity, and the interplay between these orders.

Figure2.6 shows the phase diagrams for hole- and electron-doped BaFe2As2. In
Ba1−xKxFe2As2, the substitution of Ba by potassium induces holes into the FeAs
layers indirectly. The superconductivity emerges at x = 0.1 and persists to the end
member x = 1, with optimal superconductivity (Tc = 39 K) achieved at x =
0.4 [40]. Compared with Ba1−xKxFe2As2, electron-doped Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 are
distinct in various aspects [41]. The element substitution occurs at the Fe sites and
induces electron doping in FeAs layers directly. Since the structure of FeAs layer
dominates many electronic properties of iron pnictides, introducing charge carrier by
element substitution in or out-of-FeAs layers are very different. As shown in Fig.2.6,
superconductivity in Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 appears from x = 0.03 and persists only
before x = 0.13 with optimal Tc = 26 K occurred at x = 0.062, and the AF order is
suppressed more quickly than that in Ba1−xKxFe2As2. This substantial electron-hole
asymmetry reﬂects different electron correlation in these two sides. The microscopic
origin, however, remains elusive.
In doped 122 systems, charge carrier doping in the interstitial layers adjacent to
the FeAs layers are more effective in inducing superconductivity, for which opti-
mal Tc is higher than 30 K in hole-doped Ba1−xKxFe2As2 and Ba1−xNaxFe2As2
and higher than 40 K in electron-doped Ca1−xLaxFe2As2. However, hole doping
in FeAs layer fails to induce superconductivity because Cr and Mn that suppose to
provide holes have strong magnetism and induce strong impurity scattering, which
are detrimental to superconductivity. The electron- and isovalent-doping in FeAs
layer, such as substituting Fe by Co, Ni, Ru and As by P, can induce superconduc-
tivity exhibiting optimal Tc ∼20−30 K [6, 7, 9, 11]. With increasing doping, the
AF order and orthorhombic state are gradually suppressed. The structural and the
magnetic transitions are coupled ﬁrst-order transition in Ba1−xKxFe2As2 and BaFe2-

(As1−xPx)2, while Ts and TN split with increasing doping in Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 and
BaFe2−xNixAs2.
2.2.1
Spin Density Wave
Since the parent compounds of iron pnictides show poor metallic ground state, and
their Fermi surface topology could allow Fermi surface nesting between the hole
pockets at  point and the electron pockets at M point, Dong et al. proposed that a spin
density wave (SDW) state could be formed in LaOFeAs, driven by the Fermi surface
nesting (Fig.2.5a) [36]. SDW is a symmetry-breaking state induced by the instability
of Fermi surface in an itinerant magnetic system [42]. An AF order corresponding
to the Fermi surface nesting was indeed discovered by neutron diffraction (Fig.2.2)
[17]. Because of the important role of Fermi surface nesting and itinerant magnetism
in creating the AF groundstate and driving the magnetic dynamics of iron pnictides,
it is necessary to introduce the basic ideas of Fermi-surface-nesting driven SDW.
As shown in Fig.2.7a, the Fermi surface of one-dimensional electron gas are two
points at ±kF. This special Fermi surface is susceptible to small perturbations, much
different from its counterparts in higher dimensions. From linear response theory,
electron density distribution caused by an external perturbation φ(q) can be expressed
as:
ρind(q) = χ(q)φ(q),
(2.1)
where χ(q) is the Lindhard Response Function of the system. The response function
in d dimensions can be written as
χ(q) =

dk
(2π)d
fk −fk+q
Ek −Ek+q
,
(2.2)
in which fk = f (εk) is Fermi distribution function. For the scattering between the
occupied state and the unoccupied state in one dimension (Fig.2.7a), fk −fk+q ≡1
while Ek −Ek+q can be inﬁnitesimal close to q = 2kF, resulting in a divergence of
the response function at q = 2kF, as shown in Fig.2.7b. This divergence corresponds
to an unstable state, which is usually avoided by a periodic distribution of the electron
(orspin)densitywithwavevectorq = 2kF,thatis,densitywave.Theformationofthe
q = 2kF density wave folds the band structure and open a density-wave gap, leaving
the system into a stable state [43]. Figure2.7c shows the band folding and energy
gap formation for a system with lattice parameter a. The period of the density wave
is 2a, corresponding to a smaller Brillouin zone π
a . Therefore, the periodicity of the
density wave induces an energy gap at ± π
2a [43]. For higher dimensions d = 2, 3,
only one q point on the Fermi surface meets the nesting condition, which cannot
result in any divergence in the corresponding response function Eq.2.2, as shown in
Figs.2.7b, d.

Free electron gas is a single-band system. Therefore, Fermi surface nesting cannot
be realized in two and three dimensions. In the multiband iron pnictides, the interband
scattering between the hole Fermi surface at  point and the electron Fermi surface at
M(X) point could induce Fermi surface instability and result in a SDW state with AF
wave vector (1/2, 1/2) 2π
aT (Fig.2.2). Indeed, infrared optical measurements observed
spectral weight transfer across the Néel temperature TN in LaOFeAs, indicating an
energy-gapopeningbelow TN,inagreementwiththeSDWpicture[36, 44].However,
ARPES measurements revealed Fermi surface reconstruction instead of energy gap
opening in iron pnictides [45, 46]. Therefore, whether the AF order is a SDW state
remains an open question. Furthermore, the parent compound of 11 system (FeTe) has
similar Fermi surface topology to iron pnictides but shows bicolinear AF order with
wave vector k = (1/2, 0)( 2π
aT ) Fig.2.2, suggesting that the AF order in iron-based
superconductors cannot be fully described by the SDW picture [47]. In addition, the
magnetic moment for FeTe, ∼2μB/Fe, is much larger than those in iron pnictides such
as 0.35 μB in LaOFeAs [17], 0.87 μB in BaFe2As2 [18] and ∼0.1μB in Na1−δFeAs
[19], indicative of a local-moment picture. If the AF orders in these four families of

2.2 Phase Diagrams
19
iron-based superconductors share the same origin, a comprehensive picture beyond
SDW is required, for instance, theoretical attempts emphasizing correlation effects
and Hund’s coupling have been proposed [48, 49].
2.2.2
Superconductivity and Fermi Surface Nesting
In doped BaFe2As2 systems, it is well known that charge carrier doping gradually
suppresses the long range AF order and induces optimal superconductivity at the
boarder of the AF instability [40, 41]. In the view of band structure, charge carrier
doping will change the chemical potential of the system and shift the Fermi surface.
The band shift will change the sizes of the Fermi pockets and therefore vary the
nesting condition [50–53]. In the theory of Fermi surface nesting, minor change of
Fermi surface sizes can greatly change the nesting condition and suppress the AF
order. Although the perfect nesting inducing the AF order will be broken, interband
scattering between partial Fermi surface of the hole pockets and the electron pockets
can persist in superconducting regime. Since this partial nesting could enhance AF
spin ﬂuctuations which could be a driving force for superconductivity, Fermi surface
nesting has also been connected to the evolution of the superconductivity in these
systems. As shown in Fig.2.8a, b, in Ba1−xKxFe2As2, Fermi surface nesting between
hole band α and electron bands ϵ and γ are enhanced in x = 0.25 and 0.4 sample,
which was suggested to enhance the interband scattering (and spin ﬂuctuations)
and therefore improve superconductivity (Tc). As increasing hole doping to x = 0.7,
nestingconditionsbecomeworseand Tc decreasesto22K.TheendmemberKFe2As2
(x = 1) shows only Tc = 3 K, where the γ pocket disappears and the ϵ band
changes a lot in topology, both of which suppress the nesting condition. Similar
doping evolution of Fermi surface nesting and superconductivity was also observed in
electron-dopedBa(Fe1−xCox)2As2.Thisconsistencyinthedopingevolutionbetween
nesting and superconductivity in various systems indicates that Fermi surface nesting
is intimately connected to the superconductivity in iron pnictides.
Since low energy spin ﬂuctuations, including the spin resonance mode, have been
suggested to arise from the interband scattering between the hole pockets at  and
electron pockets at M(X), better Fermi surface nesting condition means stronger
spin ﬂuctuations, which could enhance superconductivity if the superconductivity
is indeed driven by spin ﬂuctuations. The spin resonance mode was proposed to
be an important evidence of the s±-wave superconductivity in iron-based super-
conductors mediated by spin ﬂuctuations [54]. Indeed, the spin resonance mode was
subsequentlydiscoveredinvariousiron-basedsuperconductorsandstronglysupports
the s± model. The s± wave symmetry were also supported by the superconducting
gaps in various pnictide superconductors measured by ARPES [55–58]. Scanning
tunneling microscope measurements of the superconducting gap and the quasiparti-
cle interference under magnetic ﬁeld in Fe(Se,Te) also favor the s± wave symmetry
[59].

Although Fermi surface nesting was suggested to be essential for the spin ﬂuctua-
tions and the superconductivity in iron-based superconductors, experimental studies
for their connections, and their doping evolution, are still lacking. One of our main
goals is to explore the doping evolution of the Fermi surface, spin ﬂuctuations and
superconductivity, as well as their connections, in electron-doped BaFe2−xNixAs2,
as we shall discuss in Chap.7.

2.2.3
Coexisting and Competing Orders
The coexistence and competition between various orders such as AF order,
orthorhombic state and superconductivity are crucial for understanding the micro-
scopic mechanism of the superconductivity in iron-based superconductors. Studies
of the interplay between these orders can reveal their connections and provide an
experimental basis for developing a comprehensive theoretical model.
As we have discussed, underdoped BaFe2As2 samples undergo a structural phase
transition (Ts = 138 K, δ = 0.36% for BaFe2As2) and a magnetic phase transi-
tion (TN = 138 K, m = 0.87μB for BaFe2As2). In the underdoped regime, with
increasing doping, the structural transition and the magnetic transition are gradu-
ally suppressed. The transition temperatrues (Ts and TN), the orthorhombic lattice
distortions (δ) and magnetic moment decrease monotonically with increasing dop-
ing. Meanwhile, superconductivity emerges and reach its maximum at the border of
the structural and magnetic instability. The contrasting trends suggest a competition
between superconductivity and orthorhombic AF state, and a coupling between the
orthorhombic phase and the AF order. This interplay was an indirect speculation at
early time, but became clear in the phase diagrams determined by transport, mag-
netic, neutron scattering and x-ray diffraction measurements in various systems. The
underdoped region hosting orthorhombic state, AF order and superconductivity is of
particular interest in the studies of the correlations between these orders. Figure2.6
shows the research progress concerning this issue [40, 41].
When superconductivity emerges from the orthorhombic AF ground state, it has
low Tc and small superconducting volume fraction. The interplay between these
ordersarenotobvious.AsincreasingdopingtoweakentheorthorhombicAFstateand
enhance the superconductivity, a suppression of the orthorhombic lattice distortion
(δ) and the AF order parameter occurs below Tc, as shown in Fig.2.9a–c. In Fig.2.9a–
b, orthorhombic lattice distortions δ in Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 are heavily suppressed
below Tc. In the optimal doping (x = 0.063), the system even re-enters the tetragonal
state, as dictated by the merge of the two orthorhombic peaks at 8.3 K in Fig.2.9a
[41]. Figure2.9c shows the split Ts and TN and the suppression of the magnetic order
parameter below Tc in x = 0.047 of Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2[60]. The suppression of the
AF state becomes stronger at higher doping. In a doping close to optimal doping, the
AF order parameter is almost completely suppressed at a temperature below Tc [41,
60, 62, 63].
The competition between superconductivity and AF order, and the strong mag-
netoelastic coupling have been discovered not only in many electron doped systems
such as Co, Ni, Rh doped BaFe2As2 [64–67], but also in hole-doped Ba1−xKxFe2-
As2 [40] and isovalent-doped Ba(Fe1−xRux)2As2 [68] and BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 [69,
70]. These experimental facts indicate that the interplay is universal in iron pnic-
tides. Thus far, we note that the systems showing weak impurity scattering, such
as BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 and Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2, exhibit strong suppression of the AF
order, while some systems like BaFe2−xNixAs2 hosting stronger impurity scattering,
show weaker suppression.

These unusual correlations have been interpreted by the competition between
superconductivity and AF (SDW) state (since they share the same itinerant electrons)
and the strong elastomagnetic coupling [63]. This also means that the superconduc-
tivity favors a paramagnetic tetragonal state, which is more isotropic (symmetric)
than the orthorhombic AF state. This is an important point that must be taken into
account in establishing a theoretical model for explaining the phase diagrams of iron
pnictides.

2.2 Phase Diagrams

Besides the competition, whether the AF order coexist with superconductivity
in a microscopic scale is also an important question which is still controversial.
Generally, it is difﬁcult to judge the scale of this coexistence, since both microscopic
andmesoscopiccoexistencecandescribetheexperimental observations fromneutron
scattering and x-ray diffraction. Some local probes such as muon spin rotation (μSR)
and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) support the microscopic coexistence of AF
order and superconductivity. In a NMR study of Ba(Fe1−xRux)2As2 [71], Ma et
al. found that magnetic volume fraction for underdoped samples is 100% below
TN and the magnetic signal falls sharply below Tc, providing a solid evidence for
the microscopic coexistence of AF order and superconductivity. Similar conclusion
was drawn in μSR measurements of Ba1−xKxFe2As2 [61]. In underdoped Ba1−x-
KxFe2As2 hosting bulk superconductivity, the magnetic volume fraction below Tc is
100%, suggesting that AF order and the superconductivity coexist in a microscopic
scale [61]. Complete understanding concerning this issue is still lacking and remains
to be explored experimentally and theoretically. In this thesis, one important work
is to clarify the correlations between the AF order, the lattice distortion and the
superconductivity close to optimal doping of BaFe2−xNixAs2, as we shall discuss in
Chaps.4 and 5.

Neutron Scattering
3.1
Historical Overview
Neutron is a charge-neutral particle discovered in 1932 by James Chadwick, who
won the Nobel prize in physics for this discovery in 1935. Neutron is an subatomic
particle with zero charge and slightly larger mass than proton (mn = 1.674927471 ×
1027 kg). It has a spin of 1/2 and magnetic moment μn = γ μNσn, where γ = −1.913
is geometric ratio and μN = e¯h/(2m p) is nuclear magneton. Therefore, the mag-
netic moment of neutron is 1.913μN, or 1.0419 × 10−3μB. Because of its magnetic
moment, neutron can interact with the magnetic ﬁeld of unpaired electrons in mate-
rials and probe the magnetic information. Without charge, neutron is a strong pene-
trating radiation and can probe bulk information of materials without being affected
by surface effects in measurements. This is a unique advantage compared with x-ray
scattering. In addition, neutron has a mean lifetime of 886s, which is enough for
measurements.
According to the wave-particle duality of neutron, we can easily get its energy-
momentum relation. Fortunately, the wavelength of thermal neutron (∼Å) matches
the lattice spacings of condensed matter systems. With magnetic moment, neutron
is an ideal tool for probing structure and magnetic structure of condensed matter
systems. More importantly, the momenta and energies of cold neutron and thermal
neutron are similar to that for various elementary excitations such as phonon and
magnetic excitations, making neutron scattering a powerful probe of elementary
excitations in solids. With respect to its energy, neutron can be classiﬁed as: cold
neutron (0.1–10meV), thermal neutron (10–100meV), hot neutron (100–500meV)
and epithermal neutron (>500meV). The interactions between neutron and matter
are very weak. The corresponding theoretical analysis are therefore simple [1].
Because of the wave-particle duality of neutron and the development of electron
diffraction technique, neutron diffraction was demonstrated to be feasible in principle
by von Halban in 1936. However, neutron diffraction was not developed to be a
practical experimental method due to the low ﬂux of the neutron sources at that time.
In 1938, German physicist Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn discovered nuclear ﬁssion.

Neutron Scattering
In 1944, Fermi and his colleagues built the ﬁrst nuclear reactor, in which the nuclear
chain reaction can generate high ﬂux neutron beam. Neutron scattering studies were
performed since powerful nuclear reactors were built, such as the reactors in Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in United States and Chalk River Laboratory in Canada.
In Oak Ridge, Ernest Wollan and Clifford G. Shull developed a two-axis neutron
diffractometer since 1946 and applied it to structural determination of crystal. They
observed the antiferromagnetic Bragg peak of MnO crystal and demonstrated the
existence of antiferromagnetic order. In the ﬁrst several years of neutron scattering,
most studies focused on diffraction measurements. In 1952, Bertram Brockhouse
in Chalk River Laboratory invented the triple-axis spectrometer that can be used
to do inelastic neutron scattering. Triple-axis spectrometer were used to measure
phonon dispersions of some crystals and showed that inelastic neutron scattering is
a powerful spectroscopy method. Nowadays, neutron triple-axis spectrometer is still
an important tool for studying lattice and spin dynamics of solids. In 1994, Clifford
G. Shull and Bertram Brockhouse were awarded the Nobel prize in physics for their
original contributions in applying neutron scattering to the studies of condensed
matter physics [2].
Inspired by the ﬁrst neutron scattering studies performed by Wollan et al., neutron
scattering techniques were developed quickly. Several nuclear reactors designed for
neutron scattering were built since then. The ﬁrst reactor for neutron scattering is
the HFBR (High-ﬂux beam reactor) in Brookhaven National Laboratory in United
States. Later, Insitut Laue-Langevin was built in 1971 and is an international neu-
tron scattering center nowadays. Similar neutron sources include Orphée in France
(1980), FRM II (MLZ) in Germany (2003), OPAL in Austrilia, JRRR in Japan,
CARR in China. Meanwhile, pulsed neutron spallation sources were also devel-
oped. The time-of-ﬂight technique and the accessibility of high energy neutrons in
pulsed spallation neutron source make it indispensable for neutron scattering studies
of condensed matter systems. The operating spallation neutron sources around the
world include ISIS at Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory in United Kingdom, SNS
at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in United States and J-PARC in Japan. With
rapid development of condensed matter physics, more advanced neutron sources and
instruments are required. The Chinese Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) and the
European Spallation Source (ESS) in construction will play important roles in future
neutron scattering studies [2].

Principles
Neutron scattering is a well developed experimental technique. The related theoret-
ical principles have been well descripted in several text books [2–4]. In this section,
we are going to introduce the principles of neutron scattering associated with our
studies.

In neutron scattering, a monochromatized neutron beam strike a sample and are
scattered because of the interactions between neutron and the sample. The energy-
momentum distribution of the scattered neutrons are analyzed and detected by spe-
ciﬁc analyzer and detector. Assuming the wave vectors of the incident and scattered
neutrons are ki and k f , respectively, and the scattering angle between ki and k f is
2θ, as shown in Fig.3.1. The momentum transfer (Q) for this scattering process is
Q = ki −k f .

In neutron scattering measurement, the detected signal is the differential cross section
d2σ
ddE f , deﬁned as the number of neutrons scattered into a solid angle d with energy
between E f and E f +dE f per second. It is usually normalized to incident neutron
ﬂux. Assuming the incident neutron ﬂux is Φ0, the detector efﬁciency is 100%, we
get neutron counting rate

Considering full solid angle and all energies, we get total scattering cross section
σtot = Itot/Φ0,
(3.4)
where Itot is the sum of the scattered neutrons. According to the deﬁnition of the
differential cross section, scattering cross section is actually a transition rate of the
neutron-sample system. From quantum theory of transition, the differential cross
section can be written as

Wkiσiλi→k f σ f λ f is the transition rate of the neutron-sample system from initial state
to ﬁnal state. (ki, σi) and (k f , σ f ) denote the initial and ﬁnal state of neutron, and λi
and λ f the initial and ﬁnal state of the system interacting with neutron. According
to Fermi golden rule, taking into account the initial and ﬁnal states, the differential
scattering cross section can be written as:

where pλi is the probability distribution of the initial state λi and pσi the probability
distribution of the initial spin state σi of the neutron. Therefore, the interacting
potential V (r) determines the scattering cross section. Different potential V (r) such
as neutron-nuclear interactions and neutron-unpaired electron interactions can result
in different cross sections [3, 4].

3.2.2
Nuclear Scattering
Since the range of nuclear force is much smaller than the wavelength of thermal
neutron, the scattering is dominated by s wave (l = 0). For the scattering involving
a single nucleus, the scattering amplitude can be denoted by a complex parameter b
(scattering length). The imaginary part of b describes neutron absorption (absorption
cross section). The total cross section is the sum of the scattering cross section and
the absorption cross section:
σtot = σs + σa = 4π|b|2 + 4π
ki
Im(b)
(3.8)
Since absorption cross section in most elements are quite small, we neglect it in most
cases and get:
σtot ≃σs = 4π|b|2.
(3.9)
Based on Eq.3.9, the cross sections in our discussions below are all real. Different
isotopes of the same elements usually have different scattering lengthes. The scatter-
ing length depends on the relative direction between the spins of neutron and nucleus
when the net spin of the nucleus is not zero.
Scattering cross section usually contains coherent and incoherent parts. Generally,
the differential cross section for a single nucleus can be expressed as:

where
σc = 4π(b)2
(3.11)
and
σinc = 4π(b2 −(b)2)
(3.12)
represent the coherent and incoherent parts of the total scattering cross sections,
respectively. Coherent cross sections usually arise from coherent scattering associ-
ated with lattice, for instance, Bragg scattering and phonon scattering. Incoherent
cross sections come from the interactions between the spins of neutron and nucleus,
which is usually isotropic. The later can be treated as a background and need to be
subtracted before analyzing the coherent scattering signals.
The nuclear coherent scattering depends on the positions of the atoms in sample.

Since incoherent scattering cross section (σinc) is isotropic and can be easily
calculated from Eq.3.15, material with strong σinc (such as Vanadium) [5] is usually
used as a standard sample to calibrate the magnitude of the elementary excitations
in materials. For example, the cross section of vanadium is dominated by σinc ≈500
barns (σc ≈2 barns). Therefore, the elementary excitations in solids are usually
compared with that of a standard vanadium sample to get its absolute intensity.
We have discussed above the elastic nuclear scattering. The inelastic nuclear
scattering is not described here, which can be referred to Ref. [3].
3.2.3
Magnetic Interactions and Elastic Magnetic Scattering
Magnetic neutron scattering arises from the interactions between the magnetic
moment of neutron and the magnetic ﬁeld generated by magnetic ions (with unpaired
electrons) inside magnetic materials. The interacting potential for magnetic neutron
scattering can be written as
VM(r) = −μn · B(r),
(3.16)
in which μn is the magnetic moment of neutron and B represents the local magnetic
ﬁeld around magnetic ions. Do Fourier transform for Eq.3.16 and use Maxwell’s
equations, we have
VM(Q) = −μn · B(Q) = −μ0μn · M⊥(Q),
(3.17)

3.2 Principles
35
where M⊥(Q) represents the magnetization projected to the direction perpendicular
to the scattering wave vector:
M⊥(Q) = ˆQ × {M( ˆQ) × ˆQ}.
(3.18)
The expression of M⊥(Q) is usually complicated and material dependent. Often-
times, dipole approximation is enough for describing the interacting potential. In 3d
transition-metal ions, the spin-orbit coupled total angular momentum J is not a good
quantum number, because the orbital angular momentum L is usually quenched by
crystal ﬁeld. In this case, the very small residual L along S caused by spin-orbit
coupling can be denoted by (g −2)S. With dipole approximation, the magnetization
can be written as
M(Q) = −gμB f (Q)S = f (Q)μ,
(3.19)
in which, μ = −gμBS and f (Q) are the magnetic moment and the magnetic form
factor of the magnetic ion, respectively. g is Landé factor determined by spin and
orbit angular momenta. g equals 2 for a system without L, while systems where L
is not completely quenched will have a different g value.
In magnetic ordered system, neutron diffraction can probe the magnetic Bragg
peaks corresponding to the magnetic order. A magnetic Bragg peak is an average
of the scattering from the whole sample. The magnetic moment of the ions forming
the magnetic order can be derived from the intensity of the magnetic Bragg peaks.
Correlation length for the magnetic order can be estimated from the width of the
magnetic Bragg peaks. The temperature dependence of the intensity for a magnetic
Bragg peak represents the magnetic order parameter. Similar to elastic nuclear scat-
tering, magnetic Bragg peaks can be observed when the momentum transfer Q is
coincident with the magnetic wave vector in reciprocal space. For example, in long
range antiferromagnetic system such as MnO, since the magnetic unit cell is one
time larger than the structural unit cell, the magnetic Bragg peaks can be observed
at half integers in reciprocal lattice.
In dipole approximation, magnetic elastic scattering cross section can be written
as

3.2.4
Coherent Inelastic Magnetic Scattering
The principles of inelastic magnetic scattering is the basis of neutron scattering as
a powerful tool for probing magnetic excitations [3, 4, 6]. Since one of our aims is
to understand the doping evolution of the magnetic excitations collected by neutron
scattering, the principles for inelastic neutron scattering is crucial for analyzing and
understanding the data. In inelastic magnetic scattering, the cross section can be
written as

which depends on ki and k f and contains the momentum-dependent Debye-waller

the density of the unpaired electrons in a single magnetic ion. r0 = e2/(mec2) is the
radius of electron. In Eq.3.22, dynamic structure factor S(Q, ω) is the essential part
of the scattering cross section. In detail, it can be expressed as

3.2.5
Dynamic Structure Factor S(Q, ω) and Generalized
Susceptibility χ′′(Q, ω)
The dynamic structure factor S(Q, ω) of a system contains all the information of the
magnetic dynamics such as dispersion and spectral weight distribution. Meanwhile,
it can be calculated from linear response theory based on the magnetic properties
of the studied system. Therefore, S(Q, ω) can bridge the experimental observations
and theoretical scenarios, which is signiﬁcant for understanding the spin dynamics
of a magnetic system [6–8].
In a linear system, the response (R(x, t)) induced by a small external perturbation
(H(x, t)) is proportional to the perturbation R(x, t) = χ(x, t) · H(x, t). This linear
relation also holds when the perturbation is weak in a non-linear system. In these
cases, the χ(x, t) between the response and the perturbation is termed response func-
tion (or generalized susceptibility), which describes the susceptibility of a system
to external perturbations. A simple example of susceptibility is the static magnetic
susceptibility. In the measurements of magnetic dynamics, the interaction between
neutron and sample is a perturbation. The magnetic dynamics excited by the inter-
action is the response to the perturbation and therefore can be described by linear
response theory. If the response function χ(Q, ω) of a spin system is known, it will
be straightforward to get its response to external perturbation H(Q, ω) by χ · H.
In order to compare the scattering function Sα,β(Q, ω) with theoretical calculation
results, we need to introduce the corresponding susceptibility χ′′
α,β(Q, ω). General-
ized susceptibility is a complex function (χ(Q, ω) = χ′(Q, ω) + iχ′′(Q, ω)) which
can be calculated from linear response theory [7]. The real part χ′(Q, ω) describe
the in-phase response and the imaginary part χ′′(Q, ω) is the out-of-phase response
which describes the energy dissipation of the system caused by external perturbation.
Assuming the imaginary part will be zero while ω approaches inﬁnity, the real part
and the imaginary part can be connected via the Krammers-Kroning relations
χ′αβ = −2ω
π p

χ′(Q, ω′)

(3.26)
in which p means taking the principal value of the integral.
The dynamic structural factor S(Q, ω) and the imaginary part of the generalized
susceptibility χα,β(Q, ω) can be connected via the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem,
Sαβ(Q, ω) = {n(ω) + 1} 1

(3.27)
where

is Bose factor. Thus, the dynamic correlation function Sαβ(Q, ω) determines the
magnetic dynamics of the studied system. Detailed discussions about the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem and its applications in magnetic materials can be referred to Ref.
[7].
From detailed balance theorem, an important relation about the dynamic correla-
tion function can be derived:
Sαβ(Q, ω) = eℏω/kBT Sαβ(−Q, −ω).
(3.29)
It means that the neutron energy loss processes (ω > 0) will dominate when the
system is at low temperature (close to groundstate), while the neutron energy gain
processes will become important at high temperature, where the thermal-excited
elementary excitations can give energy to the scattered neutrons.
The determination of the χ′′(Q, ω) in iron pnictides will be discussed in Chap.7.
3.3
Neutron Scattering Spectrometry
Neutron scattering plays an important role in the studies of condensed matter systems.
Various neutron scattering techniques have been widely used in many ﬁelds such
as biological physics, physical chemistry, and solid state physics. In this thesis,
we focus on the studies of the magnetic order and spin dynamics in iron-based
superconductors. Here we introduce the principles of two kinds of spectrometers,
triple-axis spectrometer and time-of-ﬂight spectrometer, which were used in our
studies.
3.3.1
Triple-Axis Spectrometry
Triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) is the earliest neutron spectrometer designed for
probing elementary excitations in solids, and still an important tool nowadays. TAS
usually has high resolution (0.1–2meV) and can reach every point in the covered
(Q, ω) space. A variety of sample environments are compatible with TAS, make it
very ﬂexible for many research purposes. However, TAS also has some disadvan-
tages: Its coverage in (Q, ω) space is relative small (ℏω < 100meV); measurements
using TAS are usually performed point by point (or multi-points) in the (Q, ω) space,
suffering from low measuring efﬁciency.
There are many textbooks and references concerning the principle and instru-
mentation of TAS [2, 9, 10]. In this section, we will emphasize the instrumentation
and introduce some basic principles. Figure3.2 depicts the constituents of a TAS
and its regular experimental setup. A TAS usually consists of monochromator (axis
one), sample table (axis two), analyzer (axis three), collimator and detector. Through
controlling the independent three axes and tuning (ki, k f , 2θ, ψ), TAS can be driven

3.3 Neutron Scattering Spectrometry
39
to any point in the covered (Q, ω) space, by which means Q and ω are decoupled.
Usually, the measurements can only be performed within the horizontal scattering
plane.
3.3.1.1
Constituents of TAS
Thermal neutron beam guided out from a neutron source is usually well moderated by
heavy water etc., and therefore follows Maxwell’s distribution with the intensity max-
imum corresponding to the neutron energy of 25meV. The incident beam will then be
monochromatized by a monochromator and strike a sample. The scattered neutrons
are analyzed by an energy analyzer. Both the monochromator and the analyzer are
usually composed of pyrolitic graphite (PG) crystals and select single-wavelength
neutrons via Bragg reﬂection, by which ki and k f can be tuned continuously. The
Bragg law selecting the incident and exit neutrons are
λi( f ) = 2dM(A)sin(θM(A)),
(3.30)
ki( f ) = 2π
λi( f )
,
(3.31)
Ei( f ) =
ℏ2k2
i( f )
2mn
.
(3.32)
PG crystal has a constant c-axis lattice parameter with the in-plane a and b axes
aligned along different directions in different layers randomly. Its nuclear Bragg peak
(002) (c = 6.7079Å) is usually adopted to select ki and k f in neutron scattering. The
disorder in the ab plane greatly reduces the second-order scattering. The reﬂection
efﬁciency of the (002) Bragg peak is about ∼60–70%. Another advantage of using
PG as monochromator and analyzer is that PG ﬁlter can be applied simultaneously.
The monochromatized neutron beam has a divergence angle, especially after
focusing. The divergence angle broadens the energy and momentum resolution of
TAS. This issue happens to various parts of a spectrometer. Since the scattering plane
is within horizontal plane, it is necessary to reduce the divergence angle of ki and
k f within the scattering plane to improve the energy and momentum resolution.
Inserting a collimator has been used to greatly alleviate this issue. Collimator con-
tains many parallel-arranged sheets made of neutron-absorbing materials (Fig.3.2b).
Assuming the width of the slit between two adjacent sheets is d and the length of
the collimator (along beam direction) is L, the horizontal divergence angle for this
collimator is α = d
L . Tight collimator can improve energy and momentum resolution
but decrease neutron ﬂux. The height of collimator is usually ﬁxed.
According to Eq.3.30, higher-order neutrons with λ/n (n = 2, 3 . . .) also sat-
isfy the Bragg law used by monochromator and analyzer, and will result in strong
background. Neutron ﬁlters are usually used to remove the contamination from
higher-order neutrons. For different energy ranges, various ﬁlters can be applied.
Before monochromator, sapphire can be used as a preliminary ﬁlter to remove high

plot corresponding to the energy scan in (d)
energy neutrons (>100meV). PG ﬁlter is usually used between monochromator and
sample to remove the λ/2 neutrons and reduce the background. PG ﬁlter has high
transmission efﬁciency for speciﬁc wavelengths and can scatter the correspond-
ing λ/2 neutrons. For instance, the transmission efﬁciency for the neutrons with
λ ≈2.36 Å(ki ≈2.662Å−1, Ei = 14.7meV) is 80%, while the corresponding λ/2

3.3 Neutron Scattering Spectrometry
41
and λ/3 neutrons are blocked by 99% and 98%, respectively. Similar energy win-
dows for PG include 13.7, 30.5 and 41meV. Another two important ﬁlters for lower
energies are Be and BeO polycrystals, which are usually used in cold neutron triple-
axis spectrometer. For instance, the Be ﬁlter cooled by liquiﬁed N2 can effectively
remove the neutrons above the energy of 5meV.
On the ﬂight path of neutron, some diaphragms can be placed before and after the
sample, the sizes of the diaphragms can be adjusted to reduce the background. The
scattered neutrons will be analyzed and then arrive at the detectors (Fig.3.2a). The
mostly used neutron detector is 3He tube. The nuclear interaction between neutron
and 3He (n + 3He →p +3H +764keV) generates charged particles which can be
detected.
3.3.1.2
Neutron Scattering Measurement
Figure3.2 shows the “W” geometry of the triple-axis spectrometer, which can be
different for different spectrometers. Looking towards the direction neutron travels
along, if the instrument components after next axis is on the right, we record it as “+”,
otherwise “−”. The “W” geometry shown in Fig.3.2a, b is “+ −+” conﬁguration.
In neutron scattering measurement, exit energy E f (k f ) is usually ﬁxed. Energy
transfer ET = Ei −E f is determined by incident energy Ei (ki) controlled by the
monochromator. Momentum transfer depends on the scattering angle 2θ and the
sample rotating angle ψ (relative to ki) shown in Fig.3.2c.
The procedures for a neutron scattering experiment using TAS is as follows.
The ﬁrst step is to align sample and determine the scattering plane by ﬁnding
two nuclear Bragg peaks and input their corresponding instrumental parameters
(2θM, ψ, 2θ, 2θA) into the controlling software, where 2θM(2θA) is the scattering
angle for monochromator (analyzer). The two reciprocal lattice points within the scat-
tering plane determine a UB matrix, by which the parameters (2θM, ψ, 2θ, 2θA) for
any point in this scattering plane can be calculated. For example, the [H, 0, L] scatter-
ing plane of BaFe2As2 can be determined by ﬁnding and optimizing the nuclear peaks
(200) and (006), for which the 2θ are known from the lattice parameters of BaFe2As2.
Having determined the UB matrix, every point in the (Q, ET ) space covered by the
TAS can be automatically calculated and reached. According to the scan input into the
controlling software, the system will drive the six motors (θM, 2θM, ψ, 2θ, θA, 2θA)
to the corresponding parameters. Note there are two motors for monochromator and
analyzer. For monochromator, 2θM is the motor for rotating the monochromator,
whereas θM is the motor controlling the opening angle of the shielding for the mono-
chromator. It is also this case for the analyzer. At some spectrometers, these six
angles are named as A1–A6. These six motors can drive the spectrometer to speciﬁc
positions in (Q, ET ) space.
Figure3.2c is the operating principles of TAS. Since E f is usually ﬁxed, the
energy transfer can only be tuned by changing Ei. In Fig.3.2c, the parameters for
a point in (Q, ω) space, ki, 2θ and ψ are known, and the energy transfer is ET =
ℏω = Ei −E f . We then have

(3.34)
which determines the kinetic limit of TAS, that is, the area in (Q, ω) space that
can be reached. In other words, whether a (Q, ω) point can be reached depends on
whether (ki, kf, Q) can form a closed triangle. Since TAS measure point by point
in (ki, kf, Q) space, Q and ω are decoupled to some extent. Two types of scans are
usually used, constant energy scan (momentum scan) and constant momentum scan
(energy scan), which are shown in Fig.3.2d, e. Another advantage of TAS is that it
can be used for polarized neutron scattering experiment, see Ref. [3, 11] for details.
3.3.1.3
Resolution of TAS
Because of the divergence angle of neutron beam, and the mosaics of monochromator
and analyzer, the energy and momentum resolution of TAS has its proﬁle in (Q, ω)
space. The resolution function can be analyzed through its projection onto the planes
determined by any two of the four axes (ω, Q∥, Q⊥, Qz) of the (Q, ω) space [10]. Q∥
represents the direction parallel to Q, and Q⊥the direction perpendicular to Q, in the
scattering plane. Qz denotes the direction normal to the scattering plane. Since all the
measurements are performed in the scattering plane, the height of the collimators is
usually set to be large to integrate the signals along vertical direction. This results in a
coarse Qz, which is not crucial. Therefore, we do not need to consider the dimension
Qz. The resolution function form an ellipsoid in the space of (ω, Q∥, Q⊥). We need
to consider only the projection of this ellipsoid onto any planes in the (ω, Q∥, Q⊥)
space (Fig.3.2d). The resolution ellipsoid is determined by four collimator (neutron
source to monochromator, monochromator to sample, sample to analyzer, analyzer
to detector), three mosaics (sample, monochromator, analyzer), two wave vectors
(ki, k f ) and one spectrometer conﬁguration [12].
3.3.2
Time-of-Flight Spectrometry
Neutron time-of-ﬂight spectrometry is a neutron scattering technique characterizing
the energy of neutron by its time of ﬂight from neutron source to detector, and the
momentum by its energy and scattering angle. In this section, we will introduce the
principles and the instrumentation for time-of-ﬂight spectrometry based on spallation
neutron source.

3.3 Neutron Scattering Spectrometry

3.3.2.1
Spallation Neutron Source
Different from nuclear reactor neutron source where neutrons are generated by
self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, spallation neutron source produces neutrons
through bombarding neutron-rich heavy elements (such as tungsten, mercury) with
high energy protons accelerated by synchrotron [2].
Taking ISIS spallation neutron source as an example, we describe the procedures
for producing neutrons below. ISIS spallation source contains an 800MeV proton
synchrotron which can generate 2.5 × 1013 protons in every pulse, with an average
ﬂux of 200 µA. ISIS consists of several components (Fig.3.3) [2]. (1) A linear accel-
erator used to accelerate the H−ions injected into the accelerator to 70MeV. Here,
the injected H−pulses have a frequency of 50Hz and a width (in time domain) of
500µs. The average ﬂux is 20mA. Afterwards, the electrons of these H−ions will
be removed at (2) an injection module at which the H+ ions (protons) will be injected
into the synchrotron. The injected proton pulse will be accelerated to 800MeV within
10ms and split into two narrower pulses (90ns in width) with a time difference of
210ns between them. Here the average proton ﬂux reaches 200 µA. After the accel-
eration in the synchrotron, the proton pulses will be guided out at (3). The extracted
proton pulses will be guided by quadropolar magnet through the (4) extracted proton
beam and arrive the (5) target station, where high energy proton pulses strike the
heavy element target and generate high energy neutrons. The power of the spallation
process is 160kW.

3.3.2.2
Time-of-Flight Spectrometer
In Fig.3.4, we take MERLIN spectrometer in ISIS spallation neutron source to show
the principles of the direct geometry time-of-ﬂight (TOF) spectrometer. Time of
ﬂight of neutron from the source/moderator to the position-sensitive detector (PSD)
is the essential part of the TOF spectrometry, by which magnetic excitations in large
area of the (Q, ω) space can be measured simultaneously.
Figure3.4a shows the components ranging from target to detector. The neutrons
generated at target have very high energy and will be under moderated at the mod-
erator, after which the neutrons mostly fall into the energy range between ∼10 and
∼1000 meV. With high energy (above 100meV) neutrons, TOF spectrometer at
spallation neutron source is ideal for probing high energy magnetic excitations.
Afterwards, the neutron pulse enters the beamline for TOF spectrometer. To record
the time of ﬂight of the neutrons, we can set the moment at which the neutrons
depart from the moderator as t = 0 (Fig.3.4). Then the neutrons arrives at the sloppy
chopper which remove the very high energy neutrons. Note that since the neutron
pulse frequency of ISIS is 50Hz, the sloppy chopper must have the same frequency
and a proper phase.
Subsequently, the neutron pulse reaches the the Fermi chopper (also the mono-
chromator) which consists of a group of arc slits made by neutron-absorbing mater-
ial. Distinct from the monochromator in TAS, in which monochromatic neutrons are
selected via Bragg reﬂection, the rotating Fermi chopper “chop” speciﬁc neutrons
according to their moment (tc) arriving at the Fermi chopper. When tc match the
moment (t f ) that the opening of the slits arrive at the neutron ﬂight path, this part of
neutrons can go through, otherwise they will be absorbed or scattered. t f is called
chopper delay. Adjusting the chopper delay to match different tc, monochromatic
neutrons with different wavelengths can be selected [2].
Chopper delay is an essential parameter for selecting monochromatic neutrons.
As depicted in Fig.3.4a, b, the distance between the moderator and the Fermi chopper
is L0, then the relation between t f and neutron energy can be expressed as:
Ei = 1
2mn
 L0

(3.35)
Therefore, t f determines the incident neutron energy.1 For ﬁxed t f (Ei), the chopper
frequency ν controls the time window (t f ) of the slit opening to neutrons. Higher ν
selects more monochromatic neutrons and lead to better energy resolution, but lower
neutron ﬂux. Since the sloppy chopper rotates with a frequency s = 50Hz (also the
neutron pulse frequency), the frequency ν of the Fermi chopper must be integer times
of the sloppy chopper
ν = ns
(3.36)

For the MERLIN TOF spectrometer, the energy range its Fermi chopper can
select is about 10–1000meV. The best energy resolution for Ei = 50meV is E =
3%Ei = 1.5meV. However, as we have mentioned, increasing the energy resolution
by using higher ν will lead to lower ﬂux. In experiments, it is generally to take a
compromise between resolution and neutron ﬂux according to the research purpose.
The distances between different components, and the time of ﬂight of neutrons versus
distance for MERLIN are shown in Fig.3.4b. Figure3.4d, e show the neutron ﬂux

versus energy and time of ﬂight, respectively. Two energies for two chopper delays
t = 1 ms (Ei = 523meV) and t = 10ms (Ei = 5.2meV) are marked by vertical
lines.
We now turn to discuss how to determine the momentum transfer Q and the
energy transfer ET . For a single measurement, one needs to measure E f with Ei
ﬁxed. Assuming the time of ﬂight between Fermi chopper and sample (distance L1)
of a monochromatic neutron beam is t1, we have:
Ei = ℏ2k2
i
2mn
(3.37)
t1 = L1
v1
= mnL1
ℏki
(3.38)
Since the time of ﬂight of a neutron from Fermi chopper to detector, denoted by ttot,
can be measured directly, the time of ﬂight from sample to detector is:
t2 = ttot −t1.
(3.39)
Then it is easy to get the k f for scattered neutrons:
k f = mnL2
ℏt2
(3.40)
and the exit energy:
E f =
ℏ2k2
f
2mn
.
(3.41)
The energy transfer is deﬁned as:
ET = ℏω = Ei −E f ,
(3.42)
the scattering angle is φ, which can be recorded by the position sensitive detector
(PSD). Therefore, the momentum transfer Q can be written as:
Q2 = k2
i + k2
f −2kik f cosφ.
(3.43)
Since Ei is ﬁxed, we have the relation between Q and ℏω:
ℏ2Q2
2mn
= 2Ei −ℏω −2

Ei(Ei −ℏω)cosφ.
(3.44)
Thanks to the fast development of the large-area PSD, the spectrometer can record
the ttot and the scattering angle φ for every scattered neutron. The relation between

3.3 Neutron Scattering Spectrometry
47
Q and ℏω for every scattered neutron can be calculated from the parameters ki, ttot
and φ.
The detector bank of the MERLIN spectrometer is composed of 300 tubes (3m
long and 25mm in diameter) ﬁlled by several bars of 3He gas. As shown in Fig.3.4c,
the detector bank surrounds the sample position along both vertical and horizontal
directions. Its coverage in angle along horizontal direction is −45◦to 135◦and
vertical from −30◦to 30◦, with a coverage of 3.1 solid angle. The spatial resolution
of the 3He tube is the diameter along horizontal direction and 20 mm along vertical
direction. The whole detector bank has 50000 pixels and can cover several Brillouin
zones at a moderate Ei (such as 200meV) for solids (such as cuprates and iron
pnictides). Combined with electronic parts and controlling software, PSD is the
essential part of a TOF spectrometer [2].
3.3.2.3
Characteristics of TOF Spectrometry
Equations3.43 and 3.44 are the kinetic limits of neutron scattering measurement and
have been derived in describing the principles of TAS (Eqs.3.33 and 3.34). In the
measurements on TAS, the exit energy E f is usually ﬁxed and the incident energy
Ei (ki) will be systematically changed to perform a scan in the (Q, ω) space. The
momentum Q and the energy transfer ℏω can be controlled independently. The count-
ing time for every (Q, ω) point is in the order of minute. However, TOF measurement
need to be performed with a ﬁxed ki and sample angle ψ for much longer count-
ing time (several hours or even longer), in which the scattered neutrons follow the
kinetics determined by Eqs.3.43 and 3.44 and fall onto a paraboloid in (Q∥, Q⊥, ω)
space (Fig.3.5a). Here, Q∥is the direction parallel to ki and Q⊥perpendicular to ki.
This means that Q and ℏω are coupled through Eqs.3.43 and 3.44, which must be
taken into account in TOF measurements.
The dynamic structure factor S(Q, ω) is a function in the (Q, ω) space. The
TOF measurements of S(Q, ω) can only be performed in three-dimensional space,
resulting in a coupling between ET and Qz which is also determined by Eq.3.44.
For example, Fig.3.5b shows the projection of the scattering paraboloid onto the
[H, 0, L] scattering plane of BaFe2As2, with ki ∥L. As we can see, the ﬁx ki can
cover several Brillouin zones along L such as L = 1, 3, 5 . . .. The blue curves are
constant-energy curves. The energy transfers in these identical Brillouin zones are
different, leading to an advantage that one can get several energy transfers corre-
sponding to the same reduced in-plane wave vector. As shown in Fig.3.5b, it is
apparent that the identical in-plane wave vector (1, 0) at L = 1, 3 and 5 correspond
to different energy transfers. This advantage greatly improves the measuring efﬁ-
ciency. On the other hand, for measuring the signal at certain ET and a speciﬁc Q,
one must calculate the correct ki using Eq.3.44.
Havingdiscussedthescatteringparaboloidforﬁxed(ki, ψ),weneedtothinkabout
the elementary excitations in the systems studied by TOF measurements. Layered
compounds such as cuprates and iron pnictides exhibit very weak c-axis magnetic
coupling, leading to weak L dependence of their magnetic excitations. In this case,

the scattering function S(Q, ω) is like a paraboloid in (H, K, ET ) space (Fig.3.5).
The overlap between the neutron scattering paraboloid and the S(Q, ω) dispersion
is the signal that can be probed by TOF spectrometry. Figure3.5c is a schematic
for the overlap between the paraboloid and the dispersion in ℏω-[1 0 −1] plane.
The corresponding intensity along energy shows the signal at the overlapping points
clearly. Figure3.5d is an example in a real material KCuF3 [18]. The dispersion
of the S(Q, ω) and the scattering paraboloid are projected to the ET -L plane. The
red curves denote the scattering paraboloids with two different incident energies
Ei = 150 and 100meV. The overlapping parts are marked by thick brown curves
S1 to S3. Correspondingly, the real signal that can be probed by TOF (S1–S4) are
shown in Fig.3.5e. The decrease of the signal with increasing momentum is mainly

caused by the magnetic form factor of Cu2+. Figure3.5f shows the magnon dispersion
for La1−xCaxMnO3 and a scattering paraboloid cutting the dispersions. The probed
signal will be two circles in [Qx, Qy, ET ] space, as indicated by the red circles in
Fig.3.5f.
Sometimes, in order to decouple the energy transfer ET from the momentum Qz
and obtain full dispersion of an elementary excitation in a three dimensional material,
the TOF measurements need to be performed with various (ki, ψ) and the data need
to be combined to a 4D dataset by special data analyzing software (such as Horace)
[20, 21]. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, several important magnetic systmems
show low dimensional magnetic properties. For example, the cuprate and iron-based
superconductors exhibit weak magnetic coupling along c axis and weak dispersion
along L. Therefore, the full dispersion for the magnetic excitations in these systems
can be performed with ki∥L. It is also this case for other low dimensional systems.
The collected data can be calibrated and converted to absolute value by their
comparison with the phonon spectrum of the same sample or the incoherent scattering
of a standard vanadium sample [12, 22]. Vanadium can be used as a standard because
its cross section is well known and dominated by isotropic incoherent scattering. Its
incoherent scattering cross section (500 barns) is 250 times of its coherent cross
section (2 barns).

Chapter 4
Phase Diagram and Avoided Quantum
Criticality in BaFe2−xNixAs2
In this chapter, we describe the determination of the magnetic and structural phase
diagram of BaFe2−xNixAs2 using high resolution synchrotron x-ray and neutron
diffractions. The detailed doping evolution of the orders close to optimal doping
reveals that the purported quantum criticality in electron-doped BaFe2As2 is avoided
by the emergence of an incommensurate antiferromagnetic order. We also ﬁnd a
strong magnetoelastic coupling in the BaFe2−xNixAs2 system.
4.1
Background and Motivation
A determination of the structural and magnetic phase diagram in correlated materials
is essential for understanding their ground states and dynamic properties. In the iron
pnictides, superconductivity emerges at the border of both structural and antiferro-
magnetic (AF) orders (Fig.4.1). This motivates the exploration of quantum critical
points (QCP), where the transition temperatures for such orders are continuously sup-
pressed to zero by a nonthermal control parameter. Figure4.1 brieﬂy introduces the
concept of QCP and the possible quantum criticality in carrier-doped BaFe2As2. A
quantum phase transition (QPT) is driven by quantum ﬂuctuations instead of thermal
ﬂuctuations that drive classical phase transitions. Figure4.1a illustrates the general
concept of a QPT [1]. Consider a system described by Hamiltonian H(g) = H0+gH1,
in which H0 commutes with H1 and g is a nonthermal control parameter such as
magnetic ﬁeld, pressure, or doping. With increasing g, the ground state and the ﬁrst
excited state of this system could be reversed at g = gc (Fig.4.1a), after which the
ﬁrst excited state becomes the new ground state. This abrupt change of the ground
state at gc is a QPT, the point g = gc, T = 0 is the QCP. A second-order transition
at T > 0 could be connected to a QCP. As shown in Fig.4.1b, the second-order
phase transition temperature is gradually suppressed with increasing g, as well as the
phase ﬂuctuating region. The transition temperature is completely suppressed and

the phase ﬂuctuations converge to g = gc and T = 0, which is the QCP [1], as we
have mentioned above.
In doped BaFe2As2 systems, the parent compound exhibits simultaneous struc-
tural and magnetic phase transitions at Ts ≈TN ≈138 K. Upon doping, both transi-
tions are smoothly suppressed and disappear at optimal doping, suggesting possible
structural and magnetic QCPs in doped BaFe2As2 systems. Speciﬁcally, possible
QCP in doped BaFe2As2 could exist at the border separating the AF order and the
paramagnetic state at T = 0 beneath the superconducting dome. Since the QCP in
iron pnictides is expected to appear near optimal doping, it could be intimately con-
nected with superconductivity and thereby has attracted substantial research interest.
Thoughquantumcriticalpointisatzerotemperatureandcannotbeprobeddirectly,
it can induce quantum critical ﬂuctuations over a large temperature region close to
the QCP. As shown in Fig.4.1c, the non-Fermi liquid behavior near optimal doping
of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 was suggested to be driven by the quantum critical ﬂuctuations

associated with a QCP at optimal doping, and thereby supports the existence of a
QCP in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 [2], which is also supported by the observation of divergent
penetration depth close to optimal doping [3].
Although quantum criticality in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 has received much interest,
whether there is a QCP in electron-doped BaFe2As2 such as Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 and
BaFe2−xNixAs2 remain elusive and rarely studied [5, 6]. Upon electron doping of
BaFe2As2 via partially replacing Fe by Co or Ni, various experiments reveal that the
structural and magnetic phase transition temperatures Ts and TN in BaFe2−xTxAs2
(T =Co, Ni) gradually decrease and separate with increasing x and have Ts > TN
for all doping levels. In the initial x-ray and neutron scattering work on Ba(Fe1−x-
Cox)2As2, it was suggested that the separated Ts and TN smoothly extend into the
superconducting dome, resulting in distinct structural and magnetic QCPs at different
x. Subsequent x-ray [6] and neutron [7–9] scattering experiments on superconducting
BaFe2−xTxAs2 samples with coexisting AF order revealed that superconductivity
actuallycompeteswithstaticAForderandlatticeorthorhombicity.Asaconsequence,
the smoothly decreasing Ts and TN are reported to bend back below Tc, and the
orthorhombic structure above Tc for an optimally doped sample evolves back to a
tetragonal structure well below Tc (termed the “reentrant” tetragonal phase) [6].
Although x-ray and neutron diffractions have established the detailed structural
and magnetic phase diagram of Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 (Fig.2.6), similar measurements
have not been carried out on BaFe2−xNixAs2. Previous transport and magnetic mea-
surements did not provide enough details close to optimal doping (Fig.4.1d) [5].
From the determination of the detailed phase diagram of BaFe2−xNixAs2, we aim
to sort out whether quantum criticality could exist in electron-doped systems. The
detailed phase diagram will also shed light on understanding the interplay between
the orders.
4.2
Sample Preparation
The ﬁrst step for determining the phase diagram of BaFe2−xNixAs2 is to prepare high
quality single crystals for systematic dopings x covering the underdoped regime and
the whole superconducting dome. We have successfully grown a series of large Ba-
Fe2−xNixAs2 single crystals using self-ﬂux method [4]. The Fe2−xNixAs2 precursor
(also ﬂux) is ﬁrstly prepared by heating the mixture of pure Fe, Ni and As powder
to about 500 ◦C, staying for 20h and subsequently heating to 700 ◦C and staying for
15h. In order to make the precursor homogeneous, this procedure is usually repeated
3 times, with the ﬁnal temperature increasing by 20 ◦C in every sintering. For single
crystal growth, Ba pieces and Fe2−xNixAs2 ﬂux are loaded into a Al2O3 crucible with
a ratio Ba:Fe2−xNixAs2 = 1 : 5. The materials are sealed into a quartz tube under
high vacuum and put into a furnace. For sample growth, the materials are heated to
1180 ◦C and kept there for 10h. Afterwards, the melted materials cool down at a rate
of 5 ◦C per hour to 1050 ◦C and are then quenched to room temperature. After the
procedures is ﬁnished, single crystals can be cleaved out from the products.
Figure4.2a shows the large crystals grown by the self-ﬂux method. The average
size exceeds 1cm for all the dopings ranging from x = 0 to x = 0.3, with average

transport, magnetic and neutron diffraction measurements shown in Fig.4.2b–g. The
x-ray diffractions in Fig.4.2b shows good crystal quality along c axis, with the c-axis
lattice parameters summarized in Fig.4.2c. Figure4.2c also shows a linear relation
between the real doping x′ and the nominal doping x, indicating the sample growth
method is reliable and the doping can be accurately controlled. For simplicity, we
adopt the nominal doping throughout our studies. Figure4.2d, e are rocking curves
of the tetragonal nuclear Bragg peak (220) for various dopings. The full width at half
maximums (FWHM) of these peaks are in the range between 0.28◦and 0.41◦, which
is good enough for high resolution neutron diffraction measurements. Figure4.2f

from structural and magnetic phase transitions, as marked by vertical arrows. The
superconducting transitions are very sharp from both resistivity measurements in
Fig.4.2f and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements shown in Fig.4.2g, indicating
the samples are homogeneous in carrier doping.
For x-ray and neutron diffraction experiments, we selected 1–2 pieces of single
crystals for several dopings near optimal doping. Figure4.3 shows the magnetization
measurements of these dopings under zero-ﬁeld cooling (ZFC) and ﬁeld cooling
(FC), with the ab plane parallel to the applied magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic suscep-
tibility (without considering demagnetization factor) shown in Fig.4.4 reveals sharp
superconducting transitions and high superconducting volume fractions.

also revealed a commensurate-to-incommensurate (IC) AF phase transition near

gence of IC AF order close to optimal doping [11], as shown in Fig.4.4. This IC AF
order coexists and competes with the superconductivity. Its origin, though suggested
to arise from Fermi surface nesting [10], is still controversial.
Although the magnetic transitions in BaFe2−xNixAs2 have received much atten-
tion, how the AF order evolves to IC order and disappear is still unclear, and the

temperature and doping evolution of the orthorhombic lattice distortion for samples
with IC AF order remains unknown.
To resolve the unsettled issues above, we have carried out neutron scattering
experiments on BaFe2−xNixAs2 with x = 0.085, 0.092, 0.096, 0.1, 0.104 and 0.108
using the RITA-II cold neutron triple-axis spectrometer at the Paul Scherrer Institute;
the HB-1A thermal triple-axis spectrometer at the High-Flux Isotope Reactor, Oak
Ridge National Laboratory; and the C5 triple-axis spectrometer at the Canadian Neu-
tron Beam Centre, Chalk River Laboratories. We have also performed high-resolution
synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments on identical BaFe2−xNixAs2 samples using
beam line X22C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National
Laboratory. RITA-II uses a pyrolytic graphite (PG) ﬁlter before the sample and a
cold Be ﬁlter after the sample with the ﬁnal neutron energy ﬁxed at Ef = 4.6
meV [11]. HB-1A spectrometer operates with a ﬁxed incident neutron energy of
Ei = 14.64meV using a double PG monochromator. The second-order contamina-
tion in the beam was removed by placing two PG ﬁlters located before and after
the second monochromator. A collimation of 48′-48′-sample-40′-68′ from reactor
to detector was used throughout the measurements. C5 uses PG as monochromator
and analyzer with ﬁxed Ef = 14.56meV. The sample orientation and setup are sim-
ilar to those described previously [11]. For the x-ray diffraction measurements, the
monochromator was Si(111) and incident beam energy was set at Ei = 10keV with
a spot size of 1 × 1mm2 on the samples. In all cases, the data were collected on
warming from base temperature to a temperature well above Ts. Although neutron
scattering probes the bulk sample, whereas the length scale for x-ray diffraction is
typically about 5micron, both techniques are measuring the intrinsic properties of
these materials.
We begin by describing our determination of the evolution from long-range AF
order to short-range IC AF order for BaFe2−xNixAs2 using neutron diffraction.
Figure4.5a–c show transverse scans along the [1, K, 3] direction at different tem-
peratures for x = 0.085 and 0.092. Consistent with earlier results [11], a well-
deﬁned commensurate AF order appears below 44K for x = 0.085. Furthermore,
the transverse scan for x = 0.85 broadens at T = 18K, resulting in a preliminary
IC AF component mixed with the main commensurate peak, as revealed by the dif-
ference between the transverse scans collected at T = 18 and 28K. The IC AF
order is well developed in x = 0.092. Therefore, x = 0.085 is the beginning for
the transition from commensurate long-range AF order to IC short-range AF order.
Figure4.5d–f shows temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter for
x = 0.085, 0.092, 0.096, 0.1, 0.104 and 0.108. For x = 0.085, the AF order appears
approximately below TN = 44±5K and is suppressed from the onset of Tc, in agree-
ment with previous results [7, 11, 12]. Figure4.5e plots similar data for x = 0.092
and 0.096, showing TN = 40±5 and 32±5K, respectively [11]. In the previous work
on optimally electron-doped BaFe1.9Ni0.1As2 [14], it was suggested, based on cold
neutron data on mosaic crystals (0.6 g) counting 1min/point, that there is no mea-
surable static AF order. Our new measurements on the x = 0.1 sample (0.34 g) with
much longer counting time (30min/point on HB-1A) reveal a weak static AF order
with magnetic scattering 5 times smaller than that of x = 0.096 (Fig.4.5e, f). Similar

measurements on x = 0.104 also show the presence of a weak static AF order, which
is 50% smaller than that of the x = 0.1 sample. In spite of their small moments, the
temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameters for both samples indicates
that their Néel temperatures are essentially unchanged at TN = 30 ± 5K (Fig.4.5f).
Finally, we ﬁnd no evidence of static AF order for a x = 0.108 sample (0.5g) by
counting 40min/point on C5 (Fig.4.5f), indicating a gradual disappearance of the IC
AF order at x ≈0.108.
In order to directly compare the structural transition with the AF transition, the
measurements of the lattice orthorhombicity using high-resolution x-ray diffraction
have been performed on the same samples that were used in neutron scattering
measurements. Across the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition Ts, the

4.3 Structural and Magnetic Phase Transitions and Magnetoelastic Coupling
59
tetragonal peaks, for instance (2, 2, 12), will split into two orthorhombic peaks (4,
0, 12) and (0, 4, 12). Because of twinning effects, these two orthorhombic peaks
will appear to be close to each other along the same direction, as shown in Fig.2.3b.
Since ao is slightly larger than bo, |(4, 0, 12)| is smaller than |(0, 4, 12)|, resulting
in two peaks staying very close. Measuring the positions of these two peaks along a
[H, 0, L] direction can generate the corresponding ao and bo, and the orthorhombic
lattice distortion δ = (ao −bo)/(ao + bo), which is also the order parameter of the
orthorhombic phase.
In our x-ray measurements, we performed longitudinal scans along the orthorhom-
bic [H, 0, 12] direction. Figure4.6a shows the temperature-dependent scans for the
x = 0.085 sample with Tc = 16.5K. At a temperature above Ts (T = 58K), a single
resolution-limited peak is observed, in agreement with the tetragonal structure. The
single peak splits into two peaks with increasing peak separations as temperature
decreases down to Tc, as shown in the scans measured at T = 45, 30, and 17K.
Upon further cooling, the peak splitting becomes smaller below Tc, suggesting that
the sample turns back toward the tetragonal structure [6]. Figure4.6b shows temper-
ature evolution of similar scans for x = 0.096. The separated two peaks become a
single peak at T = 10.5K, in line with previous results for Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2. How-
ever, the width of the single peak is still larger than that for the peak at T = 34K,
indicating that the nearly optimal superconductor has an orthorhombic lattice dis-
tortion at T = 10.5K. In order to determine the orthorhombic lattice distortion at
even lower temperatures, we performed the same measurements using a cryostat
which can go down to 2K. The longitudinal [H, 0, 12] scans in Fig.4.6c show broad
peaks at temperatures below 10K, suggesting the presence of an orthorhombic lattice
structure even at 2K.

The temperature-dependent orthorhombic lattice distortion δ for x = 0.075,
0.085, 0.092, 0.096 and 0.1, extracted from the longitudinal scans shown in Fig.4.6
using δ = (ao −bo)/(ao + bo), are summarized in Fig.4.7a. Figure4.7b is a color
map of the lattice distortions plotted in Fig.4.7a. The doping and temperature depen-
dence of the lattice distortions are clearly illustrated in these two ﬁgures. The lattice
orthorhombicity emerges from Ts and increases while cooling, before a clear sup-
pression below Tc. With increasing doping, the lattice distortions decrease monotoni-
cally. In Fig.4.7a, Ts, TN and Tc are marked by vertical arrows. The lattice distortions
denoted by solid symbols are extracted from peak splittings, while the open sym-
bols obtained by assuming the peak broadenings close to Ts are induced by lattice
orthorhombicity, where peak splitting is too small to be resolved (Fig.4.6).
Figure4.8a,bcomparetheorderedmagneticmomentM2 andthelatticedistortions
for x = 0.096 and 0.1. Figure4.8c compare the doping dependence of M2 and
δ measured at 11K and 4K, respectively. The consistent trends between M2 and
δ in Fig.4.8a–c indicate a strong magnetoelastic coupling. The lattice distortion
for x = 0.1 (Tc = 20.2K) deserves special attention. In Fig.4.6d, although the
temperature dependent scans do not show peak splitting, the broadening of the single
peak persists to lowest measured temperature (T = 11 K). δ for x = 0.1 calculated
according to the peak broadening exhibits non-zero orthorhombic lattice distortions
below Ts = 30 ± 5K, and reveals a sharp cusp at Tc. We speculate that this anomaly
at Tc is induced by the response of the lattice to the superconducting ﬂuctuations
close to the optimal superconductivity, driven by strong electron-lattice coupling.
At T = 11K, the value of δ (2 × 10−5) is too small to conclusively determine
whether there is lattice distortion. However, given the M2 for x = 0.1 exhibits
similar evolution (Fig.4.5), we conclude that a weak AF order likely coexists with

the orthorhombic lattice distortions in optimally doped sample, different from the
reentrant tetragonal state suggested in Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 [6].
With increasing doping, the monotonic decrease of the magnetic moment and lat-
tice distortions in BaFe2−xNixAs2 shown in Fig.4.8c, and the similar doping depen-
dence for Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 and BaFe2−xNixAs2 shown in Fig.4.8d suggest pos-
sible existence of QCPs for both structural and magnetic phase transitions. Solid
evidence for a magnetic QCP is still lacking, whereas ultrasonic measurements of
shear modulus imply that a structural QCP appears close to the optimal doping
[15, 16].
We also ﬁnd that the difference between Ts and TN decrease with increase doping
for x > 0.065, that is, Ts and TN tend to merge near optimal doping (Fig.4.8d). The
interpretation of this unusual doping evolution of the separation between Ts and TN
will be discussed in next section.
The x-ray and neutron scattering measurements generate detailed information
concerningthestructuralandmagneticphasediagram,andthedopingevolutionofthe
magnetic moment (m), magnetic correlation length (ξmag) and lattice orthorhombicity
(δ), as we have summarized in Table4.1. Compared with Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2, our new

The resulting phase diagram from our detailed x-ray and neutron diffraction mea-
surements are plotted in Fig.4.9a. The inset clearly illustrate the IC-AF region where
Ts and TN reconverges. Concerning the quantum criticality in BaFe2−xNixAs2, we
start our theoretical analysis from building a Landau-Ginzberg interaction:

in which S2 is the contributions from second order terms, including the Landau
damping γ [17, 18]. The quartic term S4 describes mode-mode interaction between
magnetic ﬂuctuations on the same and on different magnetic sublattices; the last term
has a negative coefﬁcient (−v < 0), favoring the collinear alignment of spins on the
two sublattices [19]. The lattice parts can be written as:

The last term describes magneto-elastic coupling, leading to an Ising magnetic order
when the lattice orthorhombicity δ ≡⟨φ⟩develops.
This model is similar to the O(3)×Z2 model reported in Ref. [20], except that
here the lattice quantumeld φ bears its own dynamics and undergoes Landau damping
s, making it inherently quantum critical with the dynamic exponent z = 3. In two
spatial dimensions, d + z=5 for the φ ﬁeld and d + z=4 for the M ﬁelds. Because
they are above/at the upper critical dimension, a quantum bicritical point for both
orders is expected in the presence of the magneto-elastic coupling η. This is similar
to the result of the O(3)×Z2 model [20], and is indicated schematically in Fig.4.9b.
Indeed, as noted above, our measurements ﬁnd that TN and Ts get closer to each other
as the QCP is approached (see Figs.4.8e and 4.9a) and the two order parameters
disappear at the same point (Fig.4.8c). However, the appearance of an emergent IC
magnetism at x ≈0.088 severely reduces the scattering rate γ and s (in addition
to modifying other parameters of the effective theory), thereby eliminating the QCP.
A QCP preempted by an emergent order is often referred to as “avoided” quantum
criticality [21–23].
In summary, the magnetoelastic coupling and the overall phase diagram implicate
a quantum bicritical point at T = 0 close to optimal doping, which is preempted by
a secondary short-range IC AF order with a very small ordered moment [11]. Our
results are important to clarifying the nature of the purported quantum critical point
in the carrier-doped iron pnictides, as inferred from NMR [24], thermoelectric [25],
and ultrasonic [15] measurements, as well as its connection with the QCP in the
P-doped iron pnictides that was predicted by theory [20] and observed by extensive
experiments [2, 26].

5.1
Incommensurate Magnetic Order in BaFe2−xTxAs2
(T = Co, Ni)
In Chap.4, we noted that the emergent incommensurate (IC) short-range antiferro-
magnetic (AF) order near optimal superconductivity of Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 heavily
modiﬁes the electronic properties of this doping region and preempts the purported
quantum critical point (QCP). Therefore, it is of particular interest to investigate
the nature of the IC AF order. Figure4.5 reveals that the IC AF order appears from
x = 0.085 and is well developed in x = 0.092. The commensurate and IC AF order
coexist in a region between x = 0.085 and 0.092, where the commensurate order
is gradually suppressed while the IC AF emerges, indicating they are two different
phases. Based on the spin density wave (SDW) scenario of the long-range commen-
surate AF order in iron pnictides driven by Fermi surface nesting [1], the IC AF
discovered in Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 was explained as IC SDW induced by Fermi sur-
face nesting with IC wave vectors [2]. Subsequently, neutron scattering experiment
reveals the competition between IC AF order and superconductivity in BaFe2−xNix-
As2 [3]. Although the SDW picture is qualitatively consistent with these experimental
results, the absence of the IC AF order in Cu doped BaFe2As2 challenges this sce-
nario and suggests that the impurity effects induced by doping must be taken into
account to forming a complete understanding of the nature of the IC AF order [4].
Charge carrier doping by elemental substitution is a main method to induce high
temperaturesuperconductivityinironpnictides.Whilethesubstitutionsuppressesthe
long-range AF order and enhances superconductivity gradually in the underdoped
regime by doping charge carriers, it also causes disorder and impurity scattering
enhancement since the doped atoms are distributed randomly in the sample and
serve as impurity scattering centers. This side effect caused by elemental substitution
can smear a magnetic phase transition, induce various emergent phases and destroy
possible quantum criticality [5–7]. As suggested by previous studies, the impurity
effects induced by Ni doping is stronger than that of Co doping [5, 8]. The IC AF
order does not show a well-deﬁned TN and exhibits a short correlation length, which

are common features of spin glass systems. In addition, μSR measurements reveal
inhomogeneous internal magnetic ﬁeld of the IC AF samples, which also suggests a
spin-glass nature of the IC AF order [2, 3, 9, 10]. This hypothesis is also supported by
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 samples
which speculated that cluster spin glass exists in the IC AF region, which is induced
by doping-induced disorder [11].
Although the results above suggest that the IC AF order induced by Co and Ni
dopings are likely to exhibit spin-glass behavior, the microscopic origin remains to
be explored experimentally. In this chapter, we will describe our conﬁrmation of the
cluster spin-glass state and the determination of the nature of the IC AF order in
BaFe2−xNixAs2.
5.2
Slow Dynamics of Spin Glass State
Spin glass is a spin-freezing disordered state with the spin directions frozen by the
interacting ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions randomly distributed
in the system. A spin-glass state usually bears two basic features in magnetic sus-
ceptibility, (1) the splitting (below the freezing temperature T f ) of the temperature-
dependent magnetic susceptibility measured with ﬁeld cooling (FC) and zero-ﬁeld
cooling (ZFC) and (2) the T f measured by AC magnetic susceptibility shifts up with
increasing frequency of the AC measurement [12]. In neutron scattering measure-
ment, spin-glass system usually shows short-range magnetic order and slow magnetic
dynamics. The later can be observed in quasielastic scattering channel using high
resolution neutron scattering spectrometers such as backscattering spectrometer. The
spin-freezing temperature T f can be measured by measuring the order parameter of
the short-range magnetic order. However, the slow dynamics exist over a wide range
of time scales (τ), where the energy scale of the magnetic dynamics is positively
correlated with the magnetic correlation length (ξ), and higher energy dynamics can
persist at higher temperature. This leads to an important feature of the spin-glass
system: the observed freezing temperature T f is sensitive to the energy resolution
(or frequency) of the instrument used, since better energy resolution captures slower
dynamics which exist only at lower temperature. The instrumental-resolution depen-
dence of the freezing temperature is usually used to identify the spin-glass nature of
a magnetic system [12].
In typical spin glass sytems such as Cu1−yMny alloy, Murani et al. demonstrated
that the magnetic order parameter measured by elastic neutron scattering represents
the Edwards-Anderson (ED) order parameter of a spin-glass system [13, 14]. Further-
more, it was revealed that the spin-freezing temperature T f decreases systematically
as increasing the energy resolution of the spectrometer [13, 14], similar to the fre-
quency dependence of the AC susceptibility of a spin-glass system. The ED order
parameter describes the time-evolution of the direction of a spin in a spin-glass sys-
tem. Assuming the spin direction is v1 at moment t = 0, the ED order parameter
denotes the possibility that the same spin pointing towards the same direction at

in spatial and time domain. Compare Eq.5.1 with the pair-correlation
function, we ﬁnd that the ED order parameter represents the self-correlation func-
tion of the spin-glass system, which can be measured by elastic magnetic neutron
scattering:
q =

Si(0)Si(t)

av,
(5.2)
where [ ]av means averaging over all the spins. In the study of slow dynamics, the
self-correlation function q ∼I (t) and its temperature dependence contain much
information of the spin-glass system, which can be measured directly by a neutron
spin-echo spectrometer [16].
The self-correlation function I (t) exhibits exponential decay with time above T f
but show complicated structure below T f . As a comparison, the self-correlation func-
tion for a paramagnet always show fast exponential decay, and is time-
independent in a long-range ordered system. At a ﬁnite temperature T , the self-
correlation function can be written as:
q =

Si(0)Si(t)

=

τα
P(T, τα)exp(−t/τα).
(5.3)
Here P(T, τα) is the probability distribution of τα at temperature T . For a magnetic
relaxation with time scale τα, it can be probed by neutron scattering only if the
resolution of the spectrometer is better than ℏ/τα. Otherwise it contributes only
to the elastic scattering. A neutron scattering spectrometer with energy resolution
ΔE0 can resolve all the slow dynamics with time scale smaller than τ0 ∼ℏ/ΔE0.
Therefore, any dynamics with time scale longer than τ0 will be included in the elastic
scattering which is proportional to
qτ0 =

τα>τ0
P(T, τα)exp(−t/τα).
(5.4)
Taken together the facts that faster magnetic dynamics (with shorter correlation
length) can persist at higher temperature, it is natural to get different spin-freezing
temperatures using different energy resolutions. A systematic study about the energy-
resolution dependent T f can determine an accurate freezing temperature and reveal
the dynamic nature of the spin-glass system.

Experimental Results and Discussions
We have measured the magnetic transition temperature (TN) of the IC AF order in the
x = 0.092 sample using neutron scattering with different energy resolutions ranging
from 1µeV to 1.5 meV. We ﬁnd TN = 37 ± 3 K in the measurements on triple-axis
spectrometer with energy resolution E = 1 meV, but only 30 ± 2 K using neutron
resonance spin-echo method with E = 1µeV. In addition, our polarized neutron
scattering experiment shows that the magnetic moment in the IC AF order is along
the ao direction, whereas no component is observed along the bo direction. Through
analyzing the possible driving force for the IC AF, we conclude that the IC AF order
is a short-range cluster spin-glass state in the context of superconductivity, coexisting
and competing with the superconductivity [9].
We performed our neutron scattering measurements on BaFe2−xNixAs2 using
SPINS, IN22, and TRISP triple-axis spectrometers at the NIST Center for Neutron
Research, Institut Laue-Langevin, and MLZ, respectively. For the measurements
on SPINS, we adopted the two-axis mode with incident energy Ei = 5 meV and
triple-axis mode with exit energy E f = 2.5 meV. In the two-axis measurements,
analyzer is absent in the exit arm of the spectrometer. In principle, any neutrons
with E f < 5 meV can be detected, resulting in an energy transfer range ET = [0, 5]
meV. In triple-axis measurements, E was set to ∼0.1meV. In the measurements
on TRISP, we adopted E f = 14.68 meV and a pyrolytic graphite ﬁlter to remove
high order (λ/2) neutrons. The instrument energy resolutions are E ≈1 meV in the
triple-axis mode and E ≈1µeV in the neutron resonance spin echo (NRSE) mode.
At last, the polarized neutron-scattering mode of the IN22 triple-axis spectrometer
was used to determine the direction of the magnetic moment for the IC AF order.
Similar to that in Chap.4, we deﬁne the wave vector Q at (qx, qy, qz) as (H, K, L) =
(qxao/2π, qybo/2π, qzc/2π) reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u) in orthorhombic notation.
In BaFe2As2, the commensurate AF order occurs at QAF = (1, 0, L) with the ordered
moment aligned along the ao axis, as shown in the inset of Fig.5.1. We focus on the
x = 0.092 and 0.096 sample of BaFe2−xNixAs2 to study the IC AF order. These
two samples host well-deﬁned IC AF order along the transverse direction at Q =
(1, ±δic, 3) (Fig.5.1).
Figure5.1a is a phase diagram of underdoped BaFe2−xNixAs2. The evolution from
commensurate AF order to the IC AF order occurs in the region of x = [0.085, 0.092]
[3]. We ﬁrst verify the SDW scenario of the IC AF order, which is driven by the
Fermi surface nesting of itinerant electrons and calculated using LDA. We adopt a
ﬁve-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonian and use random-phase approximation (RPA)
to calculate the generalized susceptibility, in which the introduction of electrons cor-
responds to Fermi-level shift of a rigid band structure [2]. Figure5.1b displays the
Fermi surface for x = 0.875, with the arrows denoting the nesting wave vector from
hole pocket to electron pocket. The resulting δic is 0.15. Figure5.1c is the real part of
the generalized susceptibility χRPA for x = 0.096, generating δic = 0.17. Figure5.1d
shows the three-dimensional Fermi surface of x = 0.0875, corresponding the nest-
ing in Fig.5.1b. In Fig.5.1e, we compare the doping evolution of the experimental

the calculation generates a much larger incommensurability (4 times larger) and can-
not reproduce the transition from commensurate to IC AF order occurring close to
x = 0.085. Therefore, the IC AF order cannot be due to Fermi surface nesting.
In order to test whether the IC AF order is a cluster spin-glass state as suggested
by NMR measurements [11], we performed neutron scattering experiments on the
x = 0.092 sample using two-axis and triple-axis modes on the SPINS triple-axis
spectrometer. Figure5.2a, b are longitudinal scans along [H, 0, 3] direction mea-

Figures5.3 and 5.4 summarize the measurements performed on the TRISP triple-
axis spectrometer. TRISPis anewspectrometer combiningtheﬂexibilityof thetriple-
axis spectrometer in covering large S(Q, ω) space and the high energy resolution
(E ≈1µeV) of the neutron-resonance spin-echo (NRSE) technique in probing
magnetic dynamics [18, 19]. NRSE is a neutron spin-echo (NSE) technique using
bootstrap resonant coils to reduce the neutron ﬂight path of spin-echo process. NSE
can measure the pair-correlation function and the self-correlation function I (t) [16].
Regular NSE spectrometer can measure the I (t) over the time scale from 10−12s to
10−8s. Theoretical analysis of the line shape of the I (t) is crucial for understanding
the slow dynamics in the studied magnetic system. In the case of the NRSE, the
module installed on the TRISP spectrometer can cover only the time range from
1 ps to 70 ps, for the sake of ﬂexibility and compactness. Through ﬁtting the I (t)
in speciﬁc material, the energy width of the elementary excitations (or quasielastic
scattering) can be determined with an energy resolution of 1µeV. The NRSE on
TRISP has been used in probing the energy width of phonon and magnon in some
materials [20, 21]. In our studies of the IC AF order, we measure the energy width
of the quasielastic scattering associated with the (1, 0, 3) magnetic Bragg peak [7].
The relaxation-time dependent polarization P(τ) of the scattered neutrons is
equivalent to the function I (Q, t). The signal directly collected by NRSE is the
neutron intensity as a function of neutron precession phase in the NRSE module, in
which the phase is varied by translating one of the resonant coil. Each measurement
like that in Fig.5.3a is carried out at speciﬁc temperature (T ) and relaxation time (t).

in which P is the polarization of the scattered neutrons, tc4 is the position of the
fourth resonant coil. The ﬁtting of the intensity modulation using Eq.5.5 in Fig.5.3a
can provide the parameters I0 and P. The ﬁt P from Fig.5.3a is the data point shown
as the red dashed square in Fig.5.3b. I0 is the total magnetic scattering intensity, the
same as that measured by triple-axis mode, since the NRSE process will not reduce
the magnetic scattering signal.

Equation5.7 is used to ﬁt P(τ) at Q = (1, 0, 3) for the x = 0.092 sample, from
which Γ and its temperature dependence can be determined, as shown in Fig.5.4b.
In the measurements on TRISP, we ﬁrst measure the energy scans of the IC AF
order at Q = (1, 0, 3) using triple-axis mode. The results are shown in Fig.5.3a.
The energy scan measured at T = 57 K is subtracted as a background from the
scans collected at T = 4 K and 19 K. These energy scans can be well described by a
Lorentzian. The ﬁtting results is the same as the energy resolution of the spectrometer
(∼1meV), indicating that the energy scale of the slow magnetic dynamics is much
smaller than 1meV. The red line denotes the energy resolution of the NRSE mode (∼1
µeV). In the triple-axis mode measurements, any dynamics slower than ℏE ≈1
ps cannot be distinguished from the elastic scattering. As we have introduced, NRSE
can precisely determine the energy width Γ in the range from 1µeV to 100µeV
with E ≈1µeV. Figure5.4b shows the temperature-dependent Γ . It is clear that
the static order evolves into quasielastic scattering above 30 K, indicating that the
static order disappear above 30 K. Taken together the total scattering intensity I0
(integrated intensity of S(Q, ω)) and the ﬁtted , we can obtain the magnetic order
parameter with E ≈1µeV [red diamonds in Fig.5.4c]. The magnetic transition
temperature is determined as TN = 30 ± 2 K. With the triple-axis mode (E ≈1
meV), the transition temperature TN = 36 ± 3 K is much higher than that measured
using NRSE. The difference between these two transition temperature is caused by

the presence of the slow magnetic dynamics between 1µeV and 1meV. The spins are
likely to be frozen below T f = 30 ± 2 K, where the magnetic dynamics are at least
slower than τ ∼ℏ/E ≈6.6 × 10−10s, in agreement with the magnetic dynamics
in typical spin-glass systems [22].
Another way to understand the origin of the IC AF order is to determine its
magnetic moment direction. In an ideal IC SDW state along [K direction, there
should be either ordered moment or moment modulations along the IC AF ordering
or the bo-axis direction [23]. In order to verify this idea, we carried out polarized
neutron diffraction to determine the ordered moment direction in the x = 0.096
sample on the IN22 triple-axis spectrometer [24]. For this experiment, the x = 0.096
sample was aligned in the [H, 0, 3H] × [0, K, 0] scattering plane. As shown in
Fig.5.4a, the incident neutron beam is polarized along [H, 0, 3H](x), [0, K, 0] and
[−3H, 0, H](z, perpendicular to x and y) directions, and the out-going neutrons
can be analyzed in the same three channels. For the spin-ﬂip cross sections, we
focus on the xx, yy and zz components σSF
x , σSF
y
and σSF
z . The magnetic moment
components My and Mz can be derived from cMy = σSF
x
−σSF
y
and cMz = σSF
x
−
σSF
z , where c = (R −1)/(R + 1) and R is the spin ﬂipping ratio [24]. As can be seen
in Fig.5.5b, the magnetic components along bo axis is Mb = My. The Mz contains the
contributions from both Ma and Mb: Mz = Masin2θ + Mccos2θ. Therefore, Mb can
be calculated from σSF
x
and σSF
y . Figure5.5c shows the rocking curves of σSF
α
(α =
x, y, z) across Q = (1, 0, 3), from which we get Mb ∼cMy and Mz ∼c(Masin2θ +
Mccos2θ). The results are shown in Fig.5.5d. There is no magnetic moment observed
along bo axis. Since the data are measured by rocking curves, we are effectively
measuring the mosaic distribution of the longitudinally ordered AF state. Figure5.5e
illustrate this hypothesis. The magnetic moments in different area slightly deviate
from the ao axis.
We consider two possibilities to understand the origin of the IC AF state, as
depicted in Fig.5.5e, f. Since the ordered moments of the IC AF phase are aligned
along the ao-axis, the observed IC peaks could be the mosaic distribution of the AF
phase in the context of the superconducting background, as shown in the green areas
of Fig.5.5e. A mosaic distribution of the magnetic moments could result in a broad
peak centered at the AF wave vector, rather than the transverse IC AF order. On the
other hand, this hypothesis cannot describe the magnitude and the doping dependence
of the incommensurability. It also does not explain the lattice orthorhombicity in
the IC AF state. Therefore, it is unlikely to be a correct description for the IC AF
phase. The second possibility is the that the IC AF order may arise from the moment
amplitude modulation along the bo axis Fig.5.5f. In this case, an incommensurability
of δ = 0.03 requires a spin-density modulation with a period of 15bo ≈80 Å, which
is larger than the observed ∼50Å correlation length.
In principle, the IC AF order favors the orthorhombic structure and cannot exist
in the tetragonal unit cell of BaFe2−xNixAs2. The orthorhombic lattice distortions
in the IC AF phase have been clearly observed in x-ray diffraction experiments [see
Chap.4]. When superconductivity emerges below Tc, the lattice orthorhombicity
and the magnetic moment of the AF order are gradually suppressed while cool-

ing. This is in line with the picture that IC AF order is intimately correlated with
the lattice orthorhombicity. If optimal superconductivity in BaFe2−xNixAs2 favors a
tetragonal structure, the IC AF state should exist only in the orthorhombic distorted
patches in the matrix of the paramagnetic tetragonal phase below TN, as illustrated
in the red area of Fig.5.5e. Since the lattice orthorhombicity should evolve gradu-
ally from the tetragonal to orthorhombic area, the IC AF order could arise from the
moment amplitude modulation along the bo axis across the crossover from tetrag-
onal to orthorhombic state. Below Tc, the volume fraction of the superconducting
tetragonal state increases with cooling at the expense of the IC AF orthorhombic
phase. This picture is consistent with a cluster spin glass (or amplitude spin glass)
and much different from a spin-density wave in nested Fermi surfaces.

Nematic Spin Correlations in Detwinned
BaFe2−xNixAs2
6.1
Nematic in Iron Pnictides
A “nematic” phase was ﬁrstly proposed to describe a state of cigar-shaped molecules
in liquid crystal, in which the molecules have no positional order, but their long axes
are preferentially aligned in one direction (similar to C2 symmetry) [1]. Molecules
in nematic phase can ﬂow like a liquid. Meanwhile, they form a symmetry broken
(anisotropic) pattern like a crystal. Therefore, the nematic phase can be viewed as
an intermediate state between an isotropic liquid with O(3) symmetry and a highly
ordered crystal in view of the broken symmetry. When entering the nematic state,
the nematic transition corresponds to the breaking of the O(3) symmetry, which is
associated with the cigar shape of the molecule.
In correlated electron material, the electronic state usually has the same symmetry
as that of structure. However, the presence of the electron correlation sometimes can
organize the electrons to form certain anisotropic state which brokes the underlying
structural symmetry, which is termed “electronic nematic” [2]. Usually, electron
correlation breaks the C4 symmetry and drives the system into a C2 anisotropic
state. Electronic nematic state has been discovered in underdoped YBa2Cu3O6+x
and ultraclean Sr3Ru2O7, as indicated by their resistivity anisotropy and anisotropic
magnetic excitations [2–5].
The electronic nematic phase in doped BaFe2As2 has attracted substantial research
interests since its discovery as an electronic anisotropy revealed by resistivity mea-
surements of the uniaxial-stress detwinned single crystals of 122 systems [6, 7]. The
resistivity anisotropy, deﬁned as ψ = (ρb −ρa)/(ρb + ρa)[or ψ = ρb/ρa], appears
from a temperature (termed T ∗) well above the structural transition (Fig.6.1a) [6], as
we have discussed in Chap.2. Below T ∗, the resistivity ρb along the orthorhombic b
axis is larger and exhibits insulating behavior while the resistivity ρa shows metallic
behavior. This electronic anisotropy measured under constant uniaxial pressure per-
sists in underdoped and optimally doped regime and exhibits a maximum at certain
doping in Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2, as shown in Fig.6.1a [6]. Its temperature differential
reveals that the nematic phase transition occurs at Ts, while the anisotropy above Ts

could arise from nematic ﬂuctuations. Since the lattice orthorhombicity in the parent
compound BaFe2As2 is only δ = 3.6 × 10−3, and the orthorhombicity decreases
monotonically with increasing doping, the nematicity cannot be simply explained as
being driven by the orthorhombicity but should be electronic in origin. Therefore,
the electronic nematicity in iron-based superconductors is suggested to be driven by
spin ﬂuctuation, orbital ﬂuctuation or anisotropic impurity scattering.
After its discovery, the nematic phase was also found in other electronic properties
probed with different techniques such as orbital ordering, anisotropic optical con-
ductivity, anisotropic electronic state [8–20]. Figure6.1b shows the split between dyz
(along -X) and dxz (along -Y) orbitals in underdoped Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 which
exhibits similar temperature dependence to the resistivity anisotropy, indicating that
the orbital ordering could be crucial in creating the electronic nematicity.
However, in the same system, Ishida et al. found that the as-grown samples
showed larger resistivity anisotropy than the annealed samples [9], as shown in
Fig.6.1c, d. They suggested that impurity scattering below Ts in the underdoped
regime was anisotropic and resulted in resistivity anisotropy. With increasing dop-

ing, it is suggested that anisotropic scattering evolves into isotropic scattering in
overdoped regime Fig.6.1e. This picture can describe the resistivity anisotropy and
casts doubt on the intrinsic nature of the electronic anisotropy. Subsequently, Allan et
al. observed anisotropic impurity states in underdoped Ca(Fe1−xCox)2As2 [10] using
STM. As shown in the inset of Fig.6.1f, the STM current map I (q, E) measured
at E = −37 meV reveals a ’dimer’-shaped electronic impurity states. Figure6.1g
shows the quasiparticle scattering corresponding to the current map in Fig.6.1f,
which exhibits a periodic structure in momentum space. These results are consistent
with the resistivity anisotropy in iron pnictides.
Meanwhile, various experimental results such as those measured by magnetic
torque of BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 [16], shear modulus of Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 [20, 21] and
FeSe [22] have been interpreted in a magnetic frame [12, 16]. One important scenario
is the spin-driven Ising-nematic model proposed by Fernandes et al., [12, 13, 23]
(Fig.6.2). In this model, the true nematic transition occurs at Ts (Tnematic = Ts)
Fig. 6.2 a Nematic phase transition in the Ising nematic model [12, 13]. Z2 symmetry of the

̸= 0 (Fig.6.2b, c). Upon further cooling, the system undergoes the magnetic
transition at TN and enters the AF order, where O(3) spin-rotational symmetry is
broken (Fig.6.2a).
Although the absence of the AF order between TN and Ts is well known, whether
thespinexcitations at (1, 0) and(0, 1) inadetwinnedcrystal behavedifferentlybelow
Ts is still unknown. This is proposed to be an important phenomenon supporting
the Ising-nematic model, while it has not been tested experimentally. Therefore,
exploring the anisotropy between the magnetic excitations at (1, 0) and (0, 1) is
crucial to obtaining a complete understanding of the electronic nematic order.
As shown in the phase diagrams of doped 122 systems including the Ising-nematic
order (Fig.6.3), the nematic order emerges at Tnem = Ts and exhibits ﬂuctuations
in a wide temperature range above Ts. According to the Ising-nematic scenario,
the temperature range TN < T < Ts where nematic order locates, and the region
above Ts where nematic ﬂuctuations persist, are of particular interest to exploring the
effect of nematic order and nematic ﬂuctuations in doped 122 systems. The results
will shed light on the microscopic origin of the electronic nematic phase in iron-
based superconductors. BaFe2−xNixAs2 is an ideal system for such research purpose
because of the large separation of Ts and TN in its underdoped regime. In addition,

the resistivity anisotropy in BaFe2−xNixAs2 has been well established, as shown in
Fig.6.4. In this chapter, we will discuss our studies of the magnetic excitations of
the uniaxial-stress detwinned BaFe2−xNixAs2.

Experimental Methods
Mechanical devices for detwinning iron-pnictide single crystals were ﬁrstly invented
by Tanatar et al. [7] and Chu et al. [6]. Samples were detwinned by externally applied
uniaxial tensile or compressive stress in these devices. Later, Chu et al. developed the
methodology to measure the elastoresistivity under constant strain (ε) using piezo
stacks [24]. However, these devices are not proper for neutron scattering experi-
ments which requires large single crystals (>0.1g) to study magnetic excitations.
The ﬁrst neutron diffraction experiment on uniaxial-pressure detwinned Ba(Fe1−x-
Cox)2As2 was performed by Chetan et al. using a complicated device [25]. And
the experiment revealed the effects of uniaxial pressure on the magnetic and struc-
tural transition. Afterwards, we designed a more effective device and developed the
method to prepare well-cut square single crystals for inelastic neutron scattering
studies. Our device is capable of detwinning large crystals with mass ∼0.1−0.5g.
The maximum force the device can apply is about 100 N, generating about 20MPa

was demonstrated by neutron diffraction experiments on BaFe2As2 [26].
Figure6.5a is a schematic of the detwinning device. The pressure is applied along
the tetragonal [110] direction. Since ao > bo, bo will be predominantly aligned along
this direction. The device is made by aluminum alloy #6061 with very low incoherent
scattering cross section. The single crystal is inserted into the slots on the right side
of the device, with the tetragonal [110] (bo) axis aligned along the pressure-applied
direction (Fig.6.5a). The uniaxial pressure is applied by the spring which can be
continuously tuned by tightening the screw on left side of the device. Under uniaxial

pressure, the sample will be detwinned while cooling across the structural transition
temperature Ts.
Assuming the distribution probability of one kind of domain as P1 and the other
(1 −P1), we get the detwinning ratio Rd = |2P1 −1|. In order to obtain high Rd,
three steps must be carefully carried out. (1) The orientation of the crystal needs to
be precisely determined by Laue diffraction, as shown in Fig.6.5b. A minor mis-
alignment (>1◦) will cause difﬁculties in aligning the sample in neutron scattering
experiment. (2) While cutting the sample, the sectional surface must be parallel to
the c-axis, otherwise the sample can be easily broken under pressure. (3) The sec-
tional surface must be smooth to apply the uniaxial pressure homogeneously. To
satisfy these three requirements, we adopted real-time Laue camera to determine the
orientation of single crystals and cut single crystals by high-precision wire saw.
In our experiments, to probe the magnetic excitations at Q1 = (1, 0, 1) and Q2 =
(0, 1, 1) simultaneously, we aligned the sample and the device in a scattering plane
determined by vectors [112] and [1-10] (Figs.6.5c and 6.6). The green and orange
arrows in Fig.6.6 show the two momentum-scanning directions in our measurements.

Nematic Spin Correlations in the Tetragonal State
of BaFe2−XNixAs2
To reveal the effects of the nematic order and ﬂuctuations on the magnetic exci-
tations, we use neutron scattering to study the uniaxial-strained parent compound
BaFe2As2 (TN = 138 K), electron underdoped BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2 (Tc = 16.5 K,
TN = 44 K) and electron overdoped BaFe1.88Ni0.12As2 (Tc = 18.6 K) Figs.6.7, 6.8,
6.9, 6.10, 6.11 and 6.12. In the paramagnetic tetragonal state at high temperature
T > Ts > TN, the magnetic excitations at (±1, 0) and (0, ±1) should have equal
intensities, following the C4 symmetry of the tetragonal structure. This has been
conﬁrmed in previous neutron scattering reports [17]. In the AF state below TN, the
spin waves arising from the AF order should appear at AF wave vector (1, 0) and
have vanishing intensity at (0, 1). But it is still unclear whether the magnetic excita-
tions exhibit differences in the paramagnetic orthorhombic state between Ts and TN,
where the structural C4 symmetry is broken. In our studies, we ﬁnd that the magnetic
excitations indeed show intensity anisotropy between (1, 0) and (0, 1) above TN.
The emerging temperature (T ∗) of the spin excitation anisotropy [termed “nematic
spin correlation”], however, is well above Ts in underdoped regime and consistent
with that from the resistivity anisotropy [6, 9, 11]. Moreover, the nematic spin cor-
relations disappear in the overdoped x = 0.12 sample, resulting in similar doping
dependence to that for the resistivity anisotropy [6]. These similarities between the
nematic spin correlations and the resistivity indicate that they are likely intimately
connected and should share the same origin.
In the Ising-nematic model, a C4-symmetry-broken state without long range mag-
netic order is an Ising-nematic phase, which could be induced by an order by disorder
mechanism [28, 29]. However, this nematic state below Ts could also arise from the
orbital ordering induced by dxz/dyz orbital splitting [30–33]. Furthermore, the resis-

tivity anisotropy supporting the appearance of the electronic nematic, was recently
explained driven by anisotropic impurity scattering [9, 10].
In order to explore the possible spin nematic state and obtain further understanding
of the electronic nematic, we carried out inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experi-
ments using the PUMA thermal triple-axis spectrometer at the MLZ in Garching,
Germany. Horizontally and vertically curved pyrolytic graphite (PG) crystals were
used as a monochromator and analyzer. To eliminate contamination from epithermal
or higher-order neutrons, a sapphire ﬁlter was inserted before the monochromator and
two PG ﬁlters were installed before the analyzer. All measurements were done with
a ﬁxed ﬁnal wave vector, k f = 2.662 Å−1. Our annealed squared shaped single crys-
tals of BaFe2As2 (∼120mg), BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2 (∼220mg), and BaFe1.88Ni0.12As2
(∼448mg) were mounted inside aluminum based sample holders with a uniaxial
pressure of P ≈15 MPa, 7 MPa, and 7 MPa, appling along the bo axis, respectively.
In the AF state of a fully detwinned sample, the AF Bragg peaks should occur at
(±1, 0, L)(L = odd number) positions in reciprocal space. In addition, the low-
energy spin waves should only stem from the (±1, 0) positions. By contrast, in the

90

Nematic Spin Correlations in Detwinned BaFe2−xNixAs2
paramagnetic tetragonal phase one would expect the spin excitations at the (±1, 0)
and (0, ±1) positions to have equal intensities [17].
To see if it is indeed the case, we ﬁrst measure the magnetic order and low
energy spin waves at (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1). In addition, given that our experiments
are performed in uniaxial-strain detwinned samples, it is also important to establish
how the structural and magnetic transition temperatures are affected by the applied
pressure. Although an earlier neutron diffraction work suggested that uniaxial pres-
sure could increase the structural and magnetic transition temperatures on as-grown
BaFe2As2 [25], recent experiments on annealed samples indicated that these transi-
tion temperatures are not much affected by the uniaxial strain [26]. Figure6.7c is a
comparison of the temperature-dependent magnetic order parameters at (1, 0, 1) and
(0, 1, 1) for BaFe2As2 under zero (green symbols) and uniaxial pressure (red and
blue symbols). We ﬁnd that the BaFe2As2 sample is completely detwinned under
the applied unaxial pressure without changing TN. Similarly, the electron under-
doped BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2 is 60% detwinned and has TN ≈44 K Fig.6.7e. To test
if the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural phase transition in BaFe2−xNixAs2 is
affected by uniaxial stress, we plot in Fig.6.7d the temperature evolution of the
(2, −2, 0) nuclear Bragg peak of BaFe2As2. In neutron diffraction of single crystal,
strong nuclear Bragg peak is usually affected by sample mosaicity, which is called
secondary extinction effect. When a structural transition occurs, the mosaic of the
sample will also change accordingly, resulting in an abrupt change of the intensity
for some strong nuclear Bragg peaks at the transition [34–37]. The step-like feature
at Ts = 138 K results from the releasing of the neutron extinction across the struc-
tural transition. Furthermore, the intensity of the (2, −2, 0) nuclear peak deviates
clearly from the linear behavior below 150 K, indicating ﬂuctuating orthorhombic
structural domains above Ts [38]. While the uniaxial pressure has minor effects on
Ts = 138 K, it increases the ﬂuctuating orthorhombic domain temperature to about
165 K (Fig.6.7f).
Previous neutron scattering studies on BaFe2As2 revealed a 10 meV spin-wave
energy gap at (1, 0, 1)/(0, 1, 1) [39]. Figure6.8a, c and e are constant energy scans
across the (1, 0, 1) on detwinned BaFe2As2. In the AF ordered state (T = 3 K), no
magnetic excitations are observed at E = 6 meV because of the presence of the 10
meV magnon gap (Fig.6.8a). Above the magnon gap, spin waves at E = 15 meV and
19 meV are clearly observed (Fig.6.8c, e), which is consistent with previous results
[39]. Interestingly, we do not observe any spin waves with E = 6, 15 and 19 meV
at (0, 1, 1). This is in agreement with the 100% detwinning of the BaFe2As2 crystal
shown in Fig.6.7. Upon warming the sample to the paramagnetic state (T = 154 K),
the magnon gap is closed and magnetic excitations at E = 6meV can be seen at both
(1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1). However, we note that the intensity of the magnetic excitations
at (1, 0, 1) is obviously higher than that at (0, 1, 1) (Fig.6.8a, b), indicating the
existence of nematic spin correlations in the paramagnetic tetragonal state.
In order to quantitatively study the energy dependence of the spin-excitation
anisotropy (nematic spin correlations), we have carried out energy scans at (1, 0, 1),
(0, 1, 1) and their corresponding background positions at T = 154 K (Fig.6.9a,
b). The background subtracted spin excitations at (1, 0, 1) is stronger than that at

Nematic Spin Correlations in Detwinned BaFe2−xNixAs2
(0, 1, 1) in the energy range of our measurement ([4, 16] meV) (Fig.6.9c). When
warming up to T = 189 K, the same energy scans are shown in Fig.6.9b. After sub-
tracting the background, we ﬁnd that the spin excitations at (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1) have
the same intensity, indicative of the disappearance of the spin excitation anisotropy.
Figure6.9e shows the temperature dependence of the background-subtracted mag-
netic excitations at E = 6 meV. In the AF state, spin waves only appear at (1, 0, 1).
After warming up to the paramagnetic tetragonal state above Ts, the intensity differ-
ence of the magnetic excitations between (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1) vanishes at about 165
K, which is consistent with the onset temperature of resistivity anisotropy, as shown
in the inset of Fig.6.9e [40]. Since the resistivity anisotropy is accompanied by the
evolution of magnetic excitations from C4 symmetry to C2 symmetry, we conclude
that the resistivity anisotropy is an intrinsic property, rather than being induced by
anisotropic impurity scattering [9, 10].
Following the results of BaFe2As2, we have also studied the magnetic-excitation
evolution from C4 to C2 symmetry of the magnetic excitations in the under-
doped BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2 sample (Fig.6.7e). The magnetic excitations of (1, 0, 1)
and (0, 1, 1) at E = 6 meV and their temperature dependence are studied and
summarized in Fig.6.10. In previous study, neutron scattering experiment on a
x = 0.08 sample has revealed a resonance at E = 6 meV [41]. Figure6.10a, c
depict the constant-energy scans at E = 6 meV across (1, 0, 1) along two different
directions, as indicated by the blue arrows in the inset of Fig.6.10b, d. It is clear that
the magnetic excitations at (1, 0, 1) are greatly enhanced across Tc while cooling
from 48 K to 8 K. Figure6.10b, d are similar scans across (0, 1, 1), showing much
weaker magnetic excitations than that at (1, 0, 1). Figure6.10e shows the temper-
ature dependence of the magnetic excitations at (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1) with E = 6
meV. Consistent with Fig.6.10a–d, the magnetic excitations at (1, 0, 1) is stronger
that that at (0, 1, 1) above Tc. This spin-excitation anisotropy persists above Ts and
decreases gradually, without exhibiting any abrupt change at TN and Ts, as shown in
Fig.6.10e–f. Nematic spin correlations in the tetragonal state disappears at T ∗≈80
K, well above the Ts and TN, and consistent with the onset temperature of the resis-
tivity anisotropy [11].
Finally, we discuss uniaxial-strain effects on electron overdoped BaFe1.88Ni0.12
As2, which show vanishingly small resistivity anisotropy between ρa and ρb [6, 11].
Figure6.11a and show transverse momentum scans at E = 6 meV across the (1, 0, 1)
and (0, 1, 1) wave vectors below and above Tc, respectively, under the same uniaxial
pressure as that for the BaFe1.915Ni0.085As2 sample. We ﬁnd that spin excitations have
identical intensities at (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1), obeying the C4 rotational symmetry of
the underlying lattice. Figure6.11c, d show energy scans across Tc = 18.6 K at
(1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1), respectively. Spin resonance mode and spin gap form when
the sample enters the superconducting state. The temperature difference of energy
scansbetween T = 3.5Kand20 Kconﬁrmstheneutronspinresonancewithidentical
intensity at E = 7 meV for both (1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1) [42]. Figure6.11f plots the
temperature dependence of the scattering at E = 7 meV, which again indicates that
the applied uniaxial strain does not break the C4 rotational symmetry of the spin
excitations.

ThekeydiscoverieshavebeensummarizedinFig.6.12.Wehaveobservednematic
spin correlations in the tetragonal state of uniaxial strained BaFe2−xNixAs2. The

cating a close correlation between them.
In principle, the electronic nematic order parameter should be linearly coupled

state is broken. Therefore, the nematic transition from C4 toC2 occurs simultaneously
with the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition Ts [12, 13]. Then how do we

Nematic Spin Correlations in Detwinned BaFe2−xNixAs2
we get ϵ = λ <  > /Cs, where Cs is shear modulus. That is, the lattice orthorhom-
bicity is linearly coupled with the nematic order parameter <  >, and both emerge
from the structural transition Ts [12]. However, the nematic ﬁeld undergoes strong
ﬂuctuations above Ts while ϵ remains zero. These ﬂuctuations could be observed in
certain dynamic channels such as the low-energy spin ﬂuctuations. Thus, we con-
clude that the scale of the onset temperature T ∗of the spin-excitation and resistivity
anisotropy represents a typical range of the nematic ﬂuctuations. T ∗is more likely
a crossover rather than a phase transition. As we have emphasized, the nematic
transition occurs at Ts.
Besides the discussions above, we have several other remarks. First, since the
uniaxial pressure used to detwin the sample can induce ﬁnite ϵ at any temperature,
the structural transition Ts will become a crossover rather than a phase transition.
However, the applied uniaxial pressure is too small to induce a detectable lattice
distortion, which is the reason that Ts remains unchanged as determined from tem-
perature dependence of the nuclear (2, 2, 0) Bragg peak Fig.6.7d, f [39]. On the
other hand, nematic ﬂuctuations could be sensitive to the shear strain since the T ∗
increases with increasing pressure, as determined from resistivity anisotropy under
different uniaxial pressures [6, 11]. Second, in the action 6.1, the variable  could
also signify the orbital order [ ∝(nxz −nyz)], which can lift the degeneracy of
the dxz and dyz orbitals of Fe. These two order parameters will be linearly coupled,
(M1 · M2) ∝(nxz −nyz), and develop non-zero expectation below Ts. Therefore,
the nematic spin correlations in BaFe2As2 are consistent with the orbital ordering
observed by ARPES [8]. Third, the nematic spin correlations persist to the under-
doped x = 0.085 sample which is close to optimal doping, where orbital ordering
was not observed by ARPES [8, 43]. Since the structural transition Ts in this sample
is suppressed to 52 K, the spin-excitation anisotropy could originate from quantum
nematic ﬂuctuations. Fourth, both the resistivity anisotropy and the nematic spin
correlations disappear in slightly overdoped samples [6, 11], indicating they are inti-
mately correlated, as shown in Figs.6.11 and 6.12. At last, the onset temperature
(T ∗) of the nematic spin correlations does not signify a thermodynamic order below
T ∗. This implies that the magnetic torque anisotropy in BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 reported
in Ref. [16] should not be in the spin channel.
To conclude, we have discovered a four-fold to two-fold transition in the low-
energy spin ﬂuctuations of uniaxial strained BaFe2−xNixAs2 at temperatures T ∗
above the structural and magnetic phase transitions. Furthermore, we note that the
temperature T ∗is also associated with the previously reported resistivity anisotropy
[6, 7, 14, 24]. Our results unveil the nematic spin correlations, establish that they
are intrinsic and intimately connected to the resistivity anisotropy, and show that
they persist in the quantum ﬂuctuation regime close to the optimally electron-doped
iron-pnictide superconductor.

Magnetic Excitations in Overdoped
BaFe2−xNixAs2
Antiferromagnetic spin ﬂuctuation has been thought as an important candidate for
the “pairing glue” that mediates superconducting electron pairs in cuprates and
iron-based high-temperature superconductors [1–3]. This is suggested by the cor-
relation between spin resonance and superconductivity [4–13], and the ubiquitous
high-energy magnetic excitations throughout the whole phase diagrams [14–20].

7.1.1
Spin Resonance and Superconductivity
We ﬁrst describe the correlation between spin-resonance mode and high-Tc super-
conductivity. Spin resonance is a spin-1 bosonic mode that emerges at low energy
magnetic excitation spectrum when the system enters the superconducting state.
Comparedwithnormal-statespinexcitations,thespectralweightofspinexcitationsis
redistributed below Tc, resulting in a spin resonance (peak) mode at Er(Er ≤2, 
is superconducting energy gap), and a spin gap at lower energy [4, 5, 7].
Spin resonance emerges simultaneously with superconductivity upon cooling
across Tc in unconventional superconductors, with its temperature dependence sim-
ilar to the superconducting order parameter (energy gap ) (Fig.7.1a, b). The mag-
nitude of the spin resonance is positively correlated with Tc and superﬂuid density.
For example, the spin resonance intensity in overdoped La2−xSrxCuO4 decreases
with increasing the doping and ﬁnally becomes zero in the non-superconducting
x = 0.3 sample (Fig.7.1c) [13]. Furthermore, spin resonance has been discovered
in numerous unconventional superconductors. The resonance energies in one class
of superconductors are proportional to the corresponding Tc and 2. This linear
relationship have been discussed in various reports (Fig.7.1d, e) [9, 11, 21]. These

direct correlations between spin resonance and superconductivity in cuprates and
iron-based superconductors suggest that antiferromagnetic spin ﬂuctuations could
be a microscopic driving force for unconventional superconductivity. Based on this
idea, Scalapino et al. developed a formalism theory of superconductivity induced by
spin ﬂuctuations, similar to the BCS theory [2, 3]. Based on his model the magnetic
exchange energy difference between normal state and superconducting state can be
estimated from the spectral weight difference of the magnetic excitations. Several
works have demonstrated that such magnetic exchange energy difference is large
enough for superconducting condensation [22].
The microscopic origin of the spin resonance remains elusive. It was proposed to
be a transition from spin singlet to triplet of a cooper pair, without pair breaking [23,
24]. If it is indeed the case, the spin resonance was expected to split into three peaks
under magnetic ﬁeld. This proposed spin-resonance split, however, has not been
observed in neutron scattering studies under magnetic ﬁeld (up to 14 T) in cuprates
and iron-based superconductors [25, 26]. Since the resonant energy Er is smaller
than 2, the spin resonance can be treated as an exciton mode [3]. Understanding
the nature and behavior of spin resonance is still an important task in the studies of
unconventional superconductors.

Ubiquitous High Energy Magnetic Excitations
Moreover, recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scat-
tering (RIXS) experiments reveal that high-energy magnetic excitations persist in
optimally doped and overdoped regimes in various cuprates and iron-based super-
conductors [14–17, 20, 27]. Figure7.2 shows the ubiquitous paramagnons in various

hole pockets around  point to electron pockets around X point is unique in iron
pnictides. It is suggested to enhance low-energy magnetic excitations and super-
conductivity, as we have discussed in Chap.2. Consequently, orbitals where the
Fermi surface nesting occurs determine the proﬁle of magnetic excitations [1]. As
shown in Fig.7.3, the low-energy magnetic excitations for BaFe2As2 and electron-
doped BaFe2As2 are vertically elongated ellipses (along [1, K]), while those for
hole-doped BaFe2As2 are horizontally elongated ellipses (along [H, 0]). The pro-
ﬁles of the magnetic excitations in doped BaFe2As2 systems are revealed by INS
experiments and well described by RPA calculations [17, 28]. In addition, previous
INS studies reveal that the doping dependence of the anisotropy of the low-energy
spin excitations (FWHM of the magnetic excitation along [1, K] over that along
[H, 0]) in BaFe2−xNixAs2 can also be qualitatively described by RPA calculation
based on the Fermi surface nesting scenario [29]. The consistency between exper-
imental observations and theoretical calculations suggest that the RPA calculation
captures the main features of low-energy magnetic excitations.
For BaFe2−xNixAs2, INS studies have been performed on the parent compound
and the optimally doped (x = 0.1) sample [17, 30]. These experiments reveal that
only the magnetic excitations below 100 meV are modiﬁed by electron doping. By
contrast, the magnetic excitations above 100 meV change less from x = 0 to 0.1.
The total ﬂuctuating moments for x = 0 and 0.1 are < m2 >= 3.6 ± 0.16¯2

B [17, 31], respectively. Although the doping dependence of the magnetic
excitations from x = 0 to 0.1 has been well established, the doping evolution in the
overdoped regime remains elusive. In this chapter, we will describe our INS studies
of overdoped BaFe2−xNixAs2 with x = 0.15, 0.18 and 0.3.

Calculation of Local Susceptibility
Local susceptibility (momentum space integrated) χ′′(ω) and total ﬂuctuating mag-
netic moment < m2 > can be calculated from dynamic structure factor S(Q, ω). For

Brillouin zone, we can get the local susceptibility χ′′(ω), which is deﬁned as [32]:

χ′′(ω) reﬂects the energy-dependent density of states of magnetic excitations. The

The magnetic moment sum rule is usually used to determine the spin number and the

it was strictly valid in some systems [30, 31, 34].

Magnetic Excitations in Overdoped BaFe2−xNixAs2

Results and Discussions
Figure7.4 is a schematic phase diagram of BaFe2−xNixAs2. Solid and open red
squares markthepositions (x, T ) wherethemagneticexcitations havebeenmeasured
[17–19, 30]. Results for x = 0.15, 0.18 and 0.3 are associated with this thesis and
will be discussed in detail. We will focus on describing the electron-doping evolution
of the spin resonance, low-energy magnetic excitations, high energy excitations, and
their correlation with superconductivity.
Corresponding to the phase diagram (Fig.7.4), Fig.7.5 shows the doping and
energy dependence of the magnetic excitations in BaFe2−xNixAs2 with x = 0, 0.096
(optimal, Tc = 20 K), 0.15, 0.18 and 0.3 measured at base temperature. It is clear that
the low energy magnetic excitations evolve from long correlation length spin waves
to diffusive paramagnons and form an energy gap (∼50 meV) in x = 0.3 sample.
The spin resonance mode is observed in x = 0.096 and 0.15 but greatly suppressed
in x = 0.18. In contrast to the signiﬁcant evolution of the low energy magnetic
excitations, the high energy magnetic excitations decrease slowly with increasing
doping.
7.2.1
Spin Resonance in Overdoped BaFe2−xNixAs2
The spin resonance in BaFe2−xNixAs2 reaches its maximum in an optimally doped
x = 0.096 (Tc = 20 K) sample. With increasing doping, the spin resonance exhibit-
ing incommensurate structure along [1,K] direction is also observed in overdoped
x = 0.15 (Tc = 14 K) and 0.18(Tc = 8 K) samples. Figure7.6a, b show the spin
resonance of x = 0.15 in (E, [1, K]) plane, and in an energy cut, respectively. A
resonance at Er = 6.5 meV [Er/kBTc ≈5.4] is clearly seen. Figure7.6c, d are
momentum cuts along [1, K] and [H, 0] directions, respectively. The former shows

two incommensurate peaks centering at [1, 0]. Compared with that in x = 0.096,
the spin resonance in x = 0.15 is much weaker and incommensurate along [1, K],
which has been attributed to the doping dependence of the Fermi surface nesting
vector by RPA calculations [29].
The x = 0.18 sample with Tc = 8 K is close to the end of the superconducting
dome. Figure7.7a, b show its low-energy spin excitations in (E, [1, K]) plane. The
difference (Fig.7.7c) between Fig.7.7a, b reveals a very weak spin resonance mode
at about Er = 5.5 meV [Er/kBTc ≈8]. To show its proﬁle in momentum space, we
plot constant energy slices with E = 5.5 ± 1 meV in [H, K] plane at T = 5 K and
T = 10 K in Fig.7.7d, e respectively, and the resulted spin resonance in [H, K] plane
in Fig.7.7f. Though the spin resonance signal of x = 0.18 sample is very weak, two
incommensurate peaks along [1,K] direction can still be resolved. Figure7.8 displays

one-dimensional energy and momentum cuts of the low-energy spin excitations. The
energy cuts in Fig.7.8a, b show that the spin resonance is very weak, in agreement
with the lower Tc in this doping [35]. Corresponding to the slices in Fig.7.7d–f,
one-dimensional momentum cuts along [1, K] and [H, 0] directions unambiguously
show that the spin resonance in x = 0.18 is weak and incommensurate along [1, K],
while that cannot be observed along [H, 0] direction with an integration range of
K = [−0.1, 0.1].
Figure7.8e plots the resonance energies (Er) and the magnitude of the spin
resonance (Stot) versus Tc of x = 0.096, 0.15 and 0.18 samples. The linear
relation between Tc and Stot reveals that the spin resonance decrease in inten-
sity with increasing doping in the overdoped regime, similar to that in the over-
doped La2−xSrxCuO4 [13]. Correspondingly, the superﬂuid density of BaFe2−xNix-
As2 measured by μSR also decreases with increasing doping in the overdoped regime
and about to disappear in x = 0.18, suggesting that Stot is a measure of the super-
ﬂuid density [35]. In x = 0.096, 0.15 and 0.18, Er (8, 6.5 and 5.5 meV) is positively

However, Er/kBTc ≈4.3, 5.4 and 9.0 for x = 0.096, 0.15 and 0.18, respectively. It
has not been well understood why Tc decreases much faster than Er [10].
7.2.2
Evolution of Magnetic Excitations in Heavily
Overdoped BaFe2−xNixAs2 (x=0.3)
With further electron doping to x = 0.3 (Fig.7.4), low-energy spin excitations are
strongly suppressed and form a spin gap is formed at (1, 0) (Fig.7.5). Since low-
energy spin excitations are believed to arise from the interband scattering between
the hole pockets and the electron pockets as shown in Figs.7.3 and 7.9, low-energy
spin excitations are expected to disappear in x = 0.3 since the electron pockets
sink below the Fermi surface with increasing electron doping to x = 0.3 (Fig.7.9).
The consistent doping evolution between Fermi surface topology (Fig.7.9a–c) and
low energy spin excitations provides a solid evidence for the quasiparticle-excitation
nature of low-energy spin excitations. Since superconductivity disappears together
with low-energy magnetic excitations in x = 0.3, magnetic excitations arising from
the interband scattering should be correlated with superconductivity.

Fig. 7.9 Doping dependent Fermi surface and low energy spin excitations of BaFe2−xNixAs2.
With increasing electron doping, the Fermi surface shifts up gradually. In x = 0.3, the hole pockets
around  sink below the Fermi level
cuts along [1, K] direction (Fig.7.10e–h). By contrast, all the constant-energy slices
and momentum cuts in Fig.7.10 reveal no magnetic peaks, indicating that the spin
gap is larger than 40 meV.
More constant-energy slices for x = 0.3 are shown in Fig.7.11. Magnetic excita-
tions appear in the constant-energy slice with E = 59±10 meV (Fig.7.11b). Taking
together Figs.7.10 and 7.11, we ﬁnd that the spin gap is about 50 meV. The magnetic
excitations above 50 meV show similar intensity and dispersion to that for x = 0
and 0.1, as shown in the momentum cuts in Fig.7.12.
From the momentum cuts in Figs.7.10, 7.11 and 7.12, we get the dispersion of
the spin excitations in x = 0.3 (Fig.7.13). Compared with the magnon dispersion
for x = 0 (solid curves in Fig.7.13), the dispersion for x = 0.3 shows similar
features, with slightly lower energy band top and an ∼50 meV spin gap. The
persistence of the magnetic excitations with well-deﬁned dispersion in x = 0.3
indicates that the magnetic excitations arise from interacting local moments, and the
magnitude of the exchange couplings is similar to that in the parent compound. As
we have discussed, the exchange coupling J is an essential interaction for the spin-
ﬂuctuation theory of superconductivity. However, as we noticed here, low-energy
magnetic excitations correlated with the interband scattering of itinerant electrons
are also necessary ingredients for creating superconductivity.
To determine the doping evolution of magnetic excitations, we have calculated
local susceptibility of x = 0.15, 0.18 and 0.3 using the method described in
Sect.7.1.4. The results are shown in Fig.7.14. Similar to the evolving trend shown in

Figs.7.5 and 7.14a shows that the low energy part of χ′′(ω) (< 80 meV) decreases
gradually with increasing doping for x > 0.096, with a spin gap (∼50 meV) opened
in heavily overdoped non-superconducting x = 0.3 sample. The high energy part
of χ′′(ω), however, change less from x = 0.096 to 0.3. This surprising doping
dependence suggests that the interacting local moments which determine the high
energy magnetic excitations are insensitive to electron doping, though the ordered
magnetic moment has been quickly suppressed by electron doping. From Eq.3.27,
S(Q, ω) = [1+n(ω)]χ′′(Q, ω), where n(ω) is bose factor. χ′′(ω) reﬂects the density

B/Fe(Ni), respectively. This, again, indicates that total
ﬂuctuating moment decreases slowly from x = 0 to x = 0.3.
Since the real doping x′ is proportional to nominal doping x′ = 0.8x, the real
doping for x = 0.3 is x′ = 0.24. Assuming that the ﬂuctuating moment decreases
linearly with increasing doping, the end member BaNi2As2 will be expected to have
sizeable ﬂuctuating moment. Of course, this extrapolation is not strict since the
doping range for x′ = 0.24 is still only 0.12Ni per Fe. However, it rises a question:
whether Ni dopants have a local moment in BaFe2−xNixAs2. This question is not
easy to answer with INS, which is not element speciﬁc. The kβ emission of Fe which
can probe the magnetic moment of speciﬁc element, or RIXS which can measure
magnetic excitations arising at the resonant edge of speciﬁc element, can shed light
on this question [20, 36, 37].
From the ﬂuctuating moment square

m2
, we can get the size of atomic moment

m2
≈1.8μB for BaFe2As2, while the corresponding ordered moment is only
0.9μB. The difference between the atomic moment and the ordered moment indicates
that the system contains magnetism from both local moments and itinerant electrons.

Magnetic Excitations in Overdoped BaFe2−xNixAs2
Figure7.14b summarize the doping and energy dependence of the magnetic cor-
relation length (ξ) along [1, K] direction. For BaFe2As2, the correlation lengthes
for low energy spin waves are relatively large. While for the x = 0.096, 0.15, 0.18
and 0.3 samples, the correlation lengthes of the high energy magnetic excitations are
similar and small (∼10 Å), indicating that they are diffusive paramagnons, similar
to the paramagnons in curpates [14, 15].

Summary
In conclusion, we have carried out inelastic neutron scattering studies on the dop-
ing dependence of the magnetic excitations in overdoped BaFe2−xNixAs2, with
x = 0.15, 0.18 and 0.3. The spin resonance mode decreases in intensity and energy
with increasing doping in the overdoped regime. This trend consistent with the doping
evolution of superconductivity (Tc and superﬂuid density) and thereby demonstrates
the importance of the low-energy magnetic excitations induced by interband scatter-
ing of the itinerant electrons. While the low-energy magnetic excitations undergo sig-
niﬁcant evolution with electron doping, the high-energy magnetic excitations (> 80
meV) change less in spectral weight and dispersion, suggesting that the interacting
local moments persist through the whole superconducting dome. This unconven-
tional paramagnetic state hosting well deﬁned exchange couplings (J) is a matrix
fortheemergenceofsuperconductivityand J isanessentialinteractionfordrivingthe
superconducting pairing. Therefore, the itinerant electron-spin excitation coupling
through J could be essential for driving the superconductivity.

Summary and Outlook
We have performed detailed studies on the phase diagram and magnetic excitations
of BaFe2−xNixAs2 using neutron and x-ray scattering.
(1) We have illustrated a detailed phase diagram of BaFe2−xNixAs2 by x-ray and
neutron diffraction and ﬁnd a strong magneto-elastic coupling in the underdoped
regime. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that a purported quantum critical point is avoided
by the emergence of an incommensurate short-range antiferromagnetic order near
optimal doping.
(2) Because of the importance of the incommensurate order, we use various neu-
tron scattering spectrometers with different energy resolutions to study the slow
magnetic dynamics of this incommensurate order, and ﬁnd that the magnetic tran-
sition temperature TN is sensitive to instrumental energy resolution. This indicates
that the short-range incommensurate order is a short-range cluster spin glass state
coexisting and competing with superconductivity.
(3) We have discovered the nematic spin correlations using inelastic neutron scat-
tering. The similarities between the nematic spin correlations, resistivity anisotropy
and orbital ordering provide a comprehensive experimental basis for understand-
ing the origin of the electronic nematic phase in iron-based superconductors. In
addition, we have developed single-crystal detwinning techniques for large single
crystals, which will play an important role in our future studies on detwinned single
crystals of iron-based superconductors.
(4) We have investigated the doping evolution of the magnetic excitations in
overdoped BaFe2−xNixAs2 and revealed the importance of the low energy magnetic
excitations and the high energy magnetic excitations for driving superconductiv-
ity. The exchange coupling between the local moments and the itinerant electrons
that induce the low-energy spin excitations via interband scattering are two essen-
tial ingredients for creating superconductivity. This provides important clues for
understanding the origin of the magnetism, the electron correlation and the interplay
between magnetism and superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.

Summary and Outlook
Although great progress has been made in last several years of studies of iron-
based superconductors, much remains unknown. Following what we have done, we
will focus on several important issues in this ﬁeld. Two speciﬁc issues are given
below:
(1) The nature of the magnetic excitations of BaFe2As2. It seems the magnetic
ground state and the underlying electronic interactions have been well understood.
We argue that, however, the current understanding is not complete. For example,
the high energy magnetic excitations above 200meV at Q = (1, 1) has not been
accounted in current Hamiltonian for describing the magnetic dynamics. On the
other hand, a correct Hamiltonian must be derived in describing the spin waves in
a detwinned sample, which has not been reported. We will study the spin waves of
detwinned BaFe2As2 and explain the high energy magnetic excitations by including
some non-Heisenberg interactions.
(2) The electronic nematic phase and ﬂuctuations have been well studied by resis-
tivity measurements. However, there are only several studies on the nematic spin
correlations. In the future, we will keep studying the nematic spin correlations in
iron-based superconductors exploiting creative devices and experimental techniques.
Beside these, other important and interesting topics such as quantum criticality,
spin glass state and non-Fermi liquid behavior, will also be studied, which we are
not going to discuss in detail here.
