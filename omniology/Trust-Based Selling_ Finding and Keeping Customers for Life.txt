Introduction
Tom is a new salesperson about three months into his job. Tom was promoted 
from within the company because he was the number one inside salesperson. 
His job was cold calling to set appointments for the outside sales team. He is 
diligent, hardworking, and already understands the company and its products. 
One day, he is out to lunch with some colleagues, and one of the more senior 
reps asks, “How are things going, Tom?” 
His reply, “Things are great, I have been on many appointments. My boss 
is happy with the number of customers I have been in front of. My pipeline 
is very strong. I have not booked my first order yet, but I am excited.  
My second quarter will be huge!” 
“How many customers have you visited?” the senior rep continues.
“Close to 25,” says Tom. 
The senior rep is impressed; this is a large number of appointments for his 
industry, so it’s clear he is working hard. 
So far, it sounds like everything is great. High activity, opportunities in his 
pipeline, a happy manager; the only thing missing is some closed business. 
Three months go by, and Tom walks into the senior rep’s office. He asks Tom 
the same question, “How are you doing?”
“Well, quite a few of my deals pushed [moved to the next quarter] or fell 
through this quarter, but my pipeline is even bigger, and Q3 will be huge.” 
“Tom, how does your boss feel?” 
He replies, “I can tell he is a bit more concerned with the numbers. He loves 
my pipeline, but he is pushing me to start closing some of this business.”
“What is his advice?”
“Keep pursuing leads. He says keep my pipeline strong, and deals will come.”
The senior rep asks, “How many customers have you visited?”
“Maybe another 25 this quarter. Marketing is great—they keep the leads 
coming.”
The senior rep then asks, “What are your top opportunities?” 

Introduction

Tom lists some companies. The senior rep recognizes that from a geography 
standpoint, he is often driving three hours in one direction, then four hours in 
another direction. He asks Tom, “Why are you driving all over the place?” 
“My boss wants me running down the opportunities on these leads.” 
“So you have been in front of 50 different customers? How many different 
opportunities are you working?” The answer is an impressive 40.
The senior rep is starting to spot a trend. Tom is working on more 
opportunities than the senior rep himself. And he knows that in this industry, 
you can make your living with 10 accounts. So, he leads Tom by asking, “Tom, 
which of the 50 customers have you qualified as your best?” 
Tom is confused, “What do you mean?” 
“I mean where are you spending your time? Which customers are getting 
your time?”
“I have been following up leads, and trying close these deals, so pretty much 
where I have opportunity.”
Instead of pointing out an issue, he gives Tom some direct advice, “Go back 
through the list of accounts you have visited, and figure out which customers 
are a fit for our company and for you. Note where they have money, where 
there is change, where they have aging IT infrastructure, and where you felt 
you had a good personal fit. You need to start establishing relationships and 
building trust with these customers.”
Tom nods; the advice seems to make sense. But he’s sure some of the leads 
he gets each week will take care of the problem. 
Another quarter goes by, and he walks into the senior rep’s office one more 
time. The rep asks, “How are things going?” 
“Not so good,” says Tom. “I barely closed anything last quarter. I had three 
large deals that we thought we had won, but we lost them to price at the last 
minute. My pipeline has shrunk. We cannot figure out what is going on, so my 
boss is starting to think I must be lazy, or I am just not a closer.” 
“Did you take my advice and identify your ‘go-to’ customers?” 
“Well, no. I have been too busy trying to close deals.” 
This story does not have a happy ending. Tom was let go a few weeks later. 
How do you go from a hard-working inside sales rock star to being fired as 
a salesperson? He worked hard and had a strong pipeline, so why was he not 
closing business? 

Introduction

What Happened?
Tom is brand new to outside sales, and he was simply following the advice 
of his management team. This issue points out a fundamental flaw in sales 
process—poor sales training and coaching. Most sales training is based on 
sales skills or process. The problem is that most processes start with an 
opportunity, but they do not hit the fundamentals of new account penetration. 
This book is aimed at building a foundation for new sales professionals, and 
getting the seasoned professional back to basics after they’ve lost their 
way. (This is nothing to be ashamed of; it has happened to me and other 
sales professionals whose techniques, for one reason or another, became 
ineffective. Read on for the story of how Peyton Manning had to return to 
the fundamentals.) 
The approach that Tom took is how most salespeople approach starting a 
new sales role. The company trains them on its top-selling products. They 
are given a list of accounts or a territory, some sales training based on skills 
or process, a laptop, and a phone. 
The advice—from managers, books, seminars, and other sources of sales 
training—for starting typically goes something like this: “Work hard, get in 
front of as many customers a possible, work your leads, find opportunities, 
and close business. Go hunt!” If the salesperson is “lucky,” he is probably 
given a common strategy. “Your goal is $5,000,000 in revenue. This equates 
to $1,250,000 per quarter. We close 30% of our deals. So you should have 
$4,200,000 in potential revenue in your pipeline at any time.” In other words, 
find as many opportunities as possible; keep your pipeline full. 
The sarcasm in that last statement was not meant to insult the many managers 
who have used that advice. I have used that advice myself in the past. On the 
surface is seems like perfect common sense. However, as you start to dig 
into why customers buy, look at the most important asset a new salesperson 
has (time), and understand why managers push for pipeline much greater 
than quota, you learn that this logic hurts more than it helps. 
As this book will show, the senior rep in the previous story has the right idea 
about how to succeed: identify the most likely accounts, develop relationships, 
and build trust. But Tom—and most of the Toms in the sales world—doesn’t 
hear this kind of advice often enough. 
Not Just for Rookies: Fundamentals Matter
Just recently, NFL quarterback Peyton Manning broke the record for the most  
career touchdowns thrown by a quarterback. Following the game, he did a 
quick on-field interview. His message struck a chord with me. He was asked 
why he has been even more successful after being out for a year with a neck 

Introduction 
xii
injury. When he started his journey back, he could hardly throw a ball. In NFL 
years, he is—at 38 (in early 2015)—an old man. And, you know the old saying, 
“You can’t teach an old dog a new trick.” Personally, I was expecting him to 
say, that the Denver Broncos, the team he joined after his injury, surrounded 
him with players that are there to support his type of offense. But his reply, 
which I am paraphrasing, surprised me: “When I started throwing the ball 
again, I called my old coach to help me get back to my pre-injury form. We 
went right back to the fundamentals—arm mechanics, foot work, movement 
in the pocket, etc. I believe that getting back to the basic fundamentals has 
helped me become a better quarterback.” And, by all measures Peyton, at 
the age of 38, came back better than he was pre-injury.
I think any sales professional can learn a lot from Peyton Manning. Over time 
we all develop bad habits, or start to get lazy with process, or the basics 
of selling. While this book is about the basics of selling, even the seasoned 
professional can further their results by refreshing the foundation of their 
strategies, process, skills and tactics. 
Why I Wrote This Book
I have been a salesperson and sales manager, among other sales-related jobs, 
my entire career. My experience has been mostly in the IT industry. You 
will find many real-life examples and stories from multiple industries in this 
book, but the majority comes from the industry in which I spent my career. 
As you’ll see, the advice is universal. Many of the examples come from when 
I was with a VAR, or value-added reseller. If the tactics and strategies work 
with a VAR, they will work for any B2B sales person. Resellers find it difficult 
to differentiate themselves from competitors. By definition, they do not have 
their own products. There are multiple companies in the same territory selling 
the identical products from the same vendors. This leaves the salesperson as 
the main differentiator to the customer. Veteran salespeople therefore learn 
early on that developing good relationships is the key to success. While most 
salespeople are concentrating on their products, the customer is looking 
at the salesperson and thinking, “Can I trust this person?” And that is the 
same in any industry. As you will see, the sales skills and strategies needed to 
succeed in this industry translate to any B2B sales environment.
When I started this book, I was a regional manager at an information 
technology (IT) reseller, or VAR. It was this new role as a regional manager 
that actually prompted me to write this book. I was given a territory that 
at one point had been one of the most successful regions in our company. 
Throughout the years, five salespeople were all at, or above, their quotas. 
However, in the two–three years prior to my taking over the region, we had 
turned over most of the team more than once. Our partners had lost faith 
in our company, and our customers were concerned about the health of the 

Introduction
xiii
company due to the turnover of the sales force. This territory could support 
five to six salespeople. I only had three salespeople left and they were a 
mixed bag of experience, work ethic, and skills. One was experienced and 
performing, one had very little sales skill and was unwilling to learn, and the 
third was for the most part not showing up. So, my first job, which is not 
always easy, was to let the latter two go. My uphill battle continued:
	
I had one salesperson, but I carried a quota for five 
•
salespeople
	
I had to hire four new salespeople, and finding the right 
•
people takes time 
	
We had damaged customer relationships
•
	
In the IT industry, as a VAR, it is not unheard of for a sales-
•
person to take six months to get their first order
	
It typically takes up to 12 months, if not longer, for a new 
•
salesperson to match pace with their monthly quota
I wanted to make money in my first year. I did not want to take the long ramp 
period as the definitive truth. I turned to several sales books I had purchased 
over the years. Our company was a user of SPI’s Solution Selling, but their 
process started with the first sales call, and I knew that there was an uphill 
battle getting first appointments. I reached out to colleagues whom I trusted 
in sales management roles, but the advice was pretty much the same: train 
the best you can, cold call, follow up on leads, and drive the pipeline. The 
main advice—or the belief—for success was to drive high activity. I always 
held the belief that high activity was important, but the wrong activity is 
purely a waste of time. I needed to identify which activities would help my 
reps start producing in the short term. 
Lastly, I turned to personal experience. Before becoming a regional manager, 
I had worked as an account manager for this company for four years. Before 
that, I was a territory salesperson for two large, fast-growing manufacturers 
and a large VAR. I personally have ramped seven sales territories with varying 
degrees of success. (Of course, like any salesperson, I have had my share of 
losses, which I will be sharing with you as well.) However, I never stopped 
to think about why some territories never took off, why some took years to 
ramp, and why some were successful from the start. What was the common 
thread? What worked and what didn’t? Why did 80% of our salespeople 
close an average of only five deals their first year? 
I quickly learned that it had nothing to do with work ethic, as with Tom. I 
witnessed some of the hardest-working salespeople fail miserably. And my 
experience prompted additional questions: Why did only 20% of new hires 
reach quota? Why, in my most successful territory, did it take me four months 
to get my first order and why, by the end of the year, was I pulling in more 

Introduction 
xiv
business per month than most of the other salespeople at the company? 
Why did some of my own territories fail? 
This desire to understand the first year of sales also led me to thoroughly 
research the science of selling, including buyer psychology, seller psychology, 
sales process, sales techniques, and behavioral change. 
During the process of writing this book, I gained even more confidence as a 
salesperson and sales manager. In good conscience, and to be able to provide 
all the advice this book contains, I used the process I developed and outline 
here. I took a direct sales role with a new company. The new territory was 
a challenge and the previous two salespeople had failed by any metric you 
measure. They made very few sales, and secured perhaps two or three new 
accounts in about two years. 
In my first year, my sales engineer and I secured sales with approximately 
40 new customers and finished at 230% of our annual quota. While this is a 
small data set, I proved to myself that I was on to something with the system 
you are about to learn. 
Traditional Sales Training Does Not Work
Here is the dirty little secret of sales training: 
Sales training and materials are developed to be sold, not developed 
to work. 
This may sound a bit harsh, but let’s analyze the most popular topics of sales 
training. Sales books and training come in all shapes and sizes, but 80% of it 
falls into two categories:
	
Sales skills
•
	
Sales processes
•
Here’s what I have learned and what the book will show you: Your success 
does not depend on your ability to manage opportunities, your ability to 
close, or your ability to “wow” with presentations. 
This is a bold statement, but it’s true. Salespeople with average skills can 
be very successful with the proper strategy. Most sales training, in contrast, 
concentrates on improving a salesperson’s selling skills. I believe this is a lazy 
approach by management. Managers feel they need to do something to improve 
sales. So, they train the sales team on skills and expect better results. 
This simply does not work. Management sees that the training does not 
work and they turn back to the trainers for help. The recommendation to 
solve this problem is, if they don’t “get it” the first time, use repetition. Role 

Introduction
xv
play. Repeat over and over again. It sounds like common sense. The sales 
training community pushes the idea because it can sell more training time 
and materials to their customers. 
Sales management buys into this because it is easy to blame the salesperson 
for not “getting it.” They never stop to ask whether the salespeople are 
being tasked and managed effectively. You have probably seen this in training 
classes you have taken. You have a great teacher who motivates you. You 
are excited about everything you are learning. It all makes perfect sense. You 
role play over and over again until you have memorized the process. Then 
what happens when you get back in front of the customer? The ego kicks in. 
You now have something at stake, and you revert to your core ego-driven 
personality. 
Ask yourself: Has sales training ever improved your skills? If so, you are in the 
top 5% of self-aware people. Someone needs to be completely self-aware to 
make significant change in personality. 
I am no different. As I have already stated, I have read hundreds of sales 
books over my career, and I have taken multiple trainings, including some 
of the most popular training courses in the industry. It took me 10 years to 
realize I was one of the “talkers” who did not listen to customers enough. It 
has taken me an additional 10 years to improve on this bad personality trait. 
While I continue to improve, I am sure a 20-year return on investment is  
not the result anyone is looking for. You want to see improvement today, not 
years from now.
The next area that is popular with sales training is the sales process. Again, 
the end customer is the VP of sales. One of their main responsibilities is 
to forecast accurately at a company level. Forecast accuracy is vital to the 
running of any company. Companies need to execute on business planning, 
and Wall Street is looking for revenue expectations. A good process should
	
Help the sales force forecast more accurately.
•
	
Drive proper selling behavior. 
•
Most processes on the market are so cumbersome that management stops 
using them. However, at the end of the day, most companies hold on to 
old processes to justify the massive investment in tools. Salespeople are 
stuck using just the reporting aspects of the process, but selling productivity 
seldom increases. 
This example highlights the issue of training focused in the wrong area. 

Introduction

The Charles Barkley Effect
A perfect example of the difficulty of overcoming ego is The Haney Project. 
Hank Haney is considered the one of the best golf instructors in the world. 
He has a television series on the Golf Channel, and each season, he takes one 
amateur and works with them to improve their golf game. 
The first season is a classic. His amateur is ex-NBA star Charles Barkley. 
Charles’s “natural” swing is horrid. He has glitches, stops in the middle of 
the down swing, and literally looks like he is going fall over every time he 
swings a golf club. (If you want see this swing, take, Google “Charles Barkley 
+ golf swing.” Hank teaches the skill—how to swing the club—like we try 
to teach sales skills. They go to the driving range and practice and practice 
until Charles has a decently smooth swing. This practice is like sales role play. 
Then they go back on the golf course (the sales call), where the swing needs 
to produce results, and where there are consequences. What happens? 
The same horrid swing reemerges, as do your day-to-day sales skills. Why? 
Because under pressure, the subconscious mind takes over. The same thing 
happens to selling skills when you get back in front of a customer. 
Skills vs. Strategy
Selling skills are of course important. Improper selling skills will hinder your 
ability to execute some of the fundamental strategies in this book. But let 
me be clear: the quickest road to better sales results is by shifting your 
strategy. 
And that’s exactly what this book shows you how to do. It has some selling 
techniques, some skills training, and some process, but majority is based on 
a strategy anyone can implement. Let’s go back to the golf example. If you are 
an amateur golfer, you can spend months on the driving range with a golf pro, 
and maybe see a one- or two-stroke improvement. Or, you can go buy Jack 
Nicklaus’s book, Golf My Way, which teaches nothing but shot preparation 
and golf course management. You learn how to aim at the right location, 
how to set up for the golf swing, how to aim away from trouble, which holes 
to attack, and which holes to play cautiously. He teaches you how to get 
the most out of your game regardless of your skill level. With these new 
strategies, you will see a five-six stroke improvement your first time back out 
on the golf course. And, they do not require you to improve your golf swing 
at all. This is the difference between strategy and skill. 
You can work the strategies in this book in conjunction with the more 
popular methods like Solution Selling or the Challenger Sale. As with golf, I 
want the quick strategies to help my game today. But, I also continually work 
on the skills and methods that will improve my game in the long run. I believe 
you should do this as well.

You Picked the Right Book
If you want to sell more, you have picked up the right book. It will not 
require you to deal with uncomfortable role play. It will not require you to 
change how you talk to your customers. It will not require you to change 
how you sell. The strategies it contains do not require you to change your 
personality. Instead, they help change the focus of your efforts, and they 
produce results. 
Specifically, this book is intended to teach you the correct methods for gaining 
access and getting the all-important first order with new customers. You 
learn how to start building trust before you meet with the customer, how 
to engage new customers, how to message, how to identify real opportunities 
you can close, win new customers, and how to keep these customers for life.

Let’s get started.
Disclaimer: This book is an abridgement of my first book, Sales Hunting. 
This is a scaled-down version that concentrates on the basics of sales, not 
hunting (opening up new territory) specifically. We cut out chapters to make 
the book more streamlined for today’s busy professional. The chapters 
that remain were take almost verbatim from Sales Hunting. If by chance 
you have bought both books, please contact me and we’ll come up with an 
accommodation.

Trust
The Grease for Sales Success
Technique and technology are important, but adding trust is the issue of 
the decade.
—Tom Peters
Yet another book on trust? I know there are several books on sales that  
discuss trust as a foundation of a selling. However, there is a huge disconnect 
between the sales processes most companies use today, and reality of selling. 
Everyone talks about building rapport, but then demonstrate how do this in 
two minutes at the beginning of a sales call. Trust is not earned in two minutes; 
it is a continual process that should never stop with your customer.
My goal for this book is to educate you on the importance of developing trust, 
introduce trust into the sales process, help you develop methods for developing 
trust over time, and how to maintain trust. In order to drive home the impor-
tance of trust, I will lean toward new account acquisition—situations in which 
you are starting with zero trust from the customer. The lessons you learn here 
will, of course, apply to all levels of selling and at all times in your career.
The Ultimate Goal and How It Intersects  
with Trust
What is your primary role as a salesperson? It’s to drive revenue for your 
company, so the lights can stay on and payroll can be met. While this is true, 
it immediately points the selling process toward disaster for most salespeople 
and managers. Conventional thinking is that leads turn into opportunities, 
opportunities turn into purchase orders, purchase orders turn into invoices, 
1
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 1 | Trust
2
and invoices turn into cash flow. So, where do most sales processes start? 
Where does most management inspection happen? You guessed right—at 
opportunity. We will discuss why this is a recipe for disaster in detail in the 
coming chapters.
For now, let me say that your goal should not be to find and close as many 
opportunities as possible. Your goal should be to become the customer’s 
trusted advisor. Without any trust there is no sale, and with trusted advisor 
status there is no competition. You don’t need to achieve that status in order 
to win your first opportunity, but why not aim high?
The phrase “trusted advisor” is, however, thrown around too easily. At one 
company I worked for, we had an account-planning worksheet. The form was 
used to rate the level of relationship with the customer. The options were:
No engagement
• 
Engaged without first order
• 
Doing some business
• 
Vendor
• 
Preferred vendor
• 
Trusted advisor
• 
I sat through quarterly business reviews for approximately 40 salespeople. We 
reviewed several accounts for each. Almost half the accounts were marked 
as trusted advisors. Many of the accounts we reviewed had been through one 
sales cycle and our company won the business. Management never once 
challenged the salesperson on the trusted advisor designation. Finally, I could 
not take it anymore and asked a couple of salespeople to define their defini-
tion of trusted advisor. “Well, when the customer wants to buy widget X, they 
purchase from us.” Or, “I have a customer security badge.”
Neither suggests trusted advisor status. Trusted advisor is a simple con-
cept; your customer includes you in their business-planning sessions. Acme 
Technologies is looking to expand manufacturing into South America. Are you 
at the table with the customer when they are strategizing the feasibility of this 
expansion? Are you treated like an extension of the company? Do you have the 
ability to add value above and beyond the customer’s team? If the answer is yes, 
you are a trusted advisor. Do not confuse this with being told they are expanding, 
and then being asked to quote something to support that initiative. This status 
is closer to preferred vendor.
A trusted advisor is not the “relationship” guy or the “people person.” 
Relationship being an all-encompassing word, it is worth pointing out that  
I am talking about a business relationship, a valued business relationship. I am 
not talking about the guy the customer likes. This is not the vendor who buys 
lunch all the time. It’s the vendor who is part of the customer’s team, at a peer

level, the person who brings value. If an employee is not offering value, he is 
not part of that company very long, no matter how much he is liked. Same 
goes with salespeople. You are an extension of the customer team. They are 
looking for someone they can trust and gain value from.
Being the trusted advisor is a lofty goal that you may never get to, but one you 
should strive for. So, what is the operative word in trusted advisor? Trusted. 
Your goal should be to establish trust. Trust starts before you set foot in 
the door and is hopefully strengthened by every step you take with your 
customers.
What do I mean by trust? In a sales relationship, the seller must demonstrate 
the core elements of trust. The customer from the beginning will judge you 
on these trust characteristics. They are:
Intent
• 
Capability
• 
Dedication
• 
Results
• 
Let’s define each of these in detail.
Intent
Proper intent makes sales a noble profession. There are so many negative 
stereotypes regarding sales, all of which come from salespeople with wrong 
intentions. The major theme of this book, shifting from opportunity focus to 
customer focus, is a shift of intention.
I never thought I would be in sales. I am an educated electrical engineer. I was 
a nuclear-trained naval officer. I was waiting for a job to open up in a local 
nuclear power plant when I took an “interim” sales position 20 years ago.  
My father was a salesman in the 1970s and 1980s. He always wanted me to 
do better. So, when I started to sell, and the engineering position I was waiting 
for didn’t open up, I felt stuck in sales. It took me years to realize that sales is 
a great profession. When I changed my intention from “sell them something” 
to becoming a salesperson who wanted to educate and help my customers, 
my outlook on my career changed, and my sales results skyrocketed. My day-
to-day interactions did not change, and my skills did not change overnight, but 
that small shift in attitude allowed my customers to perceive better intent.
Your customers know your intentions. They see it in the first two minutes of 
conversation. Are you there to help them or to sell them something?

Chapter 1 | Trust
4
If you are there to help them, you will sell them something, and if you are 
there to sell them something, they will help you directly out the door.
Intention and sales skills are tied at the hip.
 “We tend to judge ourselves by our intentions; we tend to judge others by their behavior.” 
—Stephen M. Covey
If you are talking non-stop about your product or service, the perception 
from your customer will be that you are there just to sell something. If you 
truly get to know the customer, by understanding their needs first, the 
customer’s perception of your intent is to help them. If you lack the necessary 
skills to ask questions and listen, your first step in changing that behavior is to 
have good intention. Most people believe they are of good character, and that 
they have proper intent, but your customer can only see your behavior. If you 
care, you will listen. First and foremost, the customer must perceive you are 
there to help them. They want to see you are truly listening to their needs. 
Do you have a hidden agenda or do you have the best interest of all parties 
in mind? Your intent is to drive value for the customer. We have all heard the 
80/20 rule of sales—80 percent of sales are done by 20 percent of the sales 
team. Nothing is more powerful in putting you in the top 20 percent than 
proper intention.
Capability
Do you have the necessary skills, knowledge, competence, and abilities to help 
your customer? In the ever-changing world of sales, capability is increasingly 
important. Your customers are inundated by requests for their time, both internal 
to their organization and externally by sales professionals. They want to learn 
from their vendors and will make time if they believe you have the capability.
You must demonstrate competence. You must show industry and product 
knowledge. All too often, the focus for sales management is about under-
standing the features and benefits of your products. It is much more than that. 
You must demonstrate that you understand how business is done—budgets, 
project timelines, decision processes, and so on. Are you capable of educating 
your customers on better ways they can do things? Do you show a propensity 
to drive results? Do you drive thought leadership? Can you get the customer 
to rethink their current way of doing things? In other words, do you bring 
value as an individual? Does your company bring value? Do the products or 
services bring value?

Trust-Based Selling

Your capability as a salesperson is directly tied to your ability to show proper 
intention. Are you skilled in sales; do you ask the right questions; are the 
questions good; do you show you care?
Capability is the one area you can control most since there is a wealth of 
knowledge you can tap into, from peers, managers, the internet, and even 
customers. While you show capability in front of the customer, it is developed 
on your own time without pressure.
You do not have to be all-knowing. You can show your competence by being 
a good resource manager. If you lack in any knowledge area, you can utilize  
others to fill the gaps. That’s why you should use the resources at your disposal—
engineers, managers, partners, and subject matter experts. 
Dedication
Customers want you to demonstrate as much effort toward their success as 
they do. They want salespeople who follow through on promises. They want 
salespeople who can help drive the sales process. They have needs that must 
be filled, and sometimes they are so busy they rely on their salespeople to 
keep them on track with their own projects. Are you diligent with helping the 
customer? Are you dependable? Do you take control of the situation? Do you 
push through with the decision process? Do you follow through with your 
commitments? Are you dedicated to your own solution?
I ask those questions, because trust, and especially dedication, is about character. 
If you show weak character in any area of the sales process, you lose the 
confidence of your customers. The classic place this happens is during nego-
tiations. Most salespeople take the attitude that they must give in to every 
customer demand, and every pricing request. They believe that is the way to 
earn customer trust and loyalty. In fact, this weak behavior actually has the 
opposite effect. What you are showing them is that you don’t believe in the 
value of your own services, and you lack commitment and dedication to your 
own company. The customer might be happy that they get better terms and 
conditions they are looking for, but they will slowly lose their trust of you. Of 
course, negotiations require compromise, but you must demonstrate strength 
throughout the process.
All your actions make up your character, which determines the trust your 
customers have for you. If you are playing golf with your customer and bend 
the rules, your customer notices. Every aspect of your character counts, so 
always think through the message you are sending to your customer. While 
it’s important to remain dedicated to helping the customer, you cannot forget 
to protect the value of your time, product, or company. Giving in on price, for 
example, can actually hurt you as much as getting caught cheating at golf.

Chapter 1 | Trust

Intention is shown, capabilities are demonstrated, results are measured, but dedication is where you 
earn the trust of your customer.
Results
You must deliver the results you promised. You must deliver on time. In order 
to be fully trusted, you need to measure the return on investment you said 
would be achieved with your solution. Ultimately it doesn’t matter what your 
intentions are, how dedicated you are, or how smart you are; in the end you 
must be able to deliver results. The reason you are there is to help strengthen 
some aspect of the customer’s business.
You buy a used car. The salesperson and everyone at the dealership were 
incredibly helpful; they listened to your needs and were instantly able to find 
a car that fit your requirements perfectly. They knew every specification and 
feature of every car you discussed. The salesperson understood the purchase 
process, including leasing, financing, trade-ins, titling, and delivery. You feel that 
you worked out a very fair deal on the car. In other words, you saw impeccable 
intent, capability, and dedication. You drive five miles down the road and the 
car stalls. How do you feel about this salesperson and this dealership now? 
Without results, nothing else matters. You are not in direct control of the 
results your company can deliver. However, the act of measuring results—
good, bad, or indifferent—will go a long way toward building trust.
The act of measuring results can be just as important as great results. Most 
salespeople, or companies, do no take the time to measure and share results.  
I believe most people are afraid to measure, because they are afraid the results 
might not be as desired. Your customers know whether they are getting value 
from your solution. By taking the step to measure results, you show you  
are dedicated to their success. If the results are great, you are in good shape. If 
the results are bad, you have identified something that needs to be addressed. 
You will gain more trust by fixing any issues.
A discussion about results can seem a bit out of place in a book about  
penetrating new accounts. It is true that measurement of results will help you 
with repeat business with a customer. However, if you know results are an 
important part of trust, you must figure out a way to show results before a 
sale. I will discuss many ways this can be done.

Trust-Based Selling

It All Matters
When developing trust, you are building a sense of power with the customer. 
Ask yourself, whom do you trust in a crisis situation? Do you trust the per-
son who makes sure that everyone is comfortable, or do you trust the per-
son who takes control? Authority is powerful. Authority is powerful in sales. 
While you cannot change your personality, as already mentioned, authority is 
built as you build on the trust elements. Knowledge will also give you confi-
dence, which leads to trust and authority. Confidence is important in many 
aspects of a sale:
Confidence in pointing out issues your customer  
• 
might face.
Confidence in your solution.
• 
Confidence to have a peer-level relationship with your 
• 
customer. You don’t cater to their every whim.
Confidence to stick to the value of what you are selling 
• 
and not always giving in on price.
Confidence in driving your customers to make progress 
• 
toward their goals.
Each trust element is crucial. If you are missing any one of them, you are not 
completely trusted. Analyze each of these elements as if you are missing one. 
It does not matter if you have the best intent, and are capable and dedicated, 
if you can’t deliver results. Customers are looking for results.
If you can produce results, but your intent is only to sell the customers 
something, they will sense that you do not have their best interest at heart. 
Trust will not be established. To establish full trust, each element needs to 
be addressed. You can go through the exercise on your own. Think through 
situations where three of the trust elements are satisfied, but one is left out. 
Think to yourself, “Do I fully trust this person to deliver for me?”
These are the qualities your customers are looking for in a trusted advisor. 
Figure 1-1 shows your goal with customers.

Chapter 1 | Trust

The trust meter (Figure 1-2) for the trusted vendor is full. That means you 
have demonstrated or measured each element. It is okay to show how you 
have delivered results for another customer, but it is critical that you dem-
onstrate you can produce measureable results for them. They need to be 
shown, not just told. I will use this pie chart as a trust meter. Figure 1-2 shows 
a completely shaded, or full, trust meter.

During the buyer’s status quo stage, they have vendors they are already doing

Although they may not be at trusted advisor status, or have all four core  
trust elements in proper alignment, you must assume they are farther along 
than you.

Your alignment stage to the buyer’s status quo is plan and target. The incum-
bent vendor has demonstrated integrity, has shown their intent is to care, has 
solved problems, and has measured results.

Chapter 1 | Trust

 “People buy from people.” You have heard that a thousand times. Let me take this a step further, 
“People buy from people they trust.”
The Value of a Personal Relationship
Do not underestimate the value of a personal relationship. I could easily add 
a “P” section to the trust pie. Some salespeople have that natural ability to 
forge quick personal relationships with customers.. However, the P section is 
one small aspect of the relationship, so people skills get you only so far. At 
the end of the day, the customer has a job and goals to meet. Here is a direct 
quote from a customer I know, “He is a great guy, but I can only have so many 
lunches before I feel like I am wasting time. I have a job to do.”
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, your customer evaluates trust with every-
thing you do. If you are establishing a personal relationship with a customer, 
do not compromise the business trust you built with low-character activities, 
like cheating in golf, drinking too much over dinner, or acting unprofessional, 
to mention a few. There is no distinction between personal and business 
character—it is just character.
Example
I was working for the industry leader in data storage and trying to break into 
an account that was held by my competitor. I did most of the right things.  
I even called high and met with the CIO. I found an issue that my competitor 
was not in a position to solve.
It was a hotly contested sales cycle, and I was competing against a trusted 
incumbent. The customer needed more performance in their computing  
systems, and they determined that the type of technology installed from 
my competitor was not the proper technology. The incumbent did nothing 
wrong; over time, new computing needs out grew this particular technology. 
The customer needed to improve performance. In order to do this, they were 
convinced they needed a certain type of technology, a technology in which my 
company was the industry leader. We had thousands of customers running 
this technology in their environments who experienced great improvements 
to system performance.

Trust-Based Selling
11
My competitor, the incumbent, was just entering the market with this technol-
ogy, and it was widely known in the industry that they had a ton of bugs. They 
had one reference customer—themselves. The referral they used was their 
own internal IT department. We had better technology and references, com-
petitive pricing, and a powerful position within the organization. Slam dunk!
On a Monday night, I was eating pizza outdoors at a restaurant, and I get a call 
from the customer. “Congratulations Dave, we are going with your technol-
ogy.” Well, dinner became more of a celebration.
The next morning, with my head a bit cloudy, I get a call from my new cus-
tomer, “Dave, can you answer one more question?” I was thinking, “Where 
is this going? Something is not right.” They had already said I had won, why 
another question?
I answered the technical question to the customer’s satisfaction. That after-
noon, I got another call. “Dave, we decided to go with the incumbent.” I had 
better pricing, technology, references, and so on. Why did I lose? They trusted 
their incumbent more than me, the new salesperson.
Remember that the sales cycle breaks the Qualify/Develop stage into distinct 
sections. Establish trust then qualify. In my eagerness to win a “slam dunk” sale, 
I skipped straight to qualifying the technical aspects without first establishing 
trust. I sold the product first, then the company, and then myself. But any buyer 
buys in this order:
1.	 You. Do they trust you to help them with moving their 
business forward?
2.	 Company. Is the company stable; will it stand behind what 
they sell me?
3.	 Product. The product needs to meet their needs, but 
they will not consider product until trust is established.
In this example, I definitely had company and product advantages, so I have to 
assume I did not have their trust. I lost that opportunity, but using the strate-
gies in this book, I gained that company as a long-term customer.

Summary
When you know the customer is looking for trust, and you can break down 
trust into tangible components, you can shift your strategy at each stage of 
the sales cycle to address each component. Always keep in mind that you 
must show that your intent is to help. You must continually improve your 
knowledge and skill to show proper competence. You must follow through on 
your commitments, large and small, to your customer. And, most important, 
your customer is looking for results. You must demonstrate you can deliver 
what you promise before and after the sale. In coming chapters, I will explain 
how trust evolves through a typical sales cycle. However, first we will lay the 
foundation of selling 101—the psychological process used by every buyer 
regardless of the size of the purchase—then how the salesperson must align 
to the buying process, and finally how most sales processes are broken when 
it comes to acquiring new accounts. Naturally, I will then demonstrate how 
you can use trust to overcome poor processes and hone your sales skills.

Sales Killers
You Never Had a Chance
Status quo, you know, is Latin for “the mess we’re in.”
—Ronald Reagan
We are starting with establishing trust from the beginning of the sales rela-
tionship, since this is the most difficult scenario in which to succeed. But let’s 
set aside the idea of trust for the time being and look at the challenges faced 
by sales reps even before they make first contact the customer.
Why are improved sales results so hard to drive? What are the root causes?  
To improve results, salespeople and management both grab onto tangible 
ideas like product training, working leads, work ethic, sales process, and sales 
skills training. But the difficulty of succeeding in sales is often not rooted in the 
salesperson’s lack of experience or sales skills. There are many seasoned sales 
professionals who fail to meet their goals. The reasons fall into the category 
of status quo.
There are many variations of the status quo:
Potential customers are already doing business with an 
• 
incumbent vendor
Customers do not have a big enough issue to make a 
• 
change

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 2 | Identify the Silent Sales Killers

Customers’ fear of change and the risks it brings is holding 
• 
them back
Customers have fallen into the rut of habitual purchasing—
• 
the automatic use of an incumbent vendor, without thought
Customers have competing uses for capital—they have more 
• 
important projects than than the one you are proposing
Customers are not in the market—they buy what you 
• 
sell only every few years, or longer
Let’s look at how each of these items works against developing new business 
in more depth.
“We Have a Guy for That”
Customers have standing relationships in place for almost everything they 
purchase. Whether they buy that product or service every week or every 
four years, they have a vendor. You may be a better, more caring, and more 
competent salesperson than the incumbent. You may work for a better com-
pany than the incumbent. And, you might have far better products or ser-
vices than the incumbent. However, the incumbent salesperson has the most 
important asset in sales: the trusted business relationship.
Example
Here’s an example. A reseller, VarTech, recently entered into a new relation-
ship with a manufacturer, Brand Computer. Brand Computer has one of the 
largest product portfolios in the world, and they have resellers established in 
VarTech’s region. As seen in Figure 2-1, the customer base has the option to 
buy through a value added reseller, or directly from Brand Computer. Being a 
new reseller competing against incumbent resellers, VarTech needs a strategy 
for how to ramp with this new manufacturer.

Trust-Based Selling
15
Brand offers endless product training for VarTech’s sales teams and engineers. 
Marketing programs are developed to introduce this new relationship to 
VarTech’s customer base. Field sales teams from both companies conduct 
countless account mapping and territory planning sessions. Yet after six 
months, the reseller has very little sales traction. Looking for answers, sales 
management turns to the manufacturer for help. Brand Computer’s answer is, 
predictably, more product training. Still, results do not improve.
A couple of months later, VarTech was able to hire two of Brand’s senior, 
successful salespeople. These individuals interviewed very well. They passed 
the personality/sales profile tests. Their references checked out flawlessly. 
Their product knowledge of Brand Computer products is, naturally, well 
beyond any VarTech salesperson, since that’s all they had been selling the 
previous five years.
Each of these new hires comes to the company with relationships with 
several customers. These relationships are at high levels, with the power buyers. 
That’s reflected in their results—together they sold $30 million worth of 
products in the previous year. Clearly, these are senior salespeople—experienced, 
hard-working, and full of product knowledge.
This was the answer to VarTech’s problems. The company’s goal is to sell  
$3 million of the manufacturer’s product in the first year. This goal is only 
10% of what these individuals did the year before in their sales roles at  
Brand Computer.
But things didn’t go as planned. In their first year at VarTech, they booked 
$100,000 in sales—99.7% less than they did the year before.

Chapter 2 | Identify the Silent Sales Killers

Here are two experienced, hardworking salespeople with track records 
of success. They had full support from the company. They had no trouble  
getting their feet in the door with their old customers. Sales managers went 
on high-level calls with them to most of their old customers. So, what was the 
problem? Why such horrific sales results which, incidentally, resulted in their 
terminations within 12 months?
To understand what went wrong, we must analyze their previous year of 
success. What made them successful during their tenure at Brand Computer? 
What was the sales model?
They did 100% of their business through resellers.
Let me repeat that. They did 100% of their business through a reseller like 
VarTech. These salespeople thus had more of a “how is everything going” type 
of relationship with the customer. The resellers, on the other hand, owned 
the valued business relationships with the customers. How do you think the 
calls went with their old customers now that they worked for VarTech, a 
competitor for many of them?
Let’s analyze the initial conversation one had with an old customer. When 
asked by the customer, “Tell me about your new company,” one of the new 
salespeople, Susan, and her sales manager spent 30 minutes with the customer 
reviewing the capabilities of their company. At the end of the appointment, 
the customer was at least honest with the new rep, “Susan, thank you for 
the overview of your new company. Sounds like there is a lot you can offer, 
and we value the relationship we have had with you. Thank you for the hard 
work you have done over the years. However, as you know, I also have a 
relationship with Jim at VPH (another reseller of Brand Computer). I can’t 
just move my business to your new company. He has also been a great asset 
to our company, a trusted advisor. He probably has to screw up pretty big 
for us to change. They process our orders the way we like, our credit line is 
established, they are a preferred vendor in our system, and they have great 
engineering support.”
In other words, “We have a guy for that.”
The situation gets worse. The rep says, “We definitely understand that. I also 
liked working with Jim. So, what can we do to earn your business?” Two things 
here: She did not throw Jim under the bus. That’s good. But she gave up all her 
power. That’s bad.
The customer says, “Well as business comes up I can give you a chance to 
quote.”
Susan replies with a smile, “Thank you. All we ask for is a chance.”

Trust-Based Selling
17
Susan and the sales manager leave the call happy. The door is open! The 
customer is giving them a chance. The sad fact is that Susan and the manager 
think the only chance they have against Jim is to win on price, since he is giving 
them a chance to quote.
Does this turn out as they hope?
They get a chance, actually several, over the course of the year. However, 
Susan’s replacement at Brand Computer is working with Jim, the incumbent. 
In the IT industry, the first company to register the deal with the manufacturer 
enjoys a significant cost advantage over competing resellers, making it nearly 
impossible for VarTech to use lower pricing as a strategy. So, Susan never has 
a chance to win on price, which in itself is a bad way to earn business.
Why? Let’s say this “get a chance” strategy had worked. They get to quote on 
a project. The sales manager wants this customer, so they take the business 
at very low prices. With this strategy, they become the low-cost provider, a 
weak vendor, and not a partner. Winning on price just gives up your personal 
value to the customer.
But Susan never got even this far, and she was out of a job within a year. 
Later, I will outline the strategies Susan should have used to compete against 
the incumbent.
Habitual Purchasing
Habitual purchasing is a sales “relationship” in its lowest form: “We just buy 
all that stuff through Larry.” Customers who have high transaction rates will 
often fall into this category. They have a preferred vendor, the order process 
is routine, and pricing seems fair. They might even have certain items show up 
month after month. They might not have seen the salesperson in months. But, 
nonetheless, “We buy our stuff from Larry.”
Example
Let’s say a new salesperson, Sara, is trying to sell dental supplies to a busy 
dentist. She visits his office every week, in the hope she can actually catch 
the dentist to talk to him. This dentist had a relationship with a salesperson, 
Ben. Ben was a relationship guy. He won over the dentist when the dentist 
was just starting out. For 10 years, the dentist bought all his dental supplies 
from Ben’s company. Ben retired two years ago, and Chris replaced him. Chris 
barely steps foot in the dentist’s office. Chris is young, and he has nothing 
in common with this dentist. Nonetheless, the dentist keeps ordering from 
Chris’s company.

Chapter 2 | Identify the Silent Sales Killers
18
Over the years, the dentist has had to deal with so many different salespeople, 
he got to the point he does not even take calls or appointments from anyone 
new. His automatic response, and his defense against new salespeople is, “I buy 
my stuff from Ben’s, or that new kid’s, company.” He probably repeats this so 
many times that he almost believes he is not allowed to go anywhere else.
This is habitual purchasing. The dentist has a “relationship,” but it is more out 
of habit. He does not have to think about it. At the end of the month they 
tally up their inventory and just send an order over. The dentist even says, 
“What I like about this new kid is that he does not try to sell me.” He views 
new salespeople as just trying to sell him something. He views the kid who he 
doesn’t know as his preferred supplier, “Because he understands I just want to 
order and not be sold.” In reality, Chris does not understand anything about 
this dentist. he has tried to meet with him often, and the dentist rebuffs her, 
saying, “We are good. We use you; no need to come in.” Chris eventually will 
just stop calling.
So, the new person, Sara, coming in has practically no chance. What can she 
do to talk to this dentist? I will share the strategies she uses to eventually win 
this dentist’s business later in the book.
Don’t give up on customers in “habitual purchase” mode. They meet the best quality of any 
customer—they are purchasing. Eventually they will understand that salespeople can help them do 
more business or save money.
Not in the Market
In most B2B sales, buying cycles are lengthy. I will define buying cycles in detail 
later, but here is a simple definition for this chapter—it’s the period of time 
between customer purchases. Do they buy what you sell every week, every 
year, every four years, 10 years, or 20 years? Your only chance of beating an 
incumbent vendor is to beat them to the punch. You need perfect timing to 
engage the customer when they decide they need to buy and before they call 
the incumbent. This window of opportunity is very small. If they purchase—or 
consider a vendor change—every four years, this window of opportunity is 
maybe two months prior to the customer seriously considering the solution. 
That is a probability of 4.2% to engage the customer at just the right time.  
I will explore this at length in Chapter 6, Build Business Relationships.

Trust-Based Selling
19
Most sales processes have you believe that if you can create enough pain, or 
expand on an issue the customer has, they will suddenly be in the market. This 
is not the answer. What if the customer just purchased? What if there really 
is no issue? What is your strategy at that point? Customers live with pain all 
the time. While pain must be present for the customer to make a purchase, 
you cannot always manufacture pain for the customer. Plus, customers often 
live with pain for various reasons.
Example
The best way to demonstrate customers living with pain is through an example 
we can all relate to on a personal level. On a day-to-day basis, you live in a 
house. Typically, you buy what you can afford at the time. Over the course of 
the years, you start to make more money. You have your first kid. You start to 
accumulate more stuff, and the house starts to feel too small. Every day, you 
drive past a new neighborhood that is closer to work and where the homes 
are larger and nicer than the home you live in. You would love to move, and 
you now make enough money to afford a new home in this neighborhood. Even 
your ego is kicking in; your internal voice is saying, “Move up, you deserve it.”
You drive up to your existing home and see all the work you have put into the 
yard, you walk into the living room where you have laid the hardwood floor 
yourself. You see where your child took their first steps.
The next morning it’s Friday, but you are stuck in traffic and late for work, and 
you are sitting in front of that new neighborhood, “Wow, it would be nice to 
have saved 15 minutes on my commute. I would be past this traffic by now.” 
Then you start to seriously consider a move. As traffic eases up, you think 
about the effort it would take to move. You have to list your house, which 
means finding an agent. You will have to keep your house immaculate for the 
next three months. On the other side, you might have to deal with builders in 
the new neighborhood, and timing the sale of your current house with having 
the new house be move-in ready. The hassle of the physical move itself is a 
huge consideration. The new home will be bigger, which means you will need 
new furniture. You just finished hanging blinds in every window of the old 
house after five years. You will have to landscape and hang blinds in this new 
house. The list continues in your mind.
On the way home you start to wonder what your weekend plans should 
be, but you have nothing planned. You start to think, “The weather is great. 
You know what, I think I am going to go look for a new boat this weekend.” 
Thoughts of a new house have evaporated . . . for now.

Chapter 2 | Identify the Silent Sales Killers
20
This example points out several reasons why customers live with pain.
1.	 They are emotionally tied to a solution they presently 
have. In a business setting, they made a significant pur-
chasing decision at some point. They may have tweaked 
the solution over the years. They are comfortable  
with their solution. They know the ins and outs of their 
current solution.
2.	 The thought of change, or of the unknown, is too over-
whelming. The act of change will not be easy. They fear 
the learning curve of a new solution.
3.	 They have other uses for their money. They have more 
urgent projects.
In this example, you hate the commute and really want a new house that is 
bigger and in a better location. You know you have a long commute. You 
know you keep tripping on toys in your small home. But, you are not willing 
to change for a variety of reasons. Even if a real estate agent came in and 
starting selling features and benefits of the new home and neighborhood, you 
are still not ready to make the emotional decision to move. It is just easier to 
do nothing.
Understand that in many cases it is easier to do nothing than to entertain the idea of buying what 
you are selling. Even if your solution is superior, the thought of changing is too daunting for many. But 
there are ways to get people to look to you first when they do decide to buy.
More on the Status Quo
What I just described with the sections “Not in the Market, “We Have a Guy 
for That,” and “Habitual Purchasing” is status quo. Status quo is also known as 
making no decision. It’s the act of keeping the same solution, or doing busi-
ness as usual. So even if you can convince the customer there is a need, how 
do you beat the incumbent? How do these challenges present themselves? 
How do you know when the customer is not in the market or if you are in a 
competitive environment? The customer will not always be direct. And here 
is the interesting part—in status quo, regardless of which category the buyer 
falls in, she will present the same way, usually with silence.

Trust-Based Selling

The most frustrating part of being a salesperson is that prospects don’t bother 
to call you back, return your voice messages, or acknowledge your e-mails. 
After all, they not only have a guy for that, but they have 10 other salespeople 
waiting in line to provide that service or product.
It’s frustrating. You make 50 cold calls a day. You attend networking events. 
You join lead-sharing groups. You do your education on the customer. You 
have the greatest new product on the market. But, your customer does not 
acknowledge any of this. You are just another person, and they hit delete 
before the voicemail system has a chance to play the message through to  
your name.
We have all been customers, and we know what customers face. Think 
about it, how many voicemails do you get a day, how many e-mails? Think 
about the inbox of your personal e-mail account. How many spam e-mails 
do you get? When you don’t recognize the name, do you bother to read the 
e-mail? When a telemarketer calls you, don’t you want to hang up as quickly 
as ­possible? Business customers are people with busy lives. They do not feel 
any different.
Throughout the book, I discuss tactics and methods to get past the silence 
and gain access to prospects.
Understand the Opportunity Trap
The “opportunity trap” is how you learn about the power of the status quo. 
Thanks to your efforts, you engage a customer with an opportunity. They 
seem to want your input and bid. But they have no intention of awarding you 
the deal. You can identify you are falling into this trap over and over again 
because you have a large pipeline but never seem to close anything. Most 
managers will come to believe that you have a problem with closing business.
With any customer, if you go straight after opportunity, your relationship is 
not nearly strong enough to unseat other vendors with more established 
relationships. You probably are losing most of your deals to “the guy we have 
for that.” The difference is now you have skin in the game. You now see the 
opportunity, spend time on the opportunity, forecast the opportunity, and 
usually lose the deal. The problem is that customers need to look at more 
than one solution, or proposal, whenever there is a large purchase. They need 
to do this either because of policy, where they require three proposals, or 
because they are looking to negotiate against their chosen vendor. The other 
vendors they use for comparison are called “column fodder.”
Let’s take an example that has nothing to do with sales, but will drive home 
the point: American Idol. If you have been living under a rock for the last 10 years, 
or this book is still in print 50 years from now, and you have not heard of it, 

Chapter 2 | Identify the Silent Sales Killers

American Idol is a singing contest television show. Each season, they start with 
literally thousands of contestants, and, through a series of eliminations, they 
crown one winner. Here is how the process works. Before the season starts, 
they go to eight or nine cities. They advertise for contestants and fill up a 
football stadium in each city with the hopefuls. Each meets with a producer of 
the show, to see if they can get a chance to perform for the celebrity judges, 
with a potential to get on TV in the early rounds. The celebrity judges then 
select maybe 200 contestants to advance in the competition. The 200 con-
testants over the course of a week get whittled down to 15 contestants who 
make the live shows. Then, viewers vote on their favorite singer, and the one 
with the least number of votes gets eliminated each week until there is a one 
winner.
In the very first elimination event, the producers screen thousands of hopefuls 
to put in front of the celebrity judges. The four types that make it to televi-
sion are:
1.	 The great singers.
2.	 The singers that the producers need a second opinion 
about. They may have a unique quality or voice.
3.	 The “fun” people who do crazy things that will be fun to 
watch. They have no chance to win, and they know it. 
They are just happy to get on television.
4.	 The people who think they are good but are just awful. 
These people make for the best television because they 
can’t believe they are not good, and they go insane when 
they are eliminated from consideration.
How does this relate to sales? In sales you have a champion, a primary point 
of contact at the customer who guides you through the sales cycle. The cham-
pion is analogous to the producer. As with the producers, the champions have 
a mission, one that is in the best interest of the show or the company. Who 
does the champion advance in the sales cycle?
1.	 The incumbent, “the guy,” the great singer.
2.	 The hopeful, “the new guy they like.” The second option 
singer.
3.	 The vendors they are going use to beat up on price to keep 
the first two companies honest. But, unlike the category 
3 singers on American Idol, you still might have a chance at 
this stage. Later, you’ll learn different strategies. Or, if they 
stick you in this category and you know it, you can mini-
mize wasting your sales time by bowing out early.

Trust-Based Selling

4.	 This is the worst position as a salesperson. You think you 
have a great opportunity. And, you work it to the bitter 
end. You forecast it. You waste your time and company 
resources. However, you never had a chance in the first 
place. This is column fodder.
Where would you rather lose a deal—before the producers, or before 
the 20 million TV viewers? Would you rather qualify the deal out early or 
waste time—hours, weeks, or months—holding on to hope? On the show, 
the singers with little talent who are told by the producers they are good  
are devastated when they learn the truth from the celebrity judges. Salespeople 
in this category are frustrated and confused, because all along their ­“champion” 
was telling them they were winning the deal.
I will help you identify if you are number 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the process. This 
will help you understand why you lose so many deals in the first year, and it 
will help you avoid wasting that precious time. I will also help you identify if 
opportunities you uncover are worth working, or reporting in your forecast. 
But most importantly, I will discuss how to take advantage of opportunities 
that you do have a chance to win.
Avoiding the opportunity trap is not an easy problem to overcome. You will 
be pressured to build a pipeline. If you are not at quota, you will have per-
sonal and managerial pressure to work these deals hard to the bitter end. 
Along the way, you may feel your only chance to start doing business with a 
customer is through aggressive pricing. This is a mistake. It will only hurt your 
long-term relationship.
How Buyers View You
Beware of opportunities early in your relationship with potential customers. 
I have used the American Idol example to loosely define column fodder. An 
educated buyer will look at more than one vendor to compare and negotiate 
pricing. Professional buyers are taught to engage with three or four vendors 
with each deal. Let’s label the vendors as A, B, C, and D.
A is the vendor that the customer wants, the customer who has the trusted 
relationship. Determining if you are this vendor should not be difficult. Vendor 
A can be the incumbent, or the vendor that helped the customer discover a 
need and establish the purchasing criteria. This is the vendor that probably 
spent the most time with the customer. Vendor A will get access to the true 
decision-makers.
The customer can live with Vendor B, if they do not get the pricing or terms 
they believe are fair from A. You can identify yourself as B if you are not the 
incumbent but helped identify a need for the customer. You have a unique 

Chapter 2 | Identify the Silent Sales Killers
24
solution that offers greater value than A. The customer has spent a consider-
able amount of time with you. Vendor B has controlled access to power.
Vendors C and D for the most part are there to help negotiate the pricing of 
Vendors B and A. The customer spends very little time with these vendors. 
These vendors are late to the game and are given the requirements of the 
project, but they have no influence over the criteria. A lot of times, Vendors 
C and D will receive a call asking for pricing. Or, on the first few visits to the 
customer, the customer may say, “Great timing. Yes, we have something we 
need. Here are the criteria. Can you get us pricing?” If you are answering an 
RFP that you had no input on, you must consider yourself Vendor C or D. 
If you didn’t help shape the RFP you are bidding on, understand that you are most likely a third- or 
fourth-tier vendor and have your work cut out for you. Or you have no chance of winning the sale no 
matter what you do.
Most sales processes teach that one of the criteria you must have to win a 
deal is a champion. This is an individual at the customer site who guides you 
through the process, sharing information like decision criteria, who the players 
are, who the competition is, and so on. Educated customers are taught to 
assign a champion to all the vendors in the running, even the ones they have 
no intention of purchasing from. Keep in the back of your mind the questions, 
“Did we earn this level of support from the customer?” If the answer is no, 
you most likely are Vendor C or D.
Here is the basic strategy of the multivendor approach, which is taught to 
most buyers. Each vendor is assigned a champion. The champion helps the 
vendor understand the requirements of the project. Champions for Vendors 
C and D will make them think they are winning, but they need better pricing. 
The customer will keep Vendors A and B insecure, never giving them the 
feeling they are winning.
Vendor D thinks all they need to do is provide better pricing, so they do. The 
customer takes that pricing and negotiates with Vendor C for better pricing. 
With a good price in hand, the customer now approaches Vendor B who, 
remember, has been kept insecure, and asks them for even deeper pricing than 
Vendor C. Now they have a strong price, a solution, and a vendor they can live 
with, Vendor B. They will say to Vendor A, “We have a vendor we like. You are 
now in the lead, but you need to match or come close to Vendor B’s offer.”

Trust-Based Selling
25
The trap is, if you are Vendor C or D, you have been engaged on this opportunity 
by the customer very early in the relationship. You have not built trust. You must 
question why they would trust you with such a large project. Have they investi-
gated your capabilities? Probably not, which is a telling sign. That’s why you do 
not want to spend a lot of time on these opportunities early in the relationship. 
In short:
1.	 You will be forced to use lower pricing. This will pigeon-
hole you as the low-cost vendor.
2.	 You will get out of alignment with your customer if you 
think you are losing. You try too hard.
3.	 The deal becomes about your quota and not their project. 
Your perceived intentions with this customer can be  
forever damaged.
4.	 You can waste a ton of time on these deals and you can 
spend your time better establishing relationships with 
customers who might actually buy from you.
The opportunity trap becomes a vicious cycle that is hard to get out of. You 
end up wasting time on opportunities that you do not have a chance to close. 
So, your pipeline is weak, and you look for more opportunities that have  
little chance to close. This lack of strategy will put your job in jeopardy. It 
is the same strategy as the hunter grabbing a gun, walking into the woods,  
Figure 2-2.  Column fodder

and chasing deer. The deer will just run away when they hear the hunter. The 
hunter is much better off understanding the land, studying the movement pat-
terns of the deer, setting up his deer stand a good location, and allowing the 
prey to come to him.
These Leads Suck
You have a great marketing department. You get three to four leads a week, 
or a day, depending on your industry. You seem to be working harder than 
anyone, not passing up any lead, and working them until they close or die. The 
issue is that these leads are opportunity-focused.
Say you get a lead from marketing. It has all the details.
Contact name
• 
Contact number
• 
Contact e-mail
• 
Brief description of interest
• 
Date for an appointment
• 
Expected purchase timeframe
• 
You go into your Customer Resource Management (CRM) system and accept 
the lead. Next, you call the customer to confirm the call. Approximately 50% 
of the time, the customers will say they need to reschedule, and to please 
call back in a couple of weeks. But this time, the customer confirms. You are 
excited that you have an appointment, a “real” lead. You drive to the customer 
and start, “So you are interested in X.” The customer is confused and says, 
“That’s not what I told the person on the phone. I told them maybe next 
year.” So, you start to back-pedal a bit and begin to qualify the customer. The 
customer seems a bit guarded and does not share that much information. You 
go back to the office, sign into the CRM system, and update the status of the 
lead as dead. But, you put in a callback reminder six months out.
What went wrong? Why was the lead information wrong? What could you 
have done differently?
Your manager will track success with leads. Do you follow through with them? 
What close rate do you have? Marketing will want to cost-justify their lead 
programs and will also track the success of the leads passed to the field. Not 
being near your sales goals, leads become a crutch. You work every lead to 
the end. That’s what your gut instinct says to do, and your manager keeps  
saying, “Success will come; keep working your leads.”

Trust-Based Selling
27
Leads are a great tool, but only if you use them correctly. Leads are not the 
opportunity—leads are a foot in the door. Concentrating on the details of 
the lead will focus you specifically on opportunity, which means you’ll fall into 
the same dilemma as before: they have a guy for that. They engage you on 
deals you have no chance to close, or you don’t run into a dead end talking 
about a specific opportunity. If you start to qualify the customer, you leave 
the door open.
Example
A company’s finance department is having a review with the president. The 
CFO brings to the president’s attention that an incumbent software provider 
is delivering less-than-acceptable support. The discussion becomes whether 
or not the vendor can be replaced. The CFO says that they are pretty much 
locked into the incumbent solution. Even though they do not like this vendor, 
it would be too costly and cumbersome to change the technology. So, what 
do they do to get better service from this vendor? The president says, “We 
need to find a competing technology. Our current vendor needs to think this 
is a real threat. The new vendor needs to think they are winning, so we can 
get a great proposal we can leverage against our current vendor.”
They engage a new vendor with all intentions of deceiving it. They are going 
to give some salesperson hope, but no chance. Would they do this to a 
vendor who has been working for their business? No, they actively seek out 
a “stranger.”
This is not an isolated case. I know of a major customer who has a strong 
relationship with a vendor. They need to refresh the equipment every four 
years. Every four years they find a competitor who is willing to “compete” for 
the business. Every four years, they take the competing proposal and negotiate 
price with the incumbent, and the incumbent wins. This customer has done 
this over the last 20 years, so most people in the industry know that working 
this deal is a waste of time. But, every four years, they find a hopeful, with 
“happy ears,” who is willing to take the bait—even when partners and other 
people in the industry are telling the salesperson they have no chance. This 
new salesperson wastes months of work on a losing effort.
Example
You do the same thing as a consumer. You are buying a car and go to your 
nearest dealership. You negotiate what you think is a good price, but you head 
home to think about it. You want the car, but you want to make sure you are 
getting a good deal. When you get home, you call a dealer that is two hours 
away and you say, “I am looking to buy a car. I would be willing to drive the two 
hours if you give a great price.”

Chapter 2 | Identify the Silent Sales Killers
28
The salesperson on the other end of the phone says, “Let me see what I can 
do.” He goes to his manager and says he has a customer willing to drive down 
if they can give him a good price. He is engaged in the sales cycle, getting manage-
ment involved, and so on. He calls the customer back and says, “Yes, we can 
meet the price you are looking for.”
The price is very similar to the local dealer’s price. You got the information 
you needed, “Thank you, let me think about it.”
The price from the original dealer is fair so now you know you got a good 
deal. Even if it was not fair, you most likely will take that price and try to nego-
tiate with the local dealer. You never had any intention of driving two hours 
to buy from the other dealer, yet you engaged them with the carrot of a sale. 
You intentionally wasted a salesperson’s time. It happens all the time!
Summary
This chapter outlined the major challenges you face when trying to win 
business with a new customer. The number one issue is that they are unwill-
ing to change the current solution or current vendor. I will explore each 
of these challenges in more detail and discuss the strategies you need to 
first gain access, then win the trust of the customer, then focus on oppor-
tunity, and finally close the deal. You need to think outside the opportunity. 
However, that is where I will start, with the basics of an opportunity. The 
best place to start learning about opporunity is to understand the process 
your customers follow when making purchasing decisions. I will cover that 
process in the next chapter.

The Buyer 
Process
Laying the Foundation
Don’t reinvent the wheel, just realign it.
—Anthony J. D’Angelo
You need to lay a foundation on which to build the trust-based strategies 
needed to win new customers. The first place to start is to understand the 
process the buyers follow with every purchase, small or big. This is a naturally 
occurring series of stages; the goal is to define each of the stages to give you 
common ground to build upon.
The Buying Cycle
Books regarding selling and buying cycles fill the shelves of stores. They go 
into much more detail. There are many different sales processes companies 
use, and most likely your company has a process in place.
My model is a simplified version that encompasses the main concepts of most 
processes (Figure 3-1). The core buying processes are the Needs Analysis, 
Evaluate, and Purchase phases. In total, this model defines the entire vendor-
customer relationship cycle.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 3 | The Buyer Process
30
This process applies to every purchase a customer makes, from consumer-
based purchases to multi-million dollar business-to-business purchases.
Let’s look at each of the steps in order.
Status Quo
Customers are conducting business as usual. They have their preferred 
vendors, and they may be evaluating purchases today. They are influenced by 
industry trends. They are constantly being asked to drive cost down. In some 
cases, depending on which department is the target of your sales efforts, they 
may be asked to increase revenues. Today, the customer is living with issues. 
They may not be aware of the issues they have. They may have inefficiencies 
that they may not be aware of. Customers always want to simplify their lives, so 
a lot of times they have vendor-reduction programs underway. They have 30 other 
people just like you calling them daily. At a certain point, a compelling event—
called a trigger—will occur that will cause them to move to the next step.
Needs Analysis
An event has happened, or a business need arises that influences a particu-
lar department. The customer is now tasked with understanding the issue. 
Depending on the complexity of the issue, customers will look for external 
help to define their needs further and start exploring options to solve their 
issue. Once they feel they have a solution, or even multiple solutions, they 
proceed to the next phase.
Figure 3-1.  Buying process

Trust-Based Selling
31
Evaluation
Customers look at each option. They ensure the solution works to the  
specifications the vendor has promised. Once they settle on the most helpful 
solution, they move to the purchase phase.
Purchase
The purchase phase for the customer involves budget approval, if not already 
done; negotiations with the vendor(s), contracts, terms, and conditions; and 
purchase orders.
Most buyer and sales cycles stop after the close, since they are typically 
focused on the sale. I want to discuss two more steps that truly complete 
the buyer/seller relationship. These steps are important in the process of 
understanding your main competitor, the incumbent. I will discuss later how 
the stages impact trust and how they create an unfair playing field that you 
must be aware of.
Implement
Buyers will implement the solution or utilize the product they purchased. The 
buyer can implement the solution by themselves or with help from the seller. 
The buyer is evaluating the ease of implementation. Are there any surprises? 
Challenges? Did the seller stay past the close of the sale? Was implementation 
easy or hard?
Measure
Does the solution live up to the buyer’s expectations? This step is often 
neglected by both buyer and seller. In most B2B sales, an ROI is presented. 
Does the solution in fact meet the ROI objectives? This is one of the most 
important steps in maintaining customers, and lead to easier referrals; both 
internal to the customer and external.
The final two steps in the sales cycle—implementing and measuring—are areas that most salespeople 
neglect. If you want to be a superior salesperson, pay attention to these final steps in all sales. The 
good news is that the typical incumbent’s lack of focus in these stages is a weakness you can exploit. 
Again, I will discuss this in further detail later in the book.

Chapter 3 | The Buyer Process
32
The Buyer’s Four Concerns
Concentrating back on the main purchase phases—Need Analysis, Evaluate, 
Purchase—the buyer balances four psychological concerns. These concerns 
are need, cost, solution, and risk. As Figure 3-2 shows, the relative level of 
concern for each of these shifts throughout the buying process.
Figure 3-2.  Shifting buyer concerns
When buyers first enter into the buying cycle, the primary concern is need, 
followed by cost, solution, and risk. When you enter into a decision to pur-
chase, you know you need something, and you know about how much you 
can afford, or how much a solution might cost. Today this has never been 
more true with pricing information on the internet. In the first phase, buyers 
start off not as concerned with the solution. As buyers progress through this 
stage, they evaluate their needs in more detail and start to get a better sense 
of what they are looking for—the solution. Notice that cost concerns start 
going down. Risk starts to rise since the buyer is spending more time on this 
purchase—the risk of lost time.
In the evaluation stage, customers are focused on the solution; they may test-
drive a car, look at a house, try ice cream flavors, demo your solution, or conduct 
a formal evaluation. During this phase, buyers stop focusing on the need, and 
start focusing on the features and functions. Cost concerns are very low. Risk 
continues to rise as they invest more time in the process.
In the purchase phase, the focus moves to risk. Buyers are concerned about 
whether they are making the right decision. Do they sign on the bottom line? 
What if they make a mistake? In a business setting, this can affect a person’s 

Trust-Based Selling
33
career if the purchase is large. The concern with cost rises in this stage, but 
notice that cost is never top of mind in any stage. It is also important to note 
that need and solution are nearly out of mind in the final stage.
Example
This example illustrates the activities and concerns as they shift throughout 
the buying cycle. It revisits the house scenario discussed in Chapter 2.
In status quo, everyday living, you have been thinking about moving. But you 
decide you can live with the pain of the commute, and you are okay with the 
smaller house. The thought of the cost and chore of moving has you cringing. 
You get home Friday after work, and walk into the kitchen to talk to your 
wife about your idea of buying a boat. Before you open your mouth, your wife, 
smiling, says, “Guess what?”
“What?”
“We are going to have another baby!!”
Being smart, you tuck the bass boat idea away. “Wow that’s awesome honey.” 
After some hugs and kisses, you say, “You know, we need to buy a new 
house.”
You just had a compelling event, a trigger. There is no way your current house 
will provide enough room for two kids.
Most likely, you do not have real estate agents cold calling you, but over the 
years you have made friends with one or two, and you call the one you feel will 
help you find the home you need, someone who knows the market.
Needs Analysis
As far as the seller is concerned, this is when the buyer enters the market 
and into needs analysis. Assume that you are sitting down with the agent for 
the first time to go through your needs. In the early part of the sales cycle, 
your needs are loosely defined: you know about where you need to look, how 
much you are willing to spend, and you probably have an idea of the number of 
bedrooms. When you meet with the agent, she will start to define your needs 
in more detail, probably by asking a series of questions. How old are your 
kids? Are you looking for a sidewalk neighborhood, or more in the country? 
How long of a commute are you willing to tolerate? Does the age of the home 
matter? Would you like new construction? Number of bathrooms? How much 
land are you looking for? Do you care which school district? And, so on.

Chapter 3 | The Buyer Process
34
Just as in the buyer concern graph, you come in with some needs, and then 
start to more clearly define them. During that process, the buyer is also start-
ing to form a better idea of what they are looking for, or the solution. While 
defining the needs, cost is not discussed past the initial range you give the 
agent. At this point you are just developing a wish list.
Evaluation
Now that the agent has a good idea of what you are looking for, she will go 
online and do a quick search of homes for sale that meet your criteria. Now 
starts the evaluation period. You sort through all the listings and, based on gut, 
pictures, pricing, narrow down the list to 5–10 houses to evaluate. You and 
the agent spend the next week, or longer, touring houses. You look carefully 
at every house to see if it meets your criteria, while looking for good and bad 
features.
Look again at the buyer concerns. The buyer’s original needs, or criteria, are 
becoming less of a concern since most of the houses should have the basics. 
But, you now are looking at the condition of the house, the wow of the 
kitchen, the smell of pets. You are more concerned with the bells and whistles 
of the solution. Cost goes out the window. “What an amazing view of the 
lake,” you might say, even though the price of this option may be completely 
beyond your original price range. The evaluation stage closes with choosing a 
house, and having an inspector make sure that everything is up to code.
Purchase
The purchase stage starts with making an offer. Concerns and emotions can 
run high at this point. Risk is the highest concern; you just spent two weeks 
running all over looking at one house after another, and you and your wife “fell 
in love” with one. Concerns with solution and need are both at an all-time 
low. Now it’s about the risk and the price. Price is not the main factor in clos-
ing. Rarely do homebuyers go for the lowest-price house they look at. Risk is 
two-fold in the last stage—the risk of not getting what you need and the risk 
of signing. Now it’s time to sign the mortgage papers. You and your wife sit in 
the lawyer’s office signing 40 different documents. You have seen the numbers 
for the last two weeks, but now is the time to sign, and that’s when risk is a 
huge concern.

Trust-Based Selling
35
Exercise
It would be a great exercise for you to imagine any purchase you have made 
over the last week, and think through the entire buyer process. For example, 
you are driving around with the family on a hot day. The kids are getting antsy, 
so you decide to stop for some ice cream. You just went from status quo to 
needs analysis. You go through each step by evaluating (sampling), purchasing, 
implementing, and measuring results (tasting). Will you get this flavor again, or 
use this ice cream shop again? Every purchase goes through the process and 
different levels of buyer concern. The magnitude of the purchase determines 
the effort spent on each phase, and the range of buyer emotions you will 
experience. Think through going to a restaurant, buying a car, or purchasing 
a vacation.
Summary
Customers go through each stage of the buying process with every purchase. 
In some cases, parts of the process are condensed or simplified. You will learn 
that customers might make the process easier for some vendors and harder 
for others, depending on the level of trust they have with each. In the next 
chapter, you will see that sales cycles are nothing more than aligning with the 
buyer cycles.

The Sales 
Process
Align with the Buyer
Sales is like a dance; you and the customer take the same steps. The 
successful salesperson is not afraid to take the lead, or step on a few toes.
—Dave Monty
To start to define the sales process, let’s start with the end in mind. Ultimately, 
you want the customers to use and gain value from what you sell them. However, 
you must win the sale the sale first. So what do you need to win a deal?
• 
Pain. Every sales process revolves around the concept of 
pain. Without pain, or need, there is no order. Throughout 
my career, I have learned that a compelling event is more 
important than mere pain. A compelling event is pain with 
a time element. This is the best type of pain because it 
makes predicting and closing business easier. “Compelling 
event” means the customer has a deadline. Without a 
deadline, opportunities will drag indefinitely, which can be 
a huge drain on the sales rep’s time.
• 
Solution. The customer needs to envision that your offer-
ing will solve the pain, or fill the need. The customer 
needs to see value. There has to be a return on invest-
ment (ROI). What they spend must either increase  
revenue or reduce cost greater than the investment.

Chapter 4 | The Sales Process
38
• 
Authority. You need a “yes” from someone within the 
organization who has authority to purchase (otherwise 
known as power).
• 
Understanding. You need to identify and understand the 
purchasing decision process.
• 
Relationship. You must have a trusted, valued business 
relationship with the customer.
So how do you bring the customer from need/pain to purchase? Better yet, 
what does the customer need to identify their need and decide to make a 
purchase? The buyer follows a psychological process called the buying process 
(defined in the last chapter). The sales process simply needs to align with that 
process.
The Sales Cycle
As with the buyer cycle, the sales cycle can have many more stages. Again, I will 
stick with a basic sales process in order to build deeper concepts. Figure 4-1 
shows the process and how it correlates with the buying cycle. When working 
new territories or breaking into new accounts, your focus will be mainly on 
the first two stages of this process—Plan and Qualify.
Figure 4-1. The sales process involves defining the buying stages from the sales perspective
Let’s look at each step in turn.

Trust-Based Selling
39
Plan
Sellers must plan how they will develop their customers and territories. You 
must align with your customers even before you meet or reach out to them. 
You need to learn everything there is to know about your industry, and begin 
the process to learn about your customer. This knowledge can be found online, 
from company annual reports, from partners in your industry, and through 
ongoing interactions with the customer. Based on vertical markets, you can 
also make assumptions on customer needs. Planning also involves strategizing 
where to spend your time wisely.
Qualify
Understand the customer’s needs. With most models, the emphasis is on 
qualifying the opportunity. Does it meet all the criteria for an order to be 
placed? Is there pain, a decision process, a yes from power, and a good solu-
tion? You guide the conversation slowly toward your solution based on initial 
customer needs. You expand the needs to fit the solution. Paint a vision for 
the customer for how your solution can help them solve their problem or 
issue. Understand the evaluation process.
This model will shift the emphasis from qualifying the opportunity to qualify-
ing the customer. In the traditional model, the main question you need to 
answer in this stage is, “Is the opportunity worth spending time on?” In this 
model, the question becomes, “Is the customer worth my time regardless of 
an immediate, qualified opportunity?” At this point, I am laying the foundation 
of the sales cycle. I will spend chapters on this shift in focus.
In either model, this stage is the most important, as this is where a solid foun-
dation of trust is built.
Prove
This stage is all about understanding the decision criteria your customer is 
using to make a decision. It’s also about providing a demo of your product, as 
well as your service capabilities. Give customers the product to evaluate in 
their setting.
Close
Closing is, in the context of this sales process, the act of taking an order. 
Closing sales is an art that is present at every stage of the sale. The act of 
closing, if you have qualified right, and have proved your solution meets their 
business requirements, should be the simple acts of negotiating, working out 
the terms of contracts, and completing purchase orders.

Chapter 4 | The Sales Process
40
Implement
Implementation is simply the customer using your service or product. 
Depending on your offering, this can be a simple process or take years. The 
buyer or the seller may be responsible for the implementation. However, it 
is important for the seller to stay engaged at this stage to ensure it runs 
smoothly for the customer.
Measure
Measure the results after implementation. As mentioned earlier, this stage is 
often neglected. For a salesperson, this can be the most powerful stage. This 
stage takes work and diligence and may require input or work from the cus-
tomer. It is important that the buyer is shown by the seller that the value that 
was presented in the earlier stages is true. Notice that these last two stages 
are actually named the same in the buyer and seller processes. Up through the 
Close/Purchase stage, the buyer and seller may work closely together, but the 
agenda of each is different. There are still issues of pricing, terms and condi-
tions, competition, and so on. After the purchase, the customer and the seller 
are partnered in solving the problem.
Your focus in the early stages of developing a territory should be on the customer and not on  
the opportunity. Figure 4-1’s steps are simple to help you stay focused on your goal, which is a sale. 
Example
Let’s continue the real estate example from before, focusing here on the  
seller’s experience during the sale of a home. The sales agent needs to align 
with the buyer right from the beginning.
Let’s say a real estate agent meets a potential new homebuyer at a party. 
Eventually the homebuyer asks, “What do you do?”
She says, “I am a real estate agent.”
“We have been thinking of moving, but we are not ready right now.”
The agent asks, “Why are you thinking of moving?”
“Well, I am not very happy with my commute and our house is getting too 
small,” says the buyer.

Trust-Based Selling
41
The agent makes a mental note. I need to keep in touch with this client; he is close 
to moving. He is not ready to move, but he is one compelling event away from 
moving. So she does the smart thing and stays in touch with this new buyer. In 
six months she gets a call. The buyers are expecting a new baby. The compel-
ling event she had been waiting for occurs.
She gets the listing on the old home, and now she turns her attention to look-
ing for a new home.
Here, the buyer relays the basics of what they are looking for—the number 
of bedrooms, cost range, town, and so on. For any salesperson, this is the most 
important stage of the sale. It’s in this stage that you show your knowledge, 
and how much you care about the customer. When qualifying a customer or 
opportunity, the more you know, the better and easier the sale and evalua-
tion stage. For the real estate agent, effective questions include, “Why are you 
moving? When are you looking to move? Is your current house already on 
the market? Have you secured financing? How old are your kids; does school 
district matter; are you looking for a neighborhood with amenities? Where do 
you work; how long of a commute is ideal?” The goal here is not to teach you 
to be a real estate agent, but to give you a sense how the right questions show 
that you know your business, and that you care about the customer.
On the opposite side of the coin, imagine the agent skips the step of further 
qualifying the needs, and says, “I have the perfect house for you.” The agent 
can’t ignore the most important concern, real need, and jumps straight to the 
solution. I know I would feel uneasy, and that jumping straight to looking at 
houses would seem like a waste of time. Unfortunately, this is exactly the mis-
take 80% of salespeople make—they jump to product discussions well before 
needs have been analyzed in detail.
During the evaluation stage, the agent needs to show the houses. During this 
phase, the buyer can become overwhelmed with the options. What happens 
to cost concerns of the buying in this stage? This concern goes way down. 
It’s at this time that agents will stretch the buyer’s budget. Since concern with 
cost at this point is so low, this tactic goes largely unnoticed. She knows the 
buyer might pay for a lake view, even though it was not one of the original 
needs. The agent is taking advantage of the buyer concern cycle. I use this 
example to illustrate the point that cost is of little concern. In business-to-
business sales, your repeat business is more important than the first sale. So, 
your concern should be for the best interests of your prospect’s business, not 
the size of your commission check.
Now comes the time for the buyer to make that big decision and purchase. 
The biggest concern is risk. The buyer is about to commit a great percentage 
of his paycheck for the next 30 years. A good agent in this case remembers 

Chapter 4 | The Sales Process
42
the sales cycle, and keeps reminding the buyer of the needs and solution. “You 
are going to look great cooking out on that gorgeous back deck. Wow, what 
a great location, only five minutes from work. Now you don’t have to worry 
about finding a hotel in between homes.”
Exercise
As you did at the end of the last chapter, think through a purchase you have 
made recently that involved a salesperson. How did the salesperson do? Did 
she align with you in the buyer process? How did you feel if the person was 
completely aligned, or how did you feel if she was not aligned?
The degree to which you evaluate needs and the solution usually correlates 
to the size of the purchase. You drop your mobile phone and break it. You 
walk into the mobile company’s storefront. The salesperson asks what you 
what brought you in. Does this person instantly start showing you phones, or 
do they get to know what you use your phone for? Do they take the time to 
understand your needs? Do they help you narrow down your choices? Do 
they allow you to try the phone?
After you place the order, does the salesperson help you learn the new fea-
tures of the phone? Most salespeople don’t do this, but did you get a call a few 
weeks a later asking if your purchase is meeting your needs? Think through 
other scenarios you encounter on a daily basis. Take eating at a restaurant, 
where a good waiter is a good salesperson. Or, think through the last car 
you purchased. Did the seller align with you at each stage: Status Quo, Event, 
Needs Analysis, Evaluation, Purchase, Implement, and Measure? If not, how did 
you feel?
Summary
The sales process mimics the natural steps each buyer takes when buying any-
thing. Trust, of course, is woven into the process. Trust and the sales cycle, in 
fact, form a symbiotic relationship. Put another way, trust is developed through 
a sales cycle, and the sales cycle can be defined by trust. In the next chapter, 
I show how trust and the sales cycle affect one another, and why it is so 
important to understand the level of trust you have built relative to your 
competition.

Trust Sales Cycle
The Trust Meter Shows the Way
Trust…affects the quality of every relationship, every communication, every 
project, every business venture, every effort in which we are engaged.
—Stephen M.R. Covey
Focusing on the foundation of the relationship, this chapter analyzes how trust 
is developed from the beginning of a buyer-seller relationship.
Recall the trust meter I introduced in Chapter 1. Trust naturally progresses 
through an opportunity cycle. An example is shown in Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1. Trust progression
It takes a while for your trust meter to fill up. You are an unknown entity to 
your customer as you enter into the sales cycle. You have not established intent, 
capability, results, or dedication. Your trust meter is empty (Figure 5-2).

Chapter 5 | Trust Sales Cycle
44
You start to show your dedication through the evaluation and closing stages. 
Their evaluation of your product or service is in line with the features and 
capabilities you sold. You are dedicated through the contract and negotiation 
process. You remain dependable, but you also show that you value your own 
solution. You continue to follow through on your commitments. You have not 
proved you will stick around after the sale yet, so you get only half the marks 
for dedication at this point. Your capability strengthens as you show more 
depth of knowledge for your own product and start to understand their busi-
ness more deeply (Figure 5-4).
Figure 5-2.  Empty trust meter
Figure 5-3. Trust meter early in the new customer acquisition phase
Let's look at a possible scenario of how trust might progress through one 
sales cycle. If you are able to gain access to your customers, and you properly 
engage them, you can quickly start to show that your intent is to help or 
educate. As customers get more comfortable with you, they will share more 
as they define their needs. During this process, if you act as a consultant and 
focus on the customer, you can start to show capability. However, there is still 
some skepticism by the customer, so elements of intent and capability are 
shaded in a light grey on your trust meter (Figure 5-3). Capability has been 
demonstrated via sales skill and knowledge, but you have not yet demon-
strated your product’s capability.

Trust-Based Selling
45
Figure 5-4. Trust meter as a customer begins to gain confidence in you
Next, your company implements the solution the customer has purchased. As 
a salesperson, you stick around through the implementation, ensuring there is 
a smooth transition from pre-sales to post-sales. So, your dedication quotient 
goes up. Your intent is now completely in line with the customer. The suc-
cess of the implementation is as important to your company as it is to theirs 
(Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-5. Trust meter when you make your first sale
The top salespeople are not afraid to come back after the implementation 
and determine if the solution they sold to the customer actually produces the 
business results they promised during the earlier parts of the sales cycle. By 
demonstrating that you and your company can produce results, you fulfill the 
entire trust process (Figure 5-6).

Chapter 5 | Trust Sales Cycle
46
Figure 5-6.  Full trust meter
Figure 5-7. The sales cycle with the trust overlay
You can be considered the incumbent at this point. However, becoming a 
trusted advisor comes only by repeating this process several times. As trust 
grows, you get the chance to work on projects that are more important, and 
that have more impact on the business objectives of the customer.
Almost every sales process falls short when salespeople do not take into 
account relationships, competition, or timing. Remember, the structure for 
most models is focused 100% on the opportunity. With a full trust meter, sub-
sequent sales cycles become a non-linear process, as shown in Figure 5-7.

Trust-Based Selling
47
Once you have earned the customer’s trust, the next time you enter into 
another opportunity, you do not have to start at the planning and target phases 
of the sales cycle. You now enter during the needs analysis stage (buyer pro-
cess) or the qualify stage (sales process). Not only do you enter at a later 
stage, you don’t have to earn full trust from the beginning. You understand 
the customer’s business already, so you don’t have to spend as much time 
qualifying the customer. You can start to analyze the customer’s needs. Having 
already shown proper intent in a previous sales cycle, the customer will trust 
you and open up to you with more information.
To steal a phrase from the movie Meet the Fockers, you are now in “the circle 
of trust.” (See Figure 5-8.)
Broken Model
While this all sounds great, the model is missing one huge element—“the guy,” 
or the incumbent. With the introduction of the incumbent, a model that is 
focused on opportunity breaks. At the beginning, your trust meter is empty 
and you must assume the incumbent’s is full (Figure 5-9).
Figure 5-8. The Circle of Trust

Chapter 5 | Trust Sales Cycle
48
Once a vendor has established trust, they enter back into the next sales cycle 
at their earned status. The incumbent’s existing trust meter is the major chal-
lenge you face in your first year of sales, or anytime you’re trying to engage a 
new customer (Figure 5-10).
Figure 5-9.  Incumbent vs. new salesperson in the sales cycle
Figure 5-10.  Incumbent trust vs. new salesperson trust
Even if you try to focus on customer needs during your first sales cycle with 
a new customer, you may not be invited into the circle of trust. Without 
enough trust, customers will not always open up to you about their problems. 
Or, they share much more information with the incumbent. They may engage 
you with a proof of concept (the testing of your solution against customer 
needs) in the prove stage, and they may even bring you to negotiations, but 
the incumbent is trusted and you are not. Look at the close stage in the previ-
ous model. While the incumbent’s trust meter is full, your trust meter at best 
looks something like Figure 5-11.

Trust-Based Selling
49
Figure 5-11. Trust meter that shows what you are up against even when you have proven 
your concept to the customer
This simply is not enough trust to compete.
Looking at the fully trusted sales cycle of the incumbent, you can see the pro-
cess is completely condensed. They don’t have to plan and target, nor try to 
gain access to the customer. They enter into the qualify/develop stage ahead 
of a new vendor. If the incumbent is smart, they will spend the time qualifying 
and defining the needs of the customer. Since there is more trust, the prove 
stage is condensed. There is less scrutiny versus a new vendor. The close 
stage for the existing vendor is shortened because they have experience with 
the process. They are set up in the purchasing system, credit lines are estab-
lished, and relationships may have been built with the people in the purchasing 
department. It is easier and less work for the customer to continue using their 
existing vendor (Figure 5-12).
Figure 5-12. The condensed sales cycle of a trusted incumbent

Chapter 5 | Trust Sales Cycle
50
With a new customer, 90% of all sales happen during planning and qualifying. 
In order to compete with an incumbent, you must build trust in the first two 
phases of the sales cycle. Ideally, you want to win the first opportunity you 
engage with a customer, and the only way to do that is to focus on building 
trust as much as you focus on the opportunity. This is the major focus of the 
book, so strategies to accomplish this kind of trust are presented at length.
Summary
When competing against the incumbent, or the status quo, any sales model 
that focuses on the opportunity is broken. The simple realization that you’re 
not playing on a level playing field gives you huge insight—you go into the 
situation with open eyes, which can help you build trust and ultimately win 
business. The next chapter discusses in detail the advantages of focusing on 
establishing trust with new accounts versus focusing only on finding and clos-
ing opportunities.
Figure 5-13. Trust before opportunity
This is a position of power for the incumbent vendor. Early in your relation-
ship, it is like you are playing baseball on two entirely different fields. When 
the incumbent steps to the plate, they only have to run to third base and then 
back home for a run.
Knowing it is not a fair game, your strategy must shift away from getting 
the opportunity and toward building the relationship. The new sales cycle is 
shown in Figure 5-13.

Relationships
Job #1
If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have  
to be right.
—Jerry Seinfeld
On the television show Seinfeld, George is complaining about his life. He feels 
that every decision, every instinct he has, has been wrong. So, Jerry’s advice 
is to do the opposite. As salespeople, every instinct we have is to focus on 
the opportunity. Managers, after all, measure our progress by opportunity. 
However, if your focus with a new customer is only to find opportunities, you 
will fail.
Although it’s not exactly the opposite of targeting opportunity, you need to 
build business relationships first. Once you gain access to a customer, the focus 
needs to remain on the customer. Focus on the customer’s needs and adding 
value to the customer’s experience before you look to fill your pipeline.
Every sales skill is about focusing on customer issues, or finding a solution that 
will help them. This is the foundation to the establishment of trust. However, 
every sales process implemented today only tracks what is in it for the sales-
person, focusing on going after tangible opportunities. This forces salespeople 
to lose their way with new customers. I illustrated several times in the previ-
ous chapters that opportunity can’t be trusted. You need to start by forging 
a relationship. The sales managers out there are probably thinking, “You can’t 

Chapter 6 | Build Business Relationships
52
forecast on or close a relationship.” I understand that relationship is only part 
of the equation. It’s just that without it, there is no sale. Let me also reassure 
you that, by forgetting about opportunity during your initial engagements, you 
will find many more opportunities within the first year. Opportunities you 
actually have the chance to win.
The Outcome of Good Relationships
Focusing on relationships has three major effects. One, it opens the window of 
opportunity. The more time you spend with the customer, the better chance 
you have to hit a purchase cycle and or a compelling event. Two, once you are 
engaged in an opportunity, you are more trusted; you are in a position to win. 
Three, by qualifying the customers you will make better use of your time. You 
will understand which customers fit with your product. You can start to be 
selective with your customers.
Going back to the example of Tom in the Introduction, where Tom chases 
opportunities in his first year and struggles, what advice should Tom’s manager 
have given him after Q1? Had I been his manager, I would have said, “Tom, let’s 
go down your list and see which customers best match our ideal customer 
profile. Of these customers, which ones do you feel a personal connection to? 
How much time are you spending with these customers?”
I would go on to say that I wanted him to spend half his time on establishing 
more trust with these customers. He can, for example, meet other people 
who are part of their decisions. He can organize “lunch and learns” for the 
customers. He can provide educational industry training or provide road maps 
detailing future products or services. He should provide this in the spirit of 
education, not with a goal of trying to sell something. He can also introduce 
his contacts to different people from his own organization. I will explore these 
in more detail, and show how such efforts help you establish trust with your 
customers.
Trust the System
This is where you need to trust in the process. It is not easy to do. There is 
nothing in the forecast to warrant the time and resources Tom is devoting to 
this customer. Then why do it?
You hear this all the time: “Sales is a numbers game,” but we need to change 
the concept of the numbers game. Looking at sales as a numbers game tradi-
tionally focuses on volume: volume of cold calls, volume of sales calls, volume 
of opportunities, and volume of pipeline. It means hard work, and a ton of 
wasted effort.

Trust-Based Selling
53
It also means that you expect failure. I have worked with many organizations 
that require salespeople to carry a pipeline-to-quota ratio of 3:1, even up to 
5:1. Assume your annual goal is $5,000,000 in sales, meaning that in a given 
quarter your quota is approximately $1,250,000, or 1/4th the annual quota. 
Your pipeline at the 3:1 ratio should be at a minimum of $4,200,000. The com-
pany sets this threshold because, historically, their sales team has a 30% close 
rate. Look at it in the negative: that is a 70% failure rate. That is 70% of your 
time on wasted deals, wasted conversations, and wasted administrative work.
Continuing this train of thought, if you need to have $4,200,000 of pipeline 
and your average deal is $120,000, you need 35 deals in your forecast. If your 
sales calls-to-pipeline identification is 2:1, you need to go on 70 calls. If it takes 
eight calls to set one appointment, you need to make 560 calls.
Sales is a numbers game. However, the numbers that you need to focus on are 
probabilities, not volume. Volume has a compounding effect of wasting time. 
Increasing your odds of winning frees up your time to work on even more 
qualified opportunities. In Las Vegas, for example, your best odds are at the 
black jack table, where the odds of winning are at best 48%. (This is a gross 
simplification; the odds of winning are based on many house rules, and your 
ability as a player to make the right decisions.) With a 48% chance of winning, 
in the long run, you lose. Some people think it’s crazy to play roulette where 
the odds on the simplest bet drop to 47%. No matter how many times you 
spin that wheel, in the long run, you will lose. In fact, the more times you spin 
the wheel, the more you lose. It is no different in sales. Turning up the volume 
of activity with lousy odds will just cause you to fail even more. It is better to 
work on the odds.
Adding more volume to low-odds activities will compound your failure. Working to increase your odds 
of success at each stage of the sale with compound your success.
The tragedy in all of this is that the data has been staring us right in the face, 
but we ignore it. If you look across a large data set of all salespeople within a 
company, the close rate might be 70%. So, at first glance, it makes sense to use 
the 70% close rate as a metric to set pipeline targets. However, this includes 
the 80% of the not-so-good salespeople. Sales management ignores the pipe-
line rules for their top performers. Since Johnny has a great close rate, we will 
not pressure him for the higher ratio in pipeline. Since Johnny does not fit the 
model sales management expects, or manages to, he is labeled a sandbagger—
someone who underforecasts their deals to look like a hero at the end of the 
quarter. Management looks at Johnny as the anomaly. Instead, why not use him 
as the role model? He is a top performer, so let’s look at his numbers, pipeline, 
close ratios, behavior, and selling strategy. Does it make any sense to manage 

Chapter 6 | Build Business Relationships
54
to the non-performers? Instead of labeling Johnny as a sandbagger because of 
his low pipeline ratio, look at Johnny’s close rate. Now figure out why Johnny 
has a better close rate and teach the others some of his techniques.
I guarantee you one thing: He is not being pressured to waste his time manag-
ing bad deals.
Don’t play the volume game unless the odds are stacked in your favor. If you 
insist on seeing the numbers, look at the numbers from the proper angle.
Here are the questions you (and sales management) should be asking: How do 
we increase prospecting success rates? How do we improve the number of 
calls we have to make to get an appointment? How do we increase the rate of 
sales calls to opportunities? How do we better qualify customers, so we are 
spending our time only on high-odds deals? How do we know when the odds 
of winning are bad? How do we stop managing to a 70% failure rate?
Why Trusting the System Makes Sense
Purchase cycles are long in most B2B sales; sometimes there are up to 7–10 
years between decisions. Again in IT, telephony equipment, networking, or data 
storage, purchases are made every four years or more. Assume for example 
that the customer uses a four-year purchasing cycle. Out of the 48 months 
between purchases, the customer might start looking for new product or 
vendor, if they do not automatically go to their preferred incumbent vendor, 
about four months in advance. Now assume that they interview two or three 
vendors in the first two months of this buy cycle. Your window is down to 
those two months at best. That’s two months in four years, a one out of  
24 chance of hitting the customer at the right time.
You can see this in Figure 6-1. The larger circle is 24 times bigger than the 
smaller circle. The small circle represents the two-month window you have to 
hit an opportunity. The medium-sized circle represents a one-year window of 
opportunity, or customers you are establishing relationships with.
Figure 6-1. Window of opportunity

Trust-Based Selling
55
To play the volume game, you aim at 50 different customers, or you are looking 
for opportunity in 50 customers. So you give yourself 50 times the chance to 
find an opportunity. However, you know nothing about the customers. What 
are their decision criteria, who are the power players, what are their budgets, 
is there a strong incumbent? The list goes on. This is like hitting a moving 
target (Figure 6-2).
Figure 6-2.  Moving target opportunities
With a change of focus, you move from targeting opportunity to establishing 
a relationship with a customer. That will give you a much bigger target to aim 
at over time (Figure 6-3).

Chapter 6 | Build Business Relationships
56
Establishing trust takes time, so assume now you can aim at only half the 
customers, or 25. With this new approach, qualifying customers first becomes 
important. There is no sense in aiming at customers who are not going to 
buy. Customers in this case are no longer moving targets. They are sta-
tionary. Customers are there for the entire first year; they are not fleeting 
opportunities.
Which of the targets looks easier to hit? The 50 small moving targets, or the 
25 stationary targets?
Not only is it easier to hit the stationary targets, but when you do hit an 
opportunity, you have a much better chance of closing business. When aim-
ing only at opportunity, you become column fodder—the vendor uses you to 
keep their preferred vendors honest—meaning your chances of winning are 
greatly diminished. Nonetheless, most sales managers tell you to shoot more 
arrows, make more sales calls, and work harder. I have seen some reps suc-
ceed on sheer will, and some on luck. Most of us are not that lucky, and most 
of us are unwilling to work that hard.
The secret, once again, is to focus on the customer, the relationship, instead of 
the opportunity. Don’t aim at the small circles; aim at the larger ones. Work 
on building the relationship when there is no opportunity. No matter if you 
are cold calling, networking, or getting to the customer through referrals, your 
main goal should be to understand the customer, and start building trust.
Figure 6-3.  Stationary customer targets

Trust-Based Selling
57
If you find opportunity, you must be honest with yourself and truly qualify 
the deal. Do you have a chance to win? Or are you the column fodder I have 
discussed?
If you don’t find opportunity, and the customer states they are not in the mar-
ket—“I am not looking for X at this time”—your answer should be, “That’s 
okay, I would prefer not to start our business relationship in the middle of 
your buying cycle. We can spend time now understanding your needs, which 
gives us time to show our value and earn your trust.”
Your intent quickly goes from “they want to sell me something,” to “they are 
here to help our business.” Taking this approach builds trust instantly.
When you are willing to spend time with customers not currently in the market, they begin to trust you 
more. They will more readily believe you want to help their business grow and relieve problems.
Do the Math: Opportunity versus Relationship
In the previous example, I showed how the right focus improves your chances 
of finding real opportunities. But, how does the math work? What happens 
to your pipeline? In the previous example, you were aiming at 50 custom-
ers, and you had a 48-month buying cycle, so your window of opportunity is 
maybe two months long. To be more generous, I will give you a window of 
three months.
Your chance of finding any opportunity with a customer, real or not, is only 
6.25% (3/48). Now multiply that by 50 customers, and you are working a total 
of three deals. I am going to be generous with this example again, and say that 
you sell multiple items and now you find twice as many deals, or six.
Remember you are mainly column fodder if you don’t have a relationship, but 
I will be incredibly generous again and award you a close rate of 33%. (It is 
probably closer to 15%.) Congratulations—you will win two opportunities 
in a year. In the IT industry, where vendors have direct relationships with the 
customer, with no help from a partner, this is typically what you see from 80% 
of new hires. The numbers will be slightly better if the company has existing 
relationships with the customer.
Here is the math if you aim for the big circles, possible only when you 
aim at establishing the relationship with the customer before you chase 
opportunities.

Chapter 6 | Build Business Relationships
58
First, work 20% smarter and aim at only 40 customers. Now, do not look for 
opportunity, but look to qualify customers, and spend time with them. You 
are engaged with the customer whether or not there exists an opportunity. 
Again, how you stay engaged without opportunity is covered later in the book. 
The window of opportunity of each customer raises on average from three 
months to nine. With the same 48-month sales cycle, you now have a window 
of opportunity of 19% (9/48). Over 40 customers, you will see 7.5 targeted 
opportunities.
However, here is the real strength of this strategy. In actuality, you will see many 
more opportunities. In your educational approach, you will pique the interest 
of your customer about opportunities they may not have been thinking of. 
And while spending time with the customers, once you have established trust, 
you will find they will start to bring you more opportunities. Conservatively, 
this will double the number of opportunities you’re exposed to. For our pur-
poses here, that’s four opportunities per engaged customer.
Increased trust also brings higher close rates. In this example, I will be ultra 
conservative and use a slightly higher close rate than when you did not have 
a relationship, or 50%.
This math now works out to this way:
40 customers X 19% window X 4 opportunities per customer  
X 50% deal close rate = 15.2 deals
There are many circumstances that influence all of these numbers. But in gen-
eral, you are looking at five times the number of won deals. Typically, with this 
approach you will not only have more deals, but the deals will be bigger. The 
“numbers game” shows that establishing relationships will drive more oppor-
tunity. Focusing on opportunity does not correlate into driving relationships.
When you chase opportunities, you have a limited number of relationships 
built by the year’s end. In year two, you will still be chasing opportunities and 
working any deal or customer you can find. In the other scenario, you have 
purchasing relationships with at least seven customers. And, you have started 
building trust with up to 20 more customers. You can stop chasing opportu-
nities, because with the trust you have built, customers will start presenting 
opportunities to you. This will also lead to more referrals. This is the differ-
ence between chasing deer, and knowing the land like the back of your hand.

Summary
The goal of this chapter is to drive home the point that focusing solely on 
opportunity is not the most productive use of your time. I have stated this 
a few times, but it’s worth repeating. Your success does not depend on the 
first opportunity you find, it depends on a long-lasting relationship with the 
customer.
Now that I have explained the strategy, you need a way to track progress. 
In the next chapter, I will combine the aspects of opportunity and trust to 
give you the equation you need to win business. This equation will help you 
develop a process to follow, and help you determine your ability to compete 
with more established vendors.

Why Chasing Opportunities Does Not Work
Every sale has five basic obstacles: no need, no money, no hurry, no desire, 
no trust.
—Zig Ziglar
I have discussed that chasing opportunities is setting the sales person up for 
failure. However, it is obvious that you need opportunities to close business. 
The goal of this chapter is to introduce relationship, or trust, into the discus-
sion about an opportunity. I will develop a simple formula that equals sales 
success with new customers.
In Chapter 4, I listed these elements as the core to winning deals.
• 
Pain. Without pain, or need, there is no order. A compel-
ling event is pain with a time element. This is the best 
type of pain because it makes predicting and closing busi-
ness easier. A compelling event means the customer has 
a deadline. Without a deadline, opportunities will drag on 
indefinitely.
• 
Solution. The customer needs to envision that your offer-
ing will solve the pain or fill the need. The customer needs 
to see value in your solution. The increased revenue or 
cost savings of the solution you provide must be greater 
than the cost of your solution.

Chapter 7 | Understand the Sales Equation
62
• 
Authority. You need a “yes” from someone within the orga-
nization who has the authority to purchase. Otherwise 
known as power.
• 
Understanding. You need to identify the purchasing deci-
sion process.
These are the items that customers need to make a decision to purchase, 
but are they the items they need to purchase from you? The answer is no. 
Each bullet can be claimed by you—and by a competitor. If the customer has 
a compelling event, it’s a compelling event for you and for your competition. 
The competition will have a valuable solution. You hope you have more value. 
Both you and the competitor could have access to power. An incumbent 
most likely will have greater access. Both you and the competitor understand 
the decision process. Again, the incumbent will most likely know this better 
than you.
One last bullet needs to be added to the discussion.
• 
Relationship. You must have a trusted, valued business 
relationship with the customer.
I have been discussing this last bullet at length. I believe I have demonstrated 
how important it is to value the relationship as part of the sales equation. 
Without a good relationship, there is no sale. When you lose a deal to price, 
most likely you are losing because you did not have a good relationship. Price 
is the excuse the customer gives you because it is definitive and impersonal.
You must have all these elements for a sale, from which I can derive a simple 
formula for sales success:
CE x V x P x DP x (TR)2 = Sale
Here’s what each of the elements stands for:
CE – Compelling event
• 
V – Value
• 
P – Yes from power
• 
DP – Decision process
• 
TR – Trusted relationship, which is squared due to its 
• 
importance
The equation is multiplicative, meaning that if any one of the elements is zero, 
the sale does not exist. Therefore, with no relationship, there is no sale. The 
equation also squares the trust element. Trust has an exponential effect on 
your chances to win. When you are new, you have almost no trust, and with 
zero trust, you have zero chance to win. You must assume that the existing 
vendor is fully trusted (Figure 7-1).

Trust-Based Selling
63
Figure 7-1. Trust difference
What is the formula for trust? I have one, but first let me say that I understand 
relationships can’t be measured with a number or represented by a formula. 
The intent of this formula is to give you a mechanism to measure your rela-
tive strength against a competitor’s, using metrics rather than just gut feeling. 
It also helps you determine how to systematically drive toward a trusted 
relationship.
So here is a simple “formula” for trust.
Trust = I + C + D + R
Again, here’s what each item stands for:
I  = Intent
• 
C = Capability
• 
D = Dedication
• 
R = Results
• 
Here, then, is the expanded sales equation:
CE x V x P x DP x (D+I+C+R)2 = Sale
While this might look a bit complicated, it really is simple. In order to win 
a sale with a new customer, you need to be concerned with every element 
of this equation, such as the opportunity-focused sales criteria of a compel-
ling event, value, power, and the decision process. Especially with new cus-
tomers, the trust elements must be taken into account: Intent, Capability, 
Dependability, and Results. This formula offers a deeper level of inspection of 
each opportunity.

Chapter 7 | Understand the Sales Equation
64
Concentrating on the trust elements, each is rated 0 to 2. A score of 0 means 
you have not addressed this trust issue, so you must assume the buyer rates 
you a 0. Give yourself 1 point for trust that can be assumed based on referrals, 
or when you have implied a certain amount of trust through actions in the 
sales cycle. 2 points indicates that you have made an effort or otherwise mea-
sured within the element. For example, you have provided education to show 
good intent, done a product evaluation to show results, conducted seminars 
to show capability, and so on. This points system is obviously subjective. It is 
better to overate your competition and underrate yourself. You do not want 
a false sense of security. It’s better to identify weaknesses and take positive 
actions to strengthen them.
Figure 7-2 shows 0 points for results, 1 point each for dedication and intent, 
and 2 points for capability, which is a 4 out of a possible 8. You do not have a 
fair shot at the business, unless you have a unique value, a niche product, or 
are within 1-2 points of your competition.
Figure 7-2. Trust points
Figure 7-3.  More Equal Trust Levels
If you can get to the point where you have 6 out of 8, as shown in Figure 7-3, 
you have a much better chance of winning than with 4 out of 8.

Trust-Based Selling
65
There are any number of trust combinations that will work. There may be 
cases where the incumbent has lost some element of trust with a customer, 
and that gives you a chance to compete or even have an advantage. Maybe 
there is a situation where you have demonstrated dedication, some intent, 
results, and capability. Maybe the incumbent has demonstrated results and 
capability, but dedication and intent have suffered due to lack of ongoing atten-
tion. Suddenly you just leveled the score to 5 vs. 5. Now you can compete 
evenly (Figure 7-4).
Figure 7-4.  Equal Trust Levels
Allow me to repeat myself. I understand relationships can’t be measured.  
I understand that there is a mix of personal and business relationships with 
each customer. This method is a way to analyze your relative strength against 
your competitor’s. Your goal is not to walk into a customer like a robot with 
a relationship checklist. The intent of these strategies is to ensure you have 
taken conscious, proactive steps in developing a trusted business relationship.
The Great News
While the task of competing against an incumbent may seem daunting, it is by 
no means insurmountable; otherwise, new salespeople would never make it, 
nor would new companies ever get off the ground. In fact, it can be easy to 
unseat the incumbent. While you are focusing on systematically building trust, 
the incumbent is taking their customer for granted, looking for new custom-
ers, and waiting for their existing customers to call them with new orders. 
Figure 7-5 shows the buyer’s concern about relationship versus the typical 
salesperson.

Chapter 7 | Understand the Sales Equation
66
As you can see, once a salesperson makes a sale, they typically don’t come 
back around and measure results or stay focused on the customer. Before 
the sale, the relationship is more important to the salesperson than to the  
customer. However, after the sale, the customer wants a stronger relation-
ship. A lot of times the salesperson is off looking for other opportunities, 
or assumes the customer will just present them with the next opportunity.  
As a result, the trust meter of the incumbent is not as full as it could or should 
be. The customer’s expectations of the vendor are typically not met after  
the sale.
However, you must assume that incumbent trust is full and systematically 
address each element of trust so you can compete with confidence. It is pos-
sible that, by the time you’ve developed an opportunity with a new customer, 
you could be more trusted than the current vendor(s).
Always assume the incumbent vendor has a trust meter that is full or close to it. That will encourage 
you to develop your relationship fully and do your best to provide value that makes a difference to 
the customer’s business.

Summary
I have harped on relationships. But I think it is important to drive home the 
point from multiple angles. Your entire sales training—how you have been 
managed, how you have been measured and, intuitively, how you have tackled 
your territories—focused on opportunity. I hope by now I have shown, dem-
onstrated, beat you over the head, and just repeated this concept to the point 
that you understand how important relationship-building is.
Now that you have the why behind you, you’re ready turn to the how. It is  
easy to tell salespeople to work on building a relationship, but you need  
systematic, creative approaches to build this trust. You must build trust before 
you have a chance to work on opportunity, so you will spend most of your 
time in the following chapters learning how to build trust in each stage of the 
sales cycle.

Building 
Trustworthiness
Get Ready to Start
Confidence is preparation. Everything else is beyond your control.
—Richard Kline
As we have discussed, the idea of relationship, or building trust, is a crucial 
element of closing sales. However most sale processes ignore this important 
fundamental. While your customer is in status quo, you are in the planning 
stage of the sales process. This stage is also ignored by process, and it is a 
great place to start building a foundation of trust. In this chapter, I address the 
“homework” activities you must do. This chapter helps you:
Address your capabilities and learn to develop sales skills 
• 
and product knowledge.
Develop some simple messages that will engage your 
• 
prospects in conversation rather than just deliver a 
monologue on what you do or sell.
Construct an online presence that will instill trust in your 
• 
prospects before you even talk to them.

Capability
Customers will evaluate you the moment you walk in the door. Trust is earned 
over time, but one element they can and will make an instant judgment about 
is your capability. Capability can be broken into three elements.
Sales skills
• 
Industry knowledge
• 
Product knowledge
• 
The demands on the salesperson are greater today than ever. An average 
salesperson working 10–15 years ago could get away with being a walking 
datasheet. The only way customers learned about new products was from 
salespeople visiting with them face to face. Customers had to listen to a sales-
person go on about their products. Now, with the Internet, customers have 
instant access to your professional profiles, as well as your company and prod-
uct information. Your customers have a good understanding of your products 
before you step foot in the door. They do not need a salesperson to tell them 
what they already know.
Today, customers expect their salespeople to bring value. That’s why you need 
product knowledge beyond the datasheet. They want to see that you are 
experienced and understand how your products fit into the larger picture at 
their company. They want salespeople who understand their company and 
issues. They want salespeople with industry knowledge. They want subject 
matter experts.
Let’s look more in-depth at the three elements that make up capability.
Sales Skills
While sales skills are a capability, they are integral to your ability to show 
proper intent. Your customers want to know you are there to help them. The 
ability to listen, ask questions, and guide your customer through their buying 
process with ease will instill a sense of trust with you. I have already stated 
my opinion on sales skills. They are very difficult to change. As with golf, 
the quickest way to get better results is through better strategy. Continued 
improvement of your swing is still a must if you want even lower scores. Same 
with sales. Start by learning proper strategy, and then learn the sales process 
to keep you organized. But continue to become a better-skilled salesperson.
Ongoing sales training must be part of the planning process. This is your 
career, so treat it as so. It is ironic that the most important function in any 
company is sales, because salespeople are the least trained people in their 
craft. Sales brings revenue, and without revenue, there is no business. Lawyers, 
HR, IT, and finance all require four years or more of education. Each one of 

Trust-Based Selling
71
these also requires ongoing education, training, and certifications. Yet most 
salespeople have one sales course, which they half pay attention to, every two 
to three years.
There is a wealth of information on sales skills, strategy, and process. Aim to learn something daily.
Early in my career, I worked hard, but I just showed up. (By the way, showing 
up will put you in the top 50%, and working hard will put you in the top 30%.) 
I understood my products and services, and I followed up with customers. 
However, I was by no means a student of my career; I just winged it from a 
skills standpoint.
A few years back, I was eating lunch with a coworker at a sports bar. ESPN 
was on the big projection screen running a story on an all-pro linebacker 
who came into NFL training camp out of shape, and his job was in jeopardy. 
I remember saying to my friend, “What an idiot! If I was making $4 million a 
year, hell $500k a year, I would make sure I was in shape.” Coincidently, earlier 
that month one of our top salespeople made a huge sale, with a commission 
that propelled that salesperson to a commission in that range.
It then dawned on me. “I can make $500k selling. Why am I out of shape?”
Learn your craft, know your industry, and understand your offerings. Once 
you learn about them, learn to do them better. An all-pro athlete never stops 
training, a doctor does not stop reading medical journals, and your customers 
do not stop learning about new ideas on how to solve their problems. You 
should never stop learning.
Here is the simplest advice on sales skills ever: Be aware of you how much you are talking. After 
each sales call, ask yourself if you learned more about the customer than she learned about you.
Industry Knowledge
Research your industry and your customer’s industry until you know it inside 
and out. This will give you a much better idea of your customer’s potential 
problems. It will also help you position your offerings much better, help you 
with messaging, and add value with your customers.

Chapter 8 | Building Trustworthiness
72
Also research the job titles of the people you are calling on. There are web 
sites specific to almost any title.

No matter your target prospect, there is plenty of information regarding the 
issues and trends that affect their roles. This knowledge helps you gain access 
to prospects and shows the customers that you can help. For example, if you 
are meeting with a CIO, and you know the top five concerns of CIOs at this 
time, your conversation with her will be much more than just about product. 
Your potential customers want to know how you can help them with their 
concerns before they want to hear anything about your product.
If you do not have immediate access to a prospect, share industry trends and 
news on a proactive basis via e-mail or regular mailings, which will get more 
attention. These items can be online articles, information your marketing 
department provides, or ideally content you have personally generated. You 
might not be in the position to do this if you are new to an industry, but if 
you can provide these kinds of materials, you will start to show expertise 
(capability) even before you speak to a prospect. This is more effective than 
sending product literature. Sending product literature before you qualify your 
customer needs will only put you out of buyer alignment. So don’t send product 
information unless it’s requested.
The other effect of doing this research is that it will give you confidence when 
you do engage your prospect, and you will better understand their pain and 
issues. This enables you to better position your solution. Plus, your conversa-
tions will have much more meaning for the customer. The information here is 
about understanding the industry challenges of your buyer. In the chapter on 
Niche Selling, we will introduce you to buying personalities of your customers. 
They will enable you to better position solutions to match their concerns.
Product Knowledge
This may sound illogical, but there can be some dangers to having too much 
product knowledge. I have been saying all along your focus needs to be on the 
customer. With an abundance of product knowledge, most salespeople have 
the tendency to talk too much about the product. It is okay to be an expert in 
your field, but you must concentrate on customer needs first.
Look again at the buyer concerns graph (Figure 8-1).

Trust-Based Selling
73
The most important element of trust is intent. All too often, salespeople 
feel that capability of their products is the most important thing. Staying in 
alignment with your customer will allow you to show your capability in due 
time, without sacrificing intent. There is a time to focus on the solution, and 
it’s toward the end of the needs analysis stage. To help fight the urge to talk 
product too quickly, you need to define product knowledge beyond the fea-
tures and benefits. Figure 8-2 shows general levels (categories) of knowledge 
you can have with your offering. The categories of product knowledge are 
slightly different for each industry, so I have attempted to make these as broad 
as possible.
Figure 8-1.  Shifting buyer concerns

Chapter 8 | Building Trustworthiness
74
Again, there is a slight slant toward technical sales in Figure 9-2, but this matrix 
can be adapted for any industry. First, align the knowledge categories with the 
buyer concern graph. Start with analyzing the need from the business and 
technical aspects. You must understand the pains your products help allevi-
ate. Then you need to know which questions will help you better qualify the 
customer and their needs. For clarity, in the Buyer Concern column, N means 
Need, and S means Solution.
The line between the Business and Technical focus is meant to be the high-
est level of knowledge, in other words, the “50,000 foot” view. As you move 
up the categories in business, and down in technical, the depth of knowledge 
increases. Notice that the high-level knowledge corresponds to the Needs 
development of the Buyer Concern graph (Figure 8-1). Again, as you move 
away from the high-level knowledge, buyer concern shifts toward solution 
information. As you migrate toward the evaluation stages and more solution 
information is needed, you may need assistance from management on the 
business side, and from the technical support team on the technical side.
The amount of knowledge you have on any subject can be endless. Which 
categories of knowledge will benefit you most? Figure 8-3 shows the sweet 
spot of sales knowledge—it’s all about customer needs. The major problem 
most companies have with training is they believe product training needs to 
be done by product experts. Experts are asked to “dumb it down” for the 
sales teams.
Figure 8-2.  Knowledge matrix; N stands for Need, and S for Solution

Trust-Based Selling
75
The product experts stay focused on the product, taking the simplest infor-
mation about the product, and using it to educate the sales team. Look at the 
lower-right corner of Figure 9-3; you can see that they completely miss where 
sales should be focusing their conversations.
This problem is compounded with new salespeople. Here’s why. As men-
tioned, 90% of the time spent with new customers is in the planning and needs 
analysis stages. Your product experts are aiming the sales team past that stage, 
and directly at the evaluation stage. I will explore the importance of this in 
establishing intent with the customer in Chapter 11. At this point, just make a 
note that you cannot sacrifice intent for capability.
When you are studying your product, make sure you can talk in the sweet 
spot. Starting from the Business/Technical focus, first understand the business 
pain, along with the technical pain your solution can help eliminate. Then learn 
which questions can help you uncover that pain. Have a story about how you 
can help solve the customer’s business pain, and have a story about how your 
offering helps address the business pain.
Do not be satisfied with the product training provided by most companies. 
You might only have basic product training. If management will not provide 
you with this level of knowledge, analyze the customer’s pains and determine 
the questions you need to ask on your own. This is made easier with the more 
industry knowledge you gain through your own research and experience.
Figure 8-3.  Knowledge matrix showing what product experts think are the most important 
items compared to what good salespeople know are the most important things

Chapter 8 | Building Trustworthiness
76
Example
Let’s go back to the example of purchasing a home. Although Figure 8-3 is set 
up for a business-to-business sale in the IT industry, in this case I will define 
the categories of knowledge for a real estate agent who works in a new 
development/neighborhood.
The technical aspects become the housing and neighborhood data. I will start 
what is most important to the customer.
1.	 Why customers move in general.
2.	 Why this customer is moving, and what they are looking 
for in a home and community.
3.	 High-level knowledge about the community.
4.	 High-level knowledge on the quality of home 
construction.
5.	 Detailed specs of each home.
6.	 How the home was designed and built.
7.	 How the framing was done, electrical specs of the home, 
and so on.
As you can see, the depth of knowledge can increase exponentially. However, 
the selling sweet spot includes levels 1-3 and possibly 4. If the customer has 
more detailed questions about home specs, the real estate agent can rely on 
the contractor.
Now look at this from the business/money side.
1.	 Understanding the budget—minimum, maximum, and 
stretch budget
2.	 Understanding home owner dues or fees
3.	 Understanding the financial information required to qual-
ify for a loan
4.	 Understanding the types of mortgages available
5.	 Understanding how each type of mortgage works
6.	 Understanding how the loan underwriting process 
works
Again the details can get overwhelming, and the real estate agent can get help 
from a mortgage broker. The selling sweet spot is 1 and 2, and possibly 3. 
When you stay in the sweet spot, you are showing proper intent.

Trust-Based Selling
77
 You don’t ask an electrical subcontractor to teach the real estate agent how to sell the community. But 
this is exactly what happens in most business-to-business sales—the product experts teach product 
knowledge. You therefore need to educate yourself on buyer concerns to get an idea of what matters 
to your customers.
Messaging will be discussed more in the next chapter. I’ve kept this pretty sim-
ple here, but remember that when developing stories you need to take into 
consideration who you are talking to at the prospect organization. Different 
customer titles have different concerns and buying behaviors. Messaging needs 
to be tailored to your audience.
What Do You Do?
You need to learn to answer the question, “What do you do?”. This seems 
like a very simple exercise, but when you ask most salespeople this question, 
it takes them way too long to answer. Whether it is on the phone, on a web 
site, in an elevator, or during your first meeting, you need to be prepared for 
this trap. I call this a trap because it pushes you in the direction of presenting 
a monologue, when your goal should be a conversation.
Be careful, because even management is directing you into this trap by making 
every salesperson memorize an “elevator pitch.” This is typically a 20–30  
second monologue about how the company is great and how they can help 
the customer. Elevator pitches come across as memorized; they all sound the 
same, and are filled with buzzwords and marketing hype. Worse, the customer 
stops listening 10 seconds in (and I am being generous). It should be called the 
elevator shaft. Your goal is a conversation with the customer.
So, what should you do when asked about your company? Instead of an elevator 
pitch, you need to develop an elevator “hook.” An elevator hook helps you start 
a conversation with the customer. I will take some time here to set up the con-
cept of the elevator hook, but it will take no longer than eight seconds to deliver 
it. The hook returns the focus to the customer and initiates a conversation.
Selling is simple; ask questions to stay focused on the customer.
The elevator hook engages the customer in a conversation and includes 
a reference story that implies a referral. With customer referrals, you gain 
more trust. With conversations, you show more intent, and therefore more 
trust. This process will keep you in alignment with buyer concerns. This keeps 
you in the qualifying stage, focused on needs, rather than jumping straight to 
the solution, which is well into the buying process.

Chapter 8 | Building Trustworthiness
78
The first objective is to turn the question “what do you do?” into a conversa-
tion. The best way to start any conversation is with a question. So, when you 
are asked, “what does your company do?,” you respond with a question. That’s 
the hook. You ask a question that engages the customer. A question solicits a 
response and curiosity from the customer. Come up with questions centered 
on issues that you know affect most of your customer base. These questions 
should solicit a quick yes or no. There is a time for opened-ended questions 
when you are exploring the customer needs. However, in this case you want 
to box the customer into a yes response. If you understand your customer, 
the industry, its challenges, and how you can help, this is simple.
These questions are simple to develop. You can simply Google “top concerns 
for hospitals, CFOs, CIOs, universities, manufacturing, IT organizations,” or 
what have you. You can have different questions for different job titles and 
vertical markets. Again, your goal is to hit an obvious issue confronting your 
customers today. Examples include:
“Do you think you spend too much on paper copies?”
• 
“Do you have issues with explosive data growth?”
• 
“Does the introduction of mobile devices by your employees 
• 
onto your network cause you problems?”
“Do you know how complex it is to set facility security 
• 
properly?”
“Are your receivables at the level you would like?”
• 
“Do you know how hard it is to accurately forecast 90 
• 
days out?”
You now have the customer set up with the elevator hook. If you hit on 
an issue customers have, their response should be, “yes.” This will grab their 
attention, and you already got them to admit they have an issue. And, the yes 
is an invitation to say what you do, but without the details. Your response at 
this time is simple: “We help with that.”
You have checked for interest. They said they have the issue, so they will want 
to know how you can help. Now you can proceed with a reference story, one 
that starts to build trust. I will break this down further, but frame your refer-
ence story like this:
A good illustration of how we help is by what we did for a customer in your 
industry. This company had issue X. We helped them fix that issue, or we 
delivered a solution that added Z value. With our solution, the customer 
experienced Y results.

Trust-Based Selling
79
The goal of this method is to build your trust meter (Figure 8-4) with a simple 
paragraph. The elements of trust need to be woven into the story. Let’s break 
down the story based on the trust elements:
Intent: You helped the customer.
• 
Capability: You understood their problem. You brought a 
• 
solution that fixed their issue.
Dedication: You stuck around to implement and measure 
• 
results.
Results: The customer was able to achieve what you 
• 
promised.
Figure 8-4. Trust meter after your reference story
Here is quick example of a good reference story.
We helped Acme (intent) by evaluating their supply chain inefficiencies and 
made recommendations on how to improve their systems (capability). The 
implemented improvements increased their inventory turnover rates by 100%, 
resulting in $2,000,000 of savings. (We remained after the sale, which shows 
we are dedicated. And we measured results.)
Use the 15 seconds the customer gives you to build trust, not to bore the 
customer with the canned elevator pitch. You need to practice these refer-
ence stories just as you practice the company pitch. But with questions, hooks, 
and stories, use conversational English, not marketing hype. Unlike with eleva-
tor pitches, you do not need to include the latest buzzwords or marketing 
fluff. Don’t try to include everything you can do for the customer. Focus on an 
unique value you bring to customers. If you offer something unique, there is a 
better chance the door will open.

The elevator pitch is not the most effective tool. Using an elevator hook, in 
contrast, helps you start a conversation, pique interest, and frame a customer 
reference story. This is much more powerful. Once you have the reference 
story down and deliver it to the customer, you should focus right back on the 
customer by asking more about their business.
Your Online Presence
When you initially contact a customer whether through email, cold call, or 
referral, what is the first thing they are going to do? They will Google you, your 
company, or both.
Google yourself! What comes up—pictures of your last New Year’s Eve bash, 
or a professional LinkedIn profile? Knowing what you look like online is the 
first step.
Today’s leading networking site for professionals is LinkedIn. What does your 
LinkedIn profile look like? Is it like most others? Does it stand out? Does it 
offer anything to the customer? Is it simply a resume, or does it express the 
value you can offer?
You need to use your profile to show proper intent and strong capability—
the value you can bring to customers. Most profiles are nothing more than 
a resume import. LinkedIn actually guides you into this mistake by importing 
your resume to build your profile. Although it is okay to show your career 
history, it should not be the first thing people see. So do not be lazy here! The 
intent you need to demonstrate is how you can help your potential custom-
ers. Customers do not care about your resume. They want to see the value 
you can bring to them.
The first things your customers see on your profile are your name and head-
line. Use the headline to indicate your specialty, or your area of subject matter 
expertise. The next section in LinkedIn is the skills section. List your industry 
expertise in more detail. When describing your skills, concentrate on cus-
tomer trigger points:
“I help customers develop their disaster-recovery 
• 
strategies.”
“I help doctors increase in-office revenue streams.”
• 
“I help customers drive business efficiencies.”
• 
“I strive to understand my customer’s business first.”
•

If you truly want to be aligned with the buyer cycle, ask questions in your skills 
section. You are using the elevator hook to keep them interested, so they will 
read on:
“Is your data storage a bottleneck of performance?”
• 
“Does your broker become a stranger after he collects 
• 
his portfolio management fee?”
“Are government regulations bogging down your finance 
• 
department?”
“Are you concerned with patient security?”
• 
You can make the skills section as long as you like. I recommend that you 
make it long enough so that the customer has to actively scroll to see your 
work history section. Positioning your skills section in this manner can show 
proper intent and capability. That way, you can get a jump on building your 
trust meter (Figure 8-5).
Figure 8-5. Trust meter when you do a good job with your online profile
You can demonstrate dependability via recommendations. Do not hesitate to 
ask colleagues for recommendations that talk about your character. Expect to 
be asked to reciprocate by writing a recommendation for them.
As part of your profile, list industry articles you have written, as well as blogs 
you write. This is the “give to get” mentality discussed earlier.
As part of your profile, do not forget to include your contact information;  
if someone is looking for help, help them find you!
Once your profile is up to snuff, it is time to ramp up your activity and con-
tribute to the industry.

Chapter 8 | Building Trustworthiness

Proactive Online Presence
Your professional profile is a passive entity that gets no attention unless you 
are proactive. How do you become proactive online to get yourself noticed? 
First, understand which groups your customers are members of. When you 
connect with customers and colleagues, take the time to look at their groups. 
Join those groups.
Look for discussion threads that you can participate in.
Become a subject matter expert, a thought leader. Much like in the earlier 
planning stages, you do this by subscribing to industry magazines, regularly 
checking in on industry web sites, and then formulating your own thoughts, 
posting comments, or starting a discussions. If you are not an expert, look for 
whitepapers, industry articles, or professional development material you can 
share. Just make sure you give proper reference to others’ work. Your goal 
is to develop an active online presence. With increased activity you become 
more visible to peers and potential customers. You want others to view you 
as an expert, thus increasing the chance they will call you.
Summary
When you are establishing your territory, or trying to penetrate a new account, 
you will spend 90% of your time in the planning and qualifying stages. As you 
progress, planning becomes easier. The information you need to gather will 
already be at your fingertips. Planning becomes more of an updating exercise. 
When you are new, all this up-front planning will pay off. With everything you 
are doing to plan, make sure you have the end game in mind—building trust. 
The next chapter discusses what service or product is best to use when 
securing new customers.

Lead with Something Unique
Attack him [the enemy] where he is unprepared, appear where you are 
not expected.
—Sun Tzu
While this book is about developing trust with customers, trust can also be 
used to develop strategy. By understanding the trust you possess vs. the trust 
built by a competitor, you can start to formulate a game plan for penetrat-
ing accounts, messaging, and closing the business. The first major tactic in 
approaching new customers is putting relationship before opportunity. The 
second major tactic for approaching new customers or a new sales territory 
is to determine which product or service to lead with. Using the concepts of 
trust, I will develop a model that you can use to make this determination.
With all the talk about relationship and qualifying the customer, you eventu-
ally have to sell something. In the sales situation with Tom (the person who 
chased opportunities, had a large pipeline, but never closed a sale), the manager  
suggested that he learn about, and lead with, the company’s top selling prod-
uct, the products that generate the most revenue, and solutions that are the 
most competitive in the IT industry. I will first point out why this is an incor-
rect strategy, then discuss the correct product selection.
The primary reason for this chapter is to determine which products or services to lead with. If you have 
only one item or service to sell, not all the concepts of this chapter will apply to you. However, there 
is a secondary value of this chapter, which is understanding your customer’s purchasing personality, 
and how you can use it to properly present the solution you are selling. If your company is bringing a 
new product to market, memorize this chapter.

To Whom Will You Sell?
Geoffrey Moore’s book Crossing the Chasm describes how to bring a new tech-
nology to market. He adapted this concept from research done at Iowa State 
University, which describes the acceptance of new products based on custom-
ers’ demographic and psychological characteristics. The original purpose was 
to track the purchase patterns of hybrid corn seed by farmers.
This model has been widely used. These concepts adapt to most sales situa-
tions. What you should get from this chapter is an understanding of personal 
buyer personalities, how they fit within an organization, and how you position 
yourself to get that first deal. In this chapter I adapt the methods for marketing 
new technologies to work in any selling situation..
The chapter’s conversation is built around this model (Figure 9-1).
Figure 9-1.  Innovation adoption lifecycle curve
As you can see, there are five buyer personalities. The premise is that you 
must follow a logical specific progression for each type of customer in order 
to successfully introduce a new technology. This is called the innovation  
adoption curve or lifecycle. The area of the curve indicates the relative size of 
the market. Here is a brief summary of each personality type, including how 
they buy, and what they require.
Innovators
The first category is the innovator or techie. The techie can be identified as 
the type of individual who likes to be at the early stages of a new product or 
service. This is the type of customer who just likes to be first. They have the 
first mobile phone, the first laptop, or the house in a new neighborhood. This 
is the type of person who reports software bugs. This report is made not out 
of frustration, but out of pride. They like to be recognized as helping define 
the final product.

Trust-Based Selling
85
In sales, the mantra is that customers buy in this order—you, the company, 
then the product. But in the innovator category, customers put product first. 
These people tend to be lower in an organization, but not always, as I will 
discuss later. Sometimes, meeting with an innovator might be your only way 
to get a foot in the door. But you must remember, this is a small number of 
people within a company, and typically their budgets are extremely small.
Visionaries
The second personality is the early adopter, or visionary. The visionary is the 
person who looks at a new product, and looks for ways to make magnitudes-
of-order improvement in a process, or to their business. This personality 
type is viewed as a risk taker. Their ideas are grand. They like the big picture 
but get lost in the details. This buyer wants a working product; they want to 
implement the product, not trouble shoot it. They are more concerned with 
other things, like what this product can do for their company or career. In an 
organization they tend to be first-line managers, are younger, and are trying to 
move up the corporate ladder. Often, they are ambitious.
Pragmatics
Next is the early majority, or pragmatics. This is the first of the larger markets. 
By definition, pragmatics tend to be very practical. They are not risk takers, 
but are looking for products or services that are proven, and will help the 
company make small incremental improvements to costs or revenues. They 
want a product that has been proven in the market. They want a product they 
can purchase, and the companies they do business with must have references. 
These people are very well respected. They tend to be tenured within the 
organization, and carry director-level titles.
Conservatives
Conservatives, or the late majority, are about the status quo. Conservatives 
purchase a product once it has become mainstream. The product is “com-
plete,” tested, proven, and usually from the leading vendor in a particular mar-
ket. From conservatives, you often hear statements like, “No one ever got 
fired for buying [insert big name here].” This type of buyer tends to be further 
up within an organization. They are tenured, but tend to have a “mitigate the 
risk” mentality of doing business. They are more interested in career preser-
vation than career advancement. This is the largest group within a company, 
region, or market.

Chapter 9 | Niche Selling
86
Laggards
Laggards, I will not go into detail with laggards, since they are a small market, 
and it’s not necessary for the setup of our strategies. Laggards have an “old 
school” mentality; if it ain't broke, don’t fix it. For example, some still don’t see 
the need for a computer. “We always use manual ledgers; why would I need a 
computer?” This is an extreme example, but you get the point.
Customers in this category are usually related to the culture of the company. 
For example, buyers for a manufacturer of furniture will tend to be toward 
the back of the curve. But you do sometimes find a visionary working for a 
laggard company.
Laggard markets can be lucrative. In the IT industry, some customers hold 
onto equipment that is way past the support life of the manufacturer. So 
replacement parts become scarce and therefore expensive.
If you are in this type of market, just know that having a visionary message will 
usually be wasted on this type of buyer.
To fully understand the concepts around these personalities, consider these 
real-life examples.
Example: Techie in a Conservative World
My brother is in medical device sales. His company was introducing a new 
product that would reduce the need for some nasal surgeries. This device 
could be used in the doctor’s office. The cost-benefit to the doctor was 
huge. He could do this procedure, as stated, in the office. It would take 15–20  
minutes versus taking hours at a surgical center. The profit to the doctor 
was the same when you compared the surgical procedure versus the in-office  
procedure. However, for the doctor, the true savings lay in opportunity costs. 
He saved hours of time that he could use to see (and bill) other patients.
Given this great advantage to help doctors save time and make more money, 
my brother set out with his product. His sales in the first six months were 
almost nonexistent, and so were the results of the company. The main objec-
tion was that the product was not proven. Doctors tend to be conservative. 
They wanted to see that this procedure had been done safely for years. They 
want to be sure there are no long-term negative effects.
The message about large improvements to the bottom line was aimed at a 
visionary buyer. But in the medical field, the curve is shifted more to the right. 
Even visionaries in the medical field tend to be more conservative since they 
are dealing with human lives. So, the visionary market is very small in medicine. 
As a matter of luck, my brother called on a doctor who happened to be an 
inventor himself. This doctor was a straight-up techie. This is the perfect first 

Trust-Based Selling
87
customer for new technology. This doctor, without references, went straight 
to his patients and started performing procedures. As mentioned, innovators 
tend to be lower in the organization. However, in this case the doctor owned 
the practice. During the course of the procedures he pointed out issues he 
saw, made recommendations for improvements, and had ideas for add-ons to 
this product. The message of increased billings for this doctor was of little 
value. He wanted to play with the latest technology.
Leveraging the success of this doctor, my brother was able to grow his busi-
ness. Outside events helped as well. For one thing, the company was smart 
enough to listen to the early clients and make improvements to the product. 
A couple of doctors saw the business vision and the competitive advantage to 
offering this procedure, and they built huge practices specializing in this pro-
cedure. This led to a wider use of the product that could ease the concerns 
of the conservatives.
The intent of the example is to show the progression that a new product 
takes coming to market. In terms of sales strategy, there are few takeaways. 
First, understand where your product resides on the curve, so you can keep 
an eye out for customers who properly fit. Second, know your customer 
adoption personality. Third, tailor your message to match the person. When 
dealing with a techie, your message should be about the product, and what it 
can do. If you are dealing with visionaries, the messaging is more about massive 
improvements. When dealing with pragmatics, you want to talk about expe-
rience, the stability of the company, and the proven track record of helping 
customers. Lastly, when dealing with conservatives you must either have the 
leading product, or a good message about how you can enhance the solutions 
they already own.
Example 2: Selling “Conservative” to a Visionary 
Doesn’t Work
Here is an example of messaging from the other side of the equation. Early in 
my sales career I worked for Cisco Systems. If you are not in IT and do not 
know Cisco, they own 80% market share in computer networking. “No one 
ever got fired for buying Cisco.” Their message was something like this:
We have proven products. We have a huge R&D staff to keep ahead of 
the technology demands. We have 10,000 certified engineers. We have 
done proof of concepts with every technology on the market. Due to 
the volume of product we produce, we can offer competitive pricing.
How can you lose a deal with all this behind you? I did, and it was a large 
one. I had better pricing, a good relationship, and I listened to the business 
requirements. I actually helped the customer during the business planning. 
Plus, my product was more flexible than the competitors’. There was actually 

Chapter 9 | Niche Selling
88
an investment protection program in place in case the technology changed. My 
competitor was shrinking, losing massive market share, and their R&D ranks 
were decimated. (Here is a quote from my customer about my competitor, 
“The one engineer who is working on this product has promised me he is 
staying with the company.”) What’s more, they were slightly more expensive.
How then did I lose the deal? Let me give you a bit of background on the 
prospective company and this person, and you tell me.
This prospect was going to offer insurance through 
• 
kiosks at a major retailer. They were the first company 
to deliver insurance in this manner.
The owner of the company was young, and the company 
• 
was growing almost too fast.
The CIO, my main contact, was promoted from within. 
• 
Just a few years before this, he was made head of com-
puting because he knew how to operate both Apple- and 
Windows-based computers. Within four years, he was 
in charge of building out a 4,000-node network worth  
millions of dollars.
The CIO liked to jump out of planes and scuba dive on 
• 
weekends.
Why did I lose?
My approach was aimed at a conservative, but my buyer was a risk taker. The 
entire company was visionary. My competition played to the risk taker, the 
new technology, and the up-and-coming company (even though it was dying), 
and they assured him he could have access to the single design engineer. They 
risked their success on one person.
Getting back to theory, Moore’s contribution to this model is the introduction 
of a break in the adoption model. There is a challenge between the vision-
ary and the pragmatic, or the chasm. The pragmatics and decision makers of 
the company require references and referrals. These referrals can either be 
internal or external to the company. The problem is that early adopters of the 
technologies, the techies and visionaries, are not considered good references. 
The pragmatics view them as flakey, and their opinions are not valid.
The answer to this dilemma is niche marketing. For the purposes of this book, 
I call it niche selling. Niche selling is addressing a customer’s need that is 
not addressed by a current vendor. Alternatively, you may have a product 
that addresses a specific need that does not involve much risk or investment. 
Niche selling is a powerful strategy for a new salesperson. You need to find 
a unique offering in your product or service line that your competition does 
not address.

Trust-Based Selling
89
Looking back at Tom’s example, what did management do up front? They 
trained him on their big ticket, best-selling items, and their most competitive 
product set. Tom’s challenge was manifold:
Technology that is hard to replace at the customer.
• 
Dozens of other competitors in that market.
• 
Incumbents who have the customer’s trust.
• 
 Tom would have been better suited if he were trained on products or services that were new to the 
market, or unique to the vendor. Your goal should be to sell to a customer base where there is not 
an incumbent.
Trust in Niche Selling
When you’re competing against a trusted competitor, you are looking to build 
your trust and find a weakness in the competitor’s trust equation. If you lead 
with a niche product or service, you have a capability that is unique. You may 
not have demonstrated the capabilities or results yet. But since you are deal-
ing in an area in which the incumbent cannot offer a solution, their trust meter 
for that specific solution is diminished. For that solution, the incumbent still 
has proved they are dedicated to the customer, and have good intention, but 
they do not have the capability or results for that solution. Always start by 
assuming the incumbent is fully trusted. So in this case, the incumbent trust 
meter moves to this level, as shown in Figure 9-2.

Chapter 9 | Niche Selling
90
When you are actually competing with an incumbent who did not bring unique 
values to the forefront, trust in the incumbent is degraded some. This comes 
in the form of showing a customer a new way to use their existing products, 
or solutions, that they did not think of. The incumbent can be hurt in the 
dedication and possibly intent elements. The incumbent is assuming that busi-
ness will flow their way, and their approach to helping the customer comes 
into question (Figure 9-3).
Figure 9-2.  Lower incumbent trust due to lack of product offering in a needed area
Figure 9-3.  Lowering incumbent trust due to less than stellar customer service
You lowered the competition’s trust profile without once being negative 
toward your competition. All you did was present an area where they are 
not capable.
During half time of a football game, the teams go to their locker rooms and 
you reevaluate the game plan. The first place you look is where you are having 
success, or where you can exploit a known weakness in the opposing team. If 
you are drawing up a play on the whiteboard, you would first attack the weak-
est link in the defensive line. Look at attacking the incumbent the same; where 
are they weakest? The defensive line for the incumbent looks like Figure 9-4.

Trust-Based Selling
91
If you have limited trust at the beginning of the sales cycle, your best play is 
moving toward the right of the line. Going head-to-head against a competi-
tor with similar products is your toughest route. Even if you believe you have 
a solution with some better capability, you can see your situation does not 
improve much. The next trust meter shows a situation where you introduce 
a solution to a customer; a solution a competitor has, but has not discussed 
with the customer. The first niche trust meter shows a niche product that 
may replace, complement, augment, or possibly change a competitor’s solu-
tion. The last situation is by far the best. You find a new product that is 
important to the customer, and they have no incumbent in that area. You are 
competing on a completely level playing field, or, ideally, you are the only team 
on the field.
Why Niche Selling Is Effective
Selling where there is an incumbent vendor shrinks your window of opportu-
nity. Using the 48-month purchase cycle mentioned before, you might hit the 
window perfectly within the four-month sales cycle, but probably not given 
the 8% chance of hitting it. In reality, if they have a vendor for this type or pur-
chase, your window is much smaller. If you happen to catch your competition 
sleeping, and can define the solution for the customer, your true window is 
maybe one month, or a 2% chance. If you hit the window perfectly despite the 
odds, you have an 80% chance of becoming the vendor they use just to keep 
the other vendor honest.
Now look at niche selling. You understand the customer issues around which 
you will position your product. You understand that being new, you need to 
establish trust, so your first deals might be smaller. When you position a new 
need to the customer, you create an entirely new purchasing cycle because 
Figure 9-4.  Relative trust strength of incumbent vs. non-niche and niche products

Chapter 9 | Niche Selling
92
this is a new concept. There is no incumbent. Your chance of engaging in a 
conversation that is open minded, not clouded by competition, is 100%. This 
method eliminates the window-of-opportunity concept. There is no cyclical 
purchase established for this particular product. You eliminate the need for 
perfect timing and lower the influence of competition. If your competition 
does offer the same solution, you put your competition in a defensive position 
with the customer. “Why didn’t you tell me about this new product/service/
technology?”
Example: Putting Niche Selling to the Test
Let’s take a look at this strategy in a company’s effort to bring a new technol-
ogy into its portfolio.
A reseller entered into a new contract to sell a large manufacturer’s products 
and services. This manufacturer had a very broad portfolio in the IT industry, 
including servers, storage, networking, management software, and back-office 
software. Each of these product areas was supported by separate divisions of 
the manufacturer. They pretty much had everything you needed to run an IT 
shop. Yet the reseller was struggling in its first six months of engagement with 
this manufacturer. When we consulted with the reseller, we started by asking 
how they had engaged, what they had been trained on, who they had relation-
ships with at the manufacturer, and so forth. Then we analyzed their pipeline.
Eight months into this new relationship, the sales teams across the reseller’s 
five regions have done account mapping, training, and some joint sales calls 
with the manufacturer’s server and storage teams. Servers and storage in 
this industry are highly competitive—in fact, the most competitive. Products 
are almost commoditized in these markets. Moreover, the products tend to 
be in sensitive parts of their customers’ businesses, making them techni-
cally hard to replace. They are also on long purchase cycles, meaning that 
only a small percentage of their customer base is in the market at any one 
time. The reseller also faces competition from other resellers who also sell 
this manufacturer’s products. They cannot simply position better features of 
the product. With these larger purchases, the sale teams were most likely 
competing against a seasoned sales professional who “owned” the customer 
relationship. Even when the customers are “in the market,” they typically stay 
with incumbent technology.
Across five regions, they had 25 salespeople, and after eight months, they 
had a total of 10 deals in the forecast. The total revenue in the forecast was 
$1.7 million. We did not even bother to qualify the forecast based on their 
relative trust strength against the incumbent.

Trust-Based Selling
93
Our next step in the consulting process was to bring together the sales lead-
ers from each organization. We asked the manufacturer to briefly review their 
product portfolio. We were able to identify a niche product that could be sold 
to a few different titles within an organization. We then looked back at the 
forecast and saw that two of the ten opportunities were with this product; 
this was without any focus on this niche product. We chose two regions at 
the reseller to roll out this strategy.
1.	 First, the reseller trained the sales teams on this niche 
product. Training was focused, and not scattered across 
the entire product portfolio. There was a simple story 
that both junior and senior salespeople could grasp.
2.	 They developed a marketing program that would bring 
customers to lunch-and-learn events. The promotion of 
the lunch-and-learn was focused on the issues customers 
face that this product solved. They did not focus on the 
product. With this focus, the sales and marketing teams 
were able to drive great attendance to the events. Over 
50% of the attendees were net new clients to the reseller 
or the manufacturer. This is the power of focusing on 
issues that customers face.
3.	 After the lunch-and-learns, follow-up sales calls were 
conducted with the attendees.
The results were impressive. Remember, they conducted the events in only 
two of the five regions. In 37% of the time, 3 months versus 8 months, the 
company grew the number of opportunities 240%, from 10 to 24. The rev-
enue in the forecast grew from $1.7M to $4.4M. 75% of these deals were 
in a “confident” stage. The interesting part of the scenario is that the niche 
product opportunities went from 2 to 7. That means the other opportunities, 
in the larger volume categories, increased from 8 to 17. The goal of the niche 
was to gain access to the customer and then have broader conversations, and 
that is exactly what happened. With these results, the manufacturer stepped 
up and paid for marketing events in the other regions. The other divisions of 
the manufacturer saw these results and were willing to put in money for mar-
keting events, even though the niche product was outside their division.
Niche selling works because it gives every advantage to penetrating a new account. First, it increases 
the rep’s chance to gain access to a customer. Next, it reduces the chances the rep will be going head 
to head against an experienced, incumbent competitor. Last, if you have a large product portfolio, 
it allows your company to focus training for new salespeople, and it gives a specific focal point for 
marketing to assist the sales team.

Summary
In this chapter, I assumed that you have a choice in products or services. If you 
do, pick something unique. If you do not have a choice, hopefully your offer-
ing is unique. If your offering is not unique, try to find a unique application of 
the product or service that has not yet been discussed with the customer. If 
it is not unique, at a minimum make sure your messaging is in line with your 
buyer’s adoption personality, or job title.
The power of this strategy is that it does not require one ounce of sales 
training, or sales skills improvement. It can be done in a conference room with 
management. And, you can get the entire organization focused on supporting 
penetration of new accounts. It’s a matter of simple physics. If you can apply 
the same amount of force in a smaller area, you generate much more pressure. 
If you push on a piece of paper with your hand using 20 pounds of force, noth-
ing really happens. Now take that same 20 pounds of force, and focus it on the 
tiny area of a pencil tip. You will punch right through it. If you use marketing, 
events, cold calling, and training all focused on one niche product, you get the 
maximum pressure in penetrating new accounts.
Now that you are prepared to engage with the customer with a proper online 
presence, sales training, product training, an effective elevator hook, and you 
have picked a solution to lead with, we have one more element of trust to dis-
cuss which is slightly outside of business. The most trusted people are people 
with power or authority. Most sales people—the bottom 80%—give up too 
much personal power the moment they walk in the door. We will explore 
that in the next chapter.

Power in Sales
Don’t Give It Away
Wherever there is a man who exercises authority, there is a man who will 
follow it.
—Unknown
There is sure fire way to cut your sales in half with the very first sentence out 
of your mouth. I’ll get to that in a moment. But first let me say that I included 
this chapter because there are a few simple behaviors that you might not be 
aware of that can sabotage your results. And there are, likewise, a few things 
you can do to multiply your results.
Power, or authority, is required if you want to join the ranks of the best sales-
people. The salespeople who take control of the sales cycle are most likely to 
win any given deal. There are many reasons this is true. In Chapter 5, “Trust,” 
for example, you learned about the elements of trust. Each of those elements 
leads to a position of power over the customer.
There’s more. Whenever you meet with customers, you should adopt a 
mentality that you are the most powerful person in the room. After all, 
you are there to help, educate, and ultimately allow the customer to 
execute the company’s business more efficiently. You bring insight from 
the entire industry, as well as insight from other customers who have dealt 
with similar situations.
Your customers not only respond to the power you bring, but they crave it. The last thing you want 
to be is a burden to your customer; instead, be someone they want to hear from. That someone has 
power and isn’t afraid to use it.

Killing Power with One Line
It is amazing how many salespeople do not take pride in their sales careers. 
You can spot them within the first five seconds of a meeting, because they 
start with something like:
“I am just the sales guy.”
• 
“My job is to bring the smart people into the room.”
• 
“I am just the guy who buys lunch.”
• 
“I will be your cruise director during this meeting.”
• 
“Don’t pay attention to me; I am only the salesperson.”
• 
“Let me stop and let the smart people talk.”
• 
“I am just a facilitator.”
• 
“I am just the person who schedules the resources.”
• 
These type of behaviors are even more prevalent in technical sales, where 
salespeople work with a team of product experts. It is okay to let your 
customer know that, for the technical details, you will defer to the technical 
experts. But, do not downplay your value in a wholesale way with sweeping 
statements like those.
You must think of yourself as a doctor. You are there to help diagnose issues 
and solve problems. How would you feel if your doctor walked into the room 
and said, “I am not an expert in this, but let’s get started.”? The doctor may 
not be a specialist in cardiology for example, but he can still listen to the heart 
and recommend that the patient see a specialist after the exam. However, if 
he starts with, “I am not a specialist,” then the patient will think, “Then why are 
you even listening to my heart?”
The same holds true for salespeople. It is okay not to be a technical expert. 
However, everything you sell should bring business value. You are the business 
expert in the room, so project that confidence.
Your Time Is Important
Making the best use of your time is an important mantra for you to practice 
from day one. It is also important that your customer sees that your time 
is important. Powerful people have busy schedules. If you allow yourself to 
let your customers dictate your schedule, your customers will sense that 
you do not have power. Statements like, “I am open all next week,” “I will 
rearrange my schedule to accommodate you,” and “Pick a time, I will make 
it work” are all examples of how a simple statement can diminish your power, 

Trust-Based Selling

thus reducing the trust your customer has. When scheduling, be specific 
about your available times. “I have an opening on Friday at 10:00, or next 
Wednesday at 1:30.” Even if your calendar is wide open, show your cus-
tomer that your time is valuable.
It will help you set a precedent with your customer that you are important, 
and that your time is precious. If they sense your time is free, the customer 
will be more apt to make you jump through hoops. “We need this,” “Can you 
be here next week?,” “We have a an urgent request,” or “We need you here 
tomorrow!” Once you start falling into these traps, they are hard to get out 
of. Once customers start giving you hoops to jump through, you know they 
either don’t respect your power, or are testing it.
Example
I had just hired Kevin, whom I had known for years. I was more than happy 
to have him on my team. He was very well respected, and had a proven track 
record, as he has been in our industry for over 20 years.
We were meeting with a junior engineer barely out of college. We entered 
our names on the sign-in sheet that every customer has, got our badges, and 
sat down to wait for the person to come escort us to the meeting room. We 
reviewed our objectives for the call one more time. I was impressed with the 
agenda Kevin had for the meeting. Everything was looking professional, and  
I was feeling more confident in my decision to hire him. My only concern was 
this was a pretty low-level engineer we were about to meet. A few minutes 
passed, and the junior engineer came out to greet us. I extended my hand and 
said, “It’s nice to meet you; I am Dave.”
Kevin extended his hand and said with a sweet-as-molasses tone, “I am Kevin, 
and thank you so much for your time; thank you.”
As we walked down the hallway toward the meeting room, there was some idle 
conversation, and Kevin slipped in another, “Thank you so much for meeting us.” 
We arrived at the meeting room, and as we sat down, Kevin again said, “Thank 
you; Thank you for your time.” I was glaring at Kevin trying to will him to stop!
I teased Kevin for years about this, because I wanted him to stop this way-too-
nice behavior. He was giving up all his power to an administrative engineer. 
What I wanted to convey was that a salesperson’s time is more important 
than a customer’s. Most of your customers are getting paid whether they sit 
there or not. You get paid for what you sell. You could be in front of more 
important people, making more money. Your time is valuable.
Respect your customer’s time, but don’t put it on a pedestal. Your time is actually more valuable, 
because you get paid only for performance.

Chapter 10 | Power in Sales
98
Jumping Through Hoops
Again, you must show that your time is important. You need to convey that 
you are willing to help your customers, but they have to put as much skin in 
the game as you do. Do not blindly jump through hoops. Especially be aware 
of hoops that are meant to blow you off, like the “Please send me some 
literature” hoop.
I believe that sales is a profession in which you help and educate customers. 
This does not mean being subservient. Your customers will request adminis-
trative items from you, such as proofs of concept, new quotes, more quotes, 
and answers to RFPs. Sometimes customers don’t know the effort some of 
these tasks require. It is okay to push back some and to ask for clarification 
as to why they are requesting something from you. It is also okay to negoti-
ate with the customer. Give into the request reluctantly, and for something in 
return. At a minimum, put the task on your timetable.
If you have been in sales long enough, you will recognize the salesperson 
who runs around like a chicken with its head cut off. “I need to get this quote  
to the customer yesterday, and you need to drop everything you are doing to 
help me.” This is a salesperson who is not in control of the sales cycle; they 
have given up all their power to the customer. Do not assume your customers 
need everything immediately. It is okay to tell the customer that her request 
will take a certain amount of time. Set the expectation that your time is 
important.
Summary
There are many techniques for establishing power with customers, including 
the way you hold your hands, how you enter a room, how you stand, how 
you shake hands, and so on. This chapter was not about techniques you can 
use to project power. The point here was to point out simple mistakes that 
many salespeople make that are very easy to avoid. You are working hard to 
establish trust with your customer, so do not let your power wane with seem-
ingly harmless statements. I am not asking you to change your personality or 
use gimmicks to get power, but just be aware of the self-worth you project to 
your customers.
You are two-thirds the way through the book, and finally you get to meet 
with the customer in the next chapter. I will cover some “selling skills and 
strategies,” and discuss a small shift in focus from opportunity qualification to 
qualifying the customer as someone with the potential to become a long-term 
buyer of your products or services.

Sales 101
People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.
—John C. Maxwell
No matter how much strategy you have, you still must be able to pull the 
trigger and execute. Selling skills are your number one tool in developing the 
element of trust. Like with many things, selling skills are not the only thing you 
need, but without them you face an uphill challenge.
Selling is simple. Listen to the customer. Ask questions. Push the focus back 
on the customer at all times. If every salesperson could do these simple tasks, 
it would put every sales author and trainer out of business.
Why are questions so important? You ask questions for two reasons.
They enable you to dive into the heart of the issue. You 
• 
can expand the issue to the point where the customer 
says, “I have to fix this problem.”
They show that you care. As John Maxwell said, “People 
• 
don’t care how much you know until they know how 
much you care.” This is the quote at the beginning of 
the chapter, but it is worth repeating. Showing you care 
will win you more trust than any strategy you employ. 
Without proper intent from the beginning, you will have 
difficulty advancing the sales cycle.

I just saved you hundreds of dollars on sales books. It really is that simple. 
The problem is that for most people, the 80% crowd, this is hard to do. I am 
no exception. I teach sales skills, yet I still have to constantly remind myself, 
“Shut up, focus back on the customer, and don’t talk so much about what my 
products or service can do.” I like to hear myself talk, but I am at least to the 
point where I am aware when I am boring a customer.
Questions!
I was just reading an article that said questions are becoming a passé concept 
as a sales tool; conversations are the way to go. I agree that conversations are 
most important. However, questions are the tool of choice to guide conversa-
tions. The easiest way to start a conversation or keep a conversation going 
is with questions. I think the article was referring to the old questions like, 
“What keeps you up at night?,” “What’s the stone in your shoe?,” or “If you 
could fix one thing, what would it be?”
I believe canned questions like these are past their prime. First, everyone 
uses them, so they sound insincere. Second, you have not earned the trust to 
ask personal questions yet. No one is going to dump their troubles, business 
or personal, on someone they have no trust in. This chapter helps you bet-
ter understand why questions are important, why you need to build toward 
tougher questions, and how to use questions effectively so you become a 
conversationalist without sounding like an interrogator.
Overused word alert: I will use the word “question” in some form 95 times in this chapter. (I counted.) 
I overuse the word to drive home the importance of questions.
Example
Why is something as simple as asking questions so hard for salespeople?  
For 80% of salespeople, their comfort zone is in talking about their products.  
I see it with new salespeople, regional managers, and VPs of sales; they like 
to talk about what they can do for the customer. They like to talk about 
their products, their company, and themselves. I could share with you several  
stories about bad sales behavior, or salespeople with long monologues, 
but this example best exemplifies the challenge of staying focused on the  
customer and asking questions.

Trust-Based Selling
101
I have had the chance to interview many sales candidates over the years. 
During the interview, I spend half the time on an exercise with the candidate. 
My goal is to determine if they can keep asking questions. From the quality of 
their questions, I can get a great sense of how technical or business savvy they 
are. Here is how I set up the role-play.
This is not a sales call. You have a customer who has just awarded 
you a deal to help them implement a project. I will play the customer, 
and all I want you to do is ask me questions about the project. I want 
you to understand the business goals, the technical environment, the 
timelines of the project, and the technical objectives. Understand 
the timeframes, budgets, and how this project affects the business. 
Again, just find out as much as you can about this project. Do not 
sell to me. Listen to my answers; they will help you form your next 
question.
I have set them up to exhibit the proper sales behavior, asking questions. I even 
tell them the exact information they need to get from me. In the interview, 
there are a few check boxes I am looking for.
Does the candidate keep asking questions?
• 
Are they asking business questions?
• 
Are they asking technical questions?
• 
Are they asking personal or pain questions?
• 
What caliber of questions do they ask?
• 
What depth of knowledge is demonstrated?
• 
Are they carrying on a conversation?
• 
The results are typical. Nearly 80% of the time, the candidates ask two, maybe 
three, questions, and then start making statements about how they can help. 
They think since it’s a sales interview that they need to sell. What I want to 
see is proper selling behavior, which consists of asking questions. When they 
start selling, I think, “They just stopped selling. Now I am getting a monologue.” 
I stop them, and tell them once again, “Just ask questions to understand this 
project.” Still, 80%–90% of candidates find an opening in the conversation to 
deliver a monologue. The true indication of the depth of the problem is the 
fact that these candidates are making up their monologue. They know very 
little about what the company does, but they proceed to “wing it” and make 
up value propositions on the fly.
As stated, selling is simple, but hard for most salespeople to execute. I believe 
the disconnection lies in how each person’s selling style is ingrained in their 
personality, which is difficult to change.

Chapter 11 | Selling Strategies
102
What is easy to change is strategy. Strategy can be done with management, in 
the car, in the parking lot, and in a conference room. When strategizing, you 
do not have the pressure of the customer in front of you. There are no reper-
cussions for missteps. Setting a strategy is easy. The proper strategy will keep 
you aligned with the skills you need to employ. You cannot execute the strate-
gies in this book without asking questions. Questions force you to exhibit the 
proper skills. And the answers to your questions can be used to further refine 
your sales strategy and make it more effective. Even if you ignore the advice 
of building trust before you enter into an opportunity cycle, you cannot learn 
about the opportunity without asking questions. How else will you learn these 
elements in the sales equation?

No matter how smart you are, or how well you position your products, you 
cannot qualify the customer or the opportunity without asking the right ques-
tions. Using the hunter analogy, your skills are your ability to aim and shoot. 
Questions are your gun. Questions are your sales weapon of choice. When 
asking questions, you give the customer a chance to talk. This is a conversa-
tion. No matter how well you think a sales call went, the next time you get out 
of an appointment, stop and think, “Who did all the talking?”
In your first few encounters with new customers, your focus should be on 
raising trust levels. This is as easy as asking questions. Ask questions; ask ques-
tions. Why?
Intent. If you stay focused on the customers by asking them in detail about 
their issues, you show that you care about them. They may even forget they 
are in a sales meeting.
Results. This one is hard to earn from the beginning. However, you must ask 
questions about their goals. Understand where they are, and where they want 
to be. Have them tell you what a successful solution looks like.
Dedication. In the early stages of the sales/buyer relationship, your dedication 
is closely tied to your intent in the customer’s mind.
Capability. You are better off showing capability through intelligent questions 
rather than telling what you can do for them.

Trust-Based Selling
103
I was once in your shoes and wanted to prove that, even though I was a 
“sales guy,” I could hang with the customer’s engineers. I could, but it took me  
10 years to realize that the engineers dismissed what I was saying, just because 
I was the salesperson. I was not doing myself any favors. I eventually learned 
that the quality of my questions could demonstrate my capabilities. I now have 
a goal with every sales call: to hear the words, “great question.” The more 
“great question” responses I get, the more comfortable the customer is about 
my abilities. As trust grows, they open up even more.
ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS
The tough questions you are afraid to ask are the most professional ones. Questions 
about the decision process, budgets, time frames, goals, how the business is affected 
if they don’t do something, or the advantage the customer will have if they do move 
forward, will show you are the business consultant they are looking for. The interview 
process I described earlier in this chapter had this very goal—to determine the quality of 
questions asked by the interviewee. I wanted to know if they asked technical, project, or 
business-related questions. I wanted to know how detailed, or how in depth they could 
go in any one subject. Your customers want to know the same things. You will impress 
them with great—and sometimes difficult—questions, and you will annoy them with the 
answers you provide unsolicited.
A Study on
A large manufacturing company noticed a trend with their sales teams. After 
two years in a sales position, most salespeople started to lose momentum. 
Morale would decrease, and their sales results would diminish to the point of 
disrepair. (See Figure 11-1).

Chapter 11 | Selling Strategies
104
The two curves show morale and productivity. When starting in a new 
territory, you are working hard, and you are probably insecure because you 
do not know your customer, market, or products very well. However, as you 
gain experience, your morale and performance pick up. At about the two-year 
mark, your morale and performance are at an all-time high. So why does the 
curve start to go down at that point? This seems like a huge contradiction.
It’s called the “double E effect.” Experience and enthusiasm kill sales. Wait! 
You probably have read some place that one of the key qualities of any sales-
person is passion. Isn’t enthusiasm another word for passion? Why would 
experience play a role in causing sales to decline? The answer is simple. Once a 
salesperson masters her product or services, she stops asking questions. She 
is now an expert in what she is selling. She has great intent and has helped 
many customers produce results. She is eager (enthusiastic) to help the next 
customer. With the two Es, she starts telling the customers how she can help. 
She stops asking questions! Think about an uncomfortable conversation, or 
an early sales call, where you knew little about the product. Your defense 
mechanism was to ask questions and get your customer to talk, which is great 
selling. It is simple to see from the outside looking in, but hard to recognize 
when you are actually on the sales side of the call.

Trust-Based Selling
105
Example
During sales training, I do an exercise where I ask one of the participants in the 
class to role-play with me. This kind of role-play demonstrates behavior, rather 
than sales training-type role-play that is meant to ingrain specific memorized 
wordings. The first thing I do is put the salesperson on a sales call where they 
know nothing about their product. The example I use is a vacuum salesperson 
(I like the stereotype) going to a potential customer’s home. It’s this person’s 
first day on the job and he was going only to observe the senior salesperson. The 
new person shows up in the driveway and is waiting for his partner. The phone 
rings. The partner is stuck in traffic, “You have to cover this call for me.”
Since the participants know very little about vacuums, they are typically very 
nervous, so I tell them to just ask me questions. They hesitate, thinking of 
questions, and then they come out. Why did you agree to an appointment 
today? What is your old vacuum? How does it work? Is there anything you 
don’t like about it? Are there features you wish it had? How often do you vacuum? 
Do you have kids or pets? Questions, plain and simple. The participant looks 
very awkward. So I let them off the hook. I say, “Great job. I know you are 
nervous. Let me make it easier on you. Let’s role-play a sales call within your 
industry.” You see the person’s mood and morale instantly improve. They are 
back in their comfort zone.
Jeff, the participant in this case, is eager to get another try, this time with a 
product he knows something about.
I say, “Jeff, welcome; thank you for coming in, we would like to talk about x 
today.” Jeff starts with some pleasantries. Then he asks a couple of questions 
about what the customer would like to hear about. Then Jeff starts to “sell.” 
He says how great the company is; how their product is better and why. On 
and on.
After teaching on my feet all morning, I feel like letting him go on all afternoon, 
so I can rest. However, I am nice and I cut him off after three minutes or so. 
“Good job Jeff; please take a seat.”
Jeff proudly walks back to his seat, since he just did a great job selling. He did 
do a great job selling, but it’s not in the scenario he thinks. I poll the class, 
“Which was a better sales call?” Almost unanimously, the class votes for the 
vacuum sales call. Everyone can see that the call was smoother, the customer 
was more engaged in answering questions, and Jeff got a ton of information 
from the customer.
 When you are in the middle of the “sale,” you need to be an outside observer, like the class, and start 
to be aware of what’s going on. Are you sounding like a bore? Is the customer engaged? Are you 
asking questions?

Chapter 11 | Selling Strategies
106
Objectively, when I look back at people I have worked with, or for, one great 
salesperson stands out in my mind. At the time I thought he was average, 
but over time, I gained new respect for his abilities. I wish he had taught me  
more. I was a beginner who was slowly becoming an expert, and he was an 
expert. I liked to prove I was as smart as the engineers, so I talked about 
products. I had the answers to the customer’s problem; I had quick answers 
to their questions.
He acted like he didn’t know a thing. He would just ask simple questions that  
I knew he knew the answers to. I would ask him, “Why are you asking so many 
simple questions?” He would just smile. I didn’t get it 20 years ago, but today  
I do. He did not let his enthusiasm and experience stop him from asking  
questions. He was an expert acting like a beginner. He was a professional.
Example
Let’s go back to Susan from Chapter 2, the woman who had access to  
20 CIOs in her territory. When we analyzed what was going on, we realized 
the weak link was the sales manager. She had an enthusiastic sales manager 
who was overjoyed with the fact that Susan had C-level access at 20 accounts. 
In the first three months of her being on board, Susan introduced her boss to 
each of her previous customers. After six months, there were no measurable 
results in Susan’s territory.
At the quarterly business review, the VP of sales analyzes the situation. The VP 
asks the regional manager, “So, how are things going?”
He replies, “Great. It’s just a matter of time before we can take advantage of 
Susan’s relationships.”
VP: “What activity has occurred?”
The enthusiastic regional manager: “It’s been awesome. Susan has brought us 
into about 20 accounts, at the C-Level. We’ve had the chance to tell our story 
to 20 new customers!”
The VP’s response was not so enthusiastic: “What the [****] do you mean?”
Confused, the regional manager asks: “What do you mean?”
Ignoring the question, the VP suggests, “Let’s go down the list of these 
­customers and understand what next steps we have with each. I want to know 
what issues they have. Customer number one, what are their main initiatives 
for the year?”
Silence.

Trust-Based Selling
107
“Customer number 2, what are their main initiatives for the year?”
Silence.
VP: “You told our story? How long did you take in telling our story?”
Regional manager: “Well you know our slide deck, 30 minutes or so.”
VP: “Did you bother asking the customer anything about their business?”
Regional manager: “In most cases with the C-level they only had 45 minutes. 
So, we didn’t have much time for that.”
VP: “[****]!”
This is typical. The regional manager was excited to have Susan’s access to the 
C-level contacts and took for granted her relationship with the customer. He 
thought with her relationship, all he needed to do was tell the customer how 
great her new company was and orders would flow in.
What happened?
He forgot sales 101, which is to ask questions.
• 
He forgot about the incumbent.
• 
He forgot about qualifying the customer.
• 
He bored the customers.
• 
The customers dismissed the new vendor, because Susan and the regional 
manager did not take time to establish a trusting relationship. They did not 
show intent by taking the time to ask about their customer issues. Susan 
didn’t improve upon the trust she had built through her previous job, and 
she underestimated the trust the incumbent had built. She lost these sales 
as a result.
Questioning Skills
Here are the basics for questioning prospects.
Listening will help you develop your best questions.
• 
Focus on the basics—who, what, where, why, and how 
• 
(how many, how much),
Asking “why” three times will lead to the real reason the 
• 
customer has discussed an issue.
Let’s consider each of these points in detail.

Chapter 11 | Selling Strategies
108
Listening
The number one mistake you see with sales reps who are trying to question 
is that they do not listen to the answers. They ask a question, wait for the 
answer, and then move on to the next question on the list. The best ques-
tions feed off the customer’s responses. In sales, questions are your weapon. 
In hunting, your rifle is your weapon. The best sharpshooters in the word 
have an extra set of eyes on the target; they have spotters. The spotters tell 
the shooter where to aim. The shooter fires one round, and the spotter tells 
the shooter, “ You were down six inches to the left.” The shooter adjusts the 
weapon, or the scope on the weapon, to accommodate for the errant shot. 
The same goes with questions. Look for feedback from the customer in the 
form of their answers. Your next question should build off their answer, and 
probe for deeper understanding.
Sounding Like an Expert with Basic Questions
So the first principle is to listen and feed off the answers. How do you do this? 
Use the basic questions—who, where, what, when, why, and how. These ques-
tions will make you seem like an expert on any subject.
In the earlier example, Jeff was in front of the class asking questions to his 
potential vacuum customer. He must ask questions out of necessity. I call Jeff 
back to the front of the room and give him the instructions to listen to my 
answers and then follow up with the what, who, how many, and why questions. 
Here is how the conversation goes.
Jeff rings the doorbell and I welcome him in.
Jeff:  “I understand you are in the market for a vacuum?”
Customer:  “Yes I am.”
Jeff:  “Why are you looking for a new vacuum?”
Customer:  “Well, I don’t think the one we have works all that well.”
Jeff:  “What doesn’t work well? Is there a function you are looking for, or are 
your floors not as clean as you would like?”
Customer:  “A little of both. I think my current vacuum is heavy, and it’s hard 
getting the stairs clean. But mainly, the carpets don’t look as good as they used 
to.”
Jeff:  “Can you show me the stairs? Where are they dirty?”
Customer:  “See the edges and corners? I don’t have an attachment for 
those.”

Trust-Based Selling
109
Jeff: “So, it’s heavy and doesn’t have some features? How often do you vacuum 
the stairs?”
Customer: “I vacuum all the time. My kids are always dragging in grass 
clippings.”
Jeff: “How many kids do you have?”
This can go on forever, but you can see that this is a much smoother conver-
sation. He asked how, what, who, and why questions. He listened and molded 
his next question based on the customer’s answers. Does Jeff know anything 
more about vacuums than he did 10 minutes before, when he was up in front 
of the class? No. But with some guidelines, he comes across as confident and 
knowledgeable. And, by asking deeper questions, he shows he cares. The trust 
is building. Luckily for Jeff, he knew nothing about the vacuum he was selling. If 
he had, he would have had the urge to start talking about the company’s new 
“Featherweight Series,” or something like that. Fight the urge to start talking 
about the solution right when the customer opens the door, and keep on 
feeding off their answers.
 You can use the questioning method anywhere—in sales or even at parties. You will be amazed at 
the conversations you can hold without knowing a thing about a topic.
Get to the Heart of the Matter
If you ask “why” three times, you will get to the heart of the matter. You will 
get to the real reason that someone wants to make a change, fix a problem, 
or buy something new. Looking back at the vacuum scenario, the conversation 
could just as easily gone like this.
Jeff: “I understand you are in the market for a vacuum?”
Customer: “Yes I am.”
Jeff: “Why are you looking for a new vacuum?”
Customer: “Well, I don’t think the one we have works all that well.”
Jeff: “Why do you say that? Is there a function you are looking for, or are you 
floors not as clean as you like?”
Customer: “A little of both. I think my current vacuum is heavy; it’s hard get-
ting the stairs clean. But, mainly the carpets don’t look as good as they used 
to.”
Jeff: “Can you show me what you mean?”
Customer: “See this area? It doesn’t look like stain; it just seems dirty.”

Chapter 11 | Selling Strategies
110
Jeff:  “It doesn’t seem too bad; why does it bother you?”
Customer:  “My mother in-law had fun pointing that out.”
Jeff, smiling:  “Mother in-law? Is she here often?”
Customer:  “Too often; I always feel my house has to be spotless.”
These questions are not exactly why, why, why, but variations of “why” are 
woven through each question. The real reason this customer wants a new 
vacuum is to impress her mother in-law. This is a much more powerful moti-
vator than a dirty carpet.
This applies even more so to B2B sales. I have talked about how each title 
within a company has different goals. It is critical that you determine the real 
reason why someone is contemplating working on a new project or purchas-
ing something new. Let me clue you in. Most people do not want to work 
harder. They want their lives to be easier. So the real reason they are willing 
to make a change has to be personal. Asking “why” three times will get you 
to the personal reason. Once you figure out the personal reason, your trust 
score goes through the roof. Your intentions become about helping them 
personally. The results you will show have an impact on their life or their 
career.
Salesperson:  “So Bob, you are looking at buying some more storage; why?”
Bob:  “The current system does not have the horsepower we are looking for.”
Salesperson:  “Horsepower, meaning . . .?”
Bob:  “Recently, we changed the backup of our major systems over from tape 
to our storage system. That was supposed to improve performance.”
Salesperson:  “Supposed to?”
Bob:  “Yes, it helped a little, but our backups are still taking hours.”
Salesperson:  “Why is that a problem?”
Bob:  “I am not allowed to leave work until the backups are completed.”
Salesperson:  “Wow, that’s a bummer. How late have you been staying lately?”
Bob:  “Well, I can’t play in our softball league anymore.”
The reason Bob wants a new storage system is because he wants to play 
softball!!! Nowhere in any cost justification, or ROI presentation, will it 
ever mention softball. But now that you know why Bob wants it so bad, you 
have an ally.

However, Bob’s boss will have a whole different reason why she wants new 
storage.
Salesperson:  “Bob tells me you are looking at some new storage.”
Karen:  “Yes, our backups are not running as fast as we would like.”
Salesperson:  “Why does this bother you—is it causing a problem?”
Karen:  “About a month ago, a large database was corrupted, and Finance was 
unable to run an end-of-quarter report. They were late in getting their quar-
terly earnings report to the CEO.”
Salesperson:  “How will faster backups help with that?”
Karen:  “It didn’t have any direct effect, but it put a spotlight on our slow 
backup process.”
Salesperson:  “Are tasked with solving this issue?”
Karen:  “Yes, my next quarter MBOs are all based on this project.”
By asking Susan enough questions, you finally get the real reason that Bob’s 
boss wants new storage; she is financially incented.
Summary
Remember the true reasons for asking questions:
To uncover enough information about the situation to 
• 
the point the customer is saying to themselves, “We have 
to fix this issue.”
To show that you care.
• 
Questions, questions, questions. You can see how customers will open up to 
questions. If you want to sum up sales skills, think questions, questions, ques-
tions. You can’t hunt without a gun. You can’t sell without asking questions.
Even though this book is about strategy that anyone can use regardless of skill 
level, it’s important to include on chapter about sales skills. To change your 
personality is a long process. The process starts with awareness. Be aware of 
the conversations you have with customers. After each sales call, ask yourself 
who did all the talking.
With this crash course in selling, you are now in a position to ask ­questions 
and listen to the customer. It is now that you start truly executing  
your strategy.

Building 
Trust Before 
Opportunity
As you go to work, your top responsibility should be to build trust.
—Robert Eckert
The most important strategy discussed so far has been to focus on the 
customer relationship rather than on the immediate opportunity. This point 
was driven home with information about improving sales skills, managing 
opportunities, avoiding becoming column fodder, and handling leads well. 
You have spent time qualifying and ranking your customers, so now you 
need to develop their trust. However, what do you do when you are not 
completely focused on an opportunity?
Why You Can Win an Incumbent’s Business
Assume you qualified the customer and you have established some trust with 
them. You received a warm introduction and you have successfully shown 
intent by staying focused on them. Your intent is solid, while your capability, dedi-
cation, and results are at best, warm. Your trust meter looks like Figure 12-1.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 12 | Building Trust Before Opportunity
114
In the trust-ranking system, you have a score of five, but you need at least a 
six to compete with a fully trusted incumbent. You need to work on capability, 
dedication, and results.
I want to remind you that it’s likely that you’re building a trust meter that 
is actually stronger than the incumbent’s. In the incumbent’s ideal world, 
the meter is full, but in reality they have probably taken their customer for 
granted (Figure 12-2).

The smart incumbent realizes that the relationship after the sale is important 
to the customer, and that selling to an existing customer is much easier than 
finding new ones. However, this graph shows that the typical salesperson moves 
on to new opportunities after the sale. I guarantee that your focus on bringing 
value to the customer will be rewarded once an opportunity is presented.
These elements are easy to change when given a chance. However, your 
customer has been conditioned over the years to engage with salespeople 
within the confines of a project. You need to be creative in demonstrating 
dedication, capability, results, and intent without the benefit of a “natural” 
sales cycle.
Methods to Increase Trust
The ideas shared in this chapter are only suggestions for actions you can take 
to improve business relationships. These ideas go beyond, “Can I take you to 
lunch?” or “Would you like to play golf?” While you can develop a friendly 
relationship with the customer in order to win their business, you must also 
establish business trust.
The primary strategy is to stay in front of your customer while offering value. 
If you focus on product presentations or just grill the customer for informa-
tion over and over, they will stop seeing value in your interactions, and your 
ability to secure future appointments will dwindle. In everything you do with 
a customer, you must make sure you are adding business value. The most 
powerful tools you have are information and concern. You want to keep your 
customers educated about your solutions, new trends in the industry, news 
articles, or information that will help them with their careers. The more you 
understand your customer from the beginning, the more focused the infor-
mation can be to that customer. The information must complement their 
concerns. Sharing information can demonstrate your capability.
Capability is established with industry knowledge more so than with product knowledge. Customers 
are always curious about the latest industry trends.
Phone Call with Follow-Up E-Mail
This one is simple. As you are maintaining your industry knowledge, you will 
come across information that your customer will benefit from knowing. Call 
your customer and leave a simple voicemail. “I came across an article today  
I thought you would be interested in. I am going to mail (or e-mail) it to you. 
Let me know your thoughts.” Make these calls personal and specific to each 

Chapter 12 | Building Trust Before Opportunity
116
person. An ideal situation is when you come across information pertaining to 
a specific issue the customer has mentioned. “You mentioned you had X as an 
issue; I thought this article would be useful to you.” Customers are inundated 
with blanket marketing e-mails. Make it personal.
The order of calling and then sending the e-mail is important. Do not send a 
mass e-mail to every prospect. The reason you are calling and then sending 
the e-mail is to show dedication and dependability. You told the customer 
you were going to do something for them, and then you followed through. It 
creates two positive touch points.
You should not do this in reverse order. The information you are sharing is 
for their benefit. It makes no sense to send an e-mail to the customer and tell 
them you’ll follow up with a phone call.
You phone in hopes of getting the customer. If you don’t, leave a voicemail. 
Then send the e-mail with information that’s useful specifically to them. 
Incidentally, use this tactic only after you have met with the customer, not as 
part of your cold calling activities.
Lunch and Learn, or the Seminar
The lunch and learn is a different animal than just a lunch. The straight, “Can 
I take you to lunch?” does not inherently have an agenda. The conversations 
can go in many directions, and getting around to business can be a challenge. 
Lunch and learns have built-in agendas. Your goal is to educate the customers 
and have them view it as an important learning opportunity. The most effective 
lunch and learns have the following components:
The lunch is held in a neutral spot—not at the customer 
• 
site.
You invite multiple customers at one time.
• 
You cover elements of industry knowledge transfer, or 
• 
define a common issue that most customers face.
You offer a brief description of how your solution can 
• 
help.
This should not be a product pitch or a 60-minute presentation on your 
product.
Since the customer is offsite, you create an event feel rather than a disguised 
sales call. This will have the effect of demonstrating stronger intent, and it will 
cause customers to lower their guards. You want them out of their offices 
and away from their computers. Granted, this is harder today, with smart-
phones. You don’t want them to feel that they’re being “sold to” in a place 
where their guard is up.

Trust-Based Selling
117
Having multiple customers at the table is your strongest tool. Subconsciously, 
to the customer, it’s like you were referred to them by these 10 other 
customers in the room. Chances are, not everyone will meet everyone else. 
Each attendee has no idea whether they are existing customers or prospects 
like themselves. Typically, they will assume the others are existing customers. 
Referrals help strengthen all aspects of trust, and you can multiply that by the 
number of other customers attending. If you have existing customers at the 
event, there is a good chance they are there because they already trust your 
capabilities. There is a natural tendency for customers to network at these 
events, meaning there is a good chance your existing customers will refer you. 
You hope your prospect asks, “What has this vendor done for you?” Results!
Your industry knowledge will continue to keep the customers’ guards down. 
They will be thankful it’s not just another product pitch. Events that educate 
people about the latest industry trends are the best attended. The lunch and 
learns that are product-centric have your customers thinking, “Will there be 
dessert?” Focusing on knowledge transfer will improve your trust meter in the 
areas of intent and capability.
The follow-up product presentation should be brief, and should be focused on 
a real-life scenario that highlights a customer’s challenge, a brief description about 
how your solution helped, and the results you delivered for the customer. The 
goal behind this approach is to show compassion for the customer’s issues; 
this is intent. You show capability in solving the issue, and lastly, you show 
that you can deliver results. Keeping the how-to portion brief will leave the 
customer with a touch of mystery. Lunch and learns are similar to cold calling 
in this aspect; the goal is to leave the customers wanting more. You need 
customers to talk about their specific issues; obviously they are not going to 
do this in a group setting. You will need a follow-up appointment. Leaving the 
customers wanting more increases your odds of securing that follow-up.
The event’s topic is the force that drives attendance (a nice venue never hurts 
either). If you stay with industry trends, or general-knowledge events, customers 
will attend. You may also want to try some of the cold calling techniques to 
drive attendance to these events.
Never Bash
When establishing trust with a customer, a huge mistake is to bash your 
competition, or sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about the incum-
bent. Customers make emotional decisions for logical reasons. If you bash 
the incumbent, you are effectively insulting the decisions your customer has 
made. Build your trust! Do not try to tear down the competition.

Chapter 12 | Building Trust Before Opportunity
118
 It is okay to position your offerings against a competitor’s weakness. But never bash! We have all 
done this in the past. I have done it. I have done it after I was told not to do it. However, now that I am 
better at reading my customers’ reactions, I can see uneasiness in most customers’ eyes when this 
bashing occurs. I can see the walls go up. It’s just not effective to bash.
When you bash you are not doing one thing to build your own trust. Your 
customers are judging you more than your product. They want to know if they 
can trust you. Build your own trust.
It is okay to highlight strengths you know your competitor cannot match. This 
can be done in a positive manner. If you know of a competitive weakness, you 
can ask the customer if they are having any issues specifically related to that 
weakness. For example, if I know my competitor’s product is much slower 
than ours, I can simply ask, “Have you been experiencing any performance 
issues?” You want the customer to highlight their issues. It is okay to guide 
them to issues they may have with an incumbent.
Never bash!
Give to Get
This is a delicate concept. The next example in this chapter illustrates the 
psychological value of reciprocity; it shows the value of a gift. In today’s world, 
there are many rules about giving customers gifts; some companies prohibit 
the use of them; some customers are not allowed to accept gifts. However, 
when I interviewed customers for this book, there was a sense that they like 
to see a vendor make an investment in them. So, you must take this concept 
and turn it into a business value. Instead of tickets to a football game, how do 
you give the customer something of business value—something that does not 
infringe upon any employer or legal restrictions?
Example
In the 1970s and 1980s, the Hare Krishnas gained a reputation by hounding 
passengers at airports across the country for donations. After limited success 
in gathering the donations they needed, they decided on a new tactic. They 
would hand the passenger a flower before asking for a donation. It must be 
noted that most passengers did not want to accept the flower, but when it 
was extended it was natural for the passengers to reach out and accept it. 
Sometimes the flower was almost forcefully placed in a passenger’s hand.

Trust-Based Selling
119
Upon the introduction of the flower, the rate of donations went up five times. 
When they were given a gift, the passengers felt a sense of obligation to recip-
rocate. It did not matter what the gift was. How do we know that the passen-
ger was not just paying for a flower they wanted? It turns out that 70% of the 
time the passengers would go around the corner and throw out the flower. 
(Being concerned with profit, the Krishnas retrieved the flowers from the gar-
bage and handed them to the next passenger.) Think about it—five times the 
donation rate for a flower that was forced on them, all thanks to reciprocity.
You see this tactic every time you go to the grocery store; it’s called the free 
sample. The sample has two purposes. First, they get you to try the product 
in the hopes you will like it. More importantly, there is a sense of obligation 
to purchase the item.
During my interviews with customers, none ever came out and said they 
wanted something for free, or a gift. A majority did want to see a vendor 
deliver something to them as the cost of doing business. Relating this to the 
concept of trust, ask yourself how you can show them results and minimize 
the customer’s risk of time and money? You are an unproven vendor, and the 
customer wants you to stand behind your solution before they have to enter 
you into their procurement system, seek budget approval, and cut you a PO. 
They want to see that you can deliver something, and show some results, 
before they have to jump through their internal hoops.
So what do you give? Like the free sample at the grocery store, your gift 
should have two purposes. Give the customer a taste for what you can do, 
and instill a sense of obligation. In order to show value, you need to first put 
a value on the service or product, rather than present it as free. It does not 
have to be a large service engagement or an expensive product. With the goal 
of driving a deeper level of trust, it’s best to choose something unique, and 
something you know you can deliver. Giving shows intent. You are not just out 
for yourself; you have the customer’s best interests at heart.
The next two elements you can address are results and capability. Highlight 
a solution that will demonstrate your company’s—or product’s—capabilities 
and expertise. Lastly, when the customer perceives an initial value, ensure 
you show results against that initial perception. Trust has to be shown, not 
told. If you have multiple offerings and you are trying to gain a foothold, 
do not go to the most competitive offering you have in your bag. Is there 
an offering you can lead with that will get your foot in the door? Do you 
have something that is unique versus going head-to-head with a competitor? 
Think about niche selling earlier in the book. Pick a niche if possible. Initial 
deals do not have to be large. It’s your first step to checking the trust boxes 
(Figure 12-3), so that you can eventually work toward larger opportunities. 
Demonstrate and show trust.

Chapter 12 | Building Trust Before Opportunity
120
Example
A classic example in the IT industry is to deliver a “gift” in the form of a 
free assessment. Typically, these assessments lead to roadmaps for orders. 
In other words, the deliverable from the assessment shows the customers 
their strengths and weaknesses in a specific area of their IT environment. The 
vendor then uses the findings of the assessment to propose solutions. The 
assessment is a formal needs analysis, which is part of the sales cycle. To 
the customer, it seems like a free professional services engagement.
Let’s put all the elements of this together. First, there must be a value assigned 
to the service engagement. If you present to the customer a free assessment, 
the customer will perceive it as having no value. On the other hand, if you say, 
“We typically charge X for this type of service, but we are waiving the cost for 
you,” then the perception is one of value; one of getting a “gift.” This can be a 
tremendous asset to the vendor. The cost to the vendor is typically small. You 
use people you have on staff already. The customer sees your capability and 
your intent, and you can show results. And, remember the call to action from 
the assessment is for the customers to buy something to fix a problem.
Another example, which is much softer, comes from my very first sales job 
when I was in high school. I sold hockey equipment at a skate shop. The 
customers were typically parents of the kids who were playing hockey. When 
they had younger kids, the parents were new to the sport, and they were not 
always the most informed on hockey equipment. New parents would come 
into the shop to purchase hockey skates, which range greatly in price and 
quality. Most parents perceived the price of the skate to be the best indication 
Figure 12-3.  Check off each trust element before a major opportunity

Trust-Based Selling
121
of value. However, the kids who new to the sport were usually five to six years 
old, and still growing. The expensive features of the more costly skates were 
wasted on these younger kids. I learned early on that when I told the parent 
that their child would be better off with a less expensive skate, they would 
purchase anything I suggested. The way I analyze the situation is almost like 
the free assessment. First I “gave” them some free advice, which resulted in a 
gift of less expensive skates. I showed great intention and implied great capa-
bility. There was also a sense of obligation. This tactic earned the customer 
trust, and developed a sense of obligation to purchase more.
Help the Customer Regardless
If you truly want to provide your customers with business value, and you want 
to show your customers that your intent is to help them, the number one way 
to do that is to help them with a solution that you do not sell.
As you start to spend time with the customer, she will start to open up about 
all sorts of problems and issues. Stay tuned to your customer’s problems. 
Don’t just have rabbit ears for problems you can solve. As you learn about 
your industry and build your network, you will have a much bigger set of solu-
tions. Consider your professional network as an extension of your line card, 
or solutions you can deliver to your customers.
This is exactly like a doctor who has an entire list of specialists that he engages 
to provide care for his patients. By understanding the compelling events your 
noncompetitive partners are looking for in the industry, you can help cus-
tomers. What happens if you hear a customer say, “I really need to solve this 
problem?” You know you can’t help with it, but you network with someone 
who you know can help. If you have the chance, line up the customer with 
someone you have networked with. You just strengthened your position with 
your customer immeasurably.
By the way, the person you brought in to help the customer now “owes you 
one.” Reciprocation!
Your goal is to get into the position to win against an incumbent. How do get 
into the inner circle, the circle of trust? You are creating a sales cycle with no 
competition, no close, and where the proof is on your dime (Figure 12-4).

Chapter 12 | Building Trust Before Opportunity
122
With the close and prove stages eliminated, you put yourself in the position 
to build full trust (Figure 12-5).
Figure 12-5.  Establish trust before you engage the incumbent on a full sales cycle
Figure 12-4.  By giving, you can implement and measure results, without a sales cycle

Trust-Based Selling
123
Adding value in the first stages of an engagement, for even a small deal or 
proof of concept, will help you develop trust. You can then enter into a larger 
deal on an equal playing field. By creating a “sales cycle,” like the one shown in 
Figure 12-4, you create trust before you have to compete against an incum-
bent on a larger deal. See Figure 12-5.
Partnering for Trust
This book was written for the person who owns the primary relationship 
with the customers. Here are some typical statements that are, however, cast 
in stone.
Resellers or distributors typically have closer relation-
• 
ships with their customers than manufacturers do, unless 
the manufacturer is selling to the customer directly.
Resellers typically make their living based on strong  
• 
relationships with fewer accounts. Manufacturers typically 
need more transactions at more accounts than they can 
handle.
If you are a manufacturer, you have the “luxury” of not having to develop as 
deep a trusting relationship. You demonstrate capability of self and prod-
uct. Then you can partner with an incumbent reseller who has already built 
the other elements of trust. The reseller should be strong in dedication and 
intent. They do not need capability; you bring that to the table. Their results 
are proven, but for other solutions (Figure 12-6).
Figure 12-6.  Partnering to improve trust
The concept of partnering with these accounts, and possibly choosing the 
incumbent reseller, isn’t new, but it’s worth pointing out how you enhance 
your trust.
At the reseller, the opposite holds true. Being new is a lot harder for a reseller. 
They do not have the ability, most of the time, to partner with an incumbent 
manufacturer. They are probably partnered with an incumbent reseller. Your 
strategy for partnering should be to find a niche play (Chapter 10) with the 
customer, and a niche manufacturer.

Chapter 12 | Building Trust Before Opportunity
124
By starting a relationship based on understanding and education, you hope 
to instill some intent and capability. Look for areas where you might not see 
capability from an incumbent and fill that niche (Figure 12-7).
Figure 12-8.  Partner to compete against an incumbent
Figure 12-7.  Partnering with a niche manufacturer to increase trust
Now you are matched to an incumbent with a trust meter that looks some-
thing like those in Figure 12-8. The incumbent may have a full trust meter, but 
when you have a solution in an area where they have not shown capability or 
results, their trust is somewhat reduced.
You now have a four or five on the trust meter. This is in the range to compete.
Summary 
The ideas in this chapter do not comprise an exact science. The point is to 
think outside the circle—the incumbent’s sales circle. You can engage the cus-
tomer outside of an opportunity cycle. Your time is critical. First qualify the 
customers—are they worth spending time with? If they are worth the time, use 
it wisely. You need to show value. Use the trust elements as a guide to thinking 
through your strategy with new customers. Use trust to build business value. In 
the next chapter, you learn how to manage, compete, and win opportunities.

Qualif ying  
and Developing 
Opportunity
However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the 
results.

126
When you have trust, qualifying opportunities becomes as simple as validat-
ing the other criteria in this list. In the sales cycle, you should not cross into 
the evaluation stage until you have identified the budget and a compelling 
event, you have or can gain access to power, and you know all the steps the 
customer and you will go through to close the deal. Do not waste time on 
demos or web-ex meetings, or respond to any administrative-type request 
from customers, unless you have identified these elements.
The good thing about having to identify these elements is that you remain 
focused on the customer, and on asking questions. This will inherently improve 
your sales skills. New salespeople often have a hard time asking tough ques-
tions about money, timeframes, access to power, and the decision process. 
These questions become especially hard when your pipeline is not at expected 
levels. You are almost afraid to ask out of fear you might upset the customer 
or they might not have the answer you want. Here is the truth:
The tough questions are the most professional ones.
• 
It’s better to qualify to a “no” than waste time on a deal 
• 
that has no chance.
Let Go of Poor Opportunities
Qualify to a “no.” What do I mean by, qualify to a no? It means that it’s better to 
lose early. Simply ask yourself, would you rather lose upfront or after you have 
spent six months working a deal? If you can’t identify the basic components of 
the deal, most likely you are wasting your time. It is as much of a waste of time 
as competing against an incumbent without the customer’s trust.
If you opt out of an opportunity, that does not mean the customer is forever 
lost to you. Hopefully, you have already qualified the customer as worth spend-
ing time with. It is okay for you to say no to a specific opportunity. The ability to 
tell a customer that you are not a good fit for a specific deal will instill trust.
 It is okay to walk away from some business for which you are not a good fit. It will give you instant 
credibility. It shows you have the customer’s best interests at heart. You are putting their needs above 
your desire for financial gain.
So many salespeople and sales managers hold onto bad opportunities; they 
are opportunity hoarders. If you have ever seen the television show Hoarders, 
you have seen the absolute devastation that hoarding can bring to someone’s 
life. Hoarding is a psychological disorder whereby people never throw out  
anything. They are afraid if they get rid of something that they will lose 

Trust-Based Selling
127
everything. Their houses and cars fill up with so much junk that they can’t 
walk through their own homes. It gets to the point where it can be physically  
dangerous, and the illness ruins their lives.
Do not hoard opportunities. When strategizing with salespeople about specific 
opportunities, many times it becomes obvious that the deal has no chance. 
There is no access to power, no money, or no trust. As an impartial outside 
observer, you can see as plain as day that the right answer is to walk from bad 
deals. Their forecasts become so cluttered with deals, that the real opportuni-
ties are lost in the weeds. The salesperson (and sometimes the sales manager) 
makes every excuse in the book to hold on to a bad lead or deal, which keeps 
their pipeline filled with junk. It seriously is like watching hoarders justify why 
they need keep coupons that are past their expiration dates.
Some customers have trouble saying no. There are many buyers that just don’t 
like confrontation or feel they would hurt the seller’s feelings. So they say 
“maybe” a lot. If you sense this is the case, you must give the customer permission 
to say “no.” Again, this will show you are looking out for them, and that they 
can trust that you will not overreact. Working “maybe” opportunities can hurt 
trust. The customer is thinking, “can’t they take a hint?” Even though it’s the 
customer not being straightforward, the customer will be irritated with the 
constant focus on something they have no intention of moving forward with. 
It also stops you from discussing other issues that may be of greater concern 
with the customer.
Qualify, qualify, qualify. Do not waste time with deals that are not qualified. Do 
not fill your pipeline with junk.
Developing Opportunities Is an Art 
Disclaimer: Developing opportunities is not the focus of this book, but it is necessary to include at 
some level, to show how to use trust throughout an opportunity life-cycle.
Your job is to facilitate sales and lower the barriers to purchasing. The ­greatest 
barriers are the qualifying elements. When qualifying, you are looking for an 
advantage in each element of the sales equation. Your job is to create that 
advantage, and to advance the sales cycle.
Let’s look at each of the elements needed to develop an opportunity.

Trust
I will assume that by now you have developed trust with your customers. If 
not, go back and read the first 12 chapters of this book. Without trust, you are 
generally not going to get the sale.
Compelling Event
Create enough pain for the customers so they need to take ownership of 
their problem. A compelling event is pain with a time element. For example, if 
my car breaks down, the pain is immediate and the time element is acute. After 
all, I need to get to work. If I change jobs and need to move, there is a date 
I need to sell my home by. The customer might have a project that supports 
the opening of a new store. That store will have an opening date. Sometimes, 
the event is more subtle. If you can save the customer with a strong ROI, the 
longer they wait, the more they lose or the less they gain.
There are three types of pain: latent pain, admitted pain, and actively looking 
for a solution to the pain. Latent pain is pain customers are living with. They 
might not even know they have certain issues. Or, they realize that they have 
an issue, but they do not think there a solution, or a cost effective way to solve 
the problem. It is up the salesperson to either educate the customer or help 
the customer realize they have a specific issue.
Again, the IT field offers good examples of customers living with latent pain 
they do not know they have. The main function of the IT department is to pro-
vide computing services to the company, so employees can more efficiently 
complete their jobs. In IT, customers complain when things change. When they 
are steady state, or status quo, there is no complaint.
I used to run sales reports all the time, and most of them would take between 
20–40 minutes to run. The first time I ran the reports, I asked a colleague if 
this was normal, and he said it’s always been that way. So, I never mentioned 
the issue to the IT department. If the reports suddenly took over an hour, 

Trust-Based Selling
129
most likely I would then complain. The latent pain here is that the business is 
running inefficiently due to poor-performing applications provided by the IT 
department. One of two things could be going on here.
1.	 The IT department is unaware of the reporting issue.
2.	 They are aware, but do not think there is a solution or a 
cost-effective solution.
The second level of pain is when customers know they have a problem. 
They know there is a solution, but they are not ready to look for a solution. 
Remember our home buyer from the sales cycle discussion? This is the type 
of pain he had. He knew his house was too small, and he knew his commute 
was too long, but for a variety of reasons he was not ready to look for a 
new home. Typically, the customer is one compelling event away from taking 
action.
The last level of pain is when the customer knows of the issue and is actively 
looking for a solution. You know the customer is at this level when you call 
them, or they call you, and say, “We are looking to fix that problem as we 
speak, and we are ready for a solution. Can you quote us, or send us a pro-
posal? Here are the specifications we are looking for.”
When you ask most salespeople what is the best type of pain, they usually 
will answer the latter situation—where customers are looking for a solu-
tion. After all, they are ready to buy. However, the best pain you can uncover 
is latent pain. When you educate a customer on an issue, or a better way of 
doing something, you are setting the decision criteria for the sale. The win-
dow of opportunity is wide open. The second level of pain requires that you 
have perfect timing: a compelling event happens, and the customer has not 
discussed it with other venders. The window of opportunity is very narrow. 
If you engage a customer after they have started to investigate solutions, you 
most likely are too late.
The biggest impact you can have is therefore with latent pain.
When you establish trust outside the opportunity, you are increasing your 
chances of winning opportunities in three ways.
When there is a real opportunity, you have enough trust 
• 
to compete against the incumbent.
You spend time with the customer, broadening the win-
• 
dow of opportunity.
You get the chance to educate the customer and find 
• 
pains they have not addressed (latent pains).

Chapter 13 | Qualif ying and Developing Opportunity 
130
When developing the sales cycle, I mentioned that customers will live with 
pain. When you’re spending time with the customer, you have the opportunity 
to expand the pain in a situation until they realize they have to act. When your 
customer complains about a stubbed toe, you make them feel as if it’s more 
like a broken leg. Your goal is to expand the pain to the point where the 
customer thinks, “Wow, this is a big problem. I need to do something about it.”
The second, and maybe even more important, reason to spend time with 
customers is that when a compelling event happens, you want to be there to 
capitalize on it. You want to be the first person the customer talks to after 
they experience this event. You create great timing by spending more time 
with the customer.
Business pain comes in many forms—high cost, low revenue, or huge risks. 
Are your customers struggling to generate revenue; do they need to reduce 
costs; or is there a regulatory issue that needs to be solved? When diving into 
pain, you want to assign a value to it. What is the cost of not solving the prob-
lem at hand, either in lost revenue or low financial efficiency? You should ask 
“quantity” questions, such as “How much? How many? How often?”
Example
You have a meeting with a doctor, and you are trying to get him to realize 
how much of a problem he has. Right now, the doctor is in a status quo state. 
“Everything is great,” he says. He’s an “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” kind of guy. 
If the salesperson walks into the room and says, “You can save time using our 
procedure in your office, and the profit is the same,” this doctor will not con-
nect all the dots. You need to connect the dots for him. Although the customers 
must draw their own conclusion that they have a problem they need to solve, it 
is much more effective if you guide them there.
Consider a different example, where the a salesperson is attempting to sell to 
a doctor a solution that enables him to perform a procedure in his own office 
versus the way he is performing the procedure today, in a hospital. This is a 
classic example of a salesperson pointing out a pain the doctor does not even 
know he has. It’s a latent pain.
The salesperson starts with, “Doctor these procedures we are talking about, 
how many of these do you do a week?”
“Well let’s see. I would say three a week,” he replies.
“And are these done in your office?”
“No, they are done under general anesthesia, so we perform them at the 
hospital.”
“How much do you make from each procedure?”

Trust-Based Selling
131
He lists the price and the costs. “Well we charge $2,200 for the procedure, 
but the cost from the hospital and for the anesthesia is about $1,500, so we 
make about $700 per procedure.”
“Not bad for an hour of work. Can I ask you how long you are actually out of 
the office per procedure?”
“For this procedure, I try to do these all in one afternoon. So, when I have 
three, I am out all afternoon on Tuesday.”
The salesperson starts doing the math, “So, on average you are making 
$2,100 per afternoon of surgery. How many office visits can you do in an 
afternoon?”
“We do about approximately 5-6 clients an hour over four hours, so 20-25 
patients in an afternoon.”
“At about $90 per visit, plus miscellaneous lab tests, and so on. You are looking 
at about $150 per visit?”
He replies, “Yes that’s about right.”
The salesperson says, “So in an afternoon, at 20 patients, you are grossing 
$3,000?”
The doctor is starting to get the picture that he is actually losing money when 
operating. He asks the salesperson, “How long does your procedure in the 
office take?”
Sometimes customers in the status quo stage need to understand that there 
is a problem. When it comes to the business, it is always about the numbers. 
However, there is also a personal side to pain.
How does this issue personally affect the person? If you can get to the per-
sonal or emotional level, you win.
Example
While training a class on selling 101, I asked if anyone had the chance to bring 
a customer to personal pain. One person raised her hand, “Yes, I have.”
“Well, how did it go?”
The student explained, “I was talking to the customer about software to help 
them save time. I ask how this person spent their time during the day. The 
customer started listing all their responsibilities. I then asked him how much 
time each of these activities took. What happens if they do not get done? I was 
trying to get to the crucial activities. Without going into detail I was able to get 
the person to admit they worked more than 60 hours a week. Remembering 

Chapter 13 | Qualif ying and Developing Opportunity 
132
part of our earlier conversation (he had just moved to the area), I asked him 
how he found time to meet anyone. Almost in tears, he replied, ‘I have no 
life, I have no time to meet anyone.’ At that moment I was his number one 
salesperson.”
I asked, “Well did you get the deal?”
“Within a week!”
“What is a typical sales cycle?”
“Four months at a minimum.”
This is an extreme example, but powerful. The salesperson got very quickly to 
this customer’s personal pain. His current way of doing things was ruining his 
personal life. This leads to the second that reason latent pain is so important. 
The salesperson makes the customer aware of an issue, and thus becomes a 
caring, trusted salesperson. Intent levels go through the roof.
Value
Value is the logic behind the emotional decision. If there is enough pain, the 
customer will find the money. I don’t have a budget for a new car, but if the 
transmission in my current car suddenly drops out, I’ll find that money some-
where. Money can also be thought of as value. If your solution can provide the 
customer with significant cost savings or generate more revenue than the cost 
of the solution, the customer will buy. Is there a return on their investment? 
Once they agree they have an issue, and that your solution can fix that issue, 
you must show them the value of the investment.
Every company has a concept called the hurdle rate. Hurdle rate is the level of 
ROI at which the company will purchase or develop a project. Ask your cus-
tomer if they know their company’s hurdle rate. The individual might not even 
know the term. If they don’t, explain it to them. The hurdle rate is the required 
rate of return. It is a more detailed ROI analysis that takes into account cash 
flow, capital costs, and risk analysis. In layman’s terms, it answers the question, 
“Does it make financial sense to purchase this product?”
It will cause customers to go to their finance departments and ask if they 
have a hurdle rate. If they do, you may have just opened up a whole new 
world for your customer. Obviously, you have to believe and demonstrate 
to the customer that your solution does exceed this hurdle rate. Your trust 

Trust-Based Selling
133
is then improved around capability and results. You are more than a product 
person—you are business savvy.
When you’re trying to uncover pain, many of the questions you ask are quan-
tity questions, such as with the doctor example. When you ask how much, 
how many, how long, and so on, you are gathering data to support the value of 
the solution you will eventually present. Your goal is to figure out how much a 
problem is costing the customer, as well as how much you can help him save 
or make. Show customers how much it will cost them if they do not act.
Power
Getting a “yes” from power—someone who can make purchasing decisions—
requires that the power buyer has enough pain and has the budget to solve 
the problem. If your solution does not alleviate the power buyer’s pain, you 
do not have a chance.
Remember that everyone has different pains they are trying to ease over. You 
may be engaged with a person who is trying to solve a problem, like reports 
are taking too long, and that person is having to work through lunch to get 
his job done. However, the person that makes the purchasing decision might 
not care that your contact is working extra hours. She might start to care if 
the reports are missing critical deadlines to the business. So, you must, at a 
minimum, understand the pain points of the person(s) making the purchasing 
decisions. Ideally, you want access to power, so you can uncover the pain first 
hand, and help expand it for that person.
One of the most difficult challenges is how to get a meeting with the person 
of power. There are three avenues.
• 
Start at power.  We have discussed this concept a few 
times. If you start at power, you will have easier access to 
power in the future. Your initial primary point of contact 
does not need to be power, but it’s best to get to your 
primary point of contact via power.
• 
Bargain your way to power.  Along the sales cycle, your 
customer will ask you for information, for demos, or for 
evaluations. They will ask for something. Use this as a tool 
to bargain for access to power. “Yes I will run a demo, 
or show you a formal ROI, but if I do, can you get me an 
appointment with__________?”

Chapter 13 | Qualif ying and Developing Opportunity 
134
• 
Gain secondhand access. Unfortunately, the business climate 
has changed over the last 10 years. Secondhand access 
to power is becoming more and more common. And, 
being new, this may be where you operate until you earn 
more trust. If you do not start with power, your access to 
power may be blocked. You need to work through your 
main contact. However, you need to make sure you know 
what their boss will require in a solution, and what pains 
they are trying to solve. If you have your contact propos-
ing your solution to power, help them develop the mes-
sage to their boss.
Decision Process
Before you start the evaluation stage, and start jumping through hoops, be 
sure that you understand the decision process. What do they want to see in 
a demo, and why? Who is involved with the demo? How is money budgeted? 
What is the decision process, and what is the procurement process? If you 
are reacting to every customer demand and request without knowing the 
steps you need to win the business, you are functioning on hope. Understand 
all the steps necessary to close business up front. Once you know all the 
steps, you can keep yourself and your customer on track to close the order. 
Always be aware of the next step. Trusted salespeople can move deals along.  
The customer will have fluctuating concerns throughout the buying cycle. 
While you must align with these concerns, you must also continue to bring to 
the forefront why they are working on this process. They have an issue; you 
are just trying to help them solve it. If you keep the customer focused on the 
pain, the time-sensitive, compelling event will move the process along.
Controlling this process can demonstrate more business trust than any other 
portion of the sale. First, understand every step. Then, take ownership of the 
customer’s problem. Show dedication to getting that problem solved. This 
involves holding the customer accountable for their portion of getting the 
deal done. Move your customer along; always keep them going to the next 
steps you define together. As you learn more about your customer’s decision 
process over time, you can take complete control of this process. A trusted 
advisor can sometimes know the customer’s process better than the customer. 
At this point, not only is trust strong, but the customer begins to rely on the 
salesperson to help him get things done.
Now that I have addressed the most important aspects of managing an oppor-
tunity, it’s time to discuss how to track and report on them.

Trust-Based Selling
135
Forecasting
Accurate forecasting should be a simple process. I also believe any adminis-
trative work a salesperson has to accomplish should also be a tool in helping 
them close business. All too often, forecasting becomes a chore that has to be 
done, and since it’s a chore, minimal effort is put forth. Therefore, the forecast 
is inaccurate. If you can use forecasting as a tool to drive business, you’ll try 
harder, and more accurate forecasting will be the result.
This discussion is meant to be a guideline for creating a forecasting system. 
Some companies have three levels of commitment, and some have four. I am 
using the more simple three levels.
Pipeline—Something held in forecast as a placeholder.
• 
Upside—There is a clear path to closed business, but not 
• 
all the elements of the sales equation are satisfied.
Commit—Each element of the sales equation is satisfied. 
• 
A purchase order is imminent.
The age-old challenge is how to create accurate forecasts. It’s as simple as 
asking four questions of your existing customers, and five questions of new 
customers.
If the answers to all four or five questions are yes, then the opportunity is 
a commit. If there are three or four yeses, then it’s an upside. Anything less 
makes it a pipeline opportunity. It’s the sales equation!
The first four questions are opportunity based:
Does the compelling event land inside your forecast 
• 
window?
Do you have a yes from power?
• 
Does the customer see value? Or, is there an ROI showing 
• 
value?
Does the decision and purchase process put you inside 
• 
the forecast window?
For new customers, there is one additional question.
Have you made a conscious effort to address each of 
• 
the trust elements? You can’t determine whether the cus-
tomer trusts you, you can only know what actions you 
have taken.
The good news is you should be working only on deals that you have a great 
chance to close. You should be in upside with any deal that enters into the 
evaluation stage, because you can have most of these elements checked off.

Chapter 13 | Qualif ying and Developing Opportunity 
136
Is there a compelling event? If not, why are you and the 
• 
customer wasting time?
Do you understand the decision and purchase processes 
• 
before evaluation?
Does the customer see value? He should. The evaluation 
• 
stage is about demonstrating that you can deliver the 
value you promised.
Can you get a yes from power? This is really the only item 
• 
left for a commitment.
Lastly, you should have developed a certain level of trust 
• 
before you enter into opportunity discussions.
I like this method because it helps you close the deal. It tells you and manage-
ment exactly what needs to be done to close the deal. If the answer is no to 
any of the questions above, you need to get a yes. So, a no helps you define 
what is the next step in the sales effort. If there is no compelling event, can 
you create one? If you don’t understand the decision process, or it’s beyond 
the forecast window, can you change it?
The missing element from most forecasting methods is time. Each of these 
questions needs to be posed against a timeframe. You might have everything in 
place, but the decision process puts the deal into the next quarter. Well, that’s 
a “no” for that question in this quarter, but a “yes” in the next. Is there a chance 
that the decision process can be accelerated into this quarter? If yes, keep it 
upside, if no, it becomes a commit for the following quarter. This method allows 
you to be more accurate beyond your immediate month or quarter.
Lastly, do not inflate forecasts! Work on improving your odds of winning. Do 
not waste time managing deals that you have very little chance of closing.
Summary
Know the sales equation. It is the map you need to control the sales cycle. It 
is the tool you need to forecast accurately. When dealing with new customers, 
ensure you are inspecting for trust on each deal. Even though there are many 
sales processes out there, my suggestion is that you add the element of trust 
to it. If you do not have a process in place, you can download a simple sales 
process worksheet from my website at www.huntingwithtrust.com.
We have now completed building trust with a a new customer, and managing 
opportunities while keeping trust in the forefront of your mind. In order to do 
this, we started in the most difficult place—a new customer with no establish 
trust. In the next chapter we will look at trust from the incumbents point of 
view and discuss strategies for keeping your customer, by defending against 
your competition.

A Summary
We have discussed at length how trust progresses through a sales cycle. In 
order to develop this concept, I concentrated on the toughest starting posi-
tion, when you are new to the account. But, you need to consider trust with 
existing customers as well. The discussion of the incumbent defending against 
a new competitor for an account will serve as a good summary of the book.
We showed that customers place more importance on relationship after the 
sale. However most salespeople move on to look for new customers after the 
sale is made. This is foolish for two reasons.
It is much easier to sell to an existing customer—you have earned the cus-
tomer’s trust, therefore shortening future sales cycles. You don’t have to 
spend time trying to get your first appointment, and your access to the 
account should be much easier. Once you enter into the needs analysis phase, 
your customer will open up to you more, because they already trust you. 
Evaluations of additional services or products might not be as extensive as 
the first one you did. And, you probably have better access to power than you 
first during your first sales cycle.
Secondly, without continued contact with the customer, you open the door to 
a competing solution, and you risk losing the customer altogether.
When discussing the uphill battle you had when trying to displace the incum-
bent, one of the major themes was, “we have a guy for that.” Now you are “the 
guy.” Customers are living in the status quo once again, meaning they really 
do not want to work with new salespeople. They would rather work future 
opportunities with an account manager they already trust. Since you have 
gone through a sales cycle, you should have established trust, right up through 
the most difficult trust element: proven results. You are now the incumbent!

Chapter 14 | Defense 
138
Traps to Avoid
You have earned customer trust, and customers now place more value on 
your relationship—even more than they did through your sales cycle. It is 
easier to win new business, and it should be easy to keep competition out. 
Then the question becomes, why do so many salespeople neglect existing 
customer, and move on to the trap of chasing opportunities? There are many 
reasons, but they mostly fall into the following categories.
1.	 You have a quota to make, and your sale to this customer is 
done. You need to move on to the next opportunity or 
customer. This may seem to make sense. For instance, 
you have one product, and the buy cycle for this product 
is once every few years. In other words, you don’t have 
anything to sell the customer right now.
2.	 You have other products you can sell the customer, but you 
may not be comfortable with the messaging of that particular 
line of products. When salespeople have multiple types of 
products on their line card, they tend to have a great 
comfort level selling one category of products. Getting 
out of the comfort zone is not appealing to you.
3.	 You’re afraid the customer might have a problem or issue. 
This is one of the major reasons salespeople list when 
asked why they don’t follow up with existing customer. 
If they call the customer, and she has a problem with the 
product or service, it will mean more work to fix the 
problem. That leads into the last reason.
4.	 You are lazy. We will not spend time on this one, because 
only you can fix this issue.
Let’s address these one at a time, and show you why it is foolish to use these 
as excuses.
Starting with the first reason—you don’t have anything else to sell the cus-
tomer, or you are on to the next sales, or both—you should stay in touch with 
the customer for many reasons. Even if you don’t plan on staying with your 
existing company for that long.
Remember, what is important to the customer in their buying decision is 
you, then company, then product. So continue to reinvest in “you.” Build your 
brand with the customer. Do not become the rep who the customer per-
ceives as only showing up when a deal is on the table. Besides, you never 
know when a new opportunity will crop up. Maybe the customer is launching 
a new division needing your products. That’s why one of the major strategies 
you must use is to develop a relationship, and continue to develop it, before 

Trust-Based Selling
139
there is an opportunity. So, you need continue to build trust in the customer 
status quo phase. You are in a position of strength, because you only need to 
maintain trust, while a competitor has to work tirelessly to try to establish 
it. Bottom line: Put as much importance on the post-sale relationship as your 
customer does.
The next excuse: You are not comfortable selling other solutions your com-
pany has to offer. My answer to that is—so what? As I mentioned above, your 
customer would rather deal with existing salespeople and companies. Even if 
you are not comfortable with additional offerings, you should remain focused 
on customer needs anyway. This will be much easier the second or third sales 
cycle with a customer. You already have established trust, and most likely with 
this trust the customer will share more with you about their issues.
The new salesperson calling into the account is an annoyance, while you are 
welcomed. Do not be afraid of not fully understanding a new product your 
company is offering. Your customer is more concerned about their needs, not 
your solution. Remember that capability is a team effort. You maintain com-
munication with the customer and use company resources to fill in knowledge 
gaps as necessary.
Lastly, do not be afraid of results. If the results of your solution have not been 
realized by the customer, then your first sales cycle is not done. It is not done 
until the customer gets the results they are looking for. Your goal is to keep 
the trust meter full. A new competitor will try to exploit areas where your 
trust might be weak. The greatest advantage you have are the results you have 
delivered. Make sure you measure the results and make sure you don’t stop 
until results are delivered as promised.
The most important word in the previous sentence is “measured.” Your goal is to show the customer 
that you deliver as promised. It covers all aspects of the trust meter.
The Value of Problems
The best salespeople hope there is a problem with their customers. That is 
not a typo. Ask yourself about any customer service issue you have had. If the 
seller ran and hid, what was your satisfaction level? If the seller stepped up and 
fixed the problem, what was your satisfaction level? I bet it was better than if 
the solution just worked and you never engaged with the salesperson again? 
How do you feel when you get a courtesy call asking if you are satisfied? I bet 
pretty pleased. It is no different in B2B sales. You are dealing with people.
Last question, have you ever had a seller call you and say they noticed there 
was an issue, and they are calling you to help resolve it, even before you called 
them? Example: Have you ever been called about a possible fraudulent charge 

Chapter 14 | Defense 
140
on a credit card? The bank calls you and says, “we noticed some suspicious 
activity on your account.” How, do you feel when you get that call? I bet it’s, 
“wow, they have my back.” Even if they did not cause the issue, they are help-
ing to resolve it. That’s powerful. Or, you get a car recall notice in the mail. 
Your initial reaction might be, “what a hassle.” But, once the issue is fixed, for 
free, you are more confident in the car and the dealer that helped you.
Imagine you walk into an existing customer, and say, “we just went over some 
data with your team, and I noticed that our solution is not working quite as 
well as we promised. However, we are working on identifying the issue, and 
we won’t stop until you are satisfied.” You will have a customer for life. So, do 
not be afraid of bad results.
One of my favorite quotes is this: “Where there is a problem, there is an opportunity.”
You must look at it from the customer’s point of view. Your customers are 
emotionally committed to you and your solution. After all, the decision to 
purchase your product is a reflection of their due diligence. Once they have 
signed on the dotted line, you are more a partner than a vendor. If they have a 
problem, they will work with you to protect their image. If their purchase was 
large, their job may be at stake, so do not let them down.
Block the Competition
How do you do this? We just discussed it. Stay active with your customer.
The challenger to your incumbency is going to do one of two things.
• 
The challenger will build relationship before opportunity. Make 
this difficult by not letting the customer think they should 
entertain another vendor in your market segment.
• 
The challenger will try to penetrate the account by selling a 
niche solution. Figure 14-1 shows how the incumbent is 
using trust to gain access to your account.

Trust-Based Selling
141
You may not be able to protect the far right of defensive line, but don’t let the 
competition exploit you on the left. If you maintain the relationship, no addi-
tional feature on their solution will unseat you. And, most importantly, don’t 
let your competition share with the customer a feature of your own product 
you have not shared with your customer. Imagine walking into an account, and 
they say they just purchased from your competition because their solution 
could do X, and yours could not. However, your solution actually can do X; 
you just never educated the customer about the feature.
Never forget: Customers buy because they have an issue. Your customer had 
an issue that could have been resolved by utilizing a feature on a solution they 
already own. That’s why you need to maintain the relationship—to continue 
educating the customer and continue to provide value and continue to ensure 
the problem is solved! Once the customer has bought from another company 
based on a problem you could have solved, you are back to square one in the 
trust game.
If the competition has a niche product outside your market segment, there 
may not be much you can do. However, if they have a niche in your segment, 
be aware of it and help educate the customer about ways you can do what the 
niche is trying to do. At a minimum, the customer will view you as informed 
(capability), and dedicated.

Summary
Whether you are trying to penetrate a new account, or you are the incum-
bent, use trust in your selling strategies. All too often we fall into the trap 
that the solution/product is the main differentiator, when in fact it’s the last 
thing the customer bases their purchasing decision on. While trust is not the 
only thing, without it there is no sale. Systematically think through how your 
customer perceives your relationship.
I believe in this book we have built a foundation and an understanding of trust, 
so you can systematically build and maintain trusted business relationships 
with your customers.
I hope you see that my intention was to help you, not to sell you something. 
My goal was to help you understand and put to use the capabilities and dedica-
tion you need to succeed in sales. I hope you produce the results you desire.
