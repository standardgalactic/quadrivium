Introduction
The A+ certification program was developed by the Computing Technology Industry 
Association (CompTIA) to provide an industry-wide means of certifying the competency 
of computer service technicians. The A+ certification is granted to those who have attained 
the level of knowledge and troubleshooting skills that are needed to provide capable sup-
port in the field of personal computers. CompTIA is a widely respected industry leader in 
this area.
CompTIA’s A+ exam objectives are periodically updated to keep the certification 
applicable to the most recent hardware and software. This is necessary because a tech-
nician must be able to work on the latest equipment. The most recent revisions to the 
objectives—and to the whole program—were introduced in 2015 and are reflected in this 
book.
This book and the Sybex CompTIA A+ Complete Study Guide (both the Standard and 
Deluxe Editions) are tools to help you prepare for this certification—and for the new areas 
of focus of a modern computer technician’s job.
What Is A+ Certification?
The A+ certification program was created to offer a wide-ranging certification, in the sense 
that it’s intended to certify competence with personal computers from many different mak-
ers/vendors. Everyone must take and pass two exams: 220-901 and 220-902.
You don’t have to take the 220-901 exam and the 220-902 exam at the same time. 
The A+ certification isn’t awarded until you’ve passed both tests. For the latest pricing 
on the exams and updates to the registration procedures, call Pearson VUE at (877) 
551-7587. You can also go to Pearson VUE for additional information or to register 
online at www.pearsonvue.com/comptia. If you have further questions about the scope 
of the exams or related CompTIA programs, refer to the CompTIA website at  
www.comptia.org.
Who Should Buy This Book?
If you want to acquire a solid foundation in personal-computer basics and your goal is 
to prepare for the exams by filling in any gaps in your knowledge, this book is for you. 
You’ll find clear explanations of the concepts you need to grasp and plenty of help to 
achieve the high level of professional competency you need in order to succeed in your 
chosen field.
If you want to become certified as an A+ holder, this book is definitely what you need. 
However, if you just want to attempt to pass the exam without really understanding the 
basics of personal computers, this guide isn’t for you. It’s written for people who want to 
acquire skills and knowledge of personal-computer basics.

 Tips for Taking the A+ Exams 
 Here are some general tips for taking your exams successfully: 
 
■
 Bring two forms of ID with you. One must be a photo ID, such as a driver’s license. 
The other can be a major credit card or a passport. Both forms must include a 
signature. 

xviii 
Introduction  
■
■
Arrive early at the exam center so you can relax and review your study materials, par-
ticularly tables and lists of exam-related information.
■
■
Read the questions carefully. Don’t be tempted to jump to an early conclusion. Make 
sure you know exactly what the question is asking.
■
■
Don’t leave any unanswered questions. Unanswered questions are scored against you.
■
■
There will be questions with multiple correct responses. When there is more than 
one correct answer, a message at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to either 
“Choose two” or “Choose all that apply.” Be sure to read the messages displayed to 
know how many correct answers you must choose.
■
■
When answering multiple-choice questions you’re not sure about, use a process of elim-
ination to get rid of the obviously incorrect answers first. Doing so will improve your 
odds if you need to make an educated guess.
■
■
On form-based tests (nonadaptive), because the hard questions will eat up the most 
time, save them for last. You can move forward and backward through the exam.
■
■
For the latest pricing on the exams and updates to the registration procedures, visit 
CompTIA’s website at www.comptia.org.
Performance-Based Questions
CompTIA has introduced performance-based questions on the latest A+ exams. These 
are not the traditional multiple-choice questions with which you’re probably familiar. 
These questions require the candidate to know how to perform a specific task or series of 
tasks. More than likely the candidate will be presented with a scenario and will be asked 
to complete a task. They will be taken to a simulated environment where they will have to 
perform a series of steps and will be graded on how well they complete the task.
CompTIA A+ 900 Series Exam Objectives
CompTIA goes to great lengths to ensure that its certification programs accurately reflect 
the IT industry’s best practices. The company does this by establishing Cornerstone 
Committees for each of its exam programs. Each committee comprises a small group of IT 
professionals, training providers, and publishers who are responsible for establishing the 
exam’s baseline competency level and who determine the appropriate target audience level.
Once these factors are determined, CompTIA shares this information with a group 
of hand-selected subject-matter experts (SMEs). These folks are the true brainpower 
behind the certification program. They review the committee’s findings, refine them, and 
shape them into the objectives you see before you. CompTIA calls this process a Job Task 
Analysis (JTA).
Finally, CompTIA conducts a survey to ensure that the objectives and weightings 
truly reflect the job requirements. Only then can the SMEs go to work writing the 

Introduction 
xix
hundreds of questions needed for the exam. And, in many cases, they have to go back 
to the drawing board for further refi nements before the exam is ready to go live in its 
fi nal state. So, rest assured, the content you’re about to learn will serve you long after 
you take the exam.  
 Exam objectives are subject to change at any time without prior notice 
and at CompTIA’s sole discretion. Please visit the certification page of 
CompTIA’s website at  www.comptia.org for the most current listing of 
exam objectives. 
 CompTIA also publishes relative weightings for each of the exam’s objectives. The 
following tables list the objective domains and the extent to which they’re represented on 
each exam.

Introduction  
5.5 Given a scenario, explain the troubleshooting theory. 
■
■
Always consider corporate policies, procedures, and impacts before implementing 
changes.
1.	
Identify the problem
■
■
Question the user and identify user changes to computer and perform backups 
before making changes
2.	
Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious)
■
■
If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on symptoms
3.	
Test the theory to determine cause
■
■
Once theory is confirmed, determine next steps to resolve problem
■
■
If theory is not confirmed, re-establish new theory or escalate
4.	
Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
5.	
Verify full system functionality and if applicable implement preventive measures
6.	
Document findings, actions, and outcomes

This chapter will focus on the exam topics related to PC hard-
ware. It will follow the structure of the CompTIA A+ 220-901 
exam blueprint, objective 1, and it will explore the  
15 subobjectives that you will need to master before taking the exam.
1.1 Given a Scenario, Configure Settings 
and Use BIOS/UEFI Tools on a PC
PCs and other devices that use an operating system usually also contain firmware that pro-
vides low-level instructions to the device even in the absence of an operating system. This 
firmware, called either the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or the Unified Extensible 
Firmware Interface (UEFI), contains settings that can be manipulated as well as diagnostic 
utilities that can be used to monitor the device. This section discusses those settings and 
utilities. The topics addressed in objective 1.1 include the following:
■
■
Firmware upgrades—flash BIOS
■
■
BIOS component information
■
■
BIOS configurations

Firmware Upgrades—Flash BIOS
Computer BIOSs don’t go bad; they just become out of date or contain bugs. In the case of 
a bug, an upgrade will correct the problem. An upgrade may also be necessary when the 
BIOS doesn’t support some component that you would like to install—a larger hard drive 
or a different type of processor, for instance.
Most of today’s BIOSs are written to an electrically erasable programmable read-only 
memory (EEPROM) chip and can be updated through the use of software. Each manu-
facturer has its own method for accomplishing this. Check out the documentation for 
complete details. Regardless of the exact procedure, the process is referred to as flashing

the BIOS. It means the old instructions are erased from the EEPROM chip and the new 
instructions are written to the chip.
UEFI is a standard firmware interface for PCs, designed to replace BIOS. Some 
advantages of UEFI include the following:
■
■
Better security, which protects the pre-boot process
■
■
Faster startup times and resuming from hibernation
■
■
Support for drives larger than 2.2 TB
■
■
Support for 64-bit firmware device drivers
■
■
Capability to use BIOS with UEFI hardware
UEFI can also be updated by using an update utility from the motherboard vendor. In 
many cases, the steps are as follows:
1.	
Download the update file to a flash drive.
2.	
Insert the flash drive and reboot the machine.
3.	
Use the specified key sequence to enter the BIOS settings.
4.	
If necessary, disable secure boot.
5.	
Save the changes and reboot.
6.	
Reenter the BIOS settings.
7.	
Choose boot options, and boot from the flash drive.
8.	
Follow the specific directions with the update to locate the upgrade file on the flash drive.
9.	
Execute the file (usually by typing flash).
10.	 While the update is completing, ensure you maintain power to the device.
BIOS Component
At startup, the BIOS will attempt to detect the devices and components at its disposal. The 
information that it gathers, along with the current state of the components, will be avail-
able for review in the BIOS settings. Some of the components and the types of information 
available with respect to these devices and components are covered in this section.
You can view and adjust a computer’s base-level settings through the CMOS Setup program, 
which you access by pressing a certain key at startup, such as F1 or Delete (depending on the 
system). The most common settings to adjust in CMOS include port settings (parallel, serial, 
USB), drive types, boot sequence, date and time, and virus/security protections. The variable 
settings that are made through the CMOS Setup program are stored in nonvolatile random 
access memory (NVRAM), while the base instructions that cannot be changed (the BIOS) are 
stored on an EEPROM chip. NVRAM is memory that does not lose its content when power is 
lost to the machine. Figure 1.1 shows an example of NVRAM on a motherboard.

10 
Chapter 1 ■ Hardware
 F I g u r E   1.1   NVRAM 
 RAM 
 Most systems today detect the random access memory (RAM) amount and speed auto-
matically. Some motherboards can use different types of RAM, such as parity and non-
parity, or different speeds, and the CMOS Setup program may provide the opportunity 
to change those settings. Increasingly, however, RAM settings are becoming a read-only 
part of CMOS Setup programs because the system will detect additional memory added 
or a change in memory type. This does not preclude you from ensuring you are installing 
the correct type of memory for the system.  
 Hard Drive 
 Some CMOS Setup programs have a feature that polls the IDE channels and provides infor-
mation about the IDE devices attached to them. You can use this feature to gather the set-
tings for a hard disk. However, most hard disks these days are fully Plug and Play, so they 
automatically report themselves to the CMOS Setup. 
 Hard drives can be autodetected by most systems if the IDE setting is set to Auto. 
The settings detected may include the drive’s capacity; its geometry, meaning cylinders, 
heads, and sectors (CHS); and its preferred programmed input/output (PIO), direct 
memory access (DMA), or UltraDMA operating mode. You can also confi gure a hard 
drive by entering its CHS values manually, but doing so is almost never necessary 
anymore.  
 CHS is also called the  drive geometry because together these three 
numbers determine how much data the disk can hold. Most CMOS Setup 
programs are able to automatically detect the CHS values. 

1.1 Given a Scenario, Configure Settings and Use BIOS/UEFI Tools on a PC 
11  
Optical Drive
Optical drives, such as CD, CD-R, CD-RW, and DVD players, are also detected and 
reported by the BIOS. You can even set the computer to boot from one of these drives if 
desired (see the section “Boot Sequence” later in this chapter). When you do that, in most 
cases the drives will be listed as CD-ROM or CD-ROM/DVD.
CPU
In most modern systems, the BIOS detects the CPU type and speed automatically, so any 
CPU settings in CMOS Setup are likely to be read-only. Most operating systems provide 
utilities for gathering information about the CPU in the computer, but if the computer will 
not boot or there is no operating system, then viewing the CPU information in the BIOS 
can be a valuable option.
BIOS Configurations
When any of the changes listed in the following section are made to any of the BIOS 
configurations, it is important that the program be exited properly to save the changes. The 
CMOS Setup program includes an Exit command, with options that include Save Changes 
and Discard Changes. In most programs, Esc is a shortcut for exiting and discarding 
changes, and F10 is a common shortcut for exiting and saving changes.
Boot Sequence
Each system has a default boot order, which is the order in which it checks the drives 
for a valid operating system to which it can boot. Usually, this order is set for the 
hard disk and then CD-ROM, but these components can be placed in any boot order. 
For example, you might set CD-ROM first to boot from a Windows 7 Setup disk on a 
system that already contains an operating system. If you receive an error message when 
booting, always check the CD-ROM, and if a nonsystem disk is present, remove it and 
reboot.
Enabling and Disabling Devices
In CMOS Setup, you can enable or disable integrated components, such as built-in video 
cards, sound cards, or network cards. You may disable them in order to replace them with 
different models on expansion boards, for example.
You can also disable the onboard I/O ports for the motherboard, including parallel, 
serial, and USB. Depending on the utility, there may also be settings that enable or disable 
USB keyboard usage, Wake on LAN, or other special features.
In addition to enabling or disabling legacy parallel ports, you can assign an operational 
mode to the port. Table 1.1 lists the common modes for a parallel port. When you’re 
troubleshooting parallel port problems, sometimes trying a different mode will help. 
Some legacy systems do not allow onboard devices to be disabled. If this is the case, if an 
onboard device fails, the entire motherboard may need to be replaced.

Date/Time
One of the most basic things you can change in CMOS Setup is the system date and time. 
You can also change this from within the operating system. When the PC is not keeping 
correct time or date when turned off, it is usually a CMOS battery issue and may include a 
warning that the battery is soon going to die. In the absence of the PC receiving time and 
date updates from a time server such as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, the time 
kept in the CMOS is the time source for the computer.
Clock Speeds
Clock speed is a measurement of the rate at which the clock signal oscillates; it is expressed 
in millions of cycles per second or megahertz. The motherboard must be set to utilize the 
proper clock settings for the CPU installed in the computer. The BIOS usually detects the 
type of CPU and automatically sets the proper timings. In some older systems, you may 
have to use jumpers to set the correct clock speed and CPU.
External Speed (Clock Speed)    The clock speed, or external speed, which is usually 
expressed in megahertz or gigahertz, is the speed at which the motherboard communicates 
with the CPU. It’s determined by the motherboard, and its cadence is set by a quartz crystal 
(the system crystal) that generates regular electrical pulses.
Internal Speed    The internal speed is the maximum speed at which the CPU can perform 
its internal operations. This may be the same as the motherboard’s speed (the external 
speed), but it’s more likely to be a multiple of it. For example, a CPU may have an internal 
speed of 1.3 GHz but an external speed of 133 MHz. That means for every tick of the sys-
tem crystal’s clock, the CPU has 10 internal ticks of its own clock.

1.1 Given a Scenario, Configure Settings and Use BIOS/UEFI Tools on a PC 
13  
When the proper CPU speed is known, you must make sure the relationship between the 
speed of the CPU and that of the motherboard bus is correct. This is done with a value called 
the multiplier. Although the bus speed can also be manipulated, usually it is set to accommo-
date the required speed of the memory to be used, and so it is more likely you will be using 
the multiplier to achieve the proper relationship between the CPU speed and the bus speed.
For example, if you have a processor that has a CPU speed of 1.82 GHz, the proper set-
tings for the BIOS would be a bus speed of 166 MHz and a multiplier of 11 (166 MHz × 11 = 
1.826 GHz). So if the bus needed to be 166 MHz, you would set the multiplier for 11. On the 
other hand, if you changed the bus speed to 332 MHz (just a random example), the closest 
multiplier would be 5.5 to maintain 1.826 GHz (332 MHz × 5.5 = 1.826 GHz). When setting 
the speed of either is required, refer to the documentation from the CPU and motherboard.
Virtualization Support
Many computers, especially servers, host virtual machines (VMs). These are fully functional 
operating systems running in their own environment. In many cases, the motherboard and 
associated BIOS settings need no alteration to provide services to these VMs.
However, some of the newer virtualization products, for example, Microsoft Hyper-V, 
require that the motherboard support hardware-assisted virtualization. This is because in 
these cases the virtualization product is not installed on top of a regular operating system 
but is installed directly on bare metal—that is, as an integral part of the operating system, 
as in Windows Server 2012 R2.
The benefit derived from the virtualization product (also called a hypervisor) using 
hardware-assisted virtualization is it allows the hypervisor to dynamically allocate memory 
and CPU to the VMs as required. When the motherboard and the BIOS support this tech-
nology, you must ensure that it is enabled. Figure 1.2 shows an example of the settings.

BIOS Security
A number of security features are built into most BIOSs. They include BIOS passwords, 
drive encryption, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and LoJack. These items are discussed 
in this section.
BIOS Passwords    In most CMOS Setup programs, you can set a supervisor password. 
Doing so requires a password to be entered in order to use the CMOS Setup program, 
effectively locking out users from making changes to it. You may also be able to set a user 
password, which restricts the PC from booting unless the password is entered.
To reset a forgotten password, you can remove the CMOS battery to reset everything. 
There also may be a Reset jumper on the motherboard.
Drive Encryption    Many operating systems provide the ability to encrypt an entire volume 
or drive, protecting a mobile device’s data in the event of theft. A good example of this is 
BitLocker, which is available in Windows Vista and Windows 7. The drives are encrypted 
with encryption keys, and the proper keys are required to boot the device and access the 
data.
BitLocker can be used with a TPM chip (discussed in the next section), but it is not 
required. When this feature is in effect with no TPM chip, the keys are stored on a USB 
drive that must be presented during startup to allow access to the drives. Without the USB 
drive holding the key, the device will not boot.
TPM Chips    When the device has a TPM chip present on the motherboard, additional 
security and options become available. First the chip contains the keys that unlock the 
drives. When the computer boots, the TPM chip unlocks the drive only after it compares 
hashes of the drive to snapshots of the drive taken earlier. If any changes have been made 
or tampering has been done to the Windows installation, the TPM chip will not unlock the 
drives.
Moreover, you can (and should) combine this with a PIN entered at startup or a key located 
in a USB drive. In this scenario, the computer will not start unless the hashes pass the test 
and the PIN or key is provided.
LoJack    LoJack is a product made by Absolute Software that allows you to remotely 
locate, lock, and delete the data on a mobile device when it is stolen. It is a small piece of 
software that embeds itself on the computer and is difficult to detect. Once activated, it 
stays in contact with a monitoring center, allowing you to send the commands to lock and 
delete data via the center. Not only can you protect the data in this fashion, but also it will 
gather forensic data that can help to locate the device and aid in its recovery.
Secure Boot    Secure Boot is a standard adopted by many venders that requires the oper-
ating system to check the integrity of all system files before allowing the boot process to 
proceed. By doing so, it protects against the alteration or corruption of these system files. 
As with any emerging technology, issues have already been discovered that can enable a 
hacker to not only bypass Secure Boot but to also change a key value in the settings that 
will “brick” the device (render it useless).

 Built-in Diagnostics 
 Although you may not realize it, every time you start the computer, built-in diagnostics 
are at work. Every computer has a diagnostic program built into its BIOS called the 
power-on self-test (POST). When you turn on the computer, it executes this set of diag-
nostics. Many steps are involved in the POST, but they happen quickly, they’re invisible 
to the user, and they vary among BIOS versions. The steps include checking the CPU, 
checking the RAM, checking for the presence of a video card, and so on. The main 
reason to be aware of the POST’s existence is that if it encounters a problem, the boot 
process stops. Being able to determine at what point the problem occurred can help you 
troubleshoot. 
 One way to determine the source of a problem is to listen for a  beep code . This is a series 
of beeps from the computer’s speaker. The number, duration, and pattern of the beeps 
can sometimes tell you what component is causing the problem. However, the beeps differ 
depending on the BIOS manufacturer and version, so you must look up the beep code in a 
chart for your particular BIOS. Different BIOS manufacturers use the beeping differently. 
AMI BIOS, for example, relies on a raw number of beeps and uses patterns of short and 
long beeps. 
 Another way to determine a problem during the POST routine is to use a  POST 
card . This is a circuit board that fi ts into an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) 
or Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) expansion slot in the motherboard and 
reports numeric codes as the boot process progresses. Each of those codes corresponds 
to a particular component being checked. If the POST card stops at a certain number, 
you can look up that number in the manual that came with the card to determine the 
problem.  
 BIOS Central is a website containing charts detailing the beep codes and 
POST error codes for many different BIOS manufacturers. 
 Monitoring 
 By viewing the information provided in the BIOS, basic monitoring of the many items 
can be done with varying degrees of certainty. It is simply a matter of navigating the 
menu-based BIOS program and locating the proper screen that provides the information. 
Examples are provided in the following sections. 
 Temperature Monitoring 
 Temperature is probably the most important item to monitor. When components like the 
CPU overheat, bad things start to occur, such as repeated reboots. Figure  1.3 shows an 
example of the values for the CPU. Technicians should retain baseline temperatures for 
these items. Baseline temperatures should include idle temperature and load temperature 
baselines. Intel processors run at a cooler temperature than AMD.

Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
F i g u r e   1. 3     Temperature monitoring
Fan Speeds
The speed at which various fans are operating can also be displayed in the BIOS. There can 
be a CPU fan, as well as one or more system fans. (See Figure 1.3.) Programs are available 
that monitor this for you and can send alerts. This is particularly important for servers in a 
data center.
Intrusion Detection/Notification
It is also possible to enable intrusion detection, which will indicate to you whether the 
chassis has been opened. This may be referred to as the chassis intrusion detection or 
possibly the case open status, as shown in Figure 1.3, where this function has been 
disabled.
Voltage
You can also monitor and change the voltage settings in the BIOS. Be cautious in changing 
these settings because improper settings can damage the system or shorten the life of the 
CPU. Possible settings include the following:
■
■
CPU voltage
■
■
Memory voltage, which will typically be 1.5 volts
■
■
Motherboard voltage
■
■
Voltage of the graphics card
These are just a few examples. Figure 1.4 shows an example of these and many more 
voltage settings.

1.1 Given a Scenario, Configure Settings and Use BIOS/UEFI Tools on a PC 
17  
Clock
The CMOS clock is located on the computer’s motherboard and keeps time when the com-
puter is off. The operating system gets its time from the BIOS clock at boot time. This clock 
can be set using the BIOS if it is not correct. Figure 1.5 shows the time setting.
F i g u r e   1. 4    Voltage settings
F i g u r e   1. 5     Clock
Bus Speed
The processor’s ability to communicate with the rest of the system’s components relies on 
the supporting circuitry. Part of the system board’s underlying circuitry is called the bus. 
The computer’s bus moves information into and out of the processor and other devices. 
A bus allows all devices to communicate with one another. The motherboard has several 
buses. The external data bus carries information to and from the CPU and is the fastest 
bus on the system. The address bus typically runs at the same speed as the external data 
bus and carries data to and from RAM. The address bus gives the address to which the 
data should go. The data bus uses the address supplied by the address bus and carries the 
data to the specified location. The PCI, AGP, and ISA interfaces also have their own buses 
with their own widths and speeds. With newer architectures, the system or front-side bus 
(FSB) connects the CPU to the north bridge (or memory) hub. The back-side bus (BSB) con-
nects the CPU with the Level 2 (L2) cache, also called the secondary or external cache. The 
memory bus connects the north bridge (or memory) hub to RAM.
The bus speed, like the CPU speed, can also be set. (See the section on the relationship 
between the bus speed, the CPU speed, and the multiplier in the section “Clock Speeds.”) 
Usually, this should be left alone because it is normally set to a setting proper for the 
memory, but it can be changed. In many systems, this must be done with jumpers on the 
motherboard.

Exam Essentials
Flash the BIOS or UEFI.    Understand the process for upgrading the BIOS or UEFI as the 
case may be. This usually involves running a program from the BIOS vendor that erases the 
instructions from the EEPROM chip and writes the new instructions to the same chip.
Identify components reported in the BIOS.    These include RAM, hard drives, optical 
drives, and the CPU. Information is listed for each, and changes can be made to selected 
settings for each component.
Describe available BIOS configurations.    The settings that can be made using the BIOS 
include the boot sequence, the enabling and disabling of devices, setting the date and time, 
adjusting clock speeds, enabling and disabling virtualization features if supported, and set-
ting BIOS passwords.
Identify built-in diagnostic tools in the BIOS.    The power-on self-test is the most impor-
tant diagnostic testing that occurs. It runs every time the PC is started and will report—
either with a displayed error message or with beep tones—any problem components.
Monitor with the BIOS.    Utilize the BIOS display to monitor temperature, fan speeds, 
intrusion detection messages, voltage settings, the system clock, and bus speed settings.

Motherboard Components, Their 
Purpose, and Properties
The motherboard is the platform through which all the connected components commu-
nicate. The motherboard provides basic services needed for the machine to operate and 
provides communication channels through which connected devices such as the processor, 
memory, disk drives, and expansion devices communicate.
This section discusses those components. The topics addressed in objective 1.2 include

 Sizes 
 The spine of the computer is the  system board , or  motherboard. This component is made 
of green or brown fi berglass and is placed in the bottom or side of the case. It’s the most 
important component in the computer because it connects all the other components of a PC 
together. On the system board you’ll fi nd the central processing unit (CPU), underlying cir-
cuitry, expansion slots, video components, RAM slots, and a variety of other chips. There 
are a number of different sizes or  form factors of motherboards, which will be discussed in 
this section. 
 ATX 
 An older but still used form factor, Advanced Technology Extended (ATX), provided many 
design improvements over the previous version, the AT. These improvements include I/O 
ports built directly into the side of the motherboard, the CPU positioned so that the power-
supply fan helps cool it, and the ability for the PC to be turned on and off via software. It 
uses a PS/2-style connector for the keyboard and mouse, which is rarely used today because 
USB keyboards are used. Newer ATX models have removed PS/2 connectors. The expan-
sion slots are parallel to the narrow edge of the board. See Figure  1.6 .

 Micro-ATX 
 The micro-ATX was released in 1997 for smaller—and typically cheaper—systems. 
It became popular in later years in low-cost PCs. The maximum size of a micro-ATX 

20 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
motherboard is 244 mm square, compared to 305 mm×244 mm for a standard ATX 
motherboard. The micro-ATX is backward compatible with the ATX. Micro-ATX mother-
boards have a maximum of four expansion slots and four DIMM slots.
Mini-ATX
The mini-ATX has dimensions of 15×15 cm (5.9×5.9 in) and is slightly smaller than the 
mini-ITX (discussed in the next section). It was originally part of the ATX specification but 
was removed after the introduction of micro-ATX. It uses less power, generates less heat, 
and fits into a single DIN space.
ITX
The Information Technology eXtended (ITX) motherboards—the mini-ITX, nano-ITX, 
and pico-ITX—were proposed by VIA Technologies. The mini-ITX fits in the same case as 
the micro-ATX; uses low power, which means it can be passively cooled (no fan); and has 
one expansion slot. The nano-ITX is even smaller; it is used for set-top boxes, media cen-
ters, and car computers. The pico-ITX is even smaller again, half the size of the nano-ITX. 
It uses daughter cards (extensions of the motherboard) to supply additional functionality.

Expansion Slots
Expansion slots exist on a motherboard to allow for the addition of new interfaces to 
new technologies without replacing the motherboard. If expansion slots did not exist, you 
would have to buy a new motherboard every time you wanted to add a new device that uses 
an interface to the board that does not currently exist on the board. This section reviews 
various types of expansion slots.
PCI
The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus is a fast (33 MHz), wide (32-bit or 64-bit) 
expansion bus that was a modern standard in motherboards for general-purpose expansion 
devices. Its slots are typically white. PCI devices can share interrupt requests (IRQs) and 
other system resources with one another in some cases. You may see two PCI slots, but most 
motherboards have gone to newer standards. Figure 1.8 shows some PCI slots.
F i g u r e   1. 8     PCI bus connectors
PCI cards that are 32-bit with 33 MHz operate up to 133 MBps, whereas 32-bit cards 
with 64 MHz operate up to 264 MBps. PCI cards that are 64-bit with 33 MHz operate up 
to 266 MBps whereas 64-bit cards with 66 MHz operate up to 538 MBps.
PCI-X
PCI-eXtended (PCI-X) is a double-wide version of the 32-bit PCI local bus. It runs at up to 
four times the clock speed, achieving higher bandwidth, but otherwise uses the same proto-
col and a similar electrical implementation. It has been replaced by the PCI Express (see the 
next section), which uses a different connector and a different logical design. There is also a 
64-bit PCI specification electrically different but with the same connector as PCI-X.
There are two versions of PCI-X. Version 1 gets up to 1.06 GBps, and version 2 gets up 
to 4.26 GBps.

Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
PCIe
PCI Express (PCIE, PCI-E, or PCIe) uses a network of serial interconnects that operate 
at high speed. It’s based on the PCI system; you can convert a PCIe slot to PCI using an 
adaptor plug-in card, but you cannot convert a PCI slot to PCIe. Intended as a replacement 
for AGP and PCI, PCIe has the capability of being faster than AGP while maintaining the 
flexibility of PCI. There are four versions of PCIe: version 1 is up to 8 GBps, version 2 is up 
to 16 GBps, version 3 is up to 32 GBps, and final specifications for version 4 are still being 
developed. Figure 1.9 shows the slots discussed so far in this section.

Laptops and other portable devices utilize an expansion card called the miniPCI. It has the 
same functionality as the PCI but has a much smaller form factor. Unlike portable PCM-
CIA cards, which are inserted externally into a slot, these are installed inside the case.

RAM Slots
RAM slots contain the memory chips. There are many and varied types of memory for PCs 
today. I’ll discuss memory later in this chapter. PCs use memory chips arranged on a small 
circuit board. These circuit boards are called single inline memory modules (SIMMs) or dual 
inline memory modules (DIMMs). DIMMs utilize connectors on both sides of the board, 
whereas SIMMS utilize single connectors that are mirrored on both sides. DIMM is 64-bit 
and SIMM is 32-bit. There is also a high-speed type of RAM called rambus dynamic RAM 
(RDRAM), which comes on circuit boards called rambus inline memory modules (RIMMs).
Along with chip placement, memory modules also differ in the number of conductors, or 
pins, that the particular module uses. The number of pins used directly affects the overall 
size of the memory slot. Slot sizes include 30-pin, 72-pin, 168-pin, and 184-pin. Laptop 
memory comes in smaller form factors known as small outline DIMMs (SODIMMs). 
Figure 1.11 shows the form factors for the most popular memory chips. Notice that they 
basically look the same, but the memory module sizes are different.

Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Memory slots are easy to identify on a motherboard. They’re usually white and placed 
close together. The number of memory slots varies from motherboard to motherboard, but 
the appearance of the different slots is similar. Metal pins in the bottom make contact with 
the soldered tabs on each memory module. Small metal or plastic tabs on each side of the 
slot keep the memory module securely in its slot.
CPU Sockets
The CPU slot permits the attachment of the CPU to the motherboard, allowing the CPU 
to use the other components of the system. There are many different types of processors, 
meaning there are many types of CPU connectors.
The CPU slot can take on several different forms. In the past, the CPU slot was 
a rectangular box called a pin grid array (PGA) socket, with many small holes to 
accommodate the pins on the bottom of the chip. With the release of new and more 
powerful chips, additional holes were added, changing the configuration of the slot and its 
designator or number. Figure 1.12 shows a typical PGA-type CPU socket.
F i g u r e   1.12     A PGA CPU socket
With the release of the Pentium II, the architecture of the slot went from a rectangle to 
more of an expansion-slot style of interface called a single-edge contact cartridge (SECC). 
This style of CPU slot includes Slot 1 and Slot 2 for Intel CPUs and Slot A for Athlon 
(AMD) CPUs. This type of slot looks much like an expansion slot, but it’s located in a 
different place on the motherboard from the other expansion slots. Figure 1.13 shows an 
SECC.

Chipsets
The chipset is the set of controller chips that monitors and directs the traffic on the moth-
erboard between the buses. It usually consists of two or more chips. Motherboards use two 
basic chipset designs: the north/south bridge chipset and the hub chipset.
The hub chipset, a 2008 innovation, includes a memory controller hub (equivalent to 
the north bridge), an I/O controller hub (equivalent to the south bridge), and a SuperI/O 
chip.
North Bridge
The north bridge connects the system bus to the other relatively fast buses (AGP and PCIe). 
The north bridge typically handles communications between the CPU, RAM, and PCIe 
(or AGP) video cards and the south bridge. Figure 1.14 shows the location of the north and 
south bridges.

CMOS Battery
The CMOS chip must have a constant source of power to keep its settings. To prevent 
the loss of data, motherboard manufacturers include a small battery to power the CMOS 
memory. On modern systems, this is a coin-style battery, about the diameter of a U.S. dime 
and about as thick. Figure 1.16 shows the location of the CMOS battery.

Power Connections and Types
A power connector allows the motherboard to be connected to the power supply. On an 
ATX, there is a single power connector consisting of a block of 20 holes (in two rows). On 
an AT, there is a block consisting of 12 pins sticking up; these pins are covered by two con-
nectors with six holes each.

1.2 Explain the Importance of Motherboard Components 
29
Figure 1.17 shows a versatile motherboard that has both kinds so you can compare 
them. The upper connector is for ATX, and the lower one is for AT.
F i g u r e   1.17     Power connectors on a motherboard
ATX
AT
When using the AT power connector, the power cable coming from the power supply 
will have two separate connectors, labeled P8 and P9. When you are attaching the two 
parts to the motherboard, the black wires on one should be next to the black wires on the 
other for proper function.
The 20-pin main connector from the power supply to the motherboard is standard 
for all ATX power supplies. In addition to this connector, many will include an auxiliary 
power connector of either four or six pins to provide additional power.
In 2004, the ATX 12V 2.0 (now 2.03) standard was passed, changing the main connec-
tor from 20 pins to 24. The additional pins provide +3.3V, +5V, and +12V (the fourth pin is 
a ground) for use by PCIe cards. When a 24-pin connector is used, there is no need for the 
optional four- or six-pin auxiliary power connectors.
Most power supplies have a recessed, two-position slider switch (often a red one) on 
the rear that is exposed through the case. Selections read 110 and 220, 115 and 230, or 
120 and 240. This voltage selector switch is used to select the voltage level used in the 
country where the computer is in service. For example, in the United States, the power 
grid supplies anywhere from 110 VAC to 120 VAC. However, in Europe, for instance, 
the voltage supplied is double, ranging from 220 VAC to 240 VAC.

Fan Connectors
Connectors usually used for computer fans are called Molex connectors, and there can be 
several types. The following are some examples:
■

A three-pin Molex connector is used when connecting a fan to the motherboard or 
other circuit board. Figure 1.18 shows the three-pin Molex.

A four-pin Molex connector includes an additional pin used for a pulse-width modulation 
signal to provide variable speed control. These connectors can be plugged into three-pin 
headers but will lose their fan speed control. Figure 1.19 shows the four-pin Molex connector.

Front/Top-Panel Connectors
There are a number of interfaces, buttons, lights, and audio jacks in the front panel of the 
computer that must be connected to the board for power and functionality. This section 
discusses each of these and their respective methods of connection to the motherboard.
USB
When USB ports exist on the front panel (as they almost always do these days), they must 
be connected to the motherboard so that the connected USB device can communicate with

When audio plugs or jacks exist in the front panel, as they do in most computers now, 
they must be connected to the motherboard if you are using the integrated sound card. 
(Otherwise, they may connect directly to the sound card.) Figure 1.20 shows an example of 
the audio plug on the board.
Power Button
The power button located in the front panel must also be connected to the motherboard to 
communicate on and off to the computer. This connector is located along with the remain-
ing connectors discussed in this section, clustered in a group on the motherboard in the sec-
tion labeled “Front-panel connection cluster” in Figure 1.20.

The power indicator light must also be provided with power and a connection to the board. 
It is also located in the section labeled “Front-panel connection cluster” in Figure 1.20.
Drive Activity Lights
The drive activity light, which indicates when a hard drive is being either read or written 
to, must have a connection to the motherboard both for power and to transmit the drive 
activity information. It is also located in the section labeled “Front-panel connection clus-
ter” in Figure 1.20.

The reset button like all the other front-panel components, has a connection to the mother-
board and is located in the section labeled “Front-panel connection cluster” in Figure 1.20.

Differentiate the motherboard form factors.    The ATX is the oldest and largest of the mother-
board sizes still being manufactured. The micro-ATX is for smaller and cheaper systems. The 
smaller ITX motherboards come in three sizes: the mini-ITX, the nano-ITX, and the pico-ITX.
Identify expansion slot types.    PCI slots are the standard for general-purpose cards. The 
PCI-X provides higher bandwidth for servers. PCIe is a newer high-speed slot based on the 
PCI system. MiniPCI slots are used in laptops.
Describe RAM slots.    Memory slots accept either single inline memory modules (SIMMs) 
or dual inline memory modules (DIMMs). DIMMs utilize connectors on both sides of the 
board, whereas SIMMs utilize single connectors that are mirrored on both sides. DIMM is 
64-bit and SIMM is 32-bit. There is also a high-speed type of RAM called rambus dynamic 
RAM (RDRAM), which comes on circuit boards called rambus inline memory modules 
(RIMMs).
Locate the CPU socket on the motherboard.    The CPU socket can take on several different 
forms. In the past, the CPU socket was a rectangular box called a PGA socket, with many 
small holes to accommodate the pins on the bottom of the chip. With the release of the 
Pentium II, the architecture of the socket went from a rectangle to more of an expansion-
slot style of interface called an SECC.
Understand the function of the chipsets.    The north bridge connects the system bus to 
the other relatively fast buses (AGP and PCIe). The south bridge connects ISA, IDE, USB, 
audio, serial, the BIOS, the IDA bus, the IDE channels, and the interrupt controller. It han-
dles all the computer’s I/O functions.
Utilize fan and power connections.    A 20- or 24-pin main connector from the power sup-
ply to the motherboard is standard for all ATX power supplies. Fans connect with either 
three- or four-pin Molex connections.
Identify front connections.    While the USB and audio jacks will be connected with 10-pin 
connectors, the remaining front-panel components will connect with much smaller plugs in 
a cluster in one area on the board.
1.3 Compare and Contrast Various RAM 
Types and Their Features
Physically, RAM is a collection of integrated circuits that store data and program informa-
tion as patterns of 1s and 0s (on and off states) in the chip. Most memory chips require 
constant power (also called a constant refresh) to maintain those patterns of 1s and 0s. If 
power is lost, all those tiny switches revert to the off position, effectively erasing the data 
from memory. Some memory types, however, don’t require a refresh.

Types
There are many types of RAM. They differ in their speed, form factor, their ability to iden-
tify errors, and their bandwidth. Let’s examine each type in detail.
SDRAM
Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) is synchronized to the speed of the motherboard’s system 
bus and works at half the speed of DDR. Synchronizing the speed of the systems prevents 
the address bus from having to wait for the memory because of different clock speeds. A 100 
MHz clock signal produces 800 Mbps, and such memory modules are referred to as PC100. 
PC133, which replaced PC100, uses a 133 MHz clock to produce 1,067 Mbps of throughput.
The relationship between clock speed and throughput is always roughly 1:8. Thus, 
PC2700 modules are designed specifically for a motherboard with a speed of 333 MHz, 
and PC3200 modules are designed for a motherboard with a speed of 400 MHz.
SDRAM typically comes in the form of 168-pin DIMMs.
DDR
Double Data Rate (DDR) is clock-doubled SDRAM (covered in the previous section). The 
memory chip can perform reads and writes on both sides of any clock cycle (the up, or start, 
and the down, or ending), thus doubling the effective memory executions per second. So, if 
you’re using DDR SDRAM with a 100 MHz memory bus, the memory will execute reads 
and writes at 200 MHz and transfer the data to the processor at 100 MHz. The advantage of 
DDR over regular SDRAM is increased throughput and thus increased overall system speed.
DDR2
The next generation of DDR SDRAM is Double Data Rate 2 (DDR2). This allows for two 
memory accesses for each rising and falling clock and effectively doubles the speed of DDR. 
DDR2-667 chips work with speeds at 667 MHz and are also referred to as PC2-5300 modules.
DDR3
The primary benefit of DDR3 over DDR2 is that it transfers data at twice the rate of 
DDR2 (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth 
or peak data rates. By performing two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock, a 

34 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
64-bit-wide DDR3 module may achieve a transfer rate of up to 64 times the memory 
clock speed in megabytes per second. In addition, the DDR3 standard permits chip 
capacities of up to 8 GB. Table 1.4 lists the selected memory standards, speeds, and 
formats.

SODIMM
Portable computers (notebooks and subnotebooks) require smaller sticks of RAM 
because of their smaller size. One of the two types is small outline DIMM (SODIMM), 
which can have 72, 144, or 200 pins. A SODIMM was shown earlier in the chapter in 
Figure 1.11.
DIMM
Dual inline memory modules (DIMMs) are double-sided. DIMMs have separate connectors 
on both sides of the chip. They typically have 168 pins and are 64 bits in width. Figure 1.21 
shows a DIMM. For comparison purposes, a DIMM and SODIMM were shown earlier in 
the chapter in Figure 1.11.

1.3 Compare and Contrast Various RAM Types and Their Features 
35  
Parity vs. Nonparity
RAM is supplied with no parity (8 data bits per byte) or with parity (8 data bits and 1 par-
ity bit per byte, for a total of 9 bits per byte). If present, parity bits are used to determine 
whether data moving to and from memory has been corrupted or damaged (thus changed) 
in the transmission. You can identify parity SIMMs by counting the number of chips on the 
stick. If there are nine, it’s parity RAM. If there are eight, it’s nonparity.
When do you choose parity RAM? Usually, the motherboard requires either parity or 
nonparity RAM; a few motherboards will accept either. Nowadays, parity RAM is needed 
only in highly critical computing tasks because advances in RAM technology have created 
reliable RAM that seldom makes errors.
ECC vs. Non-ECC
Another type of RAM error correction is Error Correction Code (ECC). RAM with ECC 
can detect and correct errors. Like with parity RAM, additional information needs to be 
stored, and more processing needs to be done, making ECC RAM more expensive and a 
little slower than nonparity and parity RAM. Both ECC and parity memory work in ECC 
mode. However, ECC memory does not work in plain parity checking mode, meaning the 
extra bits cannot be individually accessed when ECC memory is used. This type of parity 
RAM is now obsolete. Most RAM today is non-ECC.
RAM Configurations
As I discussed earlier in this section, RAM can be either single-sided or double-sided. It can also 
use single, dual, or triple channels. In this section, I’ll discuss the use of channels in RAM.
Single Channel vs. Dual Channel vs. Triple Channel
Utilizing multiple channels between the RAM and the memory controller increases the 
transfer speed between these two components. Single-channel RAM does not take advan-
tage of this concept, but dual-channel memory does and creates two 64-bit data channels. 
Do not confuse this with DDR or double data rate. DDR doubles the rate by accessing the 
memory module twice per clock cycle.
This requires a motherboard that supports this and two or more memory modules. The 
modules go in separate color-coded banks, as shown in Figure 1.22.

36 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Triple-channel architecture adds a third memory module and reduces memory latency 
by interleaving or accessing each module sequentially with smaller bits of data rather than 
completely filling up one module before accessing the next one. Data is spread among the 
modules alternatingly with the potential to triple bandwidth as opposed to storing the data 
all on one module.
Single-Sided vs. Double-Sided
Earlier we discussed the difference between SIMMs and DIMMs. In review, SIMMs 
have connectors on one side, whereas DIMMs have connectors on both sides of the chip. 
DIMMs have twice the pins, meaning twice the contact with the motherboard, creating a 
larger interface with it and resulting in a wider data path.
Buffered vs. Unbuffered
Buffered memory or registered memory is memory that has a register between it and the 
memory controller. The register stores bits of information in such a way that systems can 
write to or read out all the bits simultaneously. This reduces the load on the controller and 
allows the device to support much more memory than would be possible otherwise. The 
other possible effect is an introduction of latency and a drop in performance, so you might 
think of this trade-off as gaining bandwidth (amount of memory) at a small cost of perfor-
mance (transfer speed).
RAM Compatibility
RAM speed used to be expressed in nanoseconds but is also sometimes expressed in mega-
hertz, like with CPUs. Faster memory can be added to a PC with slower memory installed, 
but the system will operate only at the speed of the slowest module present.
While you can mix speeds, you cannot mix memory types. For example, you cannot use 
SDRAM with DDR, and DDR cannot be mixed with DDR2. When looking at the name of 
the memory, the larger the number, the faster the speed. For example, DDR2-800 is faster 
than DDR2-533.
Exam Essentials
Identify the types of memory.    Types of memory include single data rate (SDRAM), double 
data rate (DDR), DDR2, and DDR3. These types differ in their data rate. Memory can 
also differ in packaging. There are SIMMS (single module) and DIMMs (double modules). 
They also can use either parity or ECC for error checking and can be single, dual, or triple 
channel, with multiple channels widening the path between the memory and the memory 
controller.

Expansion cards allow you to add functionality to the PC. In the section “Expansion

section, I’ll discuss the types of cards and the functionality they provide. I’ll also talk about 
installing them and configuring them properly.
Newer cards will install in the PCI or PCIe slots and will probably be detected by the 
operating system. If the operating system already contains the driver for the device in its 
preinstalled driver library, the process will be done as soon as you restart the PC. If it is 
not present in the driver cache, you will have to install the driver that came with it. These 
guidelines apply to all the expansion cards discussed in this section. The topics addressed in

Sound Cards
Most computers these days come with an integrated sound card, but for more robust sound 
or advanced features, you may need to install a sound card. Sound cards can be either inter-
nal or external. Internal cards require opening the case and installing the card in a slot. 
External cards plug into the USB socket.
In some cases, an audio cable will be connected from the card to the CD-ROM. This is rarely 
required these days. Figure 1.23 shows the connectors present on most sound cards today.

Video Cards
PCs today also contain internal video cards, but like with sound cards, you can achieve 
better video quality with more expensive video cards. This is especially true when the 
video card has its own dedicated memory. In earlier times, most internal cards were vastly 
inferior to the cards you could buy, but that is much less the case today when users have 
learned to expect better video quality.
Newer operating systems, like Windows Vista and Windows 7, have helped raise the bar for 
internal cards as well in that they require a card with a minimum set of features and a minimum 
amount of dedicated RAM to appreciate the visual capabilities of the operating system.
Video cards can be installed in the AGP, PCI, and PCIe slots. At one point, the best choice 
was clear, and that was the AGP slot. However, the newer PCIe slots provide more bandwidth. 
AGP provides a wider data path because it’s parallel, whereas PCIe is serial. But PCIe now 
goes up to 16,000 MBps as compared to AGP, which is 2,000 MBps. Figure 1.24 shows the 
AGP slot next to some slots you have already learned about.

 Some of the special functions you may get with a more expensive video card are 3D 
imaging, MPEG decoding, and TV output (discussed later in this section). The ability to 
use multiple monitors is also built into many cards. 
 Network Cards 
 Network cards do exactly what you would think; they provide a connection for the PC to 
a network. In general, network interface cards (NICs) are added to a PC via an expansion 
slot or they are integrated into the motherboard, but they may also be added through a USB 
or PCMCIA slot (also known as PC card). The most common issue that prevents network 
connectivity is a bad or unplugged patch cable. 
 Network cards are made for Ethernet, fi ber-optic, token ring (rarely used now), and 
802.11 (wireless) connections. The Ethernet, token ring, and fi ber-optic cards accept the 
appropriate cable, and the wireless cards have radio transmitters and antennas. 
 The most obvious difference in network cards is the speed of which they are capable. 
Most networks today operate at 100 MBps or 1 GBps. Regardless of other components, the 
PC will operate at the speed of the slowest component, so if the card is capable of 1 GBps 
but the cable is capable of only 100 MBps, the PC will transmit only at 100 MBps. 
 Another signifi cant feature to be aware of is the card’s ability to perform autosensing. 
This feature allows the card to sense whether the connection is capable of full duplex and 
to operate in that manner with no action required. 
 There is another type of autosensing, in which the card is capable of detecting what type 
of device is on the other end and changing the use of the wire pairs accordingly. For exam-
ple, normally a PC connected to another PC requires a crossover cable, but if both ends can 
perform this sensing, that is not required. These types of cards are called auto-MDIX. 
 Serial and Parallel Cards 
 The “Serial and Parallel Cards” section isn’t part of the official objectives, 
but it is helpful to understand these additional concepts. 
 As discussed in the section “Video Cards,” expansion cards and the slots they live in can 
be either serial or parallel. The difference is in how the bits are sent to and from the card. 
In standard parallel, these bits are sent eight at time using eight wires, one for each bit, 
whereas in serial the bits are sent one at a time down the same wire. 
 Serial has the following advantages over parallel: 
 
■
 A serial link transmits less data per clock cycle but can achieve a higher data rate 
because it can be clocked considerably faster than parallel links. (Clock skew between 
different channels is not an issue because it is in parallel.) 
 
■
 Fewer interconnecting cables occupy less space, allowing for better isolation of the 
channel from its surroundings. 

40 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
■
■
Crosstalk (which occurs when wires in the same cable interfere with one another) is 
less of an issue because there are fewer conductors in proximity.
■
■
It is cheaper to implement. Serial card interfaces have fewer pins and are therefore less 
expensive.
USB Cards
Universal Serial Bus (USB) expansion cards are used to provide a USB connection (or an addi-
tional connection) to a PC that has none (pretty rare today). All modern motherboards today 
have at least two USB slots. Some of the advantages of USB include hot-plugging and the 
capability for up to 127 USB devices to share a single set of system resources. USB 1.1 runs at 
12 Mbps, and USB 2.0 runs at 480 Mbps. Because USB is a serial interface, its width is 1 bit. 
USB 3.0 specifies a maximum transmission speed of up to 5 Gbps (625 MBps), which is more 
than 10 times as fast as USB 2.0 (480 Mbps or 60 MBps), although this speed is typically 
achieved only by using powerful, professional-grade or developmental equipment.
These cards are made to plug into PCI, PCIe, or PCMCIA slots (Chapter 3, “Mobile 
Devices,” discusses laptops in more detail).
FireWire Cards
FireWire expansion cards, like USB cards, provide this connection when none is present or 
when more are required. Most new motherboards have a built-in IEEE 1394/FireWire port, 
although this port can be added with a PCI expansion board. It transfers data at 400 Mbps 
and supports up to 63 chained devices on a single set of resources. These cards also are 
made to plug into PCI, PCIe, or PCMCIA slots.
Thunderbolt Cards
Thunderbolt is an expansion card that was originally envisioned to use fiber cabling but 
was later adapted by Intel and Apple to copper. Thunderbolt controllers multiplex indi-
vidual data lanes from connected PCIe and DisplayPort devices for transmission via one 
duplex Thunderbolt lane and then de-multiplex them for use by PCIe and DisplayPort 
devices on the other end, as depicted in Figure 1.25.

Devices can be daisy-chained on the line (up to 6). Thunderbolt devices and non-Thun-
derbolt devices can be connected, but the controller will treat them differently. It will pro-
vide a native DisplayPort signal with four lanes of output data at no more than 5.4 Gbps 
per Thunderbolt lane. When connected to a Thunderbolt device, the per-lane data rate 
becomes 10 Gbps, and the four Thunderbolt lanes are configured as two duplex lanes, with 
each 10 Gbps comprising one lane of input and one lane of output.
Thunderbolt card use has been restricted thus far to Apple devices, but the technology 
possesses a unique ability to handle audio and video in a way USB cannot. It remains to be 
seen if you will start seeing these interfaces on PCs in the near future.
Storage Cards
Storage cards plug into a slot (usually PCIe) and have storage devices attached to the card. 
Increasingly, these are solid-state drives (SSDs). This is like adding an external drive except 
it is added by placing the card in a slot inside the box.
The following are other ways these cards may be connected to the PC:
■
■
Serial ATA SATA
■
■
Serial-attached SCSI (generally found on servers)
■
■
PCIe
■
■
Fibre Channel (almost exclusively found on servers)
■
■
USB
■
■
Parallel ATA (IDE) interface (mostly replaced by SATA)
■
■
(Parallel) SCSI
Modem Cards
Many PCs already have built-in modems and therefore will have an RJ-11 connector on 
the back in which to plug a phone line. However, modems can be added with an expansion 
card. This arrangement makes it possible to connect to your ISP through the phone line, an 
increasingly rare event that you might use only in an emergency since much faster and sim-
pler connection methods are available. These are usually PCI or PCIe.
Wireless/Cellular Cards
A more likely modem connection you may use is one that connects to your mobile phone 
provider for wireless connectivity through the same system that your mobile phone uses. 
These can be either PCMCIA cards or USB devices. Figure 1.26 shows a PCMCIA card. 
They also are fully wireless versions, meaning there is no physical connection to a device. 
Your computers and mobile devices connect wirelessly to the card, and the card connects 
wirelessly to the cellular tower. These are becoming more common because of the ability to 
connect more than one device to the Internet.

TV Tuner Cards
TV tuner cards are designed to receive TV signals on the computer and usually contain a 
built-in video capture card (discussed more in the next section). The interfaces are most 
commonly either PCI or PCIe, but PCMCIA, ExpressCard, and USB devices also exist.
Video Capture Cards
Video capture is the process of converting an analog video signal to digital video. The resulting 
computer files create a digital video stream. This means that a video capture card takes input—
such as that produced by an analog video camera—and converts it to a digital file. These cards 
usually come in PCI or PCIe format. Figure 1.27 shows an example of a PCI TV tuner card.

Riser Cards
Although it isn’t common, you may occasionally encounter a slim-line case, which is a 
desktop-orientation case that is shorter and thinner than a normal one—so short that nor-
mal expansion boards won’t fit perpendicular to the motherboard. In such cases a riser card 
is installed, which sits perpendicular to the motherboard and contains expansion slots. The 
expansion cards can then be oriented parallel to the motherboard when installed. So, it’s a 
card that hosts other cards. Figure 1.28 shows a riser card from two angles.

1.5 Install and Configure Storage 
Devices and Use Appropriate Media
Storage media hold the data being accessed, as well as the files the system needs to operate and 
the data that needs to be saved. The various types of storage differ in terms of capacity, the access 
time, and the physical type of media being used. This section covers the installation and configu-
ration of various storage devices. The topics addressed in objective 1.5 include the following:

 Optical Drives 
 Optical drives work by using a laser rather than magnetism to change the characteristics 
of the storage medium. This is true for CD-ROM drives, DVD drives, and Blu-ray, all of 
which are discussed in the following sections. 
 CD-ROM 
 CD-ROM stands for Compact Disc Read-Only Memory. The CD-ROM media is used for 
long-term storage of data. CD-ROM media is read-only, meaning that once information is 
written to a CD, it can’t be erased or changed. Access time for CD-ROM drives is consider-
ably slower than for a hard drive. Standard CDs normally hold 650 MB to 700 MB of data 
and use the ISO 9660 standard, which allows them to be used in multiple platforms. 
 DVD-ROM 
 Because DVD-ROM drives use slightly different technology than CD-ROM drives, they 
can store up to 4.7 GB of data in a single-layer confi guration. This makes DVDs a better 
choice than CDs for distributing large software bundles. Many software packages today 
are so huge that they require multiple CDs to hold all the installation and reference fi les. A 
single DVD, in a double-sided, double-layered confi guration, can hold as much as 17 GB (as 
much as 26 regular CDs). 
 Blu-ray 
 Blu-ray recorders have been available since 2003, and they have the ability to record 
more information than a standard DVD using similar optical technology. In recent years, 
Blu-ray has been more synonymous with recording television and movie fi les than data, 
but the Blu-ray specifi cation (1.0) includes two data formats: BD-R for write-once and 
BD-RE for rewritable media (more later in this section). BD-J is capable of more sophis-
ticated bonus features than provided by standard DVD, including network access, pic-
ture-in-picture, and access to expanded local storage. With the exception of the Internet 
access component, these features are called Bonus View. The addition of Internet access is 
called BD Live.  
 In the official specification, as noted on the Blu-ray Disc Association web-
site ( http://us.blu-raydisc.com/ ), the  r is lowercase. CompTIA favors 
the uppercase  R . 

46 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
The current capacity of a Blu-ray is 100 GB, with 400 GB on the horizon and an aim 
for 1 TB by 2015. As a final note, there was a long-running (but finally complete) battle 
between Blu-ray and HD DVD to be the format of the future, and Blu-ray won.
CD-RW
Compact Disc-ReWritable (CD-RW) media is a rewritable optical disc. A CD-RW drive 
requires more sensitive laser optics. It can write data to the disc but also has the ability 
to erase that data and write more data to the disc. It does this by liquefying the layer 
where the data resides (removing the reflectivity placed there by the writing process 
used to create the old data) and then creating new reflectivity in the same layer upon 
writing again that represents the new data. Two states of reflectivity are used to repre-
sent the 0s and 1s for the data. CD-RWs cannot be read in some CD-ROM drives built 
prior to 1997.
DVD-RW
As you might expect, the primary advantage of DVD-RW drives over DVD-R drives is the 
ability to erase and rewrite to a DVD-RW disc. In these drives, a layer of metal alloy on 
the disk is manipulated to erase and write the data, rather than burning into the disc itself, 
similar to the operation of CD-RW.
Dual-Layer DVD-RW
A dual-layer DVD-RW disc employs a second physical layer within the disc itself. The drive 
with dual-layer capability accesses the second layer by shining the laser through the first 
semitransparent layer.
BD-R
Blu-ray players have two data formats: BD-R for recording computer data and BD-RE for 
rewritable media. BD-R can be written to only one time.
BD-RE
Blu-ray Disc Recordable Erasable (BD-RE) can be erased and written to multiple times. 
Disc capacities are 25 GB for single-layer discs, 50 GB for double-layer discs, 100 GB for 
triple-layer discs, and 128 GB for quad-layer discs.
Magnetic Hard Drives
Before the development and use of SSDs, magnetic drives were—and are still as of this 
writing—the main type of hard drive used. The drive itself is a mechanical device that spins 
a number of disks or platters and uses a magnetic head to read and write data to the surface 
of the disks. One of the advantages of SSDs (discussed in the next section) is the absence 
of mechanical parts that can malfunction. Figure 1.29 shows the parts of a magnetic hard 
drive.

The basic hard disk geometry consists of three components: the number of sectors 
that each track contains, the number of read/write heads in the disk assembly, and the 
number of cylinders in the assembly. This set of values is known as CHS (for cylinders/
heads/sectors). A cylinder is the set of tracks of the same number on all the writeable 
surfaces of the assembly. It is called a cylinder because the collection of all same-
number tracks on all writable surfaces of the hard disk assembly looks like a geometric 
cylinder when connected vertically. Therefore, cylinder 1, for instance, on an assembly 
that contains three platters comprises six tracks (one on each side of each platter), each 
labeled track 1 on its respective surface. Figure 1.30 illustrates the key terms presented 
in this discussion.

Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
5,400 rpm
The rotational speed of the disk or platter has a direct influence on how quickly the drive 
can locate any specific disk sector on the drive. This locational delay is called latency and is 
measured in milliseconds (ms). The faster the rotation, the smaller the delay will be. A drive 
operating at 5,400 rpms will experience about 5.5 ms of this delay.
7,200 rpm
Drives that operate at 7,200 rpm will experience about 4.16 ms of latency. As of 2015, a 
typical 7,200 rpm desktop hard drive has a sustained data transfer rate up to 1,030 Mbps. 
This rate depends on the track location, so it will be higher for data on the outer tracks and 
lower toward the inner tracks.
10,000 rpm
At 10,000 rpm, the latency will decrease to about 3 ms. Data transfer rates also generally 
go up with a higher rotational speed but are influenced by the density of the disk (the num-
ber of tracks and sectors present in a given area).
15,000 rpm
Drives that operate at 15,000 rpm are higher-end drives and suffer only 2 ms of latency. 
These drives also generate more heat, requiring more cooling to the case. They also offer 
faster data transfer rates for the same areal density.
Hot-Swappable Drives
If a drive can be attached to the PC without shutting down the PC, then it is a hot-swappa-
ble drive. Drive types that are hot-swappable include USB, FireWire, SATA, and those that 
connect through Ethernet. You should always check the documentation to ensure that your 
drive supports this feature.
Solid-State/Flash Drives
Solid-state drives (SSDs) retain data in nonvolatile memory chips and contain no moving 
parts. Compared to electromechanical hard disk drives (HDDs), SSDs are typically less 
susceptible to physical shock, are silent, have lower access time and latency, but are more 
expensive per gigabyte.
Thumb drives are USB flash drives that have become extremely popular for transporting 
files. Figure 1.31 shows three thumb drives (also known as keychain drives) next to a pack 
of gum for size comparison.
Like with other flash drives, you can find these in a number of different size capacities. 
Many models include a write-protect switch to keep you from accidentally overwriting files 
stored on the drive. Most include an LED to show when they’re connected to the USB port. 
Other names for thumb drives include travel drives, flash drives, and jump drives.

F i g u r e   1. 31     USB flash
Flash drives (which are solid state) have been growing in popularity for years and replac-
ing floppy disks because of their capacity and small size. Flash technology is ideally suited 
for use not only with computers but also with many other things—digital cameras, MP3 
players, and so on. This section discusses the various forms of these drives.
Compact Flash
Compact Flash (CF) cards are a widely used form of solid-state storage. There are two main 
subdivisions of CF cards: Type I (3.3-mm thick) and the thicker Type II (CF2) cards (5-mm 
thick). CF cards can be used directly in a PC card slot with a plug adaptor, used as an ATA 
(IDE) or PCMCIA storage device with a passive adaptor or with a reader, or attached to 
other types of ports such as USB or FireWire. Figure 1.32 shows a CF card.

SD
Secure Digital (SD) cards are just one type of flash; there are many others. The maximum 
capacity of a standard SD card is 512 GB, and there are two other standards that go 
beyond this: SDHC can go to 32 GB and SDXC to 2 TB. Figure 1.32 shows a Compact 
Flash card (the larger of the two) and an SD card along with an eight-in-one card reader/
writer. The reader shown connects to the USB port and then interacts with Compact Flash, 
Compact Flash II, Memory Stick, Memory Stick PRO, SmartMedia, xD-Picture cards, SD, 
and MultiMediaCards. The SD card specification defines three physical sizes, discussed in 
the following sections.
Micro-SD
Micro-SD is the smallest of the three. It is 11 mm × 15 mm × 1 mm.
Mini-SD
Mini-SD is the middle child of the three SD form factors. It is 20 mm × 21.5 mm × 1.4 mm.
xD
xD-Picture card is a flash memory card format, used mainly in older digital cameras. xD 
stands for Extreme Digital. xD cards are available in capacities of 16 MB up to 2 GB. 
Pictures are transferred from a digital camera’s xD card to a PC by plugging the camera 
into the USB or IEEE 1394 (FireWire) cable or by removing the card from the camera and 
inserting it into a card reader.
SSD
A solid-state drive (SSD) is a form of flash drive that takes the place of a magnetic hard 
drive as the main storage device in the PC. Some SSDs use volatile RAM and external 
power or batteries to maintain the data after power is removed.
These drives access the data faster because there is no wait for the platters to spin up. 
Also, with no moving parts, there is less to go wrong with these drives, and they make no 
noise, like magnetic drives will do. Smartphones are an example of the growing number of 
devices that use solid-state storage, along with many laptops.
Hybrid
A hybrid drive is one in which both technologies, traditional mechanical and SSDs, are 
combined. This is done to take advantage of the speed of SSDs while maintaining the cost 
effectiveness of mechanical drives.
There are main approaches to this: dual-drive hybrid and solid-state hybrid. Dual-drive 
systems contain both types of drives in the same machine, and performance is optimized by 
the user placing more frequently used information on the SSD and less frequently accessed 
data on the mechanical drive. In some cases the operating system can create hybrid volumes 
using space in both drives.

 An SSD, on the other hand, is a single storage device that includes solid-state fl ash mem-
ory in a traditional hard drive. Data that is most related to the performance of the machine 
is stored in the fl ash memory, resulting in improved performance. Figure  1.33 shows the 
two approaches to hybrid drives.

 An Embedded Multi-Media Controller (eMMC) is a type of fl ash memory that is slower 
than solid state but also cheaper. It is often used in less expensive laptops and tablets. It’s 
embedded into the board of the device and has more in common with an SD card than 
an SSD. Lower performance for lower price is an acceptable trade-off in devices such as 
cameras that don’t demand the type of performance you get from an SSD, but eMMC may 
not be up to the task in a laptop or desktop machine. 
 Connection Types 
 Drives can be installed internally or can be connected externally to the PC. There 
are various options to connect the drives in both cases. This section discusses those 
options.  
 The “Connection Types” section isn’t part of the official objectives, but it is 
helpful to understand these additional concepts. 

52 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
External
When a PC does not have the type of drive needed and has neither the internal connection 
type required nor the space inside the box to install the drive internally, external drives are 
made that can connect to the computer using several types of external interfaces. These 
connection types are discussed in this section.
USB
USB connections are probably the most widely used because of their inclusion on almost all 
front or back panels of computers these days. In fact, most have several USB slots, and it is 
simple to add more with a USB hub. USB drives also have the benefit of being Plug and Play, 
which makes them user friendly for setup.
FireWire
Although not as widely seen as USB or IEEE 1394, FireWire connections are also present 
on many computers. It transfers data at 400 Mbps and supports up to 63 chained devices 
on a single set of resources. It’s hot-pluggable, like USB.
eSATA
eSATA provides a form of SATA meant for external connectivity. SATA (discussed more 
completely in the section “Internal SATA, IDE, and SCSI”) is used for drive connections 
internally on many PCs. eSATA uses a more robust connector, longer shielded cables, and 
stricter (but backward-compatible) electrical standards. The interface resembles that of 
USB and IEEE 1394 (FireWire), but the cable cannot be as long, and the cable does not 
supply power to the device. The advantage it has over the other technologies is speed—it 
is approximately three times as fast as either FireWire or USB 2.0 (although USB 3.0 is 
faster).
Ethernet
There are drives that you connect to across the network or through Ethernet. These drives, 
also sometimes referred to as network-attached storage (NAS) devices, may also allow 
for wireless access, just as a laptop is capable of both wired and wireless communication. 
These devices are not seen as an attached device to the PC but rather as another device on 
the network, so they appear as a drive with shared folders as if you were connecting to a 
server. They only need to be on the same network as the PC.
Internal SATA, IDE, and SCSI
When drives are connected internally, there are several options, and the options available 
on your PC will be a function of how old it is and, in the case of SCSI, whether it is a com-
puter designed to operate as a server.
IDE drives are the most common type of hard drive found in computers. But IDE 
is much more than a hard drive interface; it’s also a popular interface for many other 
drive types, including CD-ROM, DVD, and Zip drives. IDE drives are easy to install 
and configure, and they provide acceptable performance for most applications. Their 

1.5 Install and Configure Storage Devices and Use Appropriate Media 
53
ease of use relates to their most identifi able feature—the controller is located on the 
drive itself. 
 The design of the IDE is simple: build the controller right on the drive and use a rela-
tively short ribbon cable to connect the drive/controller to the IDE interface. This offers the 
benefi ts of decreasing signal loss (thus increasing reliability) and making the drive easier 
to install. The IDE interface can be an expansion board, or it can be built into the mother-
board, as is the case on almost all systems today. 
 IDE generically refers to any drive that has a built-in controller.  The IDE you know 
today is more properly called AT IDE; two previous types of IDE (MCA IDE and XT IDE) 
are obsolete and incompatible with it. 
 There have been many revisions of the IDE standard over the years, and each one is des-
ignated with a certain AT attachment (ATA) number—ATA-1 through ATA-8. Drives that 
support ATA-2 and higher are generically referred to as enhanced IDE (EIDE). Here are 
some of the highlights: With ATA-3, a technology called ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) was 
introduced to help deal with IDE devices other than hard disks. ATAPI enables the BIOS 
to recognize an IDE CD-ROM drive, for example, or a tape backup or Zip drive. Starting 
with ATA-4, a new technology was introduced called UltraDMA, supporting transfer 
modes of up to 33 Mbps. ATA-5 supports UltraDMA/66, with transfer modes of up to 66 
Mbps. To achieve this high rate, the drive must have a special 80-wire ribbon cable, and the 
motherboard or IDE controller card must support ATA-5. ATA-6 supports UltraDMA/100, 
with transfer modes of up to 100 Mbps. 
 If an ATA-5 or ATA-6 drive is used with a normal 40-wire cable or is used 
on a system that doesn’t support the higher modes, it reverts to the ATA-4 
performance level. 
 ATA-7 supports UltraDMA/133, with transfer modes of up to 150 Mbps and SATA. 
 ATA-8 made only minor revisions to ATA-7 and also supports UltraDMA/133, with 
transfer modes of up to 600 Mbps and SATA. 
 Table  1.5 lists the ATA standards and their details.

SATA drives are ATA drives that use serial transmission as opposed to parallel. They 
use a different cable because of this. It is not a ribbon cable but a smaller cable. Figure 1.34 
shows the data cable and its connector.

Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is most commonly used for hard disks and tape 
drives, but it can connect a wide range of other devices, including scanners and CD drives. 
These devices reside on a single bus, which must be terminated on either end. Eight or six-
teen devices can be attached to a single bus, depending on whether the SCSI bus is wide 
(0–15) or narrow (0–7) bus. There also is a host bus controller, which is usually plugged 
into a slot in the computer or can be integrated into the motherboard. Figure 1.35 shows an 
internal SCSI connector.

IDE Configuration and Setup (Master, Slave, Cable Select)
The primary benefit of IDE is that it’s nearly universally supported. Almost every mother-
board has IDE connectors.
A typical motherboard has two IDE connectors, and each connector can support up to 
two drives on the same cable. That means you’re limited to four IDE devices per system 
unless you add an expansion board containing another IDE interface. In contrast, with 
SCSI (covered in the next section) you can have up to seven drives per interface (or even 
more on some types of SCSI).
Performance also may suffer when IDE devices share an interface. When you’re burning 
CDs, for example, if the hard drive you are reading from is on the same cable as the CD 
drive you are writing to, errors may occur. SCSI drives are much more efficient with this 
type of transfer.
To install an IDE drive, do the following:
1.	
Set the master/slave jumper on the drive.
2.	
Install the drive in the drive bay.
3.	
Connect the power-supply cable.
4.	
Connect the ribbon cable to the drive and to the motherboard or IDE expansion board. 
Ensure that the master device is closest to the connection to the motherboard.
5.	
Configure the drive in BIOS Setup if it isn’t automatically detected.
6.	
Partition and format the drive using the operating system.
Each IDE interface can have only one master drive on it. If there are two drives on a 
single cable, one of them must be the slave drive. This setting is accomplished via a jumper 
on the drive. Some drives have a separate setting for Single (that is, master with no slave) 
and Master (that is, master with a slave); others use the Master setting generically to refer 
to either case. The cable select setting will assume you have the primary drive first and sec-
ondary drive second on the cable. Figure 1.36 shows a typical master/slave jumper scenario, 
but different drives may have different jumper positions to represent each state. Today, the 
need for jumper settings has decreased because many drives can autodetect the master/slave 
relationship.
Most BIOS Setup programs today support Plug and Play, so they detect the new drive 
automatically at startup. If this doesn’t work, the drive may not be installed correctly, the 
jumper settings may be wrong, or the BIOS Setup may have the IDE interface set to None 
rather than Auto. Enter BIOS Setup and find out. All you usually have to do is set the IDE 
interface to Auto and allow the BIOS to detect the drive.

In BIOS Setup for the drive, you might have the option of selecting a DMA or PIO setting 
for the drive. Both are methods for improving drive performance by allowing the drive to 
write directly to RAM, bypassing the CPU when possible. For modern drives that support 
UltraDMA, neither of these settings is necessary or desirable.
When the drive is installed, you can proceed to partition and format it for the operating 
system you’ve chosen. Then, you can install your operating system of choice.
For a Windows 8 or 8.1 system, allow the Windows Setup program to partition and 
format the drive (when installing the operating system), or use the Disk Management utility 
in Windows to perform those tasks. To access Disk Management, from the Control Panel 
choose Administrative Tools and then Computer Management.
SCSI IDs (0–15)
The devices are identified by a unique SCSI ID. The SCSI ID of a device in a drive enclosure 
that has a backplane is set either by jumpers or by the slot in the enclosure the device is 
installed into, depending on the model of the enclosure. In the latter case, each slot on the 
enclosure’s backplane delivers control signals to the drive to select a unique SCSI ID. It is 
important that all devices have unique IDs. The bootable hard disk should be set with an ID 
of 0, and the host controller should be set at 7 or 15 in the case of 16-bit SCSI (it will be the 
highest number possible based on the SCSI width). Each end of the chain must be terminated.
In some cases, a single SCSI target (as they are called) may contain multiple drives 
within the unit. In these cases, the drives are differentiated with a second number called a 
logical unit number (LUN).
RAID Types
RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. It’s a way of combining the stor-
age power of more than one hard disk for a special purpose such as increased performance 
or fault tolerance. RAID is more commonly done with SCSI drives, but it can be done with 

1.5 Install and Configure Storage Devices and Use Appropriate Media 
57  
IDE or SATA drives. Several types of RAID are covered in the following sections. Because 
of the methods used to provide fault tolerance, the total amount of usable space in the array 
will vary, as discussed in each section.
RAID 0
RAID 0 is also known as disk striping. This is technically not RAID because it doesn’t pro-
vide fault tolerance. Data is written across multiple drives, so one drive can be reading or 
writing while the next drive’s read/write head is moving. This makes for faster data access. 
However, if any one of the drives fails, all content is lost. In RAID 0, since there is no fault 
tolerance, the usable space in the drive is equal to the total space on all the drives. So if the 
two drives in an array have 250 GB each of space, 500 GB will be the available drive space.
RAID 1
RAID 1 is also known as disk mirroring. This is a method of producing fault tolerance by 
writing all data simultaneously to two separate drives. If one drive fails, the other drive 
contains all the data and may also be used as a source of the data. However, disk mirroring 
doesn’t help access speed, and the cost is double that of a single drive. Since RAID 1 repeats 
the data on two drives, only one half of the total drive space is available for data. So if two 
250 GB drives are used in the array, 250 GB will be the available drive space.
RAID 5
RAID 5 combines the benefits of both RAID 0 and RAID 1 and is also known as striping 
with parity. It uses a parity block distributed across all the drives in the array, in addition 
to striping the data across them. That way, if one drive fails, the parity information can be 
used to recover what was on the failed drive. A minimum of three drives is required. RAID 
5 uses 1/n (n = the number of drives in the array) for parity information (for example, one-
third of the space in a three-drive array), and only 1 (1/n) is available for data. So if three 
250 GB drives are used in the array (for a total of 750 GB), 500 GB will be the available 
drive space.
RAID 10
RAID 10 is also known as RAID 1+0. Striped sets are mirrored (a minimum of four drives, 
and the number of drives must be even). It provides fault tolerance and improved performance 
but increases complexity. Since this is effectively a mirrored stripe set and a stripe set gets 100 
percent use of the drive without mirroring, this array will provide half of the total drive space 
in the array as available drive space. For example, if there are four 250 GB drives in a RAID 
10 array (for a total of 1,000 GB), the available drive space will be 500 GB.
Tape Drive
Another form of storage device is the tape backup. Tape backup devices can be installed 
internally or externally and use a magnetic tape medium instead of disks for storage. They 

58 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
hold much more data than most other media but are also much slower. They’re primarily 
used for archival storage.
Tape drives can be connected with SCSI, Fibre Channel, SATA, USB, FireWire, or other 
interfaces.
One of the disadvantages of tape drives in the past has been the sequential manner in 
which data is located on the tape. That issue may become a thing of the past. In 2010, IBM 
introduced the Linear Tape File System (LTFS), which allows you to access files on tape in 
the same way as on a disk filesystem.
Media Capacity
One of the common ways that storage options are compared is capacity. The capacity 
ranges of each option are briefly discussed here:
CD    Standard CDs normally hold 650–700 MB of data and use the ISO 9660 standard, 
which allows them to be used in multiple platforms.
CD-RW    Like CDs, CD-RWs normally hold 650–700 MB of data.
DVD-RW    The capacity of DVD-RW depends on whether it is single or dual layer. A sin-
gle-layer DVD-RW holds about 4.7 GB (the same as a DVD-R), and a dual-layer DVD-RW 
will hold 8.5 GB.
DVD    DVDs can have up to four layers, can be either single- or double-sided, and can 
come in about 10 different types or generations. All affect the capacity. The range of capac-
ities available is from 4.7 GB (DVD-5 single-sided, single-layer) to 17.08 GB (DVD-18, 
double-sided, double-layer, which results in four layers total).
Blu-ray    As mentioned earlier in the section “Optical Drives,” the current capacity of a 
Blu-ray disc is 100 GB, with 400 GB on the horizon, and an aim for 1 TB by 2015.
Tape    The current maximum capacity of a standard tape drive is 10 TB. Sony has a new 
cassette tape that will hold 185 TB of data.
DL DVD    As described in the section on DVD capacity, a double-layer (DL) DVD’s 
capacity is influenced by the type or generation of DVD and whether it is single or double 
sided. Single-sided DL (which results in a total of two layers) in DVD-10 holds up to 9.4 
GB, and a double-sided DL (which results in a total of four layers) in DVD-18 holds up to 
17.08 GB.
Exam Essentials
Identify and differentiate the optical drive options for the long-term storage of data.    Those 
options include CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, and Blu-Ray. When the ability to erase and rewrite 
to the disk is required, the options include CD-RW, DVD-RW, dual-layer (DL) DVD-RW, 
and Blu-ray Disc Recordable Erasable (BD-RE).

Describe the types of interfaces to connect a drive to the system.    Drives can be connected 
externally using USB, FireWire (IEEE 1394), eSATA, and Ethernet. Internally the connec-
tion types are SATA, IDE, and SCSI.
Appreciate the importance of the Master/Slave settings for IDE.    Each IDE interface can 
have only one master drive on it. If there are two drives on a single cable, one of them must 
be the slave drive. This setting is accomplished via a jumper on the drive.
Describe the operations of the SCSI bus.    SCSI devices reside on a single bus, which 
must be terminated on either end. Up to 8 or 16 devices can be attached to a single bus, 
depending on whether the SCSI bus is wide (0–15) or narrow (0–7). There also is a host 
bus controller, which is usually plugged into a slot in the computer or integrated into the 
motherboard.
Identify the advantages and disadvantage to both magnetic and solid-state drive 
operations.    SSDs retain data in nonvolatile memory chips and contain no moving 
parts. Compared to electromechanical HDDs, SSDs are typically less susceptible to 
physical shock, are silent, have lower access time and latency, but are more expensive 
per gigabyte.
List the capacities of various storage systems.    These range from 650 MB for a CD-Rom 
up to 17 GB for a double-sided DL DVD.
Identify the pros and cons of various RAID options.    RAID 0 provides only performance 
enhancement, whereas RAID 1 and RAID 5 provide fault tolerance. RAID 10 provides 
both performance enhancement and fault tolerance. The cost for these options is the use of 
multiple hard drives in various arrangements.
1.6 Install Various Types of CPUs and

The CPU is the brain of the PC and has evolved over the years both in the slots available 
to connect it to the PC and in its capabilities. With the addition of more processing power 
came the introduction of more heat in the case and the development of more advanced cool-
ing methods. This section covers these issues as well. The topics addressed in objective 1.6 
include the following:

Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Socket Types
Sockets are the interface with which CPUs are plugged into the motherboard. These sock-
ets have evolved over the years along with the changes in CPU architecture and design. 
There are three form factors for CPU chips: pin grid array (PGA), single-edge contact 
cartridge (SECC), and land grid array (LGA). The PGA style is a flat square or rectangu-
lar ceramic chip with an array of pins in the bottom. The actual CPU is a silicon wafer 
embedded inside that ceramic chip. The SECC style is a circuit board with the silicon wafer 
mounted on it. The circuit board is then surrounded by a plastic cartridge for protection; 
the circuit board sticks out of the cartridge along one edge. This edge fits into a slot in the 
motherboard.
The market leader in chip manufacturing is Intel Corporation, with Advanced Micro 
Devices (AMD) gaining market share in the home PC market. This section discusses vari-
ous socket types you may encounter.
Intel: LGA 775, 1155, 1156, 1366, 1150, 2011    Earlier in this chapter, Table 1.3 listed the 
various Intel CPU slots and sockets you may find in a motherboard and explained which 
CPUs will fit into them.
AMD: AM3, AM3+, FM1, FM2, FM2+    Table 1.3 also listed the various AMD CPU 
slots and sockets you may find in a motherboard and explained which CPUs will fit into 
them. These later-generation AMD sockets were launched as the successor to Socket 
AM2+. In 2009 AMD3 was released alongside the initial grouping of Phenom II processors 
designed for it. The principal change from AM2+ to AM3 is support for DDR3 SDRAM. 
The AM3+ socket has been designed for the AMD FX series Zambezi processors based 
on the Bulldozer architecture. Socket FM2 is a CPU socket launched in September 2012. 
Motherboards using the FM2 utilize AMD’s new A85X chipset. The FM2+ uses three PCI 
Express cores: one 2×16 core and two 5×8 cores, for a total of 64 lanes.
Characteristics
CPUs can be compared and contrasted on the basis of a number of characteristics. These 
characteristics ultimately define the ability of the CPU to perform its main role of process-
ing as well as its ability to provide more advanced features to the PC. These characteristics 
are discussed in this section.
Speeds
Speeds were discussed earlier in this chapter in the section “1.1 Given a Scenario, Configure 
Settings and Use BIOS/UEFI Tools on a PC.”
Cores
CPUs can have a single-core, dual-core, quad-core, and even dual-quad-core (eight CPUs 
total). When multiple cores exist, they operate as individual processors, so the more the 
better. The largest boost in performance will likely be noticed in improved response time 

1.6 Install Various Types of CPUs and Apply the Appropriate Cooling Methods 
61  
while running CPU-intensive processes, such as virus scans, ripping/burning media (requir-
ing file conversion), or file searching.
The addition of more cores does not have a linear effect on performance. The potential 
impact of multiple cores also depends on the amount of cache or memory present to serve 
the CPU. When a computer is designed for the processor, this will have been taken into 
consideration, but when adding a multicore processor to a PC, it is an issue to consider. 
Cache or memory is discussed in the next section.
Dual-Core Processors
Dual-core processors, available from Intel as well as AMD, essentially combine two pro-
cessors into one chip. Instead of adding two processors to a machine (making it a multi-
processor system), you have one chip splitting operations and essentially performing as 
if it’s two processors in order to get better performance. A multicore architecture simply 
has multiple, completely separate processor dies in the same package, whether it’s dual 
core, triple core, or quad core. The operating system and applications see multicore pro-
cessors in the same way that they see multiple processors in separate sockets. Both dual-
core and quad-core processors are common cases for the multicore technology. Most 
multicore processors from Intel come in even numbers, whereas AMD’s Phenom series 
can contain odd numbers (such as the triple-core processor).
Cache Size/Type
A cache is an area of extremely fast memory used to store data that is waiting to enter or 
exit the CPU. The Level 1 cache, also known as the L1 or front-side cache, holds data that 
is waiting to enter the CPU. On modern systems, the L1 cache is built into the CPU. The 
Level 2 cache, also known as the L2 or back-side cache, holds data that is exiting the CPU 
and is waiting to return to RAM. On modern systems, the L2 cache is in the same packag-
ing as the CPU but on a separate chip. On older systems, the L2 cache was on a separate 
circuit board installed in the motherboard and was sometimes called cache on a stick 
(COAST).
On some CPUs, the L2 cache operates at the same speed as the CPU; on others, the 
cache speed is only half the CPU speed. Chips with full-speed L2 caches have better per-
formance. Some newer systems also have an L3 cache, which is external to the CPU. It sits 
between the CPU and RAM to optimize data transfer between them.
Hyperthreading
One of the improvements offered since the Pentium 4 is hyperthreading technology. This 
feature enables the computer to multitask more efficiently between CPU-demanding appli-
cations. An advantage of hyperthreading is improved support for multithreaded code, 
allowing multiple threads to run simultaneously and thus improving reaction and response 
time.

62 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Virtualization Support
When using virtualization technology (discussed in the “BIOS Configurations” section 
earlier, under “Virtualization Support”), a fuller realization of its benefits can be achieved 
when the processor supports this concept.
The benefit derived from this support is to allow the virtualization product (also called a 
hypervisor) to use hardware-assisted virtualization. This allows the hypervisor to dynami-
cally allocate CPU to the VMs as required. Both AMD and Intel offer CPUs that support 
hardware virtualization.
Architecture
CPUs can be either 32-bit or 64-bit. This value describes what is called the word size of the 
processor. Having 64 bits offers two important benefits. Data can be processed in larger 
chunks, which also means with greater precision. Moreover, the system can point to or 
address a larger number of locations in physical memory. A key consideration is the operat-
ing system. If the operating system is not 64 bit, you cannot take advantage of the 64-bit 
processor.
Integrated GPU
A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized circuit designed to rapidly manipulate 
and alter memory to accelerate the building of images in a frame buffer intended for out-
put to a display. It improves the graphic abilities of the PC when this feature is present in 
the CPU.
Some visual features provided by operating systems such as Windows Vista and 
Windows 7 are unavailable unless the CPU has dedicated graphics memory or a GPU. For 
example, the Aero view in Vista and Windows 7 requires a card capable of DirectX, which 
is a technology that requires the DirectCompute API, which in turn requires a GPU.
Disable Execute Bit
The NX bit (No-eXecute) is a technology used in CPUs to segregate areas of memory for 
use either for storing processor instructions (code) or for storing data. Execute Disable Bit 
(EDB) is an implementation of this security feature in some Intel CPUs that helps to reduce 
vulnerability to malware. In AMD, this feature is called Enhanced Virus Protection. When 
malware attempts to insert code in the buffer, the processor disables code execution, pre-
venting damage and worm propagation. The operating system must support this feature, 
and it must be enabled in the system BIOS.
Cooling
CPUs produce heat, and the more powerful the CPU the more heat it produces. Heat is an 
enemy to the PC in general because it causes problems such as random reboots. Methods of 
cooling the CPU and in turn the overall interior of the case have evolved with the increasing 
need to remove this heat. This section covers options that are used.

1.6 Install Various Types of CPUs and Apply the Appropriate Cooling Methods 
63  
In methods of cooling, technology that transfers heat away from components uses ther-
moelectric cooling, and components that perform this function are called Peltier compo-
nents. Heat sinks, cooling fans, and cooling fins are Peltier components. Liquid cooling, on 
the other hand, cools not by transferring heat away from components but by circulating a 
cool liquid around them.
Heat Sink
The cooling can be either active or passive. A passive heat sink is a block of heat-conductive 
material that sits close to the CPU and wicks away the heat into the air. An active heat sink 
contains a fan that pulls the hot air away from the CPU. The heat sink sits atop the CPU, in 
many cases obscuring it from view entirely.
Fans
Active heat sinks have a fan that sits atop the heat sink. It pulls the heat out of the heat sink 
and away from it. Then the case fan shunts the heat out the back or side of the case.
Thermal Paste
Most passive heat sinks are attached to the CPU using a glue-like thermal compound 
(called thermal glue, thermal compound, or thermal paste). This makes the connection 
between the heat sink and the CPU more seamless and direct. Thermal compound can be 
used on active heat sinks too, but generally it isn’t because of the possibility that the fan 
may stop working and need to be replaced. Thermal compound improves thermal transfer 
by eliminating tiny air pockets between the heat sink and CPU (or other device like a north 
bridge or video chipset). Thermal compound provides both improved thermal transfer and 
adds bonding for heat sinks when there are no mounting holes to clamp the heat sink to the 
device to be cooled.
Liquid-Based
Liquid-Based Cooling cases are available that use circulating water rather than fans to keep 
components cool. These cases are typically more expensive than standard ones and may be 
more difficult for a technician untrained in this technology to work on, but they result in 
an almost completely silent system.
Issues with Liquid-Based Cooling machines can include problems with hoses or fittings, 
the pump, or the coolant. A failure of the pump can keep the liquid from flowing and cause 
the system to overheat. A Liquid-Based Cooling system should also be checked every so 
often for leaks or corrosion on the hoses and fittings, and the reservoir should be examined 
to make sure it is full and does not contain contaminants. Liquid-Based Cooling is more 
expensive, less noisy, and more efficient than Peltier components.
Fanless/Passive
Fanless or passive cooling systems are those that either use a highly efficient heat sink or 
use some type of Liquid-Based Cooling to keep the CPU cool. Some use a thermal heat pipe 

64 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
in which liquid is turned to vapor at the hot end, moves as a vapor down the pipe, and then 
turns back into liquid at the cool end, where it is cycled around to the hot end and the pro-
cess starts again.

Physical Connections
Many different types of cables and connectors have been developed over the years to con-
nect devices to the PC. Some have been around almost as long as the PC, whereas many 
others have made their appearance only in the last few years. This section discusses the 
physical characteristics of each of these connection methods, along with the operational 
characteristics, such as the speed and maximum cable length.

1.7 Compare and Contrast Various PC Connection Interfaces

USB 1.1 vs. 2.0 vs. 3.0
USB is an expansion bus type that is used almost exclusively for external devices. All 
motherboards today have at least two USB ports. Some of the advantages of USB include 
hot-plugging and the capability for up to 127 USB devices to share a single set of system 
resources. A USB port requires only one IRQ for all USB devices that are connected to it, 
regardless of the type or number of devices. USB 1.1 runs at 12 Mbps and USB 2.0 runs at 
480 Mbps.
USB 3.0 has transmission speeds of up to 5 Gbps, significantly reduces the time required 
for data transmission, reduces power consumption, and is backward compatible with USB 
2.0. Because USB is a serial interface, its width is 1 bit. It is useful to note, however, that a 
USB 2.0 device will perform at 2.0 speeds even when connected to a 3.0 port.
By utilizing USB hubs in conjunction with the USB ports available on the local machine, 
you can connect up to 127 of these devices to the computer. You can daisy-chain up to four 
external USB hubs to a USB port. Daisy chaining means that hubs are attached to each 
other in a line. A USB hub will not function if it is more than four hubs away from the root 
port.
Connector Types: A, B, Mini, Micro
USB connectors come in two types and two form factors or sizes. The type A connector is 
what is found on USB hubs, on host controllers (cards that are plugged into slots to provide 
USB connections), and on the front and back panels of computers. Type B is the type of 
USB connector found on the end of the cable that plugs into the devices.
The connectors also come in a mini version and a micro version. The micro version is 
used on mobile devices, such as mobile phones, GPS units, PDAs, and digital cameras, 
whereas the mini is found in applications described in the previous paragraph. The choice 
between a standard A and B and a mini A and B will be dictated by what is present on 
the device. The cables used cannot exceed 5 meters in length. Figure 1.37 shows, from left 
to right, a standard Type A, a mini Type A, a standard Type B, and a mini Type B. Some 
manufacturers have chosen to implement a mini connector that is proprietary, choosing not 
to follow the standard.

in the past was more commonly provided on a PCI expansion board. It transfers data at 
400 Mbps and supports up to 63 chained devices on a single set of resources. It’s hot-plug-
gable, like USB. Figure 1.38 shows the connections on a FireWire card.
F i g u r e   1. 3 8     Connections on a FireWire card
FireWire 400 (IEEE 1394a) is the original standard that operates up to 400 Mbps with a maxi-
mum cable length of 4.5 meters. Now, however, there are cables that will support 10 meters.
FireWire 800 (IEEE 1394b) uses a different encoding scheme that allows it to go up to 
800 Mbps. It also can use a cable up to 10 meters.
SATA1 vs. SATA2 vs. SATA3, eSATA
Connections for storage devices can be either SATA or IDE. IDE was the only option early 
on, and then SATA came on the scene. SATA came out as a standard and was first adopted 
in desktops and then laptops. Whereas ATA had always been an interface that sends 16 bits 
at a time, SATA sends only one bit at a time. The benefit is that the cable used can be much 
smaller, and faster cycling can actually increase performance. SATA uses a seven-wire cable 
that can be up to 1 meter in length. eSATA cables can be up to 2 meters. Figure 1.39 shows 
the SATA and eSATA connectors.

Other Connector Types
A computer’s peripheral ports are the physical connectors outside the computer. Cables of 
various types are designed to plug into these ports and create a connection between the PC 
and the external devices that may be attached to it. A successful IT technician should have 
an in-depth knowledge of ports and cables.
Because the peripheral components need to be upgraded frequently, either to keep pace 
with technological change or to replace broken devices, a well-rounded familiarity with the 
ports and their associated cabling is required.
Unless a peripheral device connects directly to the motherboard, it must use a port. Ports 
can be distinguished from one another by three factors:
■
■
Bits of data simultaneously conveyed
■
■
Data transmission speed
■
■
Type of connector
Serial
A serial cable (and port) uses only one wire to carry data in each direction; all the rest are 
wires for signaling and traffic control.
Common bit rates include 1,200; 2,400; 4,800; 9,600; 14,400; 19,200; 38,400; 57,600; 
and 115,200 bits per second. The connector used for serial is a D-shaped connector with a 
metal ring around a set of pins. These are named for the number of pins/holes used: DB-25, 
DB-9, HD-15 (also known as DB-15), and so on. Figure 1.40 shows DB-25, DB-15, and 
DB-9. HD-15 is covered in the section “VGA.”
Parallel
A parallel cable uses eight wires to carry bits of data in each direction, plus extra wires for 
signaling and traffic control. The most common port of this type before the conversion of 
most printers to USB was the parallel printer port.

F i g u r e   1. 4 0     DB-25, DB-15, and DB-9
It sends data 8 bits at a time (in parallel) and uses a cable with a male DB-25 connector 
at the computer and a 36-pin Centronics male connector at the printer. Figure 1.40 shows a 
DB-25 connector, and Figure 1.41 shows a Centronics. Its main drawback is its cable length. 
Older-style Centronics parallel cables can sometimes be up to 15 feet long, although 9 feet to 12 
feet is more common. Depending on the mode of operation, it can provide up to 2.5 MBps of 
bandwidth. IEEE-1284, a newer bidirectional standard, can go up to 30 feet.
F i g u r e   1. 41    Centronics
Optical
Optical ports are beginning to appear on motherboards to accept a Toshiba Link 
(TOSLINK) cable. This cable is used to connect consumer audio gear that comes with the 
cable. These cables have several form factors but the most common is the digital connector 
using a rectangular EIAJ/JEITA RC-5720 connector. This connector and the plug on the 
computer are shown in the graphic below.

HDMI
High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) connectors are used to connect compatible 
digital items (DVD players and conference room projectors, for example). The Type A con-
nector has 19 pins and is backward compatible with DVI. Type B connectors have 29 pins 
and aren’t backward compatible with DVI, but they support greater resolutions. Type C con-
nectors are a smaller version of Type A for portable devices. Type D is an even smaller micro 
version that resembles a micro-USB connector. Type E is planned for use in automotive appli-
cations. HDMI theoretical cable length limit is 25. Figure 1.43 shows all HDMI types.

This is the traditional connector for the display of a computer, and it is shaped like a D. It 
has three rows of five pins each, for a total of 15 pins. This is also often called the HD-15 
(also known as DB-15) connector. A VGA cable carries analog signals. The cable length 
utilized will affect the resolution achieved: 1024×768 would operate more effectively with 
30 feet or less of cable length. As the need for resolution increases, the allowable maximum 
cable length decreases. Figure 1.42 shows a VGA port.

DVI
There are several types of Digital Video Interface (DVI) pin configurations, but all connec-
tors are D-shaped. The wiring differs based on whether the connector is single-linked or 
dual-linked (extra pins are used for the dual link). DVI differs from everything else in that 
it includes both digital and analog signals at the same time, which makes it popular for 
LCD and plasma TVs. Figure 1.44 shows DVI connectors. Maximum cable length is 16 feet 
(5 meters). These connectors are covered in more detail in the section “Identify Common 
PC Connector Types and Associated Cables.”

Wireless Connections and Their Quality
Wireless connections, once considered a luxury, are now becoming a standard expected 
by users. There are several forms of wireless communication that serve very different pur-
poses. These connection types differ in their speed, the distance at which they can operate, 
and the frequencies they use. This section discusses three common types of wireless com-
munication and their applications.
Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a type of wireless that creates what is called a personal area network (PAN). 
Bluetooth is a radio frequency technology that can connect a device to a computer at 
a range of about 35 feet. It operates in the 2.4 GHz band, which is the same band as 
802.11b/g. Version 2.0 offers 3 Mbps (with actual throughput of 2.1 Mbps).
IR
Infrared technology requires direct line of sight and has been used for printers in the past. 
It can operate at a distance of 5 meters and can offer up to 4 Mbps. It is being replaced 
with Bluetooth over time.
RF
Radio frequency (RF) describes any of the technologies, like Bluetooth, that use radio 
waves. This also includes 802.11 WLAN technologies. These operate in two frequencies: 
802.11b/g in the 2.4 GHz range and 802.11a and 802.11ac in the 5.0 GHz range. 802.11n 
can operate in both. These connections are used for networking. The ranges, speeds, 
and frequencies of these technologies are covered later in the section “Speed, Distance 
Limitations, and Frequencies.”
NFC
Near field communications (NFC) is a wireless technology that allows smartphones and 
other equipped devices to communicate when very near one another or when touching. 
NFC operates at slower speeds than Bluetooth but consumes far less power and doesn’t 
require pairing. It also does not create a PAN like Bluetooth; rather, the connections are 
point-to-point. NFC can operate up to 20 cm at a transfer rate of 0.424 Mbps.
NFC is also a standard managed by the ISO and uses tags that are embedded in the 
devices. NFC components include an initiator and a target; the initiator actively generates 
an RF field that can power a passive target. This enables NFC targets to take simple form 
factors such as tags, stickers, key fobs, or cards that do not require batteries.
Characteristics
This section will discuss the characteristics of PC connection interfaces.

1.7 Compare and Contrast Various PC Connection Interfaces 
73
Analog vs. Digital Transmission
Audio and video can be delivered in either analog or digital form. For video this means that 
there are two connector types you may find on the PC for connecting the display (or moni-
tor). Both types are discussed next.
VGA vs. HDMI
VGA connections and cables are analog in nature, and I’ve pretty much said all there is to 
say about this connector type. HDMI is an interface for transmitting encrypted uncom-
pressed digital data. When these connections are available, they are preferable to using the 
VGA connector, but they require the use of an HDMI cable between the computer and the 
display. When compared to HDMI, VGA cannot deliver the high resolutions that HDMI 
can.

Digital Rights Management
With the rapid increase in wireless usage of all types, the concern for controlling the leak-
age of data from an organization and the illegal sharing of content wirelessly is rising. The 

74 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) created a system called OMA digital rights management 
(DRM) that provides a way for content creators to set enforced limits on the use and dupli-
cation of their content by customers. This system has been implemented in more than 500 
mobile phone models at the time of this writing.
Exam Essentials
Identify the characteristics of connector types on most PCs.    These include but are not 
limited to USB, SATA, eSATA, FireWire, serial, parallel, VGA, HDMI, DVI, audio, RJ-45,

1.8 Install a Power Supply Based on 
Given Specifications
The power supply provides a number of connectors for various devices as well as a plug for 
the motherboard. It is important to understand these connector types and to appreciate the 
power drawn by various devices. Knowledge of the power needs of the devices can allow 
the technician to choose a power supply that provides the total power needs of the PC. The 
topics addressed in objective 1.8 include the following:

Specifications
Connector Types and Their Voltages
When selecting a power supply, two issues become important. You need to supply the total 
wattage required by all the devices and the motherboard of the PC, and you must ensure 
that it has the connector types required by your devices. This section discusses the voltage 
requirements of various connector types.

1.8 Install a Power Supply Based on Given Specifications 
75  
To determine the wattage a device draws, multiply voltage by current. For example, if a 
device uses 5 amps of +3.3 V and 0.7 amps of +12 V, a total of 25 watts is consumed. Do 
this calculation for every device installed. Most devices have labels that state their power 
requirements.
SATA
The SATA power connector is 15 pins, with 3 pins designated for 3.3 V, 5 V, and 12 V and 
with each pin carrying 1.5 amps. This results in a total draw of 4.95 watts + 7.5 watts + 18 
watts, or about 30 watts. Figure 1.48 shows the SATA power connector (the data cable was 
shown earlier in Figure 1.34).

Molex
A Molex connector is used to provide power to drives of various types. It has four pins, 
two of which have power (one 12 V and the other 5 V). These are standard for IDE (PATA) 
or older SCSI drives. The total power demands are from 5 to 15 watts for IDE and 10 to 40 
watts for SCSI. The four-pin Molex connector was shown earlier in Figure 1.19.
Four/Eight-Pin 12 V
With the introduction of the Pentium 4, the motherboard required more power. 
Supplemental power connections were provided to the motherboard in 4-, 6- (discussed 
later in this section), or 8-pin formats. These were in addition to the 20-pin connector (dis-
cussed later in this section) that was already provided.
There is a four-pin square mini version of the ATX connector, which supplies two pins 
with 12 V, and an eight-pin version (two rows) that has four 12 V leads. These connect to 

76 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
other items, such as the processor, or to other components, such as a network card that 
may need power that exceeds what can be provided with the ATX connection to the board. 
Figure 1.49 shows the eight-pin version and the four-pin square mini version.

PCIe Six/Eight-Pin
PCIe slots also draw more power and require power in addition to the main 20-pin connector 
(discussed next). These additional connectors can be six pins and may also contain an addi-
tional two-pin connector on the side for cases where the connection required is eight-pin.
20-Pin
The main ATX connector, referenced earlier, is a 20-pin connector. The four pins carrying 
power are 3.3 V, 3.3 V, 5 V, and 5 V. This allows the motherboard to pull about 20 to 30 
watts. Figure 1.50 shows the 20-pin ATX.

The 24-pin ATX connector is simply the 20-pin connector discussed earlier along with the 
extra 4-pin connector on the side. This provides the four pins carrying power as discussed 
earlier plus an additional four pins with 5 V standby, 12 V, 12 V, and 3.3. Figure 1.51 
shows the 24-pin ATX.

Specifications
When purchasing the power supply, you must take into account issues such as wattage, 
number of connectors, physical size or form factor, and plug types. This section addresses 
these considerations.
Wattage
When the wattage needs of each device and of the motherboard and CPU are totaled, you 
will know the wattage that the power supply must provide. A power supply has a rated 
output capacity in watts, and when you fill a system with power-hungry devices, you must 
make sure that maximum capacity isn’t exceeded. Otherwise, problems with power can 
occur, creating lockups or spontaneous reboots. Most power supplies provide between 250 
watts and 1,200 watts. It’s always a good idea to have more than the minimum required for 
the devices that are present so that additional devices can be added in the future.
Dual-Rail
Dual-rail power supplies are ones that use multiple wires or “rails” to supply the power 
rather than a single wire. While some think this will increase the amount of power that 
can be provided, that is not true. In fact, single rails deliver more power, but you are send-
ing more current over a single wire, which can overheat the wires. Manufacturers typically 

78 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
group several wires together and apply the current limit to the entire group. Almost all 
high-power supplies claim to implement separate rails.
Size
The physical dimension of the power supply must also be considered. The slot where the 
power supply goes in the PC will be the limiting factor. The thin form has been optimized 
for small and low-profile micro-ATX and FlexATX system layouts. The long, narrow pro-
file of this power supply fits easily into low-profile systems.
Number of Connectors
The power supply can come with any combination of the power connector types discussed 
earlier in this section. A quick inventory of the connectors that you need will assist you in 
ensuring that the power supply you purchase has the connectors required.
ATX
If the motherboard is an ATX (the larger motherboard), the power needs of the system 
will probably be higher than that of a micro-ATX. In that case, ensure that the supply is 
designed for an ATX system and can provide the higher requirements.
Micro-ATX
Micro-ATX boards are smaller and designed to operate with power supplies of a lower 
wattage rating. As you add more USB devices or put the board in a larger case with more 
internal devices, a larger power supply may become necessary.
Dual-Voltage Options
Most power supplies have the ability to accept input of either 110 or 220 volts. Some 
expensive power supplies can autosense and do not need to be set manually; however, most 
have to be set manually, and you want to set the switch to the correct voltage setting or you 
could cause damage. Figure 1.52 shows the typical position of this switch.

Specifications or Needs
In many cases, an off-the-shelf computer does not fill the needs of a customer. In these 
cases, a unit must be custom built to accommodate their specific needs. This section 
describes some common custom configurations and options to meet specific needs. The  
topics addressed in objective 1.9 include the following:

Graphic/CAD/CAM Design Workstation
Computers used for graphic design, computer-aided design (CAD) applications, and com-
puter-aided manufacturing (CAM) require much more horsepower than the standard PC. 
Specifically, they require multiple or more powerful processors, more robust video cards, 
and significantly more memory. In this section, these needs are discussed.

80 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Multicore Processor
The resource-intensive applications used with graphics, CAD, and CAM require high-end 
multicore processors. For example, to run a 64-bit version of Autodesk AutoCAD software, 
requirements are an AMD Athlon 64 with SSE2 technology, AMD Opteron processor with 
SSE2 technology, Intel Xeon processor with Intel EM64T support and SSE2 technology, or 
Intel Pentium 4 with Intel EM64T support and SSE2 technology.
Streaming Single Instruction, Multiple Data Extensions 2 (SSE2) technology is the lat-
est version of a technology that provides additional instructions to the CPU that allows it 
to perform a single instruction on multiple pieces of data. Moreover, to do 3D modeling 
(which is graphic intensive), an Intel 4 processor or AMD Athlon 3.0 GHz or greater is 
required. If a dual-core Intel or AMD dual-core processor is used, then it can be 2.0 GHz.
Keep in mind these are only the minimums. For good performance, these minimums 
should be exceeded.
High-End Video
As you can imagine, the video demands of graphics such as 3D are much higher than those 
of common office applications. Continuing with the example of AutoCAD 2012, this 
requires a 1,280×1,024 true-color video display adaptor with 128 MB of its own memory 
or greater and Pixel Shader 3.0 or greater, and it should be a Microsoft Direct3D-capable 
workstation-class graphics card. Note that the graphics card itself should have a minimum 
of 128 MB of RAM for its operations.
Maximum RAM
There can never be enough RAM, and in the case of CAD/CAM and graphics, the mini-
mum (using the same example) is 2 GB of RAM. When the minimum to run the software is 
2 GB, you need much more than that for good performance.
Audio/Video-Editing Workstation
As I go over the requirements of these specialty solutions, you may notice a recurring 
theme: RAM, CPU, and graphics. It’s no different with an audio- or video-editing machine. 
These are the components that are saddled with the workload and will be the ones that 
require boosting above what would be used on a standard workstation.
With audio and video editing, however, additional components can make the worksta-
tion more productive to the user. This section discusses those items.
Specialized Audio and Video Card
Many video- and audio-editing software packages come with a special capture card that 
works in concert with the accompanying software to provide ease of use. For example, 
it might be an internal PCI card that captures video from any analog or DV source. You 
can also output video to a VCR or an analog or DV camcorder from this card. They still 
require (you guessed it) a high-end audio and video card as well and plenty of memory and 
a processor that may not have quite the requirements of CAD/CAM but still should be 2.4 
GHz or higher.

1.9 Given a Scenario, Select the Appropriate Components for a Custom PC 
81
Large, Fast Hard Drive
Your hard drive should be at least 7,200 RPM. You will also want at least two drives if not 
three. When doing audio, use one for the operating system and programs and a second drive 
for audio files. When doing video, consider a third drive used exclusively for video files.
Even better, consider a RAID setup. Many motherboards include a SATA RAID 
controller built in. Use RAID 0 to enhance performance (see the section “RAID Types”).
Dual Monitors
Especially when doing video editing, a second monitor is well worth the money and the 
desk real estate. You may need to read or refer to something on one screen while using the 
other for the editing software. The material could be tutorials or source material.
It also may be that you move your tools (for example, Photoshop tools) to one screen so 
they don’t clutter the image you are working on.
Virtualization Workstation
A virtualization workstation is also called a virtualization host. The VMs that reside on 
this operating system are called guest operating systems. The host operating system and the 
guest must all share the total amount of RAM and CPU that the host machine possesses. 
This section discusses these issues.
Maximum RAM and CPU Cores
The amount of RAM that is required depends on the number of VMs that you anticipate 
operating at the same time, not how many exist on the desktop. Total the memory require-
ments of each VM that will be open at the same time, in addition to the requirements of the 
host operating system. That should be the minimum. Then add more for overhead to ensure 
performance.
The memory issue is not something you can fudge. If there is not enough memory, the VM 
will not start, and you will be notified with an error message that there is insufficient memory.
With regard to CPU, it should be dual- if not quad-core, and multiple CPUs would be 
even better.
Gaming PC
Gaming PCs may place the highest demands on the system of any specialty PC discussed 
here because the machines are in competition with other machines. The skill of the player 
is certainly a big factor in success, but at some point the user with the more powerful PC is 
going to be able to raise the level of the game through hardware.
Multicore Processor
When it comes to the processor, the question becomes “How much do you want to spend?” 
Just as a comparison (prices change daily!), for more than $600 you can get the Intel Core 
i7-3930K. (There is also the i7-3960X for $1,000.) Also keep in mind that multiple proces-
sors or multicore processors will always improve the gaming experience.

High-End Video/Specialized GPU
When playing a game, it is critical that the action you are seeing (and reacting to) is ren-
dered to the screen as quickly as possible. With gaming machines, dual GPU cards are often 
used. The higher-end cards also require water cooling of GPUs. In fact, the faster cards all 
need water cooling (covered later in this section).
High-Definition Sound Card
When you’re considering the features of a sound card, you want those features to be per-
formed in hardware. Anytime these functions are performed in software, it simply means 
the main CPU is going to get the workload. Also, you want to go with a high-definition 
card. The following are things to consider:
■
■
Using the PCI Express slot (better bandwidth) is better than using the PCI slot.
■
■
Make sure the card has its own onboard memory (less work for the main CPU).
■
■
If you are using a Mac, a Thunderbolt card is the way to go.
High-End Cooling
With all the heat being generated by the CPUs and GPUs, fans may not be sufficient to 
remove the heat. Water-cooling systems will cool the system better and will be quieter as 
well. Cooling kits circulate water through the case in tubes that enter and exit the box to a 
unit where the water is cooled again (think of the cooling system in your car). Figure 1.53 
shows a cooling system.

Home Theater PC
A home theater PC (HTPC) is a convergence device. It uses software to bring together 
video, photo, music playback, television content, and even video recording to a single com-
puter interface. Many operating systems today include this software. To take advantage of 
its capabilities, however, additional components need to be in place. This section discusses 
some of the components that will enhance the experience.
Surround Sound Audio
Surround sound speaker systems can add to the experience of the home theater PC. A num-
bering system has been developed that indicates the number and type of speakers present. 
The common setups are 2.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1. The number on the left is the total num-
ber of speakers, and the number on the right is the number of subwoofers (bass).
Don’t forget, you will need places to plug these speakers into the system. So, a new card 
with additional plugs may be called for, or a new-generation external sound processor that 
can plug into the USB slot may be the solution.
HDMI Output
In some cases, you want to direct the content from your PC to a more suitable viewing 
device such as your big-screen TV. That is best accomplished with an HDMI plug from 
the PC to the TV. If the PC does not have multiple outlets for video, you may need to get a 
graphics card that provides these outlets. If you do that, make sure the card has an HDMI 
plug. If you are lucky, there will be one of these plugs present on the PC. Figure 1.54 shows 
an HDMI plug.
F i g u r e   1. 5 4     HDMI plug
HTPC Compact Form Factor
An HTPC that appears in the small form factor is one that is smaller in size and shape 
when compared to a regular PC while still providing the capabilities required. In some 
cases, they are cubical in shape, and in other cases they resemble a DVR or mini audio 
receiver. Other changes to the layout include placing all ports in the front. Figure 1.55 
shows an example.

F i g u r e   1. 5 5     Compact form factor
TV Tuner
If you want to receive TV signals on the HTPC, you will need a TV tuner card. These can 
be installed internally in a slot, or they can be external units connected with the USB port. 
They also can be analog, digital, or both (although broadcast analog TV has been discon-
tinued in the United States since 2009). If recording the TV content is required, the card 
must also be a video capture card.
In cases where it is desired to watch one stream of content while recording another 
stream, a card that has two tuners in it must be used. These are called combo tuners.
Standard Thick Client
When discussing thin and thick clients, you should understand that a thick client is a PC 
that has all the capabilities of a standard PC. It runs all applications locally from its own 
hard drive. A thin client (discussed in the next section) is one that has minimal capabili-
ties and runs the applications (and perhaps even the operating system itself) from a remote 
server.
Desktop Applications
A thick client has the applications installed locally and will need to have sufficient resources 
to support the applications. Applications state these requirements in the documentation. 
With a thick client, since all application support will come from the local machine, these 
requirements must be met to use the software.

1.9 Given a Scenario, Select the Appropriate Components for a Custom PC 
85
Meets Recommended Requirements for Selected  
Operating System
A standard thick client will need to provide all the hardware requirements of the installed 
operating system. This is because unlike the thin client (discussed in the next section) none 
of the processing will be offloaded to a server. It all must be supplied by the thick client. 
Requirements for various operating systems are covered in Chapter 5, “Windows Operating 
Systems,” and Chapter 6, “Other Operating Systems and Technologies.”
Thin Client
A thin client is a PC with minimal resources. Such a system is responsible only for receiving 
the processed output of an operating system and application running on a server and ren-
dering the output in the screen.
The latest example of this is a computer running the Windows Thin PC (WinTPC) oper-
ating system, which is designed to run on older hardware.
Basic Applications
Some applications are created to function in a client-server architecture. When these 
are used in a thin client, the client side of the application operates on the thin client but 
requires minimal system resources. The server side of the application performs all the 
processing, and the client side simply renders the output to the display and transmits 
keystrokes to the server.
Meets Minimum Requirements for Selected Operating System
Even thin client operating systems have minimum requirements. Follow the documented 
requirements to ensure good performance. In many cases, older computers that are of no 
use because thick clients are suitable candidates to be thin clients.
Network Connectivity
Most traditional thin clients come with a NIC built in. They require the same settings that 
any networked device does, including IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. These 
can be static configuration, or the device can receive these through DHCP.
Home Server PC
Many homes and small offices have a network of computers to rival a small enterprise. In 
these cases, sometimes it makes sense to centralize the location of resources for both ease 
of use and security of information. There are even home server operating systems made, but 
that is not required to make a PC a home server. This section discusses some common roles 
of a home server.

86 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Media Streaming
The home server can act as a streaming media server to other computers in the home net-
work if the operating system provides this capability. An example of such an operating 
system is Windows Home Server. Once the streaming feature is enabled, other systems can 
use their Windows Media Players to connect to any shared content and stream that content 
to the other PC. One of the benefits of this is centralized storage of the content and reduced 
duplication of the content on other machines in the network. This type of server should 
have plenty of disk space and memory.
File Sharing
For the same reasons that centralized storage of media content reduces content duplica-
tion in the network, so can file sharing from a home server. Another great benefit of this 
is a central location to perform regular backups of the files so that this does not need to 
be done on all the other machines in the network. This server should have plenty of disk 
space.
Print Sharing
Centralized control of printing can also be done with a home server. The machine can 
be the print server for all home printers. When done this way, printer permissions can be 
used to control who does what to the printers as well as whose print jobs get priority in a 
crunch. Print servers needs extra memory.
Gigabit NIC
When a machine is acting as the home server for all these functions, the network card will 
be busy. For that reason, it is probably a good idea to ensure that it is a Gigabit NIC, which 
allows it to operate 10 times faster than the standard 100 MB NIC. Make sure that the 
cabling supports 1 GB, or you will be wasting your time and money.
RAID Array
To speed the access to data or to provide fault tolerance to any data stored on the home 
server, consider using multiple hard drives and implementing a RAID 0, RAID 1, or RAID 
5 hard disk system. See the section “RAID Types.”
Exam Essentials
Describe the specific requirements of specialty workstations.    These include but are not 
limited to graphic, CAD, CAM, audio/video editing, virtualization, gaming, home theater, 
and home server systems.
Identify the difference between a thick and a thin client.    A thick client runs the operating 
system and applications from the local hard drive, whereas a thin client runs these compo-
nents from a remote server.

1.10 Compare and Contrast Types of 
Display Devices and Their Features
The possibilities for displaying the content from a PC used to consist of two options, cath-
ode ray tube (CRT) technology found in television sets or the liquid crystal display (LCD) 
technology found on all laptop, notebook, and palmtop computers. That is no longer the 
case. Now this output can be directed to a number of different devices employing several 
technologies. This section discusses these options. The topics addressed in objective 1.10

Types
Today, users need to redirect the content from the PC to other devices besides the regular 
monitor. Even within the monitor category, various technologies are employed to present 
content to a user from a computer device. This section discusses devices to which computer 
content may be directed, along with competing technologies for rendering the content.
LCD
LCDs have almost completely replaced CRTs as the default display type for both laptops 
and desktops. Two major types of LCDs are used today: active matrix screens and passive 
matrix screens. Their main differences lie in the quality of the image. Both types use some 
kind of lighting behind the LCD panel to make the screen easier to view. One or more small 
fluorescent tubes are used to backlight the screen.
Passive Matrix    A passive matrix screen uses a row of transistors across the top of the 
screen and a column of them down the side. It sends pulses to each pixel at the intersection 
of each row and column combination, telling it what to display. Passive matrix displays are 
becoming obsolete because they’re less bright and have poorer refresh rates and image qual-
ity than active matrix displays. However, they use less power than active matrix displays 
do.

88 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Active Matrix    An active matrix screen uses a separate transistor for each individual pixel 
in the display, resulting in higher refresh rates and brighter display quality. These screens 
use more power, however, because of the increased number of transistors that must be pow-
ered. Almost all notebook PCs today use active matrix. A variant called thin-film transistor 
(TFT) uses multiple transistors per pixel, resulting in even better display quality.
TN vs. IPS
There are two major LCD technologies used in LCDs. This section discusses the pros and 
cons of each.
Twisted Nematic (TN)    Twisted nematic (TN) is the older of the two major technologies 
for flat-panel displays. While it provides the shortest response time, high brightness, and 
draws less power than competing technologies, it suffers from poor quality when viewed 
from wide angles. It suffers color distortions when viewed from above or from the sides.
In-Plane Switching (IPS)    This is a newer technology that solves the issue of poor quality 
at angles other than straight on. It also provides better color quality. However, it has much 
slower response time and is more expensive. Newer versions like Super-IPS (SIPS) make 
improvements on the response time.
Fluorescent vs. LED Backlighting
LCDs can use two kinds of backlighting: LED-based and fluorescent. Fluorescent is an 
older technology and consists of a fluorescent tube connected to a voltage inverter board 
that provides power to the backlight. LED-based is a newer technology and uses a matrix 
of LEDs for the backlighting. Table 1.9 compares the two technologies.

LED
LED-based monitors are still LCDs (they still use liquid crystals to express images 
onscreen), but they use a different type of backlight than what is normally used. Several 
types of backlights are used with LED.

1.10 Compare and Contrast Types of Display Devices and Their Features 
89  
The most common for computers is white LEDs (WLEDs). Using a special diffuser, the 
light is spread to cover the entire screen. A more expensive type is RGB LED. Instead of 
using WLEDs on one edge of the screen, with RGB LCD layers, like the previous technol-
ogy, RGB LEDs are aligned all over the panel matrix. Each LED is capable of red-, green-, 
or blue-colored light. This gives the display more accurate color than WLEDs. Finally, there 
is WLED on a flat array, covering the entire screen (like an RGB LED using only WLEDs). 
Currently, it’s used only in LED-backlit HDTVs. As you’ve seen, however, computer output 
can be directed to the HDTV screen.
Plasma
Plasma displays utilize small cells containing ionized gases, similar to what is used in 
fluorescent lamps. They have the advantage of high-quality picture, wider viewing angles, 
and less motion blur—but they have the disadvantage of screen burn-in and high energy 
requirements.
They have mainly been used for TV displays but now can be purchased simply as display 
monitors that accept output from a variety of devices, including PCs.
Projector
In the business world, it is frequently necessary to share the desktop with others in a meet-
ing. This is easily accomplished by directing the output of the PC to a projector. The projec-
tor can be plugged into the same connector as the monitor, and in most cases both can be 
used at the same time. Some projectors require an HDMI connector.
OLED
Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology uses a layer of organic compound with 
emissive electroluminescent qualities to emit light in response to an electric current. This 
organic layer resides between two electrodes. Although it uses no backlight, it results in a 
higher-contrast ratio than an LCD in low-light conditions.
This technology is currently expensive, and the materials used have a limited life span. 
As of this writing, 17-inch models with LED technology run close to $5,000.
Refresh/Frame Rate
A monitor’s refresh rate specifies how many times in one second the scanning beam of 
electrons redraws the screen. The phosphors stay bright for only a fraction of a second, 
so they must constantly be hit with electrons to stay lit. Given in draws per second, or 
hertz (Hz), the refresh rate affects how much energy is being put into keeping the screen 
lit. Most people notice a flicker in the display at refresh rates of 75 Hz or lower because 
the phosphors begin to decay to black before they’re revived; increasing the refresh rate 
can help reduce eyestrain by reducing the flickering. CRTs experienced a refresh flicker 
that was often visible to the naked eye. This is no longer a problem with newer LCD 
monitors.

90 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
The frame rate, or frame frequency, is the frequency at which an imaging device pro-
duces unique consecutive images called frames. It is a description of the number of frames 
per second that the card writes to the buffer, while the refresh rate refers to how often the 
screen is drawn from the data coming from the buffer. That means the refresh rate depends 
on the display, and the frame rate depends on the application writing data to the buffer.
If the application writes data at a rate faster than the display can refresh, then some 
visual data will be lost because screen buffer updates will be overwritten by the application 
before the display refresh occurs. This results in what is typically called screen tearing.
Resolution
The resolution of a monitor is the number of horizontal and vertical pixels that are dis-
played. Most monitors allow for two or more resolutions, and you can pick the one to use 
in the desktop settings of the operating system. On a CRT, the vertical hold (V-hold) setting 
can be tweaked to make the image appear properly in the monitor.
Display resolutions include the following:
VGA    Video graphics array is a 320×200 resolution and uses analog technology.
XGA    Extended graphics array has been around since 1990. It’s a 1,024×768 resolution 
that offers fixed-function hardware acceleration for 2D tasks.
SXGA+    Super extended graphics array is a 1,400×1,050 resolution commonly used on 14- 
or 15-inch laptops. It’s typically considered the maximum resolution that video projectors 
will work with.
UXGA    Ultra-extended graphics array is a 1,600×1,200 resolution and is the next step in 
the monitor-resolution evolution.
WUXGA    Widescreen ultra-extended graphics array is a resolution of 1,920×1,200 with a 
16:10 screen aspect ratio. It’s also a standard for use with television sets, at a slightly differ-
ent ratio.
Native Resolution
The native resolution of a display refers to its single fixed resolution. An LCD cannot 
change resolution to match the signal being displayed like a CRT monitor can, meaning 
that optimal display quality can be reached only when the signal input matches the native 
resolution. Most LCD monitors are able to inform the PC of their native resolution.
Brightness/Lumens
Contrast ratio is a measurement of the brightness of the LCD panels. A general rule of 
thumb is the greater the contrast ratio, the brighter the display can be, and thus a rating of 
3,000:1 is preferred over 800:1.
You can adjust the brightness by using the controls that are usually found on the front 
of the monitor, but keep in mind that these adjustments will be less refined than if you use 
a calibration program. Standard symbols are used to represent brightness; the location 

1.10 Compare and Contrast Types of Display Devices and Their Features 
91  
and operation of these controls vary from monitor to monitor. Use the documentation that 
came with your monitor.
Analog vs. Digital
As described in the section “VGA vs. HDMI,” VGA connections and cables are analog in nature, 
and HDMI and DVI are interfaces for transmitting encrypted uncompressed digital data.
CRT monitors require the signal information in analog. In those cases, the video adap-
tor converts digital data into analog. DVI and HDMI maintain the information in digital 
format through the process with no need for conversion. Some DVI connectors will support 
both analog and digital.
Privacy/Antiglare Filters
Privacy and antiglare filters fit over the front of a display screen and either reduce the glare 
on the screen or, in the case of privacy filters, make it difficult if not impossible to read 
the monitor unless you are squarely in front of it, which helps to reduce eavesdropping or 
shoulder surfing. In situations where high-security information will be displayed on the 
desktop, a privacy filter may be called for. When the workstation is facing sunlight, an anti-
glare filter may be beneficial.
Multiple Displays
Most PCs allow you to use multiple monitors as long as there is a display card installed for 
each. Although this can be useful for running a window for each monitor, one of the most 
common uses is the Presenter View in Microsoft PowerPoint. When chosen, this allows a 
different view of the slideshow to be shown on the main monitor (typically a projector) than 
what is shown on the secondary monitor (such as presenter notes, the next slide that is set 
to appear, and so forth). Multiple displays can present the same desktop on both displays 
(mirroring) or can be set up as a large single desktop, which is called extending the desktop. 
Multiple displays are beneficial in any cases where many windows or documents need to open 
at the same time, especially if copying and pasting may be called for between the windows.
Aspect Ratios
Aspect ratio describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height and is 
usually expressed as a ratio such as 16:9, where the first value is the width and the second 
is the length. Keep in mind the values are not inches or centimeters or any other absolute 
value, but describe the proportional relationship between the two. Three standard aspect 
ratios are discussed here:
4:3    At one time most monitors had a 4:3 aspect ratio. This continued until about 2006.
16:10    Starting about 2006, the 16:10 aspect ratio began to replace the 4:3 aspect ratio, as 
the use of “square” monitors began to decline.

92 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
16:9    In about 2008, this ratio, sometimes referred to as sixteen-nine began to replace 
both 16:10 and 4:3. By 2010, virtually all manufacturers had moved to 16:9.

Types and Associated Cables
A wide variety of connector types and cables are used to hook together the parts and 
pieces of a PC system. This section briefly reviews the connectors and cables that have

Display Connector Types
Connecting the monitor to the PC can be accomplished with many different connector 
types. In this section, for those types that have been covered earlier, I’ll provide a reference 
to the section discussing them.
DVI-D
DVI connectors can come in several forms. You may remember that DVI can sometimes 
do analog and digital at the same time. DVI-D (the D stands for digital) connectors supply 
digital signals only. These can also come in a single- or dual-link format. A dual-link for-
mat allows for a second data link.

DVI-I
A DVI-I connector (the I stands for integrated) has pins that can provide analog and digital. 
These can also come in a single- or dual-link format.
DVI-A
A DVI-A connector (the A stands for analog) has pins that can provide analog and digital. 
This type comes in a single-link format only. Figure 1.56 shows the various types of DVI 
plugs discussed in this section.

RCA
RCA plugs are sometimes used for audio and video in the same way that mini-TRS con-
nectors are (see the “Audio” section under “Other Connector Types”). They are nearly the 
same size but look quite different. Figure 1.58 shows a set of these connectors.

example.

BNC
Bayonet Neill–Concelman (BNC) connectors are sometimes used in the place of RCA con-
nectors for video electronics, so you may encounter these connectors, especially when video 
equipment connects to a PC. In many cases, you may be required to purchase an adaptor to 
convert this to another form of connection because it is rare to find one on the PC. Figure 
1.60 shows male and female BNC connectors.

1.11 Identify Common PC Connector Types and Associated Cables

miniHDMI
The miniHDMI is a small form-factor version of HDMI. It is intended for portable devices 
such as a camcorder. Cables that are made to connect a portable device to a PC will have a 
miniHDMI connector on one end and a standard HDMI (type A) connector on the other. 
A miniHDMI connector (type C) was shown in Figure 1.43.
miniDIN-6
MiniDIN connectors come with a number of different pin arrangements and are used in 
various applications. A six-pin version, miniDIN-6, is used to connect to some projectors 
and speaker systems. When connecting those devices to the PC, you may encounter this 
plug. As with the BNC connector, it may require a converter to a connection type that 
exists on the PC, such as USB. Figure 1.61 shows a six-pin miniDIN.

Display Cable Types
Cables must match the connector. This section provides a quick survey of the cables that go 
with the various connectors.
HDMI    HDMI cables are rated by the resolution they can provide. Category 2 (also called 
high speed) provides better resolution than Category 1. These also differ in acceptable 
length. Category 1 is best at 5 meters, whereas Category 2 can be up to 15 meters.
DVI    When purchasing DVI cables, you should make note of the connector type that 
exists on the PC. The cable connector must be the same type as the PC. Review the section 
“Display Connector Types.”

96 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
VGA    VGA cables are quite common and come in lengths up to 50 feet. They have an 
HD-15 (or DB-15a) female connector on one end and a DB-15 male connector on the other.
Component    Component video is a video signal that has been split into two or more component 
channels. It is transmitted or stored as three separate signals. There will typically be three color-
coded plugs on the cable that connect to the same color plug on the PC or the video device.
Composite    Composite video combines the signal into one line-level signal, so there is one 
plug on the connector, usually an RCA plug.
Coaxial    When BNC cables are used, the cable type will be coaxial. See the BNC section 
in “Display Connector Types.”
Device Cables and Connectors
As with display connectors, there are a wide variety of connector and cable types for the other 
devices in the PC. This includes internal devices as well as peripherals. In this section, the 
most common connectors are discussed along with the pin-outs. In many cases, the number 
of pins and their arrangement is the only way to differentiate two connector types with com-
mon form factors. In cases where the connector has been discussed, a reference is provided to 
the section where the connector was discussed. Following that section is one on cable types.
SATA    Internal SATA storage devices have a 7-pin data connection and a 15-pin power connec-
tion. Those connections sit next to one another on the SATA device, as shown in Figure 1.62.

mouse and the keyboard. These have been replaced for the most part with USB mice and 
keyboards. Figure 1.64 shows the PS/2 connectors.

with the various connectors.
SATA    Internal SATA storage devices have 7-pin data cables and a 15-pin power cable. 
Figure 1.65 shows a SATA data cable.

eSATA    eSATA cables may be either flat or round and can be only 2 meters in length. An 
eSATA connector was shown in Figure 1.63.
USB    USB cables were discussed in the section “USB 1.1 vs. 2.0 vs. 3.0,” and the micro 
and mini versions were displayed in Figure 1.37.
IEEE 1394    IEEE 1394 (FireWire) was discussed in the section “FireWire 400 vs. FireWire 
800.” The cables look very much like USB cables.
Adaptors and Converters
In many cases, you will need to attach a device to a computer on which the correct connec-
tors is not present. In these cases, there are adaptors (converters) and connectors that can 
be used to connect the device to a connector type for which it was not designed. In this sec-
tion, you’ll look at some of the more common of these.
DVI to HDMI
These adaptors connect from HDMI to DVI and come in a number of gender combinations (male

1.12 Install and Configure Common 
Peripheral Devices
Installing devices is much easier today than it was at one time. In most cases, the device 
is detected and set up for you by the operating system as soon as you plug it in. This sec-
tion discusses any deviations from that along with any special issues related to a particular 
device type. The topics addressed in objective 1.12 include the following:
■
■
Input devices
■
■
Output devices
■
■
Input and output devices
Input Devices
Input devices allow you to communicate with the PC either by clicking an item or by 
using the keyboard. This category also includes devices that allow you to import infor-
mation into the system in other ways. This section discusses the installation of each 
device.
Mouse
Mice are typically USB devices these days and require you only to plug them in; in moments 
they are functional. In some rare cases (especially for a mouse with special capabilities), you 
may need to install a driver for the mouse. These types typically have a CD you can access 
that will install those drivers for you.
Keyboard
Keyboards can be treated the same as mice. Follow the guidelines in the section on mice.
Scanner
Scanners are used to convert paper documents or photographs to digital files so they can be 
stored on a PC and transmitted as files across the network. The installation process is much 
like a print device. Because so many of these now are USB, plugging them in will install the 
driver. In cases where that does not work (usually when it is a new model and the operating 
system is older), use the installation disc to install the driver.
Barcode Reader
Barcode readers read and input codes used to identify products. They are used in ware-
houses and at retail checkouts. Once you plug the device into either the serial or the USB 
connector, you need to install the software that comes with the reader. Use the installation 
disc that comes with the reader.

1.12 Install and Configure Common Peripheral Devices 
103  
F i g u r e   1.7 3     DB-15 game port
GAME
Microphone
Microphones are simple to install. Typically, all you do is plug them into the mini-TRS con-
nector. There are usually two of these: one for headphones (or speakers) and the other for a 
microphone (or line in). In some systems, you may be prompted to specify the mic or line in 
when you plug in a headset. A 3.5-mm plug was shown in Figure 1.45.
Biometric Devices
Biometric devices allow for inputting information used to authenticate or identify a user to 
the system. That input may be a retina scan or a fingerprint, for example. Use the installa-
tion disc that comes with the device. In most cases, you should install the software before 
you plug in the device (usually USB). During the installation process of the software, at 
some point you will be told to connect the device. Follow the instructions.
Game Pads
You may begin to notice a pattern. Game pads are also usually USB and install in the same 
way as biometric devices and barcode readers. Install the software and connect the device 
when instructed. One additional thing you may need to do with the game pad is to calibrate 
it. Once it’s installed, locate the device in Control Panel in the correct section (usually Game 
Controllers), open the properties of the device, and click the option Calibrate. Follow the 
instructions. This will make it operate correctly. Some game pads require a DB-15 serial port, 
as shown in Figure 1.73.
Joysticks
Joysticks use the same guidelines and instructions as game pads and usually the same connectors.
Digitizer
Digitizers are pad-like devices that allow you to write and draw on the pad and input that 
to a digital file. Treat the installation of these devices in the same way as the other devices 
in this section. Install the software first and connect the digitizer when instructed to do so.
Motion Sensor
Motion sensors can be used to allow control of the computer using hand gestures. It allows 
you to control an operating system with your hands and fingers and never touch a mouse 
or keyboard. It also can be used in PC gaming when developers integrate these controls in 

104

their games as they build them. Figure 1.74 shows a USB-based motion sensor. The device 
is a small rectangular cube that you plug into your computer via the USB drive. To install 
these, you simply connect them and if the operating system does not have the drivers, 
provide these drivers during installation.

Touchpads
While touchpads come on laptops, you can also buy add-on touchpads. These allow you to per-
form basic mouse functions on the device. In most cases, they use a USB connector. To install 
them, you simply connect them and if the operating system does not have the drivers, provide 
these drivers during installation. Figure 1.75 shows an external touchpad and a laptop.
F i g u r e   1.74     Motion sensor
Smart Card Readers
Smart card readers are used to accept input from a smart card, which is a credit card–sized 
piece of plastic that can be used to input credentials securely. They are small and usually 
USB based, as shown in Figure 1.76. To install them, you simply connect them and if the 
operating system does not have the drivers, provide these drivers during installation.

1.12 Install and Configure Common Peripheral Devices 
105  
Digital Cameras
Digital cameras usually connect to the PC with a USB cable. In many cases, the operating system 
comes with software that may detect the camera and assist you in accessing the pictures and mov-
ing them to the computer. In other instances, you may want to install software that came with the 
camera. Doing so will often allow you to take fuller advantage of the features the camera offers. 
SD cards can be used to transfer images from the camera if a cable is not available.
Microphone
Follow the instructions in the earlier section “Input Devices.” In some cases, the connector 
on the microphone may not be one that is present on the PC. You may be able to purchase a 
converter to match the input on the PC.
Webcam
First install the software that came with the webcam (sound familiar?) and then connect 
the webcam to the USB port when instructed. If the webcam has been out for some time 
and the operating system is new, it may be possible to just plug in the camera and let the 
operating system set it up.
Camcorder
Treat camcorders like cameras for the purpose of installation. If the camcorder is an older 
analog model, you will need to install a signal digitizer. If you have a TV tuner card pres-
ent, it can perform the conversion.
MIDI-Enabled Devices
Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is an industry specification for encoding, stor-
ing, synchronizing, and transmitting musical performance information, basically allowing 
you to digitally record a musical instrument.
The MIDI controller (usually an instrumental keyboard) connects to the PC using MIDI 
cables, which use a five-pin DIN connector. Since most computers don’t have these, you 
may need to buy a MIDI-to-USB converter cable. Some specialized sound cards come with 
a MIDI port.
F i g u r e   1.76     Smart card reader

106 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
To use the controller, you install the software and then connect the MIDI device. The 
software will install the driver for the device. Once that is taken care of, install the record-
ing software of choice. If the installation of the device went correctly, the recording soft-
ware should recognize the MIDI controller and allow you to record from it.
Output Devices
Output devices allow you to print, listen to, or view information from the PC. The installa-
tion of these devices is remarkably like that of input devices.
Printers
Printers and their installation are covered in the “Compare and Contrast Differences 
Between the Various Print Technologies and the Associated Imaging Process” section later 
in this chapter.
Speakers
Installing speakers is more a matter of connecting them properly than installing them. 
Usually, one of the speakers will connect to a power source and the other will connect to 
the powered speaker. Once they are connected to a power source, connect the speaker cable 
to the proper plug in the PC. These plugs will be marked with icons that indicate which is 
for a microphone and which is for speakers.
Display Devices
Before connecting or disconnecting a monitor, ensure that the power to both the PC and 
the monitor is off. Then, connect a VGA (DB-15) cable from the monitor to the PC’s video 
card, and connect the monitor’s power cord to an AC outlet. If a better connection is avail-
able (DVI, for example), use it.
Input and Output Devices
There are also several dual-purpose input/output devices.
Touchscreen
Touchscreen monitors allow you to interact with the screen instead of using the mouse. 
These monitors may require installing a driver to function. Use the CD that comes with 
the device to install the driver. Touchscreens also require calibration. Most vendors include 
calibration software with the installation disc.
KVM
A keyboard, video, and mouse (KVM) device allows you to plug multiple PCs (usually 
servers) into the device and to switch easily back and forth from system to system using 

1.13 Install SOHO Multifunction Devices 
107
the same mouse, monitor, and keyboard. The KVM is actually a switch that all the 
systems plug into. There is usually no software to install. Just turn off all the systems, 
plug them all into the switch, and turn them back on; then you can switch from one to 
another using the same keyboard, monitor, and mouse device connected to the KVM 
switch.
Smart TV
A smart TV is one with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 features. These devices can pro-
vide Internet TV (receiving a TV signal from an Internet connection), online interactive 
media, over-the-top content (content that arrives from a third party), as well as on-demand 
streaming media and home networking access. “Installing” a smart TV really consists of 
connecting it to the Internet, which can be done in several ways.
■
■
Some devices have an Ethernet jack on the back of the TV, and you can use that 
option.
■
■
Other devices have wireless capability, and you need to connect the smart TV to your 
home wireless network.
■
■
Some will allow you to connect to the Internet though a gaming console.
■
■
Finally, you can connect some to a computer or laptop that in turn has Internet 
access.
Set-Top Box
Another option for getting content to a TV is to use a set-top box. These are appliances 
that contain a TV-tuner input and display output to a television set or other display device. 
Some can accept input from multiple sources (cable, satellite, and so on). They are used in 
cable television, satellite television, and over-the-air television systems. The exact manner in 
which they are installed and the specific connectors they require to be on the TV vary, so it 
is important to determine beforehand if the set-top box can be used with the TV based on 
the connectors present on both devices.
Exam Essentials
Install input devices.    These include the mouse, keyboard, scanner, barcode reader, 
biometric devices, game pads, joysticks, digitizer, motion sensor, touchpads, smart 
card readers, digital cameras, microphone, webcam, camcorder, and MIDI-enabled 
devices.
Install output devices.    These include printers, speakers, and display devices. Take appropriate 
precautions if encountering an LCD.
Install devices that are both input and output.    These include but are not limited to touch-
screen devices, KVMs, smart TVs, and set-top boxes.

Printers and Configure Appropriate Settings
Printers are one of the most common elements in any computing environment, from home 
to office. The range they cover is phenomenal—everything from a free printer included by a 
vendor with the purchase of a PC up to a monolith in a large office churning out hundreds 
of pages a minute. Regardless of where a printer falls in that spectrum, they are all the same 
in that they must be installed and properly configured to be of use. Moreover, most printing 
devices today are multifunction devices. They print, scan, and fax in various combinations.
The topics addressed in objective 1.13 include the following:
■
■
Using appropriate drivers for a given operating system
■
■
Configuration settings
■
■
Device sharing
■
■
Integrated print server (hardware)
■
■
Cloud printing/remote printing
■
■
Public/shared devices
Printing Components
Printing components are not a topic of objective 1.13, but they are something that will be 
helpful for you to understand in the real world. In addition to the physical body of the printer, 
components and consumables are associated with it. Components include the following:
Memory    As a general rule, the more memory a laser printer has, the better. The mem-
ory is used to hold the print jobs in the printer queue; the more users and the larger the 
print jobs, the more memory you’ll want. Dot-matrix and inkjet printers contain little 
memory, the former using only a buffer to hold a few characters.
Drivers    These are the software components of the printer—allowing the device to commu-
nicate with the operating system. It’s important to always have the correct and most current 
drivers for the greatest efficiency. The printer drivers vary based on the operating system being 
used on the client computer, and if a printer is attached to more than one operating system, 
you have to make sure you have the appropriate driver for each operating system in use.
Firmware    Although drivers can be updated, firmware rarely is. Firmware is installed on 
the printer and can be thought of as the operating system for that device.
Consumables for printers are those items you must change as you use the printer—the vari-
able items that get consumed and must be replenished. These include toner (or ink, depend-
ing on the type of printer you’re using) and paper. Be sure to always order and use the correct 
grade of consumables that are recommended for your machine. For example, don’t use inkjet 
media in a laser printer or you will run the risk of the laser printer’s fuser melting it.

1.13 Install SOHO Multifunction Devices 
109
Using Appropriate Drivers for a Given Operating System
Besides understanding the printer’s operation, for the exam you need to understand how 
these devices talk to a computer. The driver software controls how the printer processes the 
print job. When you install a printer driver for the printer you are using, it allows the com-
puter to print to that printer correctly (assuming you have the correct interface configured 
between the computer and printer). Also keep in mind that drivers are specific to the operat-
ing system, so you need to select the one that is both for the correct printer and for the correct 
operating system.
An interface is the collection of hardware and software that allows the device to com-
municate with a computer. Each printer, for example, has at least one interface, but some 
printers have several to make them more flexible in a multiplatform environment. If a 
printer has several interfaces, it can usually switch between them on the fly so that several 
computers can print at the same time.
Configuration Settings
You need to be familiar with the various settings that are available and what these 
settings do. This section covers the more common settings, features, and characteristics 
of printers.
Duplex    An optional component that can be added to printers (usually laser but also ink-
jet) is a duplexer. This can be an optional assembly added to the printer, or built into it, but 
the sole purpose of duplexing is to turn the printed sheet over so it can be run back through 
the printer and allow printing on both sides.
Collate    Collating is the process of arranging the output of a print job so that multiple 
individual sets of the output are in proper order. A collator is a unit that if present on the 
printer will allow the printer to collate.
Orientation    The orientation of a document refers to how the printed matter is laid out 
on the page. In the landscape orientation, the printing is written across the paper turned 
on its long side, while in portrait the paper is turned up vertically and printed top to 
bottom.
Quality    Print quality is a description of the look of the printing, its sharpness, and its 
color depth. It is impacted by the quality of the paper, the speed of the printing process, 
and the resolution settings. It can also be affected by the DPI setting. This setting controls 
the size of objects on the screen and therefore their quality. As you increase the size of an 
object, its quality will usually decrease a bit.
Device Sharing
Printer sharing covers the hardware technologies involved in getting the information to and 
from the computer. There are several types, which can be broken into two broad categories: 
wired and wireless.

110 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Wired
The wired forms of connection this exam test on are USB, parallel, serial, and Ethernet. 
Each is addressed in the sections that follow.
USB    The most popular type of printer interface as this book is being written is USB. It’s 
the most popular interface for just about every peripheral. The benefits for printers are that 
it has a higher transfer rate than either serial or parallel and it automatically recognizes 
new devices. USB is also fully Plug and Play, and it allows several printers to be connected 
at once without adding ports or using up additional system resources.
Serial    This is the traditional RS-232 serial port found on most PCs. The original printer 
interface on the earliest computers, it has fallen out of favor and is seldom used anymore 
for printing because it’s so slow.
Ethernet    Most large-environment printers (primarily laser and LED printers) have a special 
interface that allows them to be hooked directly to a network. These printers have a NIC and 
ROM-based software that let them communicate with networks, servers, and workstations.
Wireless
The wireless forms of connection included on this exam are Bluetooth, 802.11x, and 
Infrared (IR). Each is addressed in the sections that follow.
Bluetooth    Bluetooth is an infrared technology that can connect a printer to a computer at a 
short range; its absolute maximum range is 100 meters (330 feet), and most devices are specified 
to work within 10 meters (33 feet). When printing with a Bluetooth-enabled device (like a PDA 
or mobile phone) and a Bluetooth-enabled printer, all you need to do is get within range of the 
device (that is, move closer), select the print driver from the device, and choose Print. The infor-
mation is transmitted wirelessly through the air using radio waves and is received by the device.
802.11 (a, b, g, n, ac)    A network-enabled printer that has a wireless adaptor can participate 
in a wireless Ethernet (IEEE 802.11b, a, g, n, or ac) network, just as it would as a wired 
network client.
Infrastructure vs. ad hoc    The architecture of the wireless network may affect the way 
you set up a wireless printer. In ad hoc mode, all devices communicate directly in a peer-
to-peer fashion. This means that each user who accesses the wireless printer will establish 
their own connection to the wireless printer, and they need to ensure they are in the same 
IP network with the printer as well as the same WLAN. In infrastructure mode, the wire-
less network is using an access point (AP), and all communication goes through the AP. In 
this case, the printer must be set up to automatically connect to the AP so it is on the same 
network as the wireless clients that need to use the printer.
Integrated Print Server (Hardware)
A print server is a popular option for adding a printer to the network and not adding a host 
computer. To be a print server, the NIC in the printer differs from a NIC in a computer in 

1.13 Install SOHO Multifunction Devices 
111
that it has a processor on it to perform the management of the NIC interface and it is made 
by the same manufacturer as the printer.
To qualify as a print server, when someone on the network prints, the print job goes 
directly to the printer and not through any third-party device. This tends to make printing 
to that printer faster and more efficient—that NIC is dedicated to receiving print jobs and 
sending printer status to clients.
Cloud Printing/Remote Printing
While printing remotely to a printer over the Internet has been available for a number of 
years, cloud printing is a new service being offered by cloud vendors. In a cloud arrange-
ment, you connect your printer to the vendor’s cloud, and then the printer is available to 
you anywhere you can get Internet access, just as cloud-based resources are available any-
where you can get Internet access.
While not required, cloud vendors encourage the use of cloud-ready printers in this 
arrangement. These are printers that need no PC to connect to the Internet. It makes the 
process of connecting to the cloud print server much simpler.
Another option is to create a VPN connection to your home network. Once connected to 
the home network over the VPN, you should be able to connect to and print to the printer 
as if you were sitting in your home office.
Public/Shared Devices
All operating systems allow you to share a local printer or connect over the network to one 
that has been shared. To connect to a printer in Windows 8.1, choose Start ➢ Control Panel 
➢ Devices And Printers, and it will show the currently recognized printers (see Figure 1.77) 
and allow you to add new ones.

The image of a check box on the first instance of the Samsung M 2070 shows that it 
is the current default printer, and the image of two people on the second instance of the 
device means that it is shared. Clicking Add A Printer (at the top of the dialog box) starts 
the wizard shown in Figure 1.78.
F i g u r e   1.78     Adding a printer
Sharing Local/Networked Device via Operating System Settings
To share a local/networked printer via the Windows operating systems, right-click the icon 
for the printer (beneath Devices And Printers or Printers And Faxes, depending on your 
operating system) and choose Printer Properties. Next, click the Sharing tab.
Select Share This Printer and provide a name that the printer will be known by on the 
network. This is the name that will appear when adding a new network printer on a cli-
ent, and it can also be referenced by the entire qualified name using the syntax \\host\
share_name.
TCP    A TCP printer is one that is not shared by a computer but one that has its own net-
work card and IP address. To share them, you must create a TCP port on the computer 
from which you would like to print that points to the IP address of the printer. Then when 
adding the printer, select the TCP port you created instead of selecting a local port (USB, 
and so on) like you would do if setting up a printer that is connected locally.

1.13 Install SOHO Multifunction Devices 
113
Bonjour    Bonjour is an Apple technology that discovers devices on a network. It can 
also be used to facilitate the sharing of a printer in the network. While it can work with 
Windows, the steps for using it on a Mac are as follows:
1.	
Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock to open the System Preferences 
window.
2.	
Click Print And Scan in the Hardware section to open the Print And Scan window.
3.	
Click the + button under the Printers list box to open the Add window.
4.	
Click the Default tab to display the list of available printers. Choose the name of the 
network printer from the list of printers. The system automatically searches for and 
installs the appropriate driver for the printer.
5.	
If the system cannot find a printer driver, click the Use box and manually select it from 
the pop-up menu. Click Add to automatically make the printer available in the printer 
queue.
AirPrint    AirPrint is the Apple technology for printing wirelessly to a printer in the net-
work. Many printers come ready to support AirPrint. One important thing to note is that 
AirPrint does not support printing directly to the wireless printer; it must be done through 
an AP. This means that you can use this technology only in a WLAN where an AP is 
present.
Data Privacy
In any scenario where users are sharing a device, data privacy is an issue. There are several 
things that can be done to protect the privacy of data sent to the printer.
■
■
Ensure that all users are authenticated to the device (discussed in the next section).
■
■
Ensure that users are given only the rights to the device they need to perform their 
job.
■
■
Consider the use of data loss prevention (DLP). These services can be used to control 
the printing, emailing, sharing, or deleting of documents.
■
■
Make use of the auditing features to maintain an awareness of who does what and 
when they do it.
User Authentication on the Device
While nearly all enterprise-grade multifunction devices support user authentication, it may 
be easier and make more sense in a large network to perform this on the print server and 
use domain credentials to take advantage of single sign-on. In any case, user authentication 
forms the bedrock for auditing.
Hard Drive Caching
It is also important to realize that most enterprise-grade multifunction devices have hard 
drives and cache information on those hard drives. You must take steps to protect that 

114 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
data; it can be stolen from the hard drive, either by remote access or by extracting the data 
once the drive has been removed.
Options for securing the data on the device include the following:
Encryption    Encodes the data stored on the hard drive so that it cannot be retrieved even if 
the hard drive is removed from the machine.
Overwriting    Changes the values of the bits on the disk that make up a file by overwriting 
existing data with random characters. By overwriting the disk space that the file occupied, 
its traces are removed, and the file can’t be reconstructed as easily.
Exam Essentials
Be familiar with the possible interfaces that can be used for printing.    The types generally 
fall into two categories: wired (USB, parallel, Ethernet) and wireless (Bluetooth and 802.11x).
Know how to install printers.    The manufacturer is the best source of information about 
installing printers. You should, however, know about the wizards available in Windows as well.
Know how to share printers.    This includes how to share in Windows and by using 
AirPrint and Bonjour.

1.14 Compare and Contrast Differences Between the Various Print 
115
 printer Introduction 
 Although it is not a topic for objective 1.14, it is helpful to know that printers may be dif-
ferentiated from one another in several ways, including the following: 
Impact vs. Nonimpact  Impact printers physically strike an inked ribbon and therefore 
can print multipart forms; nonimpact printers deliver ink onto the page without strik-
ing it. Dot matrix is impact; all the other printers you need to know for the exam are 
nonimpact. 
 Continuous Feed vs. Sheet Fed  Continuous-feed paper feeds through the printer using 
a system of sprockets and tractors. Sheet-fed printers accept plain paper in a paper tray. 
Dot matrix is continuous feed; everything else is sheet fed. 
 Line vs. Page  Line printers print one line at a time; page printers compose the entire 
page in memory and then place it all on the paper at once. Dot matrix and inkjet are line 
printers; laser is a page printer. 
 Laser 
 Laser printers are referred to as  page printers because they receive their print job instruc-
tions one page at a time. They’re sheet-fed, nonimpact printers. Another name for a laser 
printer is an  electrophotographic (EP) printer. 
 LED printers are much like laser printers except they use light-emitting 
diodes (LEDs) instead of lasers. Their process is similar to that of laser 
printers.  
 An EP (laser) printer consists of the following major components: 
Printer Controller  This is a large circuit board that acts as the motherboard for the 
printer. It contains the processor and RAM to convert data coming in from the computer 
into a picture of a page to be printed. 
 Imaging Drum  The toner cartridge and drum are typically packaged together as a con-
sumable product that contains the toner. Toner is a powdery mixture of plastic resin and 
iron oxide. The plastic allows it to be melted and fused to the paper, and the iron oxide 
allows it to be moved around via positive or negative charge. Toner comes in a cartridge, 
like the one shown in Figure  1.79 .

Chapter 1 ■ Hardware
 The drum is light sensitive; it can be written to with the laser scanning assembly. The 
toner cartridge in Figure  1.79 contains the print drum, so every time you change the toner 
cartridge, you get a new drum. In some laser printers, the drum is a separate part that lasts 
longer, so you don’t have to change it every time you change the toner. 
 There are quite a few images included with this discussion. You need not 
memorize the images for the exam; they are included to help make con-
cepts that may seem difficult more easily explainable. 
Primary Corona (Charge Corona)  This applies a uniform negative charge (around –600V) 
to the drum at the beginning of the printing cycle. 
Laser Scanning Assembly  This uses a laser beam to neutralize the strong negative charge 
on the drum in certain areas, so toner will stick to the drum in those areas. The laser scan-
ning assembly uses a set of rotating and fi xed mirrors to direct the beam, as shown in 
Figure  1.80 .

Paper Transport Assembly (Transfer Belt, Transfer Rollers)    This moves the paper through 
the printer. The paper transport assembly consists of a motor and several rubberized 
rollers and transfer belts. These rollers are operated by an electronic stepper motor. See

Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
High-Voltage Power Supply (HVPS)    This delivers the high voltages needed to make the 
printing process happen. It converts ordinary 120V household AC current into high-DC 
voltages used to energize the primary and transfer corona wires (discussed later).
DC Power Supply    This delivers lower voltages to components in the printer that need much 
lower voltages than the corona wires do (such as circuit boards, memory, and motors).
Fusing Assembly    This melts the plastic resin in the toner so that it adheres to the paper. 
The fusing assembly contains a halogen heating lamp, a fusing roller made of Teflon-coated 
aluminum, and a rubberized pressure roller. The lamp heats the fusing roller, and as the 
paper passes between the two rollers, the pressure roller pushes the paper against the hot 
fusing roller, melting the toner into the paper (see Figure 1.83).
Pickup Rollers    Pickup rollers are rubber wheels that grab the paper and feed it in. When 
these parts get old, they lose their ability to grip the paper, so they should be checked and 
changed regularly.
Separate Pads    These pads are used to separate sheets in a stack of printing paper. It does 
this as the paper passes over them by creating friction that separates the paper. These pads 
are usually 2 to 3 inches wide, and when they start to wear out, they lose their ability to 
create friction, and you start getting two and three sheet at a time pulled through.
Transfer Corona    This applies a uniform positive charge (about +600V) to the paper. When 
the paper rotates past the drum, the toner is pulled off the drum and onto the paper. Then the 
paper passes through a static eliminator that removes the positive charge from it (see Figure 
1.82). Some printers use a transfer corona wire; others use a transfer corona roller.

Step 2: Writing    In the writing step of the EP process, the laser is turned on and scans the 
drum from side to side, flashing on and off according to the bits of information the printer 
controller sends it as it communicates the individual bits of the image. In each area where the 
laser touches the photosensitive drum, the drum’s charge is severely reduced from –600VDC 
to a slight negative charge (around –100VDC). As the drum rotates, a pattern of exposed 
areas is formed, representing the image to be printed. Figure 1.85 shows this process.

Imaging Process
The laser (EP) print process consists of six steps. Here are the steps in the order you’ll see 
them on the exam:
Step 1: Conditioning    In the conditioning step (Figure 1.84), a special wire (called a pri-
mary corona or charge corona) within the EP toner cartridge (above the photosensitive 
drum) gets a high voltage from the HVPS. It uses this high voltage to apply a strong, uni-
form negative charge (around –600VDC) to the surface of the photosensitive drum.

Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
At this point, the controller sends a signal to the pickup roller to feed a piece of paper into 
the printer, where it stops at the registration rollers.
Step 3: Developing    Now that the surface of the drum holds an electrical representation of 
the image being printed, its discrete electrical charges need to be converted into something 
that can be transferred to a piece of paper. The EP process’s developing step accomplishes 
this (Figure 1.86). In this step, toner is transferred to the areas that were exposed in the 
writing step.
A metallic developing roller or cylinder inside an EP cartridge acquires a –600VDC charge 
(called a bias voltage) from the HVPS. The toner sticks to this roller because there is a mag-
net located inside the roller and because of the electrostatic charges between the toner and 
the developing roller. While the developing roller rotates toward the photosensitive drum, 
the toner acquires the charge of the roller (–600VDC). When the toner comes between the 
developing roller and the photosensitive drum, the toner is attracted to the areas that have 
been exposed by the laser (because these areas have a lesser charge of –100VDC). The toner 
also is repelled from the unexposed areas (because they’re at the same –600VDC charge 
and like charges repel). This toner transfer creates a fog of toner between the EP drum and 
the developing roller.
The photosensitive drum now has toner stuck to it where the laser has written. The photo-
sensitive drum continues to rotate until the developed image is ready to be transferred to 
paper in the next step.
Step 4: Transferring    At this point in the EP process, the developed image is rotating 
into position. The controller notifies the registration rollers that the paper should be fed 
through. The registration rollers move the paper underneath the photosensitive drum, and 
the process of transferring the image can begin with the transferring step.
The controller sends a signal to the corona wire or corona roller (depending on 
which one the printer has) and tells it to turn on. The corona wire/roller then acquires a 
strong positive charge (+600VDC) and applies that charge to the paper. The paper, thus

charged, pulls the toner from the photosensitive drum at the line of contact between the 
roller and the paper because the paper and toner have opposite charges. Once the regis-
tration rollers move the paper past the corona wire, the static-eliminator strip removes 
all charge from that line of the paper. Figure 1.87 details this step. If the strip didn’t 
bleed this charge away, the paper would attract itself to the toner cartridge and cause a 
paper jam.
The toner is now held in place by weak electrostatic charges and gravity. It won’t stay there, 
however, unless it’s made permanent, which is the reason for the fusing step.
Step 5: Fusing    In the next step, the fusing step, the toner image is made permanent. The 
registration rollers push the paper toward the fuser rollers. Once the fuser grabs the paper, 
the registration rollers push for only a short time more. The fuser is now in control of mov-
ing the paper.
As the paper passes through the fuser, the fuser roller melts the polyester resin of the 
toner, and the rubberized pressure roller presses it permanently into the paper (Figure 1.88). 
The paper continues on through the fuser and eventually exits the printer.

122 
Chapter 1 ■ Hardware
Step 6: Cleaning  In the last part of the laser print process, a rubber blade inside the EP car-
tridge scrapes any toner left on the drum into a used-toner receptacle inside the EP cartridge, 
and a fl uorescent lamp discharges any remaining charge on the photosensitive drum (remember 
that the drum, being photosensitive, loses its charge when exposed to light). See Figure  1.89 .  
 A color laser is much like a regular laser printer except that multiple passes 
over the page are made, one for each ink color. Consequently, the printing 
speed is rather low. 
 The EP cartridge is constantly cleaning the drum. It may take more than one rotation of 
the photosensitive drum to make an image on the paper. The cleaning step keeps the drum 
fresh for each use. If you didn’t clean the drum, you would see ghosts of previous pages 
printed along with your image. 
 The actual amount of toner removed in the cleaning process is quite small. 
The cartridge will run out of toner before the used toner receptacle fills up. 
 Putting It All Together 
 Figure  1.90 summarizes all the EP process printing steps. First, the printer uses a rubber scraper 
to clean the photosensitive drum. Then the printer places a uniform, negative, –600VDC charge 
on the photosensitive drum by means of a charge corona. The laser paints an image onto the 
photosensitive drum, discharging the image areas to a much lower voltage (–100VDC). The 
developing roller in the toner cartridge has charged (–600VDC) toner stuck to it. As it rolls 
the toner toward the photosensitive drum, the toner is attracted to (and sticks to) the areas of 
the photosensitive drum that the laser has discharged. The image is then transferred from the 
drum to the paper at its line of contact by means of the corona wire (or corona roller) with a 
+600VDC charge. The static-eliminator strip removes the high, positive charge from the paper, 
and the paper, now holding the image, moves on. The paper then enters the fuser, where the 
fuser roller and the pressure roller make the image permanent. The paper exits the printer, and 
the printer starts printing the next page or returns to its ready state.

 An optional component that can be added to printers (usually laser but also 
inkjet) is a duplexer. This can be an optional assembly added to the printer, or 
built into it, but the sole purpose of  duplexing is to turn the printed sheet over 
so it can be run back through the printer and allow printing on both sides.

 F I g u r E   1. 91   A typical ink cartridge 
 Inkjet 
 Inkjet printers are one of the most popular types in use today. This type of printer sprays 
ink on the page to print text or graphics. It’s a nonimpact, sheet-fed printer. Figure  1.91 
shows an ink cartridge. 
 There are two kinds of inkjet printers:  thermal and  piezoelectric . These terms refer to 
the way the ink is sprayed onto the paper. A thermal inkjet printer heats the ink to about 
400 degrees Fahrenheit, creating vapor bubbles that force the ink out of the cartridge. 
Thermal inkjets are also sometimes called  bubble jets . A piezoelectric printer does the same 
thing but with electricity instead of heat. 

124 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
Inkjet printers are popular because they can print in color and are inexpensive. 
However, their speed isn’t quite as good as that of a laser printer, and the per-page cost of 
ink can be higher than for a laser printer. Therefore, most businesses prefer laser printers 
for their main printing needs, perhaps keeping one or two inkjet printers around for situa-
tions requiring color printing. Components of an inkjet printer are covered in the following 
sections.
Ink Cartridge
These cartridges contain the ink. Some cartridges contain the print head for that color of 
ink; you get a new print head each time you replace the cartridge. On other printer models, 
the ink cartridge is just an ink reservoir, and the heads don’t need replacing.
Print Head
The print head has a series of nozzles from which the ink is sprayed onto the paper. They 
may be attached to the ink cartridge, or those two components may be separate. In cases 
where they are one piece, you will be getting a new print head each time you get a new ink 
cartridge.
Roller
Just as on a laser printer, rollers are used to pull the paper in from the tray or feeder and 
advance the paper when the print head assembly is ready for another pass. As is the case with 
any rollers, they will need to be replaced when they lose their ability to “grab” the paper.
Feeder
The feeder looks like a tray and is where you load paper. It is from here that it is pulled into 
the printer when a new sheet is required. These feeders do not usually hold as much paper 
as a tray in a printer will.
Duplexing Assembly
A duplexing assembly performs the same function on an inkjet printer that it does on a 
laser printer, which is to flip a sheet over to print on the back side.
Carriage and Belt
The carriage holds the ink cartridges, and it uses a belt to move the entire piece across the 
paper as it is printing. As it prints, it uses ink from the various cartridges in whatever pro-
portion is necessary to create the desire colors.
Calibration
Calibrating an inkjet printer is the process of ensuring that there is proper alignment of 
the cartridges to one another and to the paper so that high quality is maintained. When 
a printer gets out of calibration, the print quality will decline. When a new cartridge is 

1.14 Compare and Contrast Differences Between the Various Print 
125
loaded, the printer will usually perform a calibration, but you may need to do this manually 
from time to time, especially on printers that are not used often enough to require a car-
tridge change as often as a calibration may be required.
On an inkjet printer, calibration is more commonly known as head alignment. The 
printer will automatically try to align ink cartridges each time they are replaced (or 
installed). If you want to make sure they are in the right place, most printers allow you to 
print an alignment page from the maintenance menu.
If characters are not properly formed or are appearing as straight lines along the 
margin (usually the left), you can use the maintenance menu settings to align the ink 
cartridges.
Thermal
Thermal printers can be found in many older fax machines (most newer ones use either 
inkjet or laser printing) that print on a waxy paper that comes on a roll; the paper turns 
black when heat passes over it. These are also found on many handheld package tracking 
and point-of-sale (POS) devices such as credit card terminals. Thermal printers work by 
using a print head the width of the paper. When it needs to print, the print head heats and 
cools spots on the print head. The paper below the heated print head turns black in those 
spots. As the paper moves through the printer, the pattern of blackened spots forms an 
image on the page of what is being printed.
Another type of thermal printer uses a heat-sensitive ribbon instead of heat-sensitive 
paper. A thermal print head melts wax-based ink from the ribbon onto the paper. These are 
called thermal transfer or thermal wax-transfer printers.
Thermal direct printers typically have long lives because they have few moving parts. 
However, the paper is somewhat expensive, doesn’t last long, and produces poorer-quality 
images (that tend to fade over time) than most of the other printing technologies.
There are some deviations of thermal printing that exist. They’re all high-end color 
graphics printers designed for specialty professional usage. Here are four popular ones:
Thermal Wax Transfer    This is a color, nonimpact printer that uses a solid wax. A heater 
melts the wax and then sprays it onto the page, somewhat like an inkjet. The quality is very 
high, but so is the price.
Dye Sublimation    This is another color, nonimpact line printer. This one converts a 
solid ink into a gas that is then applied to the paper. Color is applied in a continuous 
tone, rather than individual dots, and the colors are applied one at a time. The ink comes 
on film rolls. The paper is expensive, as is the ink. Print speeds are low. The quality is 
extremely high.
Feed Assembly    Feed assemblies, commonly called feeders, are available to allow you to 
feed in the media you are printing on (paper, cards, and so on). Some feeders allow you to 
switch between multiple feeds, which is helpful if you need to alternate printing on different 
types of stock.
Heating Element    The heating element for a thermal printer is what generates the heat and 
does the actual printing. It is often the most expensive component of the printer.

126 
Chapter 1 ■ Hardware
 Special Thermal Paper 
 To print with a thermal printer, you need to use heat-sensitive paper designed for the ther-
mal printer as opposed to paper for any other type of printer. Rolls of thermal paper are 
available in a variety of sizes and colors. 
 Impact 
 A dot-matrix printer is an impact printer; it prints by physically striking an inked ribbon, 
much like a typewriter. It’s an impact, continuous-feed printer. 
 The print head on a dot-matrix printer consists of a block of metal pins that extend and 
retract. These pins are triggered to extend in patterns that form letters and numbers as the print 
head moves across the paper. Early models, known as near letter-quality (NLQ), printed using 
only nine pins. Later models used 24 pins and produced much better letter-quality (LQ) output. 
 The main advantage of dot matrix is its impact (physical striking of the paper). Because 
it strikes the paper, you can use it to print on multipart forms. Nonimpact printers can’t do 
that. Dot-matrix printers aren’t commonly found in most offi ces these days because of their 
disadvantages, including noise, slow speed, and poor print quality. 
 Dot-matrix printers are still found in many warehouses, and other businesses, 
where multipart forms are used or where continuous feed is required.  
 Key elements of an impact printer are discussed in the sections that follow. 
Print Head  The pins in the print head are wrapped with coils of wire to create a solenoid 
and are held in the rest position by a combination of a small magnet and a spring. To trig-
ger a particular pin, the printer controller sends a signal to the print head, which energizes 
the wires around the appropriate print wire. This turns the print wire into an electromagnet, 
which repels the print pin, forcing it against the ink ribbon and making a dot on the paper. 
Ribbon  The ribbon is like that on an old typewriter. Most impact printers have an option 
to adjust how close the print head rests from the ribbon. So if your printing is too light, you 
may be able to adjust the print head closer to the ribbon. If it’s too dark or you get smeared 
printing, you may be able to move the print head back. 
Tractor Feed  The tractor feed unit feeds in the continuous feed paper. This paper has 
holes running down both edges. 
 Impact Paper 
 An impact printer uses continuous feed paper fed to it by the tractor feed unit. 
 Virtual 
 There is also virtual printing that is not really printing at all but a way to convert a 
document to a particular format. There a number of ways this conversion can take place. 

Print to File
Print to file is quite an old concept by now but still available as an option when printing. 
When you do this, the information that would normally be sent to the printer is saved, 
usually as a .prn file. It is a way to avoid the printing process from within an applica-
tion (which may be time-consuming or inconvenient) and print it (convert it) once and 
then save the file so that whenever you need a copy, you can simply send that to the 
printer.
Print to PDF
If you can print to file, you can print to PDF. In applications that support this feature, it 
will be an option presented when you select to print. When you select this option, it pro-
duces an Adobe PDF instead of a printout. It is a convenient format because you can still 
print them later, search them, and send them, and when you do send them, you can be 
certain that the way the document appears to you will be the way it does to the recipient, 
regardless of the device type on which they are viewing it.
Print to XPS
An XPS document is a standardized open format and is Microsoft’s answer to the PDF. 
It is always offered as a printer type in Windows. It will be called a Microsoft XPS 
Document Writer and will appear with other printers in the printer’s folder, as shown in 
Figure 1.92.
F i g u r e   1. 9 2     Microsoft XPS Document Writer
When your file is converted, it will appear with an .opxs file extension (Open XPS). 
While Microsoft encourages the use of these documents and of the default XPS device and 
offers more support for it then for PDF, the document type is not as widely supported else-
where as the PDF.

 Print to Image 
 Finally, printing to an image is somewhat like scanning because it creates an image of the 
document. This typically requires a third-party application. Many of the applications that will 
create a PDF, such as Nitro PDF Writer, will also allow for you to convert those formats to a 
.jpg fi le.

 1.15 Given a Scenario, Perform 
Appropriate Printer Maintenance 
 Most printing problems today are because of either improper confi guration or actual physi-
cal problems that arise from the poor maintenance of the printer. As far as confi guration 
goes, the Windows architecture is such that when a client wants to print to a network printer, 
a check is fi rst done to see whether the client has the latest printer driver. If it doesn’t—as 
judged by the print server—the new driver is sent from the server to the client, and then the 
print job is accepted. This is an enormous help to the administrator because when a new 
driver comes out, all the administrator must do is install it on the server, and the distribu-
tion to the clients becomes automatic. The printers covered in subobjective 1.15 include the 
following:

 This objective tests your knowledge of some of the basic operations of 
printers. The emphasis, however, is on detecting and solving problems 
with them. If you truly want to show your expertise with printers, CompTIA 
offers another certification, PDI+, which is meant for that purpose. 

1.15 Given a Scenario, Perform Appropriate Printer Maintenance 
129
 general maintenance 
 Beyond what is covered in subobjective 1.15, it is important to know good principles of general 
printer maintenance. To keep your printers working effi ciently and extend their life as much as 
possible, you should start by creating a log of scheduled maintenance as outlined by the ven-
dor’s guidelines and then make certain this maintenance log is adhered to. For many printers, 
the scheduled maintenance includes installing maintenance kits. Maintenance kits typically 
include a fuser, transfer roller, pickup rollers (for the trays), separation rollers, and feed rollers.  
 After installing the maintenance kit, you need to reset the maintenance 
counter as explained in the vendor’s documentation. 
 Pay a great deal of attention to the ambient surroundings of the printers as well. High 
temperature, high humidity, and high levels of dust and debris can negatively affect the life 
of the printer and the quality of print jobs. Always make certain you use recommended 
supplies. It may be cheaper to buy off-brand supplies that aren’t intended for your equip-
ment, but you’re taking a gamble with shortening the life of your printer and decreasing the 
quality of your output. 
 Some general preventive maintenance includes the following: 
 
■
 Never reuse paper in a laser printer that has been through the printer once. Although 
it may look blank, you’re repeating the charging and fusing process on a piece of paper 
that most likely has  something  already on it. 
 
■
 Change the toner when needed. You should recycle; most toner manufacturers partici-
pate in a recycling program of some type. The toner cartridge should never be exposed 
to light for longer than a few minutes; it usually comes sealed in a black plastic light-
resistant bag. 
 
■
 Clean any toner that accidentally spills into the printer with a dry, lint-free cloth. Bear 
in mind that spilled toner in the paper path should clear after you run a few blank 
pages through. If toner gets on your clothes, wipe them with a dry cloth and wash 
them with cold water (hot water works like the fusing process to set them into the 
material). 
 
■
 Clean any paper shreds, dust, or dander that gets deposited in the printer. Pressurized 
air is the most effective method of removal. 
 
■
 Keep the drum in good working order. If it develops lines, replace it. 
 
■
 Install the maintenance kit when needed and reset the page count. The maintenance 
kit (sometimes called a  fuser kit ) typically includes a fusing assembly, rollers, and 

130 
Chapter 1 ■ Hardware
separation pads. A printer that displays a message similar to “Perform Printer Main-
tenance” indicates the printer has reached its maintenance interval and a maintenance 
kit needs to be installed. 
 
■
 Don’t be afraid to cycle the power for an unresponsive printer. Turning it off, leaving it 
off for one minute to clear, and then turning it back on can solve a great many problems. 
 
■
 For inkjet and impact printers, you should periodically clean the print head. 
 While the previous list is a good rule of thumb, for this objective CompTIA wants you 
to be familiar with maintenance for three types of printers: laser, thermal, and impact. The 
following sections will look at each of those. 
 Laser 
 Just as laser printers are the most complicated of the types (and offer the most capabilities), they 
also have the most things that can go awry. A thermal fuse is included to keep the system from 
overheating, and if it becomes faulty, it can prevent the printer from printing. Many high-capac-
ity laser printers also include an ozone fi lter to prevent the corona’s ozone output from reaching 
too high a level. On these printers, the fi lter should be changed as part of regular maintenance. 
 Other common problems and solutions are as follows: 
Paper Jams  While paper jams can be caused by numerous problems, two common ones 
are the paper not feeding correctly and moisture. To correct improper feeds, make sure 
you set the alignment guides for the paper you are using and verify the paper is feeding 
in straight. Keep paper from getting any moisture before feeding into the printer because 
moisture often causes pages to stick together and bind. Paper jams can also be caused by 
using paper that is not approved for the printer—particularly thick cardstock. 
 One employee routinely had problems with a printer each time he went 
to print on high-quality paper—a problem experienced by no one else. 
Upon close examination, it turned out that each time he chose to print to 
the expensive paper, he counted the number of sheets he loaded into the 
printer—counting that involved licking his finger and then touching each 
page. A simple directive to stop doing this solved the problem. 
 Regardless of the cause of a paper jam, you need to always fully clear the printer of any 
traces of paper (torn or whole) before attempting to print again. 
Error Codes  Many laser printers include LCDs for interaction with the printer. When 
error codes appear, refer to the manufacturer’s manuals or website for information on how 
to interpret the codes and solve the problem causing them. 
Out-of-Memory Error  While PCs now may need a minimum of 1 GB of RAM to run at a 
base level, it is not uncommon to fi nd printers that still have only 4 MB or 8 MB of mem-
ory. If you are routinely running out of memory on a printer, add more memory if possible, 
and replace the printer when it is no longer possible to do so. 

1.15 Given a Scenario, Perform Appropriate Printer Maintenance 
131
Lines and Smearing  Lines and smearing can be caused by the toner cartridge or the fuser. 
Try replacing the toner fi rst (and cleaning any that may have spilled). If this does not fi x the 
problem, replace the fuser. 
Blank Pages Print  Verify that there is toner in the cartridge. If it’s an old cartridge, you can 
often shake it slightly to free up toner once before replacing. If it’s a new cartridge, make sure 
the sealing tape has been removed from the cartridge prior to placing it in the printer.  
 Be careful when doing this operation. Someone who has asthma or who is 
sensitive to microfine particles could be adversely affected by the toner. 
Dark Spots Print  The most likely culprit is too much toner. Run blank pages through the 
printer to clean it. 
 Garbled Pages Print  Make sure you’re using the right printer driver in your application. 
 Ghosted Images Print  Ghosting—repeating text or images on the page—is usually caused 
by a bad cartridge. There can be damage to the drum or charging roller, and if there is, 
replacing the cartridge will help with the problem. 
 No Connectivity  If a network printer is not able to receive jobs, it can be an issue with the IP 
address that it has (or, more correctly, does not have). Often the printer will need to be manually 
assigned an IP address to make sure that it has the same one each time. Read the manufacturer’s 
documentation for assigning an IP address to the printer and walk through the steps to do so.  
 Never overlook the obvious. Connectivity problems also occur when the 
printer is turned off. 
Print-Quality Problems  See whether your printer has the ability to turn Resolution 
Enhancement Technology (RET) on and off. This is what allows the printer to use partial-sized 
dots for images that are rounded. If it’s turned off, turn it back on. If there are small marks or 
defects in the same spot on every page printed, the most likely culprit is a scratch on the drum. 
Replacing Toner  Toner represents the consumable within the laser printer. Toner car-
tridges are used by laser printers to store toner. Use toner that is recommended for your 
printer. Using bad supplies could ruin your printer and void your warranty. Remove the 
toner before moving or shipping a printer to avoid spills. 
Applying a Maintenance Kit  Maintenance kits are marketed by the manufacturer. Each 
kit varies in contents based on the printer in question but typically consists of a fuser, trans-
fer roller, and feed/separation rollers. A counter on the laser printer often identifi es when 
the maintenance kit is needed, and you can reset the counter after applying the new kit. 
 Calibration  With laser printers and inkjets, there is often a need to calibrate. Calibration 
is the process by which the result produced matches what was created. All the hardware, 
including the monitor, scanner, and printer, need to match on color, margins, and so forth. 

132 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
The calibration process is different for each manufacturer but is usually similar to the following:
1.	
During installation of the software, you are asked (by the installation wizard) if you 
want to calibrate now (say Yes).
2.	
The printer prints multiple sets of numbered lines. Each set of lines represents an align-
ment instance, and you are asked which set looks the best.
3.	
You enter the set number and click OK. In some cases, the alignment ends here. In 
other cases, the alignment page is reprinted to verify that the settings are correct, and 
you are given a chance to change.
4.	
You exit the alignment routine.
Cleaning    It is important to keep the printer and the area around it clean. Each time you 
replace the toner or perform any maintenance, be sure to clean the debris.
Thermal
The amount of maintenance required on a thermal printer pales in comparison to laser 
since there are no moving parts to speak of. The following sections look at the key items to 
be aware of related to thermal printers as you study for the exam.
Replace Paper    Replace the thermal paper as it is needed; be sure to keep the feed area 
clean of paper slivers and other debris.
Clean Heating Element    Before even looking at a heating element, always unplug the 
printer and make certain it is cool. Thermal printer cleaning cards, cleaning pens, and kits 
are available and recommended for cleaning.
Remove Debris    Keep the printer free of dust and debris. Any particulates that get into 
the printer can interfere with the paper feeding properly or can affect the print quality. Use 
compressed air or computer vacuum to remove any debris.
Impact
A dot-matrix print head reaches high temperatures, and care must be taken to avoid a user 
or technician touching it and getting burned. Most dot-matrix printers include a tempera-
ture sensor to tell whether the print head is getting too hot. The sensor interrupts print-
ing to let the print head cool down and then allows printing to start again. If this sensor 
becomes faulty, it can cause the printer to print a few lines, stop for a while, print more, 
stop, and so on. The following sections look at the key items to be aware of related to 
impact printers as you study for the exam.
Replace Ribbon    A common culprit with poor printing is the ribbon. A tight ribbon, or 
one that isn’t advancing properly, will cause smudges or overly light printout. To solve this 
problem, replace the ribbon.
Replace Print Head    The print head should never be lubricated, but you can clean off 
debris with a cotton swab and denatured alcohol. Print pins missing from the print head 

1.15 Given a Scenario, Perform Appropriate Printer Maintenance 
133  
will cause incomplete images or characters or white lines running through the text. This 
can be remedied by replacing the print head.
If the print head isn’t at fault, make certain it’s close enough to the platen to make 
the right image. The print head can be moved closer and farther from the platen (the 
surface on which typing occurs) depending on the thickness of the paper and other 
considerations.
Replace Paper    Preventive maintenance includes not only keeping the print head dry and 
clean but also vacuuming paper shreds from inside the machine. This should be done more 
often if needed but always when you replace the paper.
Inkjet
While inkjet printers use a different technology to print, they require many of the same 
maintenance procedures. These are discussed briefly in this section.
Clean Heads    Two maintenance task apply to the print heads. If your colors don’t look the 
same or your blacks are getting a bronze look, you need to clean the nozzles. This can be 
done with the head cleaning cycle, which will clear out the nozzles. The second task is head 
alignment. If you see white repeating lines or a grid-like pattern in the printing, the head is 
misaligned. While some newer printers have an automatic alignment and cleaning function, 
you may need to do this manually using the printer documentation.
Replace Cartridges    When ink runs low (and most printers will alert you before you run 
out), you must remove the old cartridge and replace it with a new one. The procedure is as 
follows:
1.	
Open the printer cover and locate the button that is used to place the cartridge in the 
replacement position.
2.	
Open the cover that may be over the cartridge.
3.	
Grasp and remove the empty cartridge.
4.	
Take the new cartridge out of its packaging.
5.	
Place the new cartridge in the empty position left by the old cartridge. It should “click” 
into place.
6.	
Replace the cartridge cover.
7.	
Use the same button you used to place the cartridge into the replacement positon to 
move it back to the home position.
Calibration    Calibration is a task usually performed by accessing the properties of 
the printer and looking for the calibration function either on the General tab or on the 
Advanced tab. Just select it, and the printer will perform a calibration. It is also useful to 
know that in most cases a calibration is done whenever you replace one of the cartridges.
Clear Jams    While keeping in mind that many paper jams are a result of using poor-
quality paper, there will be times you suffer jams with good paper. To clear a jam, do the 
following:

134 
Chapter 1  ■  Hardware  
1.	
Check the paper tray. If you see a piece protruding from where the paper is picked up, 
pull it out gently.
2.	
If there is still a jam, remove the rear access door and look into the printer. If you see 
any paper stuck inside, pull it out, making sure you get all the pieces out.
3.	
Check the front door of the printer and see whether any pieces are stuck in that 
section; if so, gently pull them out.
4.	
At any point in this process you can select the resume button, and if you have cleared 
the jam, the print process will resume.
Exam Essentials
Know how to interact with printers.    Know that the Properties page for each, available 
from Windows, allows you to interact with them, but many printers also include advanced 
utilities that go beyond basic interaction.
Know the common printing problems listed.    Understand the most common problems that 
occur in an environment.
Know the importance of running scheduled maintenance.    Scheduled maintenance can 
prolong the life of your equipment and help ensure that your output continues to live up to 
the quality you expect.
Understand the importance of a suitable environment.    If you want your equipment to 
last as long as possible and deliver quality, you should pay attention to the environment in 
which you place it.

CompTIA offers a number of other exams and certifications 
on networking (Network+, Server+, and so on), but to become 
A+ certified, you must have good knowledge of basic network-
ing skills. Not only do you need to know the basics of cabling and connectors, but you also 
need to know how to install and configure a wireless/wired router, apply appropriate set-
tings, and use some basic tools. There are nine objectives for this domain.
2.1 Identify the Various Types of 
Network Cables and Connectors
You’re expected to know the basic concepts of networking as well as the different types 
of cabling that can be used. For the latter, you should be able to identify connectors and 
cables from figures even if those figures are crude line art (think shadows) appearing in 
pop-up boxes.
For this exam you must know the three specific types of network cables (fiber, twisted 
pair, and coaxial) and the connectors associated with each. Fiber is the most expensive of 
the three and can run the longest distance. A number of types of connectors can work with 
fiber, but three you must know are SC, ST, and LC.
Twisted pair is commonly used in office settings to connect workstations to hubs or 
switches. It comes in two varieties: unshielded (UTP) and shielded (STP). The two types of 
connectors commonly used are RJ-11 (four wires and popular with telephones) and RJ-45 
(eight wires and used with xBaseT networks—100BaseT, 1000BaseT, and so forth). Two 
common wiring standards are T568A and T568B.
Coaxial cabling is not as popular as it once was, but it’s still used with cable television 
and some legacy networks. The two most regularly used connectors are F-connectors (tele-
vision cabling) and BNC (10Base2 and so on).
Fiber
Fiber-optic cabling is the most expensive type of those discussed for this exam. Although 
it’s an excellent medium, it’s often not used because of the cost of implementing it. It has 
a glass core within a rubber outer coating and uses beams of light rather than electrical 
signals to relay data (see Figure 2.1). Because light doesn’t diminish over distance the way 
electrical signals do, this cabling can run for distances measured in kilometers with trans-
mission speeds from 1 Gbps up to 100 Gbps or higher.

2.1 Identify the Various Types of Network Cables and Connectors 
141
 Connectors: SC, ST, and LC 
 Often, fi ber is used to connect runs to wiring closets where they break out into UTP or 
other cabling types, or as other types of backbones. Fiber-optic cable can use either ST, 
SC, or LC connectors. ST is a barrel-shaped connector, whereas SC is squared and easier to 
connect in small spaces. The LC connector looks similar to SC but adds a fl ange on the top 
(much like an RJ-45 connector) to keep it securely connected. Figure  2.2 shows the fi ber 
connectors.

 In addition to these listed in the A+ objectives, other connectors are used 
with fiber. FC connectors may also be used but are not as common. MT-RJ 
is a popular connector for two fibers in a small form factor. 
 Twisted Pair 
 There are two primary types of twisted-pair cabling (with categories beneath each that 
are addressed in the “2.2 Compare and Contrast the Characteristics of Connectors and 
Cabling”): shielded twisted pair (STP) and unshielded twisted pair (UTP). In both cases, 
the cabling consists of pairs of wires twisted around each other, as shown in Figure  2.3 . 
 UTP offers no shielding (hence the name) and is the network cabling type most prone 
to outside interference. The interference can be from a fl uorescent light ballast, electrical 
motor, or other such source (known as  electromagnetic interference [EMI]) or from wires 
being too close together and signals jumping across them (known as  crosstalk ). STP adds a 
foil shield around the twisted wires to protect against EMI.

Connectors: RJ-11, RJ-45
STP cable uses an IBM data connector (IDC) or universal data connector (UDC) to con-
nect to token ring networks. It can also be used in Ethernet networks where EMI is an 
issue. While you need to know STP for the exam, you are not required to have any knowl-
edge of the connectors associated with it. You must, however, know that most UTP cable 
uses RJ-45 connectors, which look like telephone connectors (RJ-11) but have eight wires 
instead of four. Figure 2.4 shows both RJ-45 (left) and RJ-11 (right) connectors.
F i g u r e   2 . 4    RJ-45 and RJ-11 connectors
Wiring Standards: T568A, T568B
Two wiring standards are commonly used with twisted-pair cabling: T568A and T568B 
(sometimes referred to simply as 568A and 568B). These are telecommunications stan-
dards from TIA and EIA that specify the pin arrangements for the RJ-45 connectors on 
UTP or STP cables. The number 568 refers to the order in which the wires within the 
CAT5 cable are terminated and attached to the connector. The signal is identical for 
both.
T568A was the first standard, released in 1991. Ten years later, in 2001, T568B was 
released. Figure 2.5 shows the pin number assignments for the 568A and 568B standards. 
Pin numbers are read left to right, with the connector tab facing down. Notice that the pin-
outs stay the same, and the only difference is in the color coding of the wiring.
The bottom line here is that if the same standard is used on each end, the cable will be 
a crossover cable, and if a different standard is used on either end, it will be a straight-
through cable.

 Mixing cables can cause communication problems on the network. Before 
installing a network or adding a new component to it, make sure the cable 
being used is in the correct wiring standard.

 Coaxial 
Coaxial cable , or  coax , is one of the oldest media used in networks. Coax is built around a 
center conductor or core that is used to carry data from point to point. The center conduc-
tor has an insulator wrapped around it, a shield over the insulator, and a nonconductive 
sheath around the shielding. This construction, depicted in Figure  2.6 , allows the conduct-
ing core to be relatively free from outside interference. The shielding also prevents the con-
ducting core from emanating signals externally from the cable. 
 Before you read any further, accept the fact that the odds are incredibly 
slim that you will ever need to know about coax for a new installation in 
the real world (with the possible exception of RG-6, which is used from 
the wall to a cable modem). If you do come across it, it will be in an exist-
ing installation, and one of the first things you’ll recommend is that it be 
changed. That said, you do need to know about coax for this exam. 
 Connectors: BNC, F-connector 
 Connections to a coax occur through a wide variety of connectors, often referred to as 
 plumbing . These connectors provide a modular design that allows for easy expansion. 
The three primary connections used in this case are the T-connector, the inline con-
nector, and the terminating connector (also known as a  terminating resistor or  termi-
nator ). Figure  2.7 shows some of these common connectors in a coaxial cable–based 
network.

145
 In addition to these, there are  F-connectors (commonly called  F-type con-
nectors ). These are screw-on connectors used to attach coaxial cable 
(including RG-59 and RG-6) to devices. They have a nut on the connection 
that provides something to grip as the connection is tightened by hand (or, 
if necessary, pliers to aid with disconnecting). F-connectors are most com-
monly associated with connecting Internet modems to cable or satellite 
Internet service provider (ISP) equipment. However, F-type connectors are 
also used to connect to some proprietary peripherals. 
 Coax supports both baseband and broadband signaling.  Baseband signaling means that 
a single channel is carried through the coax, and  broadband refers to multiple channels on 
the coax. Figure  2.8 illustrates this difference. Baseband signaling is similar in concept to 
a speaker wire. The speaker wire in your stereo connects one channel from the amplifi er to 
the speaker. Broadband is similar to the cable TV connection in your home. The cable from 
the cable company carries hundreds of channels. Your TV set uses a tuner to select the 
channel you choose to watch.

 In a coax network, some type of device must terminate all the coax ends. Figure  2.9 
shows this termination process in more detail. Coax is present in many older networks 
and tends to provide reliable service once it’s installed. However, if a terminator, NIC, 
T-connector, or inline connector malfunctions or becomes disconnected, the entire segment 
of wire in that network will malfunction, and network services will cease operation. Coax 
tends also to become brittle over time, and it can fail when handled. In addition, coax is 
expensive per foot when compared to UTP cable. These are the primary reasons that coax 
is falling from favor as a primary network medium.

Coax has two primary vulnerabilities from a security perspective. The most common is 
the addition of a T-connector attached to a network sniffer. This sniffer would have unre-
stricted access to the signaling on the cable. The second and less common method involves 
a connection called a vampire tap. A vampire tap is a type of connection that hooks directly 
into a coax by piercing the outer sheath and attaching a small wire to the center conductor 
or core. This type of attachment allows a tap to occur almost anywhere in the network. Taps 
can be hard to find because they can be anywhere in the cable. Figure 2.10 shows the two 
common methods of tapping a coax cable. The T-connector is a standard connector that can 
be used any place there is a connector on the cable. An inductive pickup or RF collar can be 
placed around a coaxial cable to capture any stray RF that isn’t blocked by the coax’s shield.

Exam Essentials
Know the network cable types.    UTP is the cheapest type of cable to implement, but it’s 
also the weakest. STP is more expensive, but it isn’t subject to EMI. Fiber-optic cabling is 
the most expensive and most difficult to implement, but it offers the greatest combination 
of speed and distance. Coaxial typically exists in legacy installations with the exception of 
cable modems.
Know the cable connectors.    Fiber connections include ST, SC, and LC connectors. Twisted-
pair cabling uses RJ-45 connectors and can differ in pin-outs based on whether the wiring stan-
dard used is T568A (old) or T568B (newer). Coaxial cabling uses either BNC or F-connectors.
2.2 Compare and Contrast the 
Characteristics of Connectors and Cabling
The previous section introduced cabling and the connectors used with each type. This 
objective builds on that and reexamines each of the three major types (fiber, twisted-pair, 
and coaxial) and looks at some of the characteristics of each with an emphasis on speed 
and transmission limitations.
Fiber cabling comes in two major types: single-mode (SMF) and multi-mode (MMF). 
The speed of fiber makes it a wonderful choice for network implementations, but the 
cost still remains prohibitive in many situations. Twisted-pair cabling, which is available 

148 
Chapter 2  ■  Networking   
unshielded (UTP) or shielded (STP), comes in a number of types—known as categories 
(CAT3, CAT5, and so forth). As a general rule, the higher the category of twisted-pair 
cabling, the greater the speed possible. Coaxial cabling comes in a number of types, with 
RG-6 and RG-59 being the two to know for the exam.
Fiber
Because fiber-based media use light transmissions instead of electronic pulses, such prob-
lems as EMI, crosstalk, and attenuation become nonissues. Fiber gets around the limita-
tions on almost everything else except cost and is well suited for transferring data, video, 
and voice transmissions. Since anyone trying to access data signals on a fiber-optic cable 
must physically tap into the medium, it is the most secure of all cable media.
Types (Single-Mode vs. Multi-mode)
Two types of fiber-optic cable are available: single-mode and multi-mode. As the name 
implies, single-mode uses a single direct beam of light, thus allowing for greater distances 
and increased transfer speeds. With multi-mode, a lot of light beams travel through the 
cable, bouncing off the cable walls; this weakens the signal, reducing the length that the 
data signal can travel.
The most common types of fiber-optic cable include the following:
■
■
8.3 micron core/125 micron cladding single-mode
■
■
50 micron core/125 micron cladding multi-mode
■
■
62.5 micron core/125 micron cladding multi-mode

Types
There are different grades, which are given as categories, and as you may guess, the higher 
the grade, the more expensive the cabling and the higher the data rate it can support. You 
do not need to know all of the categories for the exam, but the ones you do need to know 
are described in the following sections.
STP    Shielded twisted pair (STP) differs from unshielded twisted pair (UTP) only in the 
presence of the shielding, which resembles aluminum foil directly beneath the outer insu-
lation. The shielding adds to the cost of the cable, and a rule of thumb based on current 
prices is that STP is twice as expensive as UTP for the same length of cable.
UTP    Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is the most popular twisted-pair cabling in use.
CAT3    CAT3 transmits data at speeds up to 10 Mbps with a possible bandwidth of 16 MHz. 
It contains four twisted pairs of wires with three twists per foot. This is the lowest-level cabling 
you can safely use in a network. For many years, it was the standard used, but since cabling 
today considers 100 Mbps to be a minimum, CAT3 has been pushed to legacy installations.
CAT5    CAT5 transmits data at speeds up to 100 Mbps and was used with Fast Ethernet 
(operating at 100 Mbps) with a transmission range of 100 meters. It contains four twisted 
pairs of copper wire to give the most protection. Although it had its share of popularity (it’s 
used primarily for 10/100 Ethernet networking), it is now an outdated standard. Newer 
implementations use the 5e standard.
CAT5e    CAT5e transmits data at speeds up to 1 Gbps (1000 Mbps). Category 5e cabling 
can be used up to 100 meters, depending on the implementation and standard used and 
provides a minimum of 100 MHz of bandwidth. It also contains four twisted pairs of cop-
per wire, but they’re physically separated and contain more twists per foot than Category 5 
to provide maximum interference protection.
CAT6    CAT6 transmits data at speed up to 10 Gbps, has a minimum of 250 MHz of 
bandwidth, and specifies cable lengths up to 100 meters (using CAT6a). It contains four 
twisted pairs of copper wire and is used in 10GBaseT networks. Category 6 cable typically 
is made up of four twisted pairs of copper wire, but its capabilities far exceed those of other 
cable types. Category 6 twisted pair uses a longitudinal separator, which separates each of 
the four pairs of wires from each other and reduces the amount of crosstalk possible.
CAT6e    While not an official standard, many vendors now offer a CAT6e cable and 
market them as providing better performance, which may be true, but whatever improve-
ment there is will vary from vendor to vendor since there is no official standard. They 
are designed to double transmission frequency to 500 MHz. Moreover, by wrapping it in 
grounded foil shielding, full 10 Gigabit Ethernet speeds can be reached without sacrificing 
the maximum cable length of 100 meters.
CAT7    Another cable specification not recognized by TIA/EIA is CAT7. By shielding indi-
vidual wire pairs and the cable as a whole, 10 Gigabit Ethernet can be extended over 100 
meters of copper cabling. Moreover, the twisting of the pairs and the number of turns per 
unit length increase RF shielding and protect from crosstalk.

Chapter 2  ■  Networking   
PVC    The outer insulation that covers most network cables—the part you touch when you 
handle the cable—is a plastic known as PVC (an acronym for polyvinyl chloride). While 
inexpensive and easy to work with, PVC gives off a poisonous gas when burned. In places 
where this may be a problem, plenum cable must be run.
Plenum    Plenum cable is a specific type of cable that is rated for use in plenum spaces. 
Plenum spaces are those in a building used for heating and air-conditioning systems. Most 
cable cannot be used in the plenum because of the danger of fire (or the fumes the cables 
give off as they burn). Plenum cable is fire-rated and meets the necessary standards, which 
makes it OK to use in these locations. It replaces PVC with a Teflon-like material.

Splitters and Effects on Signal Quality
It is possible to connect a splitter to a single port in a wall outlet and then connect two devices 
to the splitter. However, considering that this works by using all eight wires (four for each 
device), it cannot be done when using a higher-speed connection that uses all eight wires. 
Moreover, it does not eliminate the requirement for two ports on the switch or hub to which the 
cable from the wall outlet connects. You must also have a second splitter on that end and split 
the connection again to the two ports. Otherwise, only one device can function at a time.
With regard to the effect on signal quality, you may experience some degradation 
because the wire pairs being used by the two devices are within the same physical cable and 
may interfere with one another. When connected to a hub on the far end, this may be worse 
because of the potential for collisions between the two devices.
Coaxial
Several types of coax exist, and usually each has a specific use. The exam expects you to 
know two types.

2.2 Compare and Contrast the Characteristics of Connectors and Cabling 
151
 Types 
 While the exam will probably require you to know only two of these types of coaxial 
cables, in this section I’ll cover three of the most common types of coaxial cable. 
RG-6  This is often used for cable TV and cable modems. RG-6 can run longer distances 
than RG-59 and support digital signals. 
 RG-59  This is used to generate low-power video connections. The RG-59 cable cannot be 
used over long distances because of its high-frequency power losses. In such cases, RG-6 
cables are used instead. 
 RG-58  Not specifi cally listed in the objectives, but something you should know is that 
RG-58 is the type traditionally used in Thin Ethernet networks (10Base2). Thick coax 
(10Base5) utilized RG-8, was used primarily for backbone cable, and could be run through 
plenum spaces since it offered signifi cant resistance to EMI and crosstalk and could run in 
lengths up to 500 meters. Thick coax offered speeds up to 10 Mbps—too slow for today’s 
network environments. 
 There are two types of RG-58 used in legacy Thin Ethernet implementations. 
RG-58/U has a solid core, whereas RG-58A/U has a stranded wire core.

 Splitters and Effects on Signal Quality 
 Splitters are often used to send the signal from a coaxial cable to multiple locations in a 
house or offi ce. When you do this, it does affect the signal quality. The amount of degrada-
tion is related to where you perform the split. Consider the diagram in Figure  2.11 . 
 In this scenario there are two splitters. One is placed just after the cable enters the house and 
splits the signal between the cable modem and the TV. Since there are multiple TVs, a second 
splitter has been inserted. The loss of signal will be greater at the second split than at the fi rst 
split. So if you going to introduce a splitter, do so as close to the main signal line as possible.

Exam Essentials
Know the types available for each media.    The two types of fiber available are single-mode 
and multi-mode. The types of twisted pair you need to know are all UTP related: CAT3, 
CAT5, CAT5e, and CAT6. Coax cabling includes RG-6 (TV and cable modems) and RG-59 
(video). The cables also come in either single-mode (SMF) or multi-mode (MMF) versions.
Know the speeds of CAT cabling.    CAT3 transmits data at speeds up to 10 Mbps. CAT5 
transmits data at speeds up to 100 Mbps. CAT5e transmits data at speeds up to 1000 Mbps 
(1 Gbps). CAT6 transmits data at speeds up to 10 Gbps.
2.3 Explain the Properties and 
Characteristics of TCP/IP
The protocol of the Internet is TCP/IP, and because of this, TCP/IP has become the de facto 
protocol of most networks as well. Far from the only networking protocol available, TCP/
IP meets the needs of most organizations and is becoming more and more the one protocol 
suite that administrators must understand in order to do their jobs.
A host is any machine or interface that participates in a TCP/IP network—whether as a 
client or a server. Every interface on a TCP/IP network that must be issued an IP address 
is considered a host. Those addresses can be manually entered or provided dynamically 
to the host by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. (If IPv4 is in use, 
the addresses fall into three classes—A, B, and C.) The other values needed, besides the 

2.3 Explain the Properties and Characteristics of TCP/IP 
153
IP address, are the subnet mask (identifying the scope of the network on which the host 
resides) and the default gateway (the router interfacing with the outside world). Since 
memorizing complex numerical addresses can be diffi cult to do, the Domain Name System 
(DNS) is used to translate hostnames into IP addresses as needed. 
 IP Class 
 Although there is no offi cial IP class objective, it is helpful to understand IP classes in the 
real world, and knowing about them also enriches your understanding of various CompTIA 
objectives. 
 IPv4 addresses (IPv6 is discussed later) are 32-bit binary numbers. Because numbers of such 
magnitude are diffi cult to work with, they’re divided into four octets (8 bits) and converted to 
decimal. Thus, 01010101 becomes 85. This is important because the limits on the size of the 
decimal number are because of the reality that they’re representations of binary numbers. The 
range must be from 0 (00000000) to 255 (11111111) per octet, making the lowest possible IP 
address 0.0.0.0 and the highest 255.255.255.255. Many IP addresses aren’t available because 
they’re reserved for diagnostic purposes, private addressing, or some other function. 
 Three classes of IP addresses are available for assignment to hosts; they’re identifi ed by 
the fi rst octet. Table  2.5 shows the class and the range the fi rst octet must fall into to be 
within that class. The entire 127.0.0.0 network is missing because that network has been 
set aside or reserved for diagnostics. 
 TA b l E 2 . 5    IP address classes 
Class
Range
A
1–126
B
128–191
C
192–223
 Five classes exist. Class D (multicast) and Class E (experimental) are not 
assigned to hosts. 
Class A  If you’re given a Class A address, then you’re assigned a number such as 125. 
With a few exceptions, this means you can use any number between 0 and 255 in the sec-
ond fi eld, any number between 0 and 255 in the third fi eld, and any number between 0 and 
255 in the fourth fi eld. This gives you a total number of hosts that you can have on your 
network in excess of 16 million. The default subnet mask is 255.0.0.0. 
Class B  If you’re given a Class B address, then you’re assigned a number such as 152.119. 
With a few exceptions, this means you can use any number between 0 and 255 in the third 

154 
Chapter 2 ■ Networking 
fi eld and any number between 0 and 255 in the fourth fi eld. This gives you a total number 
of hosts that you can have on your network in excess of 65,000. The default subnet mask is 
255.255.0.0. 
Class C  If you’re given a Class C address, then you’re assigned a number such 
as 205.19.15. You can use any number between 1 and 254 in the fourth field, for 
a total of 254 possible hosts (0 and 255 are reserved). The default subnet mask is 
255.255.255.0. 
 The class, therefore, makes a tremendous difference in the number of hosts your net-
work can have. In most cases, the odds of having all hosts at one location are small. 
Assuming you have a Class B address, will there be 65,000 hosts in one room, or will they 
be in several locations? Most often, it’s the latter. 
 IPv4 vs. IPv6 
 IPv4 uses a 32-bit addressing scheme that provides for more than 4 billion unique 
addresses. Unfortunately, there are a lot of IP-enabled devices added to the Internet 
every day—not to mention, not all of the addresses that can be created are used by pub-
lic networks (many are reserved, in classes D and above and are unavailable for public 
use). This reduces the number of addresses that can be allocated as public Internet 
addresses. 
 IPv6 offers a number of improvements, the most notable of which is its ability to handle 
growth in public networks. IPv6 uses a 128-bit addressing scheme, allowing a huge number 
of possible addresses: 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456. Table  2.6 
compares IPv4 to IPv6. 
 In IPv6 addresses, repeating zeros can be left out so that colons next 
to each other in the address indicate one or more sets of zeros for that 
section.

Public vs. Private vs. APIPA/Link Local
Within each of the three major classes of IP addresses, there is a range set aside for private 
addresses. These are addresses that do not communicate directly with the Internet (often 
using a proxy server or network address translation to do so), so each host’s address needs 
to be unique only within the realm of that network. Table 2.7 lists the private address 
ranges for Class A, B, and C addresses.

10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
C
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a TCP/IP feature Microsoft added to its 
operating systems. If a DHCP server cannot be found and the clients are configured to 
obtain IP addresses automatically, the clients automatically assign themselves an IP address, 
somewhat randomly, in the 169.254.x.x range with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0. This 
allows them to communicate with other hosts that have similarly configured themselves, 
but they are unable to connect to the Internet. If a computer is using an APIPA address, 
it will have trouble communicating with other clients if those clients do not use APIPA 
addresses.
In IPv6, there is a type of address called a link local address that in many ways is like an 
APIPA address in that the device will generate one of these addresses for each interface with 
no intervention from a human, as is done with APIPA. The scope of the address is also the 
same, in that it is not routable and is good only on the segment the device is located on.
However, as is the case with APIPA addresses, if two devices connected to the same 
segment generate these addresses, they will be in the same network, and the two devices 
will be able to communicate. This is because the devices always generate the address using 
the same IPv6 prefix (the equivalent of a network ID in IPv4), which is FE80::/64. The 
remainder of the address is created by spreading the 48-bit MAC address across the last 64 
bits yielding an IPv6 address that looks like the one shown here:
FE80::2237:06FF:FECF:67E4/64
Static vs. Dynamic
The two methods of entering address information for a host are static and dynamic. 
Static means that you manually enter the information for the host and it does not change. 
Dynamic means that DHCP is used for the host to lease information from.

156 
Chapter 2 ■ Networking 
 Client-Side DNS Settings 
 As stated earlier, every computer, interface, or device on a TCP/IP network is issued a 
unique identifi er known as an  IP address that resembles 192.168.12.123. Because of the 
Internet, TCP/IP is the most commonly used networking protocol today. You can easily see 
that it’s diffi cult for most users to memorize these numbers, so hostnames are used in their 
place.  Hostnames are alphanumeric values assigned to a host; any host may have more than 
one hostname. 
 For example, the host 192.168.12.123 may be known to all users as Gemini, or it may 
be known to the sales department as Gemini and to the marketing department as Apollo9. 
All that is needed is a means by which the alphanumeric name can be translated into its IP 
address. There are a number of methods of doing so, but for this exam, you need to know 
only one: DNS. On a large network, you can add a server to be referenced by all hosts 
for the name resolution. The server runs DNS and resolves fully qualifi ed domain names 
(FQDNs) like  www.entrepreneurshipcamp.com into their IP address. Multiple DNS servers 
can serve an area and provide fault tolerance for one another. In all cases, the DNS servers 
divide their area into zones; every zone has a primary server and any number of secondary 
servers. DNS works with any operating system and any version. 
 FQDNs identify the host and information about it. 
 Client-Side DHCP 
Dynamic Host Confi guration Protocol (DHCP) falls into a different category. Whereas 
DNS resolves names to IP addresses, DHCP issues IP confi guration data. 
 Rather than an administrator having to confi gure a unique IP address for every host 
added on a network (and  default gateway and  subnet mask ), they can use a DHCP server 
to issue these values. That server is given a number of addresses in a range that it can sup-
ply to clients. 
 For example, the server may be given the IP range (or  scope ) 192.168.12.1 to 
192.168.12.200. When a client boots, it sends out a request for the server to issue it an 
address (and any other confi guration data) from that scope. The server takes one of the 
numbers it has available and leases it to the client for a length of time. If the client is still 
using the confi guration data when 50 percent of the lease has expired, it requests a renewal 
of the lease from the server; under normal operating conditions, the request is granted. 
When the client is no longer using the address, the address goes back in the scope and can 
be issued to another client. 
 DHCP is built on the older Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) that was used to allow diskless 
workstations to boot and connect to a server that provided them with an operating system and 
applications. The client uses broadcasts to request the data and thus—normally—can’t communi-
cate with DHCP servers beyond their own subnet (broadcasts don’t route). A DHCP Relay Agent, 
however, can be employed to allow DHCP broadcasts to go from one network to another. 

2.3 Explain the Properties and Characteristics of TCP/IP 
157
 While the primary purpose of DHCP is to lease IP addresses to hosts, when it gives the 
IP address, it also often includes the additional confi guration information as well: DNS 
server, router information, and so on. 
 Subnet Mask vs. CIDR 
Subnetting your network is the process of taking the total number of hosts available to you 
and dividing it into smaller networks. When you confi gure TCP/IP on a host, you typically 
need only give three values: a unique IP address, a default gateway (router) address, and a 
subnet mask. Table  2.8 shows the default subnet mask for each class of network. 
 Purists may argue that you don’t need a default gateway. Technically this is 
true if your network is small and you don’t communicate beyond it. For all 
practical purposes, though, most networks need a default gateway. 
 TA b l E 2 . 8   Default subnet values 
Class
Default subnet mask
A
255.0.0.0
B
255.255.0.0
C
255.255.255.0
 When you use the default subnet mask, you’re allowing for all hosts to be at one site and 
not subdividing your network. This is called  classful subnetting. Any deviation from the 
default signifi es that you’re dividing the network into multiple subnetworks, which is called 
classless subnetting. 
 The problem with classful subnetting is that it allows for only three sizes of networks: 
Class A (16,777,216 hosts), Class B (65,536 hosts), and Class C (254 hosts). Two of these 
are too large to operate effi ciently in the real world, and when enterprises were issued 
public network IDs that were larger than they needed, many public IP addresses were 
wasted. For this reason and simply to allow for the creation of smaller networks that 
operate better, the concept of classless routing, or Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR), 
was born. 
 Using CIDR, administrators can create smaller networks called subnets, by manipulat-
ing the subnet mask of a larger classless or major network ID. This allows you to create a 
subnet that is much closer in size to what you need, thus wasting fewer IP addresses and 
increasing performance in each subnet. The increased performance is a function of the 
reduced broadcast traffi c generated in each subnet.

Chapter 2  ■  Networking   
Gateway
A gateway can have two meanings. In TCP/IP, a gateway is the address of the machine to 
send data to that is not intended for a host on this network (in other words, a default gate-
way). A gateway is also a physical device operating between the Transport and Application 
layers of the OSI model that can send data between dissimilar systems. The best example of 
the latter is a mail gateway—it doesn’t matter which two networks are communicating; the 
gateway allows them to exchange e-mail.
A gateway, as it is tested on the exam, is the server (router) that allows traffic beyond 
the internal network. Hosts are configured with the address of a gateway (called the default 
gateway), and if they need to correspond with a host outside the internal network, the data 
is sent to the gateway to facilitate this. When you configure TCP/IP on a host, one of the 
fields that should be provided is a gateway field, which specifies where data not intended for 
this network is sent in order to be able to communicate with the rest of the world.
Exam Essentials
Know the IP classes.    Class A addresses range from 0 to 126, Class B from 128 to 191, 
and Class C from 192 to 223. Within each class, there are private address ranges. Class 
A’s private range is from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, Class B is from 172.16.0.0 to 
172.31.255.255, and Class C is from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.
Understand what APIPA is.    Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a TCP/IP feature 
for clients that cannot find a DHCP server but are configured to get their address from 
DHCP. The clients automatically assign themselves an IP address, somewhat randomly, in 
the 169.254.x.x range with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0.
2.4 Explain Common TCP and UDP 
Ports, Protocols, and Their Purpose
Communication across a TCP/IP-based network takes place using various protocols, such 
as FTP to transfer files, HTTP to view web pages, and POP3 or IMAP to work with e-mail. 
Each of these protocols has a default port associated with it, and CompTIA expects you to 
be familiar with them for this exam.
Both TCP and UDP use port numbers to listen for and respond to requests for commu-
nication using various protocols. There are a number of protocols and their port numbers 
that you must know for this exam, as well as the differences between TCP and UDP.
Ports
There are two transport layer protocols in the TCP/IP stack. TCP provides guaranteed, 
connection-oriented delivery, while UDP provides nonguaranteed, connectionless delivery. 

2.4 Explain Common TCP and UDP Ports, Protocols, and Their Purpose 
159  
Each protocol or service uses one of the two transport protocols (and in some cases both). 
There will be additional information later in this chapter on TCP and UDP.
TCP and UDP both use port numbers to listen for and respond to requests for communi-
cations. RFC 1060 defines common ports for a number of services routinely found in use, 
and these all have low numbers—up to 1,024. You can, however, reconfigure your service 
to use another port number (preferably much higher) if you’re concerned about security and 
you don’t want your site to be available to anonymous traffic.
21—FTP    File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is both a TCP/IP protocol and software that permits 
the transferring of files between computer systems. Because FTP has been implemented on 
numerous types of computer systems, files can be transferred between disparate systems (for 
example, a personal computer and a minicomputer). It uses ports 20 and 21 by default. It can be 
configured to allow or deny access to specific IP addresses and can be configured to work with 
exceptions. While the protocol can be run within most browsers, a number of FTP applications 
are available, with FileZilla (http://filezilla-project.org/) being one of the most popular.
22—Secure Shell (SSH)    Secure Shell is a remote administration tool that can serve as a 
secure alternative to using Telnet to remotely access and configure a device like a router or 
switch. While requiring a bit more setup than Telnet, it provides an encrypted command-
line session for managing devices remotely.
23—Telnet    Telnet is a protocol that functions at the application layer of the OSI model, 
providing terminal-emulation capabilities. Telnet runs on port 23 but has lost favor to SSH 
because Telnet sends data—including passwords—in plain-text format.
25—SMTP    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol for sending e-mail 
between SMTP servers. Clients typically use either IMAP or POP to access their e-mail 
server and use SMTP to send e-mail. SMTP uses port 25 by default.
53—DNS    As mentioned earlier, DNS is the Domain Name System, and it is used to translate 
hostnames into IP addresses. DNS is an example of a protocol that uses both UDP and TCP.
80—HTTP    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used for communication 
between a web server and a web browser. It uses port 80 by default.
110—POP3    The Post Office Protocol (POP) is a protocol for receiving e-mail from a mail 
server. The alternative to POP (which runs on port 110) is IMAP.
143—IMAP    Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a protocol with a store-and-
forward capability. It can also allow messages to be stored on an e-mail server instead of 
downloaded to the client. The current version of the protocol is 4 (IMAP4), and the coun-
terpart to it is Post Office Protocol (POP). IMAP runs on port 143.
443—HTTPS    Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS) is a pro-
tocol used to make a secure connection. It uses port 443 by default.
3389—RDP    Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used in a Windows environment to make 
remote desktop communications possible.
137-139 (UDP ports 137, 138 & TCP ports 137, 139), 445—SMB    Server Message Block 
(SMB) is an application layer protocol used to provide shared access to resources. It is 

160 
Chapter 2  ■  Networking   
primary used in Windows systems with the latest version being 3.02, which was released 
to support Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012R2. It operated as a client-server 
application.
548— or 427—AFP    Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) is a proprietary resource sharing proto-
col by Apple, one of several it supports. It uses port 548 or 427 for communication. The 
latest version, 3.4, was introduced with the OS Mountain Lion system.
Just associating each protocol with a port doesn’t do much good. You should also know 
what the protocol is used for. The following sections look at each of the ports in the table 
and explain a bit about them.
Protocols
There are a number of protocols that CompTIA lists for this objective. Among them are 
DHCP and DNS, which were covered fully in the discussion of objective 2.3. The others 
are as follows:
LDAP    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a protocol that provides a mecha-
nism to access and query directory services systems. These directory services systems are 
most likely to be Microsoft’s Active Directory but could also be Novell Directory Services 
(NDS). Although LDAP supports command-line queries executed directly against the direc-
tory database, most LDAP interactions are via utilities such as an authentication program 
(network logon) or a search engine that locates a resource in the directory.
SNMP    Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol that facilitates net-
work management functionality. It is not, in itself, a network management system (NMS), 
simply the protocol that makes NMS possible.
SMB    Server Message Blocks (SMBs) are used to share access to resources. While the 
newest versions of SMB (versions 30 and 30.2) are proprietary to Microsoft, compatible 
versions are available in Linux operating systems, allowing them to still share the printers, 
files, and other resources that have been made available across the network.
CIFS    Common Internet File System (CFIS) is a cross-platform implementation of SMB 
that became the native file system in Windows starting with Windows 2000. It is also sup-
ported on many other systems such as Unix, Mac OS, and IBM.
SSH    The Secure Shell (SSH) application replaces Telnet and provides the same function-
ality while increasing security. SSH runs on port 22 and encrypts the transmitted data, 
including the password.
AFP    Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) was discussed in the section “Ports.”
TCP vs. UDP
Operating at the transport layer of the TCP/IP stack are two key protocols: Transmission 
Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The biggest difference 

2.5 Compare and Contrast Various Wi-Fi Networking Standards 
161
between these two is that one is connection based (TCP) and the other works in the absence 
of a dedicated connection (UDP). Both are needed and serve key roles.
If you are sending credit card information to a website, you need a dedicated connection 
between your host and the server, so TCP handles that task. An example of UDP is DHCP. 
When a client sends a request for any DHCP server listening to give it an address, it is not 
requiring a dedicated communication.
Exam Essentials
Know the default ports.    There are a number of protocols you need to know the default 
ports for: FTP (20/21), Telnet (23), SMTP (25), DNS (53), HTTP (80), POP3 (110), IMAP 
(143), HTTPS (443), and RDP (3389).
Know what the protocols do.    In addition to the protocols for which ports are given, know 
as well DHCP, DNS, LDAP, SNMP, SMB, CIFS, SSH, and AFP.

Wi-Fi Networking Standards and 
Encryption Types
More and more, networks are using wireless as the medium of choice. It is much easier to 
implement, reconfigure, upgrade, and use than wired networks. Unfortunately, there can be 
downsides, with security being one of the largest.
The 802.11 standard applies to wireless networking, and there have been many versions/
types of it released; the main ones are a, b, g, and n. Encryption has gone from very weak 
(WEP) to much stronger with increments along the way, including WPA, WPA2, and imple-
mentations of TKIP and AES.
Standards
The IEEE 802.11x family of protocols provides for wireless communications using 
radio frequency transmissions. The frequencies in use for 802.11 standards are the 
2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency spectrums. Several standards and bandwidths have 
been defined for use in wireless environments, and they aren’t extremely compatible 
with each other.
802.11a    The 802.11a standard provides wireless LAN bandwidth of up to 54 Mbps in the 
5 GHz frequency spectrum. The 802.11a standard also uses orthogonal frequency division 
multiplexing (OFDM) for encoding rather than FHSS or DSSS.

162 
Chapter 2  ■  Networking   
802.11b    The 802.11b standard provides for bandwidths of up to 11 Mbps (with fallback 
rates of 5.5, 2, and 1 Mbps) in the 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum. This standard is also 
called Wi-Fi or 802.11 high rate. The 802.11b standard uses only DSSS for data encoding.
802.11g    The 802.11g standard operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum. This offers a 
maximum rate of 54 Mbps and is backward compatible with 802.11b.
802.11n    The goal of the 802.11n standard is to significantly increase throughput in both 
the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges. The baseline goal of the standard was to reach 
speeds of 100 Mbps, but given the right conditions, it is estimated that the 802.11n speeds 
might be able to reach 600 Mbps. In practical operation, 802.11n speeds will be much 
slower. It is also backward compatible with 802.11 a/b/g.
802.11ac    The 802.11ac standard builds upon the features of 802.11n and improves on 
them in the following ways:
■
■
Wider channels (40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz)
■
■
New modulation (256 Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), which has the poten-
tial to provide a 30 percent increase in speed)
■
■
More spatial streams (up to eight spatial streams)
■
■
Improved MIMO and beamforming with the use of multi-user MIMO, allowing an AP 
to transmit a signal to multiple client stations on the same channel simultaneously if 
the client stations are in different physical areas
With 802.11ac, which operates only in the 5 GHz frequency range, it is possible to achieve 
a data rate of almost 2 Gbps if the AP and the station have enough antennas.
Three technologies are used to communicate in the 802.11 standard.
Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)    DSSS accomplishes communication by adding 
the data that is to be transmitted to a higher-speed transmission. The higher-speed trans-
mission contains redundant information to ensure data accuracy. Each packet can then be 
reconstructed in the event of a disruption.
Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)    FHSS accomplishes communication by hop-
ping the transmission over a range of predefined frequencies. The changing or hopping is 
synchronized between both ends and appears to be a single transmission channel to both 
ends.
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)    OFDM accomplishes communi-
cation by breaking the data into subsignals and transmitting them simultaneously. These 
transmissions occur on different frequencies or subbands.
The mathematics and theories of these transmission technologies are beyond the scope 
of this book and far beyond the scope of this exam.

Encryption Types
There are a number of wireless encryption “types” you need to know for the A+ exam. 
These are WEP, WPA, WPA2, TKIP, and AES.
Let’s take a closer look at each.
WEP    Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a standard that was created as a first stab 
at security for wireless devices. Using WEP-encrypted data to provide data security has 
always been under scrutiny for not being as secure as initially intended. WEP is vulner-
able because of weaknesses in the way the encryption algorithms are employed. These 
weaknesses allow the algorithm to potentially be cracked in as few as five minutes using 
available PC software. This makes WEP one of the most vulnerable protocols available for 
security.
WPA    The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) tech-
nologies were designed to address the core problems with WEP. These technologies 
implement the 802.11i standard. The difference between WPA and WPA2 is that the 
former implements most—but not all—of 802.11i in order to be able to communicate 
with older wireless cards (which might still need an update through their firmware to 
be compliant), while WPA2 implements the full standard and is not compatible with 
older cards.
WPA2    WPA2 implements the full 802.11i standard for security and is not compatible 
with older wireless cards.
TKIP    WPA was able to increase security by using a Temporal Key Integrity Protocol 
(TKIP) to scramble encryption keys using a hashing algorithm. The keys are issued an 
integrity check to verify they have not been modified or tampered with during transit. 
While a good solution, it was far from perfect. Corporate security today favors WPA2 since 
it replaces TKIP with Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication 
Code Protocol (CCMP).

164 
Chapter 2 ■ Networking 
AES  CCMP uses 128-bit Advanced Encryption Security ( AES ) with a 48-bit initialization 
vector, making it much more diffi cult to crack and minimizing the risk of a replay attack. 
 Never assume that a wireless connection is secure. The emissions from 
a wireless portal may be detectable through walls and for several blocks 
from the portal. Interception is easy to accomplish, given that RF is the 
medium used for communication. Newer wireless devices offer data secu-
rity, and you should use it. You can set newer WAPs and wireless routers 
to nonbroadcast. This is also sometimes called  disabling the broadcast of 
the SSID. Given the choice, you should choose to use WPA2, WPA, or WEP 
at its highest encryption level in that order. 
 Exam Essentials 
Understand wired and wireless connectivity.  Networks work the same whether there is 
a physical wire between the hosts or that wire has been replaced by a wireless signal. The 
same order of operations and steps are carried out regardless of the medium employed. 
Know the capabilities and limitations of the 802.11 x network standards.  The current stan-
dards for wireless protocols are 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11ac. 
 Know the vulnerabilities of wireless networks.  The primary method of gaining informa-
tion about a wireless network is a site survey. Site surveys can be accomplished with a PC 
and an 802.11 card. Wireless networks are subject to the same attacks as wired networks. 
 2.6 Given a Scenario, Install and 
Configure a SOHO Wireless/Wired 
Router and Apply Appropriate Settings 
 Small offi ce and home offi ce (SOHO) networks can be created easily today and relatively 
inexpensively. You can choose to do so with or without wires. While there isn’t a hard-and-
fast rule on what the limit is for a SOHO network, the term is generally used for networks 
of 10 or fewer workstations. 
 One of the biggest differences between SOHO networks and larger local area networks 
(LANs) is the way they connect to the outside world. While a LAN would never connect in 
today’s world through an ADSL connection, it is still common in a SOHO network. 
 This section will look at the connection types and possibilities that exist for small net-
works, as well as some of the basics of network confi guration. While a number of topics in 
this section are not part of the offi cial objectives, they are included because they are both 
important and helpful to your understanding. 

2.6 Given a Scenario, Install and Configure a SOHO Wireless 
165
 MAC Filtering 
 One way to increase security is to implement  MAC fi ltering . Every network card has a 
unique 48-bit address assigned to it—half of which identifi es the vendor of the card and 
the other half of which acts like a serial number. When MAC fi ltering is implemented, you 
identify each host by this number and determine specifi cally which addresses are allowed 
access to the network. While a great security tool, bear in mind that it is identifying the 
NIC and not the person sitting at that machine, so it cannot ever be the only form of 
authentication employed. 
 An example of a MAC address is 00-21-6A-2C-89-3C. 
 Channels (1–11) 
 Wireless routers can be set to use different channels, which are numbered 1 through 11 (1, 
6, and 11 are those commonly used in the United States). Each channel represents a differ-
ent frequency. You can change the channel to avoid interference—either from another net-
work nearby or from devices also using that frequency. 
 The channel change is made only on the router because each client should automatically 
detect and change to the new channel. 
 SSID Broadcast (On/Off) 
 Many networks will regularly broadcast their name (known as an  SSID broadcast ) to 
announce their presence. For security reasons, you should change the SSID from its default 
value (if one is preconfi gured) and disable broadcasts where possible. Disabling the broad-
casts prevents snooping eyes from seeing that the network is there but does not affect oper-
ations in any other way—clients simply need to specify the name of the network without 
having the assistance of seeing it. 
 Wireless Encryption 
 Domain 2.5, which preceded this one, is focused solely on wireless encryption. Information 
is not repeated here to avoid needless repetition, but you are advised to read it there. 
 Port Forwarding/Triggering 
 A fi rewall can be hardware- or software-based. At its simplest, fi rewall confi guration is 
accomplished by confi guring ports and rules. A  port is an interface that is used to connect 
to a device and is identifi ed by number. Throughout this book, many well-known ports 
have been discussed by their number (SMTP on port 25, for example). 

166 
Chapter 2  ■  Networking   
When you use a service, the default port is implied, but you can always change the port 
assignment if you want to increase security. For example, when you attempt to connect 
to a website, you’ll use port 80 by default. (A socket is the combination of the IP address 
and the port number. If you were accessing a website at 192.168.0.100, the combination 
of these two elements would give you a socket; the full address and port description would 
then be 192.168.0.100:80.)
The assignment can be changed so that a server offers the web service at a port other 
than the default, such as 8080. If that is done, the service can be accessed by the client by 
specifying the socket: http://192.168.0.100:8080.
Port forwarding (also known as port mapping) is the act of mapping one port to 
another. This is essentially the same as what NAT does, and it allows external users to 
access the private LAN. This is useful when you want to allow only some external users 
(partners, for example) to be able to access the network resources remotely. These ports 
can be left open all the time or turned on only when needed. If the latter is the case, this is 
known as port triggering. With triggering, an inbound attempt at connection triggers the 
opening of an outbound port, and communication is now possible. Obviously, the trigger is 
activated only after all authentication measures have been successfully met.
Another aspect of firewall configuration is the establishment of rules. The rules are cri-
teria given for what is allowed to pass through or connect to the network. These rules are 
typically accept- or deny-based (but can be configured to include exceptions). For example, 
you may choose to deny all connections except those specifically allowed; this is much 
better than the alternative of allowing all except those specifically denied, which creates a 
security nightmare.
Rules can typically be created based on the following:
■
■
Direction, which can be inbound or outbound
■
■
Protocol source, which can be either TCP (connection-based) or UDP (connectionless)
■
■
Address source
■
■
Port
■
■
Destination address
■
■
Destination port
If you want to limit all of any one criterion—for example, all destination ports—most 
firewalls allow you to use the value any for this purpose.
DHCP (On/Off)
This chapter has discussed DHCP a few times already. It serves a useful purpose of issu-
ing IP addresses and other network-related configuration values to clients to allow them 
to operate on the network. The router can perform this function on a SOHO network and 
simplify the administrator’s life.
From a security standpoint, however, having the router do this can present a serious 
concern. Since the values can be issued to any wireless device that comes within range, it is 

2.6 Given a Scenario, Install and Configure a SOHO Wireless 
167
possible that a rogue machine could be issued these values and then be allowed on the net-
work. In the interest of security, I recommend that the DHCP feature be turned off on the 
router and IP addresses (along with other networking values) manually entered for the clients. 
 DMZ 
 The networking equivalent of a security zone is a network security zone. They perform the 
same function. If you divide a network into smaller sections, each zone can have its own 
security considerations and measures—just like a physical security zone. This arrangement 
allows layers of security to be built around sensitive information. The division of the net-
work is accomplished by implementing virtual LANs (VLANs) or instituting demilitarized 
zones (DMZs). 
 A  demilitarized zone (DMZ) is an area where you can place a public server for access 
by people you might not trust otherwise. By isolating a server in a DMZ, you can hide or 
remove access to other areas of your network. You can still access the server using your net-
work, but others aren’t able to access further network resources. This can be accomplished 
using fi rewalls to isolate your network. 
 When establishing a DMZ, you assume that the person accessing the resource isn’t necessar-
ily someone you would trust with other information. By keeping the rest of the network from 
being visible to external users, this lowers the threat of intrusion in the internal network.  
 Any time you want to separate public information from private information, 
a DMZ is an acceptable option.  
 The easiest way to create a DMZ is to use a fi rewall that can transmit in three 
directions. 
 
■
 To the internal network 
 
■
 To the external world (Internet) 
 
■
 To the public information you’re sharing (the DMZ) 
 From there, you can decide what traffi c goes where; for example, HTTP traffi c would be 
sent to the DMZ, and e-mail would go to the internal network. 
 NAT/DNAT 
Network address translation (NAT) creates a unique opportunity to assist in the security 
of a network. Originally, NAT extended the number of usable Internet addresses. Now it 
allows an organization to present a single address to the Internet for all computer connec-
tions. The NAT server provides IP addresses to the hosts or systems in the network and 
tracks inbound and outbound traffi c. 
 A company that uses NAT presents a single connection to the network. This connection 
may be through a router or a NAT server. The only information that an intruder will be 
able to get is that the connection has a single address. 

168 
Chapter 2 ■ Networking 
 NAT effectively hides your network from the world, making it much harder to determine 
what systems exist on the other side of the router. The NAT server effectively operates as a 
fi rewall for the network. Most new routers support NAT; it provides a simple, inexpensive 
fi rewall for small networks. 
 It’s important to understand that NAT acts as a proxy between the local 
area network (which can be using private IP addresses) and the Internet. 
Not only can NAT save IP addresses, but it can also act as a firewall. 
 Most NAT implementations assign internal hosts private IP address numbers and use 
public addresses only for the NAT to translate to and communicate with the outside 
world. The private address ranges, all of which are addresses that are nonroutable, are 
as follows: 
 
■
 10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255 
 
■
 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255 
 
■
 192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255 
 In addition to NAT, port address translation (PAT) is possible. Whereas NAT 
can use multiple public IP addresses, PAT uses a single one and shares 
the port with the network. Because it is using only a single port, PAT is 
much more limited and typically used only on small and home-based 
networks. Microsoft’s Internet Connection Sharing is an example of a PAT 
implementation. 
Destination network address translation (DNAT) is a technique for transparently 
changing the  destination IP address of an end route packet and performing the inverse 
function for any replies. 
 Also known as Transparent Traffi c Forwarding, DNAT provides a facility to send HTTP 
user traffi c to another destination, such as a centralized content fi lter, authentication server, 
or some other external location, based on defi ned criteria; it accomplishes a similar goal as 
port forwarding. 
 WPS 
 Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) simplifi es the security confi guration of small home net-
works by implementing WPA2 encryption and allowing new devices to join the network 
by pressing a button on the router instead of having to enter a complicated passphrase. 
When a new device (called an  enrollee ) needs to join, you simply press the button on 
the access point and the registrar enrolls the device. The access point itself can be the 
registrar (common), or it can pass the information on to a server that does the actual 
enrollment (not common).

169
Basic QoS
Quality of Service (QoS) describes the strategies used to manage the flow of network traf-
fic. A network administrator can use QoS to manage the amount of bandwidth provided to 
applications that are latency sensitive (those that don’t function well with lags—voice and 
video, for example).
One way QoS accomplishes this is by prioritizing latency-sensitive applications over 
latency-insensitive ones and then doing priority queuing. Traffic is placed in order based 
on its importance on delivery time. All data is given access, but the more important and 
latency-sensitive data is given higher priority.
Firmware
Like many hardware devices, wireless access points, wireless routers, and wireless con-
trollers use firmware to manage the hardware in the device. In many cases, the firmware 
version will determine the features and functions that are available on the device. For this 
reason you create a plan to monitor the vendor website for any firmware updates that are 
issued.
Firmware updates either correct something that isn’t working or add additional func-
tionality to the device. The most critical firmware updates are those that address and cor-
rect security vulnerabilities. These are updates you don’t want to miss because otherwise 
your device has a security vulnerability.
UPnP
Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a protocol that lets computers, printers, and other 
devices make themselves easily discoverable to a network router. Promoted by the UPnP 
Forum, a computer industry initiative, it is available on many wireless APs and routers. 
While it makes it easier to connect devices, it does have security issues.
In several studies it has been shown that more than 6,900 network-aware products from 
1,500 companies at 81 million IP addresses responded to their discovery requests on the 
Internet. Depending on the security posture of the device, many of those devices can be 
accessed or manipulated. For this reason, many have called for disabling this feature on 
wireless routers or APs.
Exam Essentials
Know the difference between port forwarding and port triggering.    Port forwarding is the 
act of mapping one port to another (essentially the same as what NAT does). Port triggering 
involves turning on ports only when they are needed.
Understand MAC filtering.    When MAC filtering is implemented, you identify each host by 
this number and determine specifically which addresses are allowed to access the network.

2.7 Compare and Contrast Internet 
Connection Types, Network Types,  
and Their Features
Your network can connect to the Internet in a number of ways. This can range from the 
slow dial-up connection that is established only when you need it to be established to a high 
speed fiber connection that is always on. This section looks at many of the options available 
and all that you need to know for this objective on the A+ exam.
When discussing ways to connect to the Internet, most of the discussion is on broadband 
network techniques. It is imperative that you understand the various types of networks, 
including broadband. The sections that follow will focus on the key issues associated with 
connecting to the Internet.
Cable
Two of the most popular methods of connecting to the Internet today are using DSL or a cable. 
Instead of the service coming from a telephone company as with DSL, cable service is provided by 
the cable provider, and a cable modem is used. While speeds vary based on the number of users 
the cable company is servicing, as a general rule cable-based broadband service is faster than DSL.
DSL
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) uses existing phone lines with a DSL modem and a network card. 
A standard RJ-45 connector is used to connect the network card to the DSL modem, and a phone 
cord with RJ-11 connectors is used to connect the DSL modem to the phone jack. Multiple types 
of DSL exist; the most popular are high bit-rate DSL (HDSL), symmetric DSL (SDSL), very 
high bit-rate DSL (VHDSL), rate-adaptive DSL (RADSL), and asymmetric DSL (ADSL). The 
latter provides slower upload than download speed and is the most common for home use. While 
speeds may vary depending on the quality of the connection and the equipment used, Table 2.10 
shows the most common upload and download speeds for the various flavors of DSL.

 Dial-up 
 Whereas broadband holds great promise for high-speed connections, there are many people 
(quite a few in rural areas) who cannot take advantage of this. Thankfully, one of the fi rst 
methods of remote access, dial-up networking, is still in existence. With dial-up, you add a 
modem to your computer and connect to an Internet service provider (ISP) over the existing 
phone lines, also known as the  Plain Old Telephone System (POTS). With a good connec-
tion, you can transmit and receive at 56 Kbps. 
 Fiber 
 Fiber-optic cabling provides excellent speed and bandwidth but is expensive. Not only are 
the cables that you use costly, but the light-emitting/receiving hardware costs also make 
this an expensive undertaking. Because of the cost involved, fi ber is often an option for 
businesses only when it comes to broadband access. 
 Fiber to the Home (FTTH) is an attempt some communities are undertaking to offer 
high-speed connectivity to residential dwellings as well. Verizon’s FiOS, a similar imple-
mentation, runs single-mode optical fi ber to homes and includes phone and television 
service along with Internet access. 
 Satellite 
 Whereas the other broadband technologies discussed require the use of physical wiring, 
with satellite broadband the service provider sends a microwave signal from a dish to an 
orbiting satellite and back. One satellite can service many receivers, so this is commonly 
known as  point-to-multipoint technology. As a general rule, satellite connections are 
slower than the other broadband technologies you need to know for the exam, and they are 
adversely affected by weather and atmospheric conditions. 
 With satellite, download speed is much faster than upload speed. 
 ISDN 
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a WAN technology that performs link man-
agement and signaling by virtue of packet switching. The original idea behind it was to let 
existing phone lines carry digital communications by using multiplexing to support mul-
tiple channels. 
 Cellular 
 Mobile devices have made cellular networking popular, though they are not the only 
devices capable of using networking; for example, a cellular modem can also be quickly 
added to a laptop. Cellular networks use a central access point (a cell tower) in a mesh 

172 
Chapter 2 ■ Networking 
network design. For a long time, two competing standards were the  Global System for 
Mobile Communications (GSM) and the  Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA); the 
latest technology is Long Term Evolution (LTE), which is used in 4G networks. 
 Most cellular phone companies now have specialized wireless routers that 
are used to create mobile hotspots. These cards act as stand-alone routers 
to the Internet using the cellular phone network. 
 Tethering 
Tethering is the process of connecting a device to a smartphone or tablet with a cel-
lular connection for the purpose of using the Internet connection on the cellular device. 
Connecting to the phone or tablet with the other device can be done using 802.11, 
Bluetooth, or a physical connection using a cable, for example through USB. 
 Mobile Hotspot 
 When the devices using the Internet connection on the cellular device are connected wire-
lessly using 802.11, it is sometimes called a  mobile hotspot . This is also the term used for 
devices that are capable of acting as a hotspot for surrounding Wi-Fi devices. The mobile 
hotspot device may get its Internet access through either cellular or 802.11. 
 Line-of-Sight Wireless Internet Service 
 Line-of-sight wireless, as the name implies, requires you to have a direct line of vision 
between your location and the ISP. Because this uninterrupted path must be main-
tained, distances are quite short, and this method is not widely used.  
 Network Types 
 You should know the terminology used for networking as well as the major topologies that 
are available. Networks consist of servers and clients. A  server is a dedicated machine offer-
ing services such as fi le and print sharing. A  client is any individual workstation accessing 
the network. A  workstation is a client machine that accesses services elsewhere (normally 
from a server). 
 Networks differ in size and scope. The size of the network on which servers and clients 
operate can range signifi cantly. 
 LAN 
 A  local area network (LAN) is a network that is geographically confi ned within a small 
space—a room, a building, and so on. Because it’s confi ned and does not have to span a 
great distance, it can normally offer higher speeds.

With Ethernet, you can often use the network type to compute the required length and 
speed of your cabling. For example, 100BaseT tells you three things:
■
■
100: The speed of the network, 100 Mbps.
■
■
Base: The technology used (either baseband or broadband).
■
■
T: Twisted-pair cabling. In the case of 10BaseT, it’s generally UTP.
When you configure a network, one of the first places to turn your attention is the rout-
ers and access points—they are the hardware components on which network access can 
rely. Because these devices must always be able to be found, I suggest that you not use 
DHCP to issue them addresses but that you configure their addresses statically.
To increase security, devices should be behind a firewall, and you should always change 
the administrative username and password that comes preconfigured with these devices to 
ones that adhere to stringent password policies (mixture of uppercase and lowercase alpha-
bet, numbers, and special characters), and you should keep the firmware updated.
With wireless access points, you should change the SSID from its default value (if one is 
preconfigured) and disable broadcasts. MAC filtering can be used on a wireless network, 
for example, to prevent certain clients from accessing the Internet. You can choose to deny 
service to a set list of MAC addresses (and allow all others) or allow service only to a set of 
MAC addresses (and deny all others).
WAN
A wide area network (WAN) is a collection of two or more LANs, typically connected by 
routers, and dedicated leased lines (not to mention complicated implementations). The geo-
graphic limitation is removed, but WAN speeds are traditionally less than LAN speeds.
PAN
A personal area network (PAN) is a LAN created by personal devices. Often, personal 
devices include networking capabilities and can communicate directly with one another. 
Wireless technologies have introduced a new term: wireless personal area network 
(WPAN). WPAN refers to the technologies involved in connecting devices in close prox-
imity to exchange data or resources. An example is connecting a laptop with a PDA 
to synchronize an address book. Because of their small size and the nature of the data 
exchange, WPAN devices lend themselves well to ad hoc wireless networking. Ad hoc 
wireless networks are those that have devices connect to each other directly, not through 
a wireless access point.
MAN
Occasionally, a WAN will be referenced as a metropolitan area network (MAN) when it is 
confined to a certain geographic area, such as a university campus or city. No formal guide-
lines dictate the differences between a MAN and a WAN; technically, a MAN is a WAN. 
Perhaps for this reason, the term MAN is used less frequently than WAN. If any distinction 
exists, it’s that a MAN is smaller than a WAN. A MAN is almost always bigger than a 

174 
Chapter 2  ■  Networking   
LAN and usually is smaller than or equal to a WAN. MANs utilize an ISP or telecommuni-
cations (telco) provider.
Exam Essentials
Know the differences between Internet connection types.    Many technologies can be used 
to obtain Internet access. DSL and cable are two of the most popular for SOHO networks 
and require modems. DSL service is provided by the telephone provider in the area, and 
cable service is provided by the area cable television provider.
Understand ISDN’s purpose.    The original idea behind it was to let existing phone lines 
carry digital communications by using multiplexing to support multiple channels.
Know the various types of networks.    A network is a collection of computers that can 
interact with one another and share files and resources. The network may be peer-to-peer 
or client-server. LANs are confined to local, whereas WANs expand that limit.
2.8 Compare and Contrast Network 
Architecture Devices, Their Functions, 
and Features
To make a network, you need a number of devices. The most common of those devices are 
tested on the A+ exam and discussed in this section.
Networks are built using a number of devices. Know those that are covered in this sec-
tion to be able to answer questions on their functions and features when presented with 
them on the A+ exam.
Hub
Hubs are used in networks that use twisted-pair cabling to connect devices, and they 
can be used to join segments into larger networks. Hubs direct data packets to all 
devices connected to the hub, regardless of whether the data package is destined for 
the device. This makes them inefficient by nature and can create a performance bot-
tleneck on busy networks. In its most basic form, a hub does nothing except provide 
a pathway for the electrical signals to travel along. Such a device is called a passive 
hub. Far more common nowadays is an active hub, which, as well as providing a path 
for the data signals, regenerates the signal before it forwards it to all the connected 
devices. In addition, an active hub can buffer data before forwarding it. However, a 
hub does not perform any processing on the data it forwards, nor does it perform any 
error checking.

2.8 Compare and Contrast Network Architecture Devices 
175
Switch
Like hubs, switches are the connectivity points of an Ethernet network. Devices connect to 
switches via twisted-pair cabling, one cable for each device. The difference between hubs 
and switches is in how the devices deal with the data they receive. Whereas a hub forwards 
the data it receives to all the ports on the device, a switch forwards it to only the port that 
connects to the destination device. It does this by learning the MAC address of the devices 
attached to it and then by matching the destination MAC address in the data it receives.
Router
A router is used to connect LANs together; you can even use a router to connect dissimilar 
topologies that use the same protocol because physical specifications don’t apply. A router 
can be a dedicated hardware device or a computer system with more than one network 
interface and the appropriate routing software. All modern network operating systems 
include the functionality to act as a router.
Access Point
Access points (APs) are transmitter and receiver (transceiver) devices used to create a wire-
less LAN (WLAN). APs typically are a separate network device with a built-in antenna, 
transmitter, and adapter. APs use the wireless infrastructure network mode to provide a 
connection point between WLANs and a wired Ethernet LAN. APs also typically have sev-
eral ports, giving you a way to expand the network to support additional clients.
Depending on the size of the network, one or more APs might be required. Additional APs 
are used to allow access to more wireless clients and to expand the range of the wireless net-
work. Each AP is limited by a transmission range—the distance a client can be from an AP 
and still obtain a usable signal. The actual distance depends on the wireless standard being 
used and the obstructions and environmental conditions between the client and the AP.
Bridge
Bridges are used to divide larger networks into smaller sections. Bridges accomplish this by 
sitting between two physical network segments and managing the flow of data between the 
two. By looking at the MAC address of the devices connected to each segment, bridges can 
elect to forward the data (if they believe that the destination address is on another interface) 
or block it from crossing (if they can verify that it is on the interface from which it came).
Modem
A modem, short for modulator/demodulator, is a device that converts the digital signals gener-
ated by a computer into analog signals that can travel over conventional phone lines. The modem 
at the receiving end converts the signal back into a format that the computer can understand. 

176 
Chapter 2  ■  Networking   
Modems can be used as a means to connect to an ISP or as a mechanism for dialing up a LAN. 
Modems can be internal add-in expansion cards or integrated with the motherboard, external 
devices that connect to a system’s serial or USB port, PCMCIA cards designed for use in laptops, 
or proprietary devices designed for use on other devices, such as portables and handhelds.
Firewall
A firewall is a server that sits between the internal network and the rest of the world and 
filters what goes between the two. While the filter can be done on programs, most are done 
on ports since applications and protocols use ports that are recognized. Open ports are 
those that allow traffic, whereas closed ports are those that block traffic. The firewall can 
be software- or hardware-based, and most incorporate both. The firewall may incorporate 
a proxy, a gateway, and a filter.
Patch Panel
A patch panel is a device to which the cables running through the walls from the hosts are 
connected. Then shorter cables called patch cables run from the patch panel to the switch 
or hub. Three types of patch panels are shown in Figure 2.12.
F i g u r e   2 .12    Patch panels
(JPE004F) Patch panel type A
(JPE005F) Patch panel type B
(JPE006F) Patch panel type C
Repeaters/Extenders
A repeater or extender is a device that regenerates any signal that goes through it. It can be 
used to extend a cable run that exceeds the maximum allowable distance. For example, if 
you needed to run a cable with a maximum allowable length of 100 meters for 150 meters, 
you could put a repeater between two 75 feet lengths of cable, and the problem would be 
solved. Figure 2.13 illustrates the use of a repeater.

Ethernet over Power
Ethernet over Power is a technology designed to allow for the sending of Ethernet frames over 
the power lines in a facility. In Figure 2.14, a device called a power line Ethernet bridge plugs 
into the wall outlet, and then the devices or a switch are plugged into the bridge. This eliminates 
the need to install costly power outlets and leverages the existing power lines in the building.

Power over Ethernet Injector
Many times when installing devices, the device needs to be located far from an available 
power outlet. On switches that support Power over Ethernet (PoE), the switch can supply 
power on the same data cable used to connect to the device. So if you get the device within 
100 meters of a switch, you can eliminate the need to install costly power outlets.
A PoE injector is a device that can be used to provide PoE to a device when the switch 
does not support PoE. It plugs into the wall, then a line providing data and PoE is run to 
the device and another cable runs to the switch, as shown in Figure 2.15.

Exam Essentials
Know the two types of hubs.    Hubs can be passive or active. If the hub does nothing 
except provide a pathway for the electrical signals to travel along, it is passive. It if regener-
ates the signal, it is considered active.
Be able to recognize a firewall.    A firewall is a server that sits between the internal net-
work and the rest of the world and filters what goes between the two.
2.9 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate 
Networking Tools
To create a network and solve problems with it, you need a toolbox. While some of the 
tools you use will be in the form of software, many others are hardware, and those are the 
ones this objective focuses on.

2.9 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Networking Tools 
179  
No networking administrators worth their pay would try to troubleshoot a problem 
without a set of tools. The tools that should be readily on hand include a crimper for fix-
ing connectors, a multimeter for checking signals, a toner probe to find breaks in a cable, a 
cable tester, a loopback plug, and a punchdown tool.
Crimper
Wire crimpers look like pliers but are used to attach media connectors to the ends of cables. 
For instance, you use one type of wire crimper to attach RJ-45 connectors on unshielded 
twisted-pair (UTP) cable. You use a different type of wire crimper to attach Bayonet Neill-
Concelman (BNCs) to coaxial cabling.
Cable Stripper
A cable stripper is used to remove the outer covering of the cable to get to the wire pairs 
within. You place the end of the cable in the mouth of the device, close the mouth, and then 
circle the cable, cutting away the outer sheath without damaging the wire pairs within. 
Figure 2.16 shows a cable stripper.
F i g u r e   2 .16    Cable stripper
Multimeter
A multimeter combines a number of tools into one. There can be slight variations, but a 
multimeter always includes a voltmeter, an ohmmeter, and an ammeter (and is sometimes 
called VOM as an acronym). With one basic multimeter, you can measure voltage, current, 
and resistance (some will even measure temperature).
A multimeter has a display, terminals, probes, and a dial to select various measurement 
ranges. A digital multimeter has a numeric digital display, and an analog has a dial display. 

180 
Chapter 2 ■ Networking 
Inside a multimeter, the terminals are connected to different resistors, depending on the 
range selected. 
 Toner Generator and Probe 
 A  toner probe has two parts: the tone generator (called the  toner ) and the tone locator 
(called the  probe ). The toner sends the tone, and at the other end of the cable, the probe 
receives the toner’s signal. This tool makes it easier to fi nd the beginning and end of a cable. 
The purpose of the toner probe is to generate a signal that is transmitted on the wire you 
are attempting to locate. At the other end, you press the probe against individual wires. 
When it makes contact with the wire that has the signal on it, the locator emits an audible 
signal or tone. 
 A toner probe can be used to find breaks in a cable. 
 Cable Tester 
Cable testers (sometimes called  media testers ) are used to verify that the cable you are 
using is good. Commonly used with network cabling, you can perform many of the same 
tests with a multimeter. Any tool that facilitates the testing of a cable can be deemed a 
cable tester, but a media tester allows administrators to test a segment of cable, looking for 
shorts, improperly attached connectors, or other cable faults. All media testers have a way 
of telling you whether the cable is working correctly and where the problem in the cable 
might be. 
 Loopback Plug 
 Also called wrap plugs,  loopback plugs take the signal going out and essentially echo it 
back. This allows you to test ports to make certain they’re working correctly. 
 To simply test an implementation of TCP/IP on a host, you can always use 
the loopback address of 127.0.0.1. This is often used with ping (discussed in 
Chapter  6 , “Other Operating Systems and Technologies.”) 
 Punchdown Tool 
Punchdown tools are used to attach twisted-pair network cable to connectors within a 
patch panel. Specifi cally, they connect twisted-pair wires to the insulation displacement 
connector (IDC). 

2.9 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Networking Tools 
181  
Wi-Fi Analyzer
A Wi-Fi analyzer is a tool that gathers information of all sorts about the RF medium in the 
area. These may be handheld hardware devices or software that is installed on a laptop that 
uses the wireless card in the laptop to gather information. These analyzers vary widely in 
what type of information they are capable of generating and the price point.
The following are among the functions that these analyzers offer:
■
■
Noise and inference detection and location
■
■
Channel information
■
■
Signal strength
■
■
List of APs in the area
Exam Essentials
Know the tools for working with networks.    A good administrator’s toolbox will include 
wire crimpers, a multimeter, a toner probe, cable tester, loopback plugs, and a punchdown 
tool.
Know the two parts of a toner probe.    A toner probe has two parts: the tone generator (the 
toner) and the tone locator (the probe).

This chapter will focus on the exam topics related to mobile 
devices. I will follow the structure of the CompTIA A+ 220-
901 exam blueprint, objective 3, and cover the five subobjec-
tives that you will need to master before taking the exam.
3.1 Install and Configure Laptop 
Hardware and Components
Whether you choose to call them laptops, notebooks, tablets, or something different is 
mostly a matter of semantics. In this section, I’ll discuss some of the basic components of 
laptops and their installation (when possible and called for). In many cases, the components 
are the same as in a desktop computer, and I discussed them already. I’ll focus now on 
those that are different. The following are the topics addressed in exam objective 3.1:
■
■
Expansion options
■
■
Hardware/device replacement
Expansion Options
A portable computer must provide all the functionality of a desktop counterpart yet be able 
to withstand travel, run in the absence of AC power, and be much smaller and more com-
pact. When you get right down to it, there is not a great deal of difference between laptop 
and desktop computers, with the exception that laptops are more difficult to disassemble, 
and form factors on items such as motherboards, memory, and hard drives become impor-
tant. In this section, I will discuss (and in some cases simply review) the options available 
to expand the functionality of a laptop, and I’ll cover the type of memory packages used in 
laptops.
ExpressCard/34
The ExpressCard standard is an alternative to the use of PC Cards. ExpressCards are 
inserted into a slot that will accept either of two form factors. Neither card type is installed 
or configured as such; they are simply plugged into the slot if present on the laptop.
The ExpressCard/34 is 34 mm wide with a connector that runs the full width of the 
card. The cards are 75 mm long (10.6 mm shorter than CardBus) and 5 mm thick. In some 

188 
Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
cases, the functionality provided by the card requires the thickness of the card to be more 
than 5 mm, such as when it must provide a port or an antenna. ExpressCard slots may 
be either 34 mm or 54 mm wide. The 54 mm slot (covered in the next section) will accept 
either card, whereas the 34 mm slot will accept only a 34 mm card. Having said that, the 
connector on both card types is 34 mm. The maximum transmission speeds are as follows:
■
■
280 Mbps effective (USB 2 mode)
■
■
1.6 Gbps effective (PCIe 1 mode)
■
■
3.2 Gbps effective (PCIe 2 or USB 3 mode)
ExpressCard/54
By using a guide at the rear of the slot, the 54 mm slot will accept both card form factors. 
Adaptors are made for connecting an ExpressCard/34 card to a CardBus (but not 16-bit PC 
Card) slot.
Both the 34 mm and 54 mm versions of these cards are used in the same way PC Cards 
are—that is, to provide functionality that does not presently exist on the laptop. They 
could be used to add an 802.11 wireless connection or access to a mobile phone network, 
for example. Figure 3.1 shows both types of ExpressCards and a PC Card for comparison.

SoDIMM
For space reasons, memory modules that are used in desktops cannot be used in lap-
tops. Laptop memory comes in smaller form factors known as small outline DIMMs 
(SoDIMMs). Figure 3.2 shows the form factor for 144-pin and 72-pin SoDIMMS com-
pared to memory modules used in desktops. Notice that they basically look the same but 
the memory module sizes are different. The most common sizes are 512 MB and 1 GB. 
They are also available in 4 GB and 8 GB sizes. The speeds of these modules range from 
677 MHz to 1,333 MHz. They can have 72, 144, or 200 pins.
F i g u r e   3 . 2     SoDIMMS, SIMMs, and DIMMs
30-pin SIMM (3.5n.75")
72-pin SIMM (4.25n1")
168-pin DIMM (5.375n1")
144-pin SoDIMM (2.625n1")
72-pin SoDIMM (2.375n1")
Another option is the MicroDIMM, which has either 172 pins (DDR) or 214 pins 
(DDR2). These modules are slightly shorter than the SoDIMM and slightly wider. They do 
not use the same slots. Keep in mind that many manufacturers have proprietary memory, 
which means it does not conform to a standard and that you will have to buy the memory 
from them. Consult the documentation in all cases.
To install laptop memory, follow these steps:
1.	
Turn off the computer.
2.	
Disconnect the computer and any peripherals from their power sources, and remove 
any installed batteries.
3.	
Remove the screws holding the memory door in place.
4.	
Use your fingers to gently separate the plastic tabs holding the memory module in 
place. The module should pop up so you can grab it.
5.	
Align the notch in the new memory module to the one in the connector.

190 
Chapter 3 ■ Mobile Devices 
 6. 
 Insert the new memory module into the socket at a 45-degree angle. Once full contact 
is made, press the module down. It should click into place. 
 7. 
 Replace the memory door and fasten the screws. 
 Some laptops have the memory under the keyboard, so you might need to 
remove the keyboard to get to it. 
 Once the memory is installed, there really is no confi guration, but you should check 
System Tools ➢ System Information to ensure that the memory has been recognized by the 
system at reboot. 
 Flash 
 Flash memory is a type of solid-state storage (covered in Chapter  1 , “Hardware”) that is 
beginning to be considered not only as an option for additional storage in a laptop but as 
a replacement for the hard drive. The advantages are reduced heat, lower power consump-
tion, less noise, and better reliability since you have no moving parts. The disadvantages 
are higher cost and less capacity. The Lenovo IdeaPad (called the Yoga) released in 2012 
will cost about $1,200 with solid-state drives (SSDs) up to 256 GB. A similar model by the 
same manufacturer with a 500 GB hard drive will be only $700. 
 While all flash drives are solid state, not all solid-state drives are flash 
drives.

Ports/Adaptors
In many cases, you need to connect a device to a laptop that requires a port type not 
­present on the laptop. In scenarios like these, you need adaptors like the ones I discussed in 
Chapter 1 in the section “Compare and Contrast Various PC Connection Interfaces, Their 
Characteristics and Purpose.” In this section, I’ll briefly review these adaptors. I’ll also 
­discuss the use of other components discussed in Chapter 1’s “Thunderbolt” section. Here 
I’ll cover how they are used in laptops.
Thunderbolt      As I said in Chapter 1, Thunderbolt ports are most likely to be found 
on Apple laptops, but they are now showing up on others as well. Figure 3.3 shows a 
Thunderbolt port on an HP laptop. Notice the “thunderbolt” icon next to the port. For 
more information on Thunderbolt, see the section “Thunderbolt Cards” in Chapter 1.
F i g u r e   3 . 3     Thunderbolt port
DisplayPort      As you learned in Chapter 1, DisplayPort is a digital interface primarily 
used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor or television 
set. It resembles a USB connector and is displayed next to one in Figure 3.3. It is between a 
Thunderbolt port on the left and a USB port on the right. It has an icon that looks like a D 
with one arrow pointing up and another pointing down to its left. For more information on 
DisplayPort, see the section “DisplayPort” in Chapter 1. The latest version of DisplayPort 
is 1.3, approved on September 15, 2014. This standard increases overall transmission 
bandwidth to 32.4 Gbps with the new HBR3 mode featuring 8.1 Gbps per lane (up from 
5.4 Gbps with HBR2 in version 1.2), totaling 25.92 Gbps with overhead removed.
USB to RJ-45 Dongle      This adaptor allows you to use a USB port on a laptop to connect 
an Ethernet cable to the device. It can be useful when the device has a bad Ethernet port or 
if it lacks one. One of these is shown in Figure 3.4.

F i g u r e   3 .6     USB to Bluetooth dongle
USB to Wi-Fi Dongle      This adaptor allows you to use the USB port to connect an 802.11 
wireless adaptor to the laptop. In the early days of 802.11 this was usually done with a 
PCMCIA card (the slots for which are no longer found on new laptops), but now it is much 
simpler with USB to Wi-Fi adaptors. One of these is shown in Figure 3.5.
USB to Bluetooth Dongle      When you need to allow Bluetooth access to a laptop that 
lacks this, you can use a USB to Bluetooth dongle. One of these is shown in Figure 3.6.

USB Optical Drive  While many laptops come with an optical drive, some do not. In cases 
where there is no internal optical drive, you can use the USB port to connect an external 
optical drive, one of which is shown in Figure  3.7 .

 Hardware/Device Replacement 
 Replacing hardware and devices in a laptop can be a challenge because of the size limita-
tions. The best way to determine the proper disassembly method is to consult the documen-
tation from the manufacturer. 
 Some models of notebook PCs require a special T-8 Torx screwdriver. Most PC toolkits 
come with a T-8 bit for a screwdriver with interchangeable bits, but you may fi nd that the 
T-8 screws are countersunk in deep holes so that you can’t fi t the screwdriver into them. In 
such cases, you need to buy a separate T-8 screwdriver, available at most hardware stores or 
auto parts stores. 
 Many laptop manufacturers will consider a warranty void if an unauthor-
ized person opens a laptop case and attempts to repair a laptop. 
 Prepare a clean, well-lit, fl at work surface; assemble your tools and manuals; and ensure 
that you have the correct parts. Shut down the PC, unplug it, and detach any external 
devices such as an external keyboard, mouse, or monitor. In this section, with these general 
guidelines for opening the laptop in mind, you’ll look at replacing various components of a 
laptop. Always ensure that you have grounded yourself before working with computer com-
ponents of any kind. Use an antistatic wristband and attach it to the case.

Chapter 3 ■ Mobile Devices 
 Keyboard 
 When replacing the keyboard, one of the main things you want to keep in mind is to  not 
damage the data cable connector to the system board. With the laptop fully powered off 
and unplugged from the wall, remove the battery. 
 Examine the screws on the back of the laptop. Ideally, icons indicating which screws are 
attached to the keyboard will be available. If not, look up the model online and determine 
which of the screws are attached to the keyboard. 
 Remove the screws with a T-8 or Phillips-head screwdriver. With the laptop turned back 
over, open it. If the keyboard is tucked under any plastic pieces, determine whether those 
pieces need to have screws removed to get them out of the way; if so, remove the screws and 
the plastic pieces. In some cases, there may just be clamps that are easily removed. 
 With any plastic covers out of the way, remove any screws at the top and remove the 
keyboard itself from top to bottom. There should be a thin, but wide, data cable to the sys-
tem board at the bottom. 
This is the piece to be careful with! 
 Take a pick and lift the plastic connectors that hold this data cable in place. Remove the 
data cable. Take the new keyboard and slip the data cable back in between the plastic con-
nectors on the system board. Ensure it’s all the way in. 
 Put the plastic connector back into place and make sure it’s holding the data cable in. 
Position the keyboard into place and refasten the keyboard in place at the top, replacing any 
screws that were there before. 
 Replace any plastic pieces that were covering the keyboard, turn the laptop over, and replace 
all of the keyboard screws. When you replace the battery and turn it on, check the functional-
ity. If the keyboard doesn’t work, the main component to check is the data connector.  
 Hard Drive 
 To change the hard drive, turn the laptop upside down and look for a removable panel or a 
hard drive release mechanism. Laptop drives are usually accessible from the bottom or side 
of the chassis. Release the drive by fl icking a lock/unlock button and/or removing a screw 
that holds the drive in place. 
 You may be required to remove the drive from a caddy or detach mounting rails from its 
sides. Attach the rails or caddy to the new drive using the same screws and washers. If required, 
remove the connector attached to the old drive’s signal pins and attach it to the new drive. Make 
sure it’s right side up and do not force it. Damaging the signal pins may render the drive useless. 
 Reverse your steps to place the drive (and caddy if present) into the case. Replace the 
screws and start the laptop. The system should recognize the drive. If you or the customer 
created a bootable backup disc or a complete image disc (before the drive failed, by the 
way), place it in the optical drive and follow the instructions for restoring the data. You 
may have to update a driver or two, but you should otherwise be ready to go.

2.5 Inch vs. 3.5 Inch
The 2.5-inch hard drives are smaller (which makes them attractive for a laptop where space 
is at a minimum), but in comparison to 3.5-inch hard drives, they have less capacity and 
cache, and they operate at a lower speed. Whereas 3.5-inch drives often can store up to 
3 TB of data and have as much as 64 MB of cache, 2.5-inch drives usually store only 1 TB 
of data and use up to 16 MB of cache.
Moreover, whereas 2.5-inch drives operate from 5,400 to 7,200 RPM, 3.5-inch drives 
can operate from 7,200 to 10,000 RPM. However, 2.5-inch drives use about half the power 
(again, good for a laptop) of a 3.5-inch drive (2.5 W rather than 5 W).
The 1.8-inch drive is the smallest of the three I’m discussing here and is rarely seen anymore. It 
was originally used in subnotebooks and audio players. It has the least capacity of the three, with 
the largest up to 320 GB. It has only two platters, each of which can hold 220 GB maximum.
SSD vs. Hybrid vs. Magnetic Disk
Although many devices still use a magnetic disk hard drive as discussed in the previous 
section, most laptop vendors are moving to using either solid-state drives or hybrid drives, 
which are a combination of magnetic disk and solid-state technology.
The advantage of solid-state drives is that they are not as susceptible to damage if the 
device is dropped, and they are, generally speaking, faster because no moving parts are 
involved. They are, however, more expensive, and when they fail, they don’t typically give 
some advanced symptoms like a magnetic drive will do.
Hybrid storage products have a magnetic disk and some solid-state memory. These 
drives monitor the data being read from the hard drive, and they cache the most frequently 
accessed bits to the high-speed NAND flash memory. These drives tend to cost slightly 
more than traditional hard drives (but far less than solid-state drives), but the addition of 
the SSD memory for cached bits creates a surprising improvement in performance. This 
improvement will not appear initially because the drive must “learn” the most frequently 
accessed data on the drive.
Memory
There should be a panel used for access to the memory modules. If the panels are not marked 
(many are not), refer to your laptop instruction manuals to locate the panel on the bottom.
Remove any screws holding the panel in place, remove the panel from the laptop, and set 
it aside. If removing an existing memory module, remove it by undoing the module clamps, 
gently lifting the edge of the module to a 45-degree angle, and then pulling the module out 
of the slot.
Align the notch of the new module with that of the memory slot and gently insert the 
module into the slot at a 45-degree angle. With all pins in the slot, gently rotate the module 
down flat until the clamps lock the module into place.
Replace the memory access panel, replace any screws, and power up the system. When 
the computer is powered back up, it may be necessary to go into the computer BIOS to let 
the system properly detect the new RAM that has been installed in the computer. Please 
refer to the user manual for the computer system for any additional information.

Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
Smart Card Reader
Smart card readers come in both internal and external versions. External versions will 
most likely plug into a USB port and replacing them is easy; all you do is plug them in. It is 
possible that you may need to install a driver for the device, and if so, you should use the 
installation utility that came with the device if there is one. There are also external readers 
that use the ExpressCard slot.
Internal readers will reside in a drive bay like a hard drive or optical drive would. You 
will remove the hard drive, optical drive, and keyboard screws first, and then you’ll remove 
the screws that hold the bottom case on the laptop. There will also be some screws marked 
P or P1 inside the case that you will remove. Once they are removed, turn the laptop over 
and remove the keyboard screws, keyboard, and the palm rest cables. Don’t forget to 
unplug both the keyboard and the palm rest cables! Underneath you will now be able to 
access the smart card reader. Unplug the reader, remove the screw holding it in, and remove 
it. Place the new reader in the same place and reverse these steps.
Optical Drive
Replacing an optical drive is usually easier than replacing a hard drive or memory. Remove 
the screw that secures the optical drive to the bottom of the notebook. Grasp the edge of 
the optical drive bezel and slide the optical drive out of the base enclosure. Insert the new 
optical drive into the base enclosure until the connector is seated and replace the screw that 
secures the optical drive to the bottom of the notebook.
Wireless Card
Both 802.11 and Bluetooth wireless cards that are built in can be replaced if they go bad. 
Sometimes they reside near the memory, so open the same panel that holds the memory. In other 
cases (such as a Dell Inspiron), you have to remove the memory, keyboard, optical drive, and 
hand rest to get to it. The Bluetooth card may be located in the same place, or it may be located 
at the edge of the laptop with its own small panel to remove. Consult your documentation.
Once you’ve found either type of wireless card, disconnect the two antenna contacts from 
the card. Do not pull by the wire; pull by the connector itself. Remove any screws from the 
wireless card and gently pull out the card from the slot. Insert the replacement card into 
the slot at a 45-degree angle, replace the screws, and reconnect the antenna to the adaptor. 
Replace the parts you were required to remove to get to the card, reversing your steps carefully.
Mini-PCIe
Since many of the wireless cards are mini-PCIe, replacing any other card in this format will 
follow the same procedure, with the exception of removing and reconnecting the antenna 
cables. You can find the location of the card in the documentation. Make sure that the new 
card is firmly inserted into the slot after removing the old card.
Screen
The screen is one of the more involved parts to replace, which is why many people throw a 
laptop away when the screen gets damaged. It’s possible to replace a damaged screen, but 

3.1 Install and Configure Laptop Hardware and Components 
197  
you have to remove a lot of parts to do so. Start by removing the battery and then hold the 
power on for 10 seconds to drain the power out of the capacitors.
Remove all the screws on the back of the unit and then turn the laptop over. Remove the 
speaker bezel and you will see six wires coming from the old screen to the laptop. Remove 
the keyboard (see the instructions in the section “Keyboard”). Under the keyboard, locate 
where these six wires connect, and disconnect them. Make note of what went where so you 
can replace them correctly when you reconnect the new screen.
Remove the screws that are holding the old screen to the hinges of the laptop. Position 
the new screen in place and screw it into the hinges. Reroute the six wires coming from the 
new screen through any holes or spaces that lead them to their connection points. These 
are usually for the video cable, mic jacks, and wireless antenna. Reconnect the keyboard 
and reinstall it. Replace all parts that were required to get at the keyboard and replace all 
screws on the back of the unit.
These are general guidelines for this replacement, and you should always check the doc-
umentation for any departures from this general approach.
DC Jack
Replacing a bad DC jack usually requires soldering. If this is not a skill you possess, just 
replace the motherboard. If you want to attempt it, remove all the parts to get to the moth-
erboard. In some cases, the old DC jack can still be used; it just needs to have the old solder 
removed and replaced. If that is not the case, remove the old DC jack by unsoldering it 
from the connector. Then put the new jack in place and solder it to the connectors. Replace 
all the parts and pieces you removed to get to the board. In general, a bad DC jack usually 
means a new board.
Battery
Replacing the battery in a laptop is simply a matter of removing the battery storage bay, 
removing the old battery from the bay, inserting the new battery into the bay, and replacing 
the bay. Determining the battery type for the replacement will probably take longer than 
the replacement procedure. In fact, many users carry extra batteries for situations where 
they know they will need to use the laptop for longer than the battery life (such as a long 
plane trip) and change the battery as needed.
Touchpad
This is another repair where many parts must be removed just to get to the piece to 
be replaced. Remove all the covers from the back of the system first. This may include 
those for the hard drive, RAM, and wireless card compartments. Remove the RAM, 
hard drive, and wireless card. Take the screw holding the CD-ROM in place and 
remove it as well.
Turn the laptop back over, open the lid, and remove any plastic pieces in the way of the 
keyboard. Remove the keyboard (see the section “Keyboard”). Disconnect the video and 
antenna cables from the motherboard (see the section “Screen”). Remove the Phillips-head 
screws from the LCD hinges and then remove the LCD.

198 
Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
Disconnect the touchpad cable from the motherboard. Separate the upper casing assem-
bly from the bottom casing and set it aside. Remove the touchpad from the upper casing 
assembly. Install the new touchpad by reversing the previous steps.
Plastics/Frames
In the course of explaining some of the replacement procedures in this section, several times 
I have mentioned plastic pieces that either hold something in place or cover something. 
These pieces may be held in place by screws, or they may use snaps. In either case, it is easy 
to damage these parts (especially the snaps) in the disassembly or assembly process. If this 
occurs, consult the documentation for the laptop. Even these pieces will have part numbers 
and can be ordered. It’s easier to just take great care not to damage them in the first place. 
The best way to prevent damage to these pieces from happening is to never force a piece in 
place. If you meet resistance, back out and try to determine what the obstruction is.
Speaker
To replace speakers, first follow the earlier instructions to remove the hard drive, the battery pack, 
and all the screws holding the body together. Lift the screen up and separate it from the body (see 
the section “Screen”). Do not remove the wires connecting the screen to the motherboard.
Separate the two pieces of plastic body frame to view the inside of the laptop. Locate the 
speakers, using the documentation if necessary. Unscrew the speakers and note where they 
connect to the motherboard. Disconnect the old speakers and connect the new ones to the 
same location as where the old speakers were removed. Replace all the parts in the reverse 
order you removed them.
System Board
Replacing the system board requires removing all parts discussed to this point since they all 
are either in the way of or connected to the motherboard. Once that is done, open the pro-
cessor access door if there is one on the machine. If the processor is removable and one did 
not come with the new motherboard, remove it and set it aside in a safe place.
Disconnect any remaining wires that are connected to the motherboard. Unplug any 
cards, such as the video card, that are not built directly into the motherboard. Locate the 
mounting screws for the motherboard and unscrew them. Remove the old motherboard, 
mount the new unit and reassemble the parts in reverse order.
CPU
If the CPU is not built into the motherboard, it can be replaced. If it is built in, then you 
will be replacing the motherboard as well. If you are upgrading the processor and not sim-
ply replacing it, make sure your BIOS will support the new processor. It may be that you 
need to flash the BIOS to support the new CPU. You can determine this at the website of 
either the CPU maker or the laptop. This is important!
Follow the earlier instructions to remove the case, keyboard, and display. This will allow you 
to separate the two parts of the case. Remove the graphic card and note where it plugs back in. 
Remove the heat sink from the top of the CPU by removing the screws holding it in place.

3.2 Explain the Function of Components Within the Display of a Laptop 
199  
Remove the single screw holding the CPU in place and pull it out. Insert the new CPU in 
place and replace the screw. (In some cases, it is not a screw but a locking bar.) Place some 
thermal grease between the CPU and the heat sink. Replace the heat sink and its screws. 
Reverse your steps to reattach all the other parts and pieces.
In some cases, you may encounter a laptop that allows you to get at this from the bot-
tom without removing the keyboard and display. This is why it is best to follow the specific 
directions in the documentation to save unnecessary component removal.

3.2 Explain the Function of Components 
Within the Display of a Laptop
The display of a laptop contains more components than you may expect. In this section, I’ll 
discuss these components and, in some cases, cover competing technologies. The following 
are the topics addressed in exam objective 3.2:
■
■
Types
■
■
Wi-Fi antenna connector/placement
■
■
Webcam
■
■
Microphone
■
■
Inverter
■
■
Digitizer
Types
Laptop displays can use several technologies. These were covered in Chapter 1 (all of them 
can be used in a desktop as well). This section contains a quick review of these display 
types and their characteristics as they apply to laptops.
LCD
Two major types of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are used today: active matrix screens and 
passive matrix screens. Their main differences lie in the quality of the image. Both types 

200 
Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
use some kind of lighting behind the LCD panel to make the screen easier to view. For 
more information on both active and passive LCDs displays, see the section “Compare and 
Contrast Types of Display Devices and Their Features” in Chapter 1.
TTL vs. IPS Displays    In Chapter 1, you learned about two types of LCDs displays, twisted 
nematic (TN) and in-plane switching (IPS). You may also run across the term TTL display. 
TTL refers to transistor-transistor logic and refers to a special type of digital circuit. When 
that term is attached to a display, it means that the display accepts digital input.
Fluorescent vs. LED    LCDs can use two kinds of backlighting: LED-based and fluorescent. 
For more information, see the section “Fluorescent vs. LED Backlighting” in Chapter 1.
LED
Light-emitting diode (LED)-based monitors are still LCDs (they still use liquid crys-
tals to express images onscreen), but they use a different type of backlight than what 
is normally used. Several types of backlights are used with LED, including white LED 
(WLED), RGB LED, and WLED on a flat array. For more information on all three LED 
display types, see the section “Compare and Contrast Types of Display Devices and 
Their Features” in Chapter 1.
OLED
An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is another type of LED technology. It uses an 
emissive electroluminescent layer of organic compounds that emit light in response to an 
electric current. For more information, see the section “Compare and Contrast Types of 
Display Devices and Their Features” in Chapter 1.
An interesting characteristic of these displays is their flexibility and transparency. This 
means they can roll up for storage (like a mat) and you can see through the display to 
objects behind the display. These displays are now available but quite expensive.
Plasma
Plasma displays utilize small cells containing ionized gases, similar to what is used in 
fluorescent lamps. They have the advantage of high-quality picture, wider viewing angles, 
and less motion blur, but they have the disadvantage of screen burn-in and high energy 
requirements.
Because of the high energy requirements, using plasma for laptops is a challenge; how-
ever, laptop makers are working to reduce the power consumption of plasma to bring this 
technology to wider use.
Wi-Fi Antenna Connector/Placement
The wireless antenna is located in the display. You may recall that when replacing a laptop 
screen, you encountered a number of wires coming from the screen to the laptop body. One 
of these is the cable that connects the wireless antenna (located in the display) with the 
wireless card located in the body of the laptop.

3.2 Explain the Function of Components Within the Display of a Laptop 
201  
The antennas that are in the display usually work quite well. In any specific situation 
you may improve your signal by moving the laptop around. This changes the polarization 
of the antenna and may cause it to line up better to the incoming signal.
Webcam
Many displays today, especially laptop displays, have a webcam built in. They come ready 
to go with all drivers preinstalled and nothing to configure or set up. If you need to replace 
the webcam, you will have to disconnect the laptop lid (which holds the display) from the 
base, remove the screw covers and screws holding the display bezel in place, and remove the 
bezel. After removing the screws holding the mounting rails to the hinges, remove the LED 
screen from the lid assembly. Now you can get at the camera, but first carefully remove the 
tape that holds the camera cable in place and remove it and the camera. Attach the replace-
ment cable to the new camera, install the new camera, and reverse these steps.
Microphone
While many desktop systems lack a built-in microphone, almost all laptops have one. In 
some cases this microphone will be located on the laptop bottom, but in many cases it will 
be in the display next to the webcam or off to the side. If you need to replace it, you will 
need to take the same steps to get inside the display that you took for the webcam.
When you unhook the lid from the bottom, you will need to unplug several things from 
the board, and one of those will be the microphone cable. If the microphone is not work-
ing (which it probably isn’t or you wouldn’t be replacing it), take a moment to inspect the 
cable. Sometimes the cable can be cut by the constant opening and closing of the case (it 
shouldn’t, but sometimes it does happen). You may be able to repair the cable without 
replacing the microphone.
If that is not the case, remove the microphone and cable and replace both with the new 
mic and cable. Reverse the steps to get into the display, reconnect the cables to the board, 
and put the back on the bottom.
Inverter
An inverter is a component that takes DC power and converts it to a form that can be used 
by the LCD screen. It is implemented as a circuit board that is located behind the LCD. If 
problems with flickering display or dimness occur, the inverter is a prime suspect.
If the inverter needs to be replaced, you should be aware that it may contain stored 
energy, so it may need to be discharged to be safe.
Digitizer
Digitizers read pressure applied to the surface of the display and are what make touch-
screens work. In some cases, they work with a stylus or small pen-like device, or you 

202 
Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
simply touch the screen with your finger. The digitizer is a thin piece of clear material 
that fits on top of the display. It has its own cable just as the display itself does. If it gets 
cracked, which often happens, it can be replaced without replacing the display itself. 
Typically when you perform this replacement, you will have to open the display lid, as I 
covered earlier, and separate the digitizer from the display. It is usually glued to the dis-
play, and you can use a hair dryer to heat the glue to make removing it easier. When you 
need to put the new digitizer in, you may need to reheat the glue on the display to stick 
them back together.
Exam Essentials
Differentiate the types of displays available in laptops.    Two major types of LCDs are 
used today: active matrix screens and passive matrix screens. LED-based monitors are still 
LCDs, but they use a different type of backlight than what is normally used. An OLED is 
another type of LED technology. It uses an emissive electroluminescent layer of organic 
compounds that emit light in response to an electric current. Because of the high energy 
requirements, using plasma for laptops is a challenge.
Describe the location and operational characteristics of the wireless antenna in a 
laptop.    The wireless antenna is located in the display. Moving the laptop changes the 
polarity of the antenna and may result in a better signal.
Identify the location and function of the inverter.    An inverter is a component that takes 
DC power and converts it to a form that can be used by the LCD screen. It is implemented 
as a circuit board behind the LCD.
3.3 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate 
Laptop Features
Because of the nature of their physical implementation, laptops have some features 
not found in desktops and some issues that need to be handled differently than with 
desktops. In this section, I will discuss some of these features and issues along with 
the use of some special function keys. The following topics are addressed in exam 
objective 3.3:
■
■
Special function keys
■
■
Docking station
■
■
Physical laptop lock and cable lock
■
■
Rotating/removable screens

3.3 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Laptop Features 
203  
Special Function Keys
Special function keys exist in both desktops and laptops, but in laptops function keys 
exist that may not be present in desktops. In the lower-left corner of the keyboard is a 
key with blue text on it that says Fn. When this key is held, other keys with a similar blue 
marking (such as F1, F2, and so on) will perform a different function than their normal 
function. This section describes some of the most common uses of these keys, although 
manufacturers sometimes implement these keys differently, so you should consult the 
documentation.
Dual Displays
When additional displays are connected to the laptop (for example, a projector or second 
monitor), holding down the Fn key and pressing the appropriate function key (located 
on the top row of the keyboard) will move the active screen from display to display (or 
display to a projector) and then to a setting where all monitors have the same output. 
Normally, the F key that you press has an image of a monitor on it. This is valuable 
when making a presentation or when you would like to direct the image to the projector 
or the laptop screen. It is also worth noting that some laptop keyboards have the F1 key 
on the top line marked with an icon of a laptop display and another screen. If this is the 
case, this key is used to toggle between dual-monitor settings rather than the Fn and 
F8 keys.
Wireless (On/Off)
There is also a function key that will turn the wireless off and on. Consult the documen-
tation to determine which key does this. Many laptops now have an antenna icon just 
above the blue text on F2 (or maybe another key in the top line). In that case, you do not 
have to hold the Fn key to use it. If wireless does not work (especially if the system is tell-
ing you to turn the wireless on), check this setting. It is easy to hit this key and disable 
the wireless!
Cellular (On/Off)
Just as you can turn off the wireless (802.11) connection, you can also turn off the cellular 
(WWAN) connection (if one exists on the device). Because integrated cellular connections 
are still fairly new, you will probably need to refer to the device’s documentation to identify 
the exact key.
Volume Settings
On the top row where the keys labeled F1–F12 are located, there are usually a couple of 
keys (usually F8 and F9) that have icons on them that look like speakers. These keys can be 
used to raise and lower the volume of the sound. If the icon is blue, you have to hold down 
the Fn key. Otherwise, you do not need to use the Fn key to activate them. (As a matter of 
fact, if you hold down the Fn key and use the F8 key, you may be changing the location of 

204 
Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
the display output, as described in the section “Dual Displays.”) If these keys are not pres-
ent, consult the documentation for the key to use in conjunction with Fn to lower and raise 
the volume. Most laptops also include a mute button marked as such.
Screen Brightness
On the top row where the keys labeled F1–F12 are located, there are usually a couple of 
keys (usually F4 and F5) that have icons on them that look like suns with arrows pointing 
up and down, respectively. They could also be located on the lower right on the keyboard. 
These keys can be used to increase and decrease the brightness of the display. As with the 
volume settings described in the previous section, you do not need to use the Fn key to 
activate them. If these keys are not present, consult the documentation for the key to use in 
conjunction with Fn to increase and decrease the brightness.
Bluetooth (On/Off)
In most cases, the same key that turns 802.11 wireless off and on also does the same for 
Bluetooth. See the section “Wireless (On/Off).”
Keyboard Backlight
Some keyboards come with backlighting. These models will usually allow you to turn the 
backlighting on and off by using the Fn key in combination with another key, such as the Z 
key on some models. Consult the documentation to determine which key combination will 
perform this function.
Touchpad (On/Off)
While touchpads provide you with a way to operate without a mouse, there are cases when 
you don’t want to use the touchpad and it gets in your way when typing. In other cases, the 
touchpad does not work simply because it has been turned off. So, how do you enable and 
disable the touchpad? It can be done using either software or hardware.
In some cases, you may find there is a touchpad icon in the notification area. If there is, 
you can right-click or double-click it, and in the settings you should find an enable and dis-
able feature. If there is no icon, it may be possible to go to the mouse settings in Control 
Panel and find touchpad settings. Finally, you can always open Device Manager and enable 
and disable the touchpad from here.
There also is usually a way to physically enable and disable the touchpad. This var-
ies from laptop to laptop. For example, on a Lenovo, you hit a location in the upper-right 
corner of the touchpad and it acts as a toggle switch between on and off. Consult the docu-
mentation that came with the laptop, or look on the vendor’s website.
Screen Orientation
The screen orientation refers to the position of the image on the screen. This is changed by 
“rotating” the screen. For example, if you rotated the screen 180 degrees, the image would 

3.3 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Laptop Features 
205  
be upside down. Rotating the screen can be done either by using the display settings or in 
some cases by using a special key combination. In most cases, if you right-click the desktop, 
you will find the option to rotate in various ways in the menu. It may also be under the 
Graphics Options menu, as shown in Figure 3.8.
F i g u r e   3 . 8    Screen orientation
It could be that a special key combination can be used as well. On many models, you can 
use the Shift+Alt+arrow keys to cycle through the four positions (right side up, on one side, 
upside down, and on the other side).
Media Options (Fast-Forward/Rewind)
Many laptops also offer keys that are used with your media players. For example, you 
can fast-forward (or go to the next track), rewind (go to the last track), and stop the 
player. These keys may have a special location, or they may be included as function 
keys at the top of the keyboard (the ones that say F1, F2, and so on). If they are in the 
function keys, you will need to hit the Fn key at the bottom of the keyboard and hold 
it down as you use the function keys. In Figure 3.9, they are located at the top of the 
keyboard.

GPS (On/Off)
Many devices now come with a built-in GPS feature. You can enable and disable the GPS 
using the privacy settings in Windows. While you will probably find it is enabled by default, 
you can disable it in Windows 8.1 by bringing up the Charms bar. At the bottom, choose 
the Settings charm. Tap or click the Change PC Settings link and then select Privacy on the 
left. Choose Location. On this page you can select to either turn it off completely or turn it 
off for certain applications, as shown Figure 3.10.

3.3 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Laptop Features 
207  
Airplane Mode
Airplane mode is a mode that suspends many of the device’s signal-transmitting functions. 
It’s called airplane mode because it disables the transmission of signals that interfere with 
aircraft signaling (or so they say). Enabling and disabling this mode can be done either in 
Windows or in some cases by using a special key on the keyboard.
To enable and disable it in Windows 8.1, navigate to the PC settings, as discussed in the 
“GPS (On/Off)” section. In the PC settings, select Network. Then select Airplane Mode. 
On the right you will see a button to toggle between on and off, as shown in Figure 3.11. 
There will be separate controls for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
F i g u r e   3 .11     Airplane mode
On many laptops this can also be done using one of the function keys. If this feature 
is present on the laptop, the key will have an airplane icon on it. Use it as you would any 
function key to toggle between off and on.
Docking Station
Some notebook PCs have optional accessories called docking stations or port replicators. 
They let you quickly connect/disconnect with external peripherals and may also provide 
extra ports that the notebook PC doesn’t normally have.
A docking station essentially allows a laptop computer to be converted to a desktop 
computer. When plugged into a docking station, the laptop has access to things it doesn’t 
have stand-alone—the network, a workgroup printer, and so on. The cheapest form of 
docking station (if it can be called that) is a port replicator. Typically, you slide a laptop 
into the port replicator, and the laptop can then use a full-sized monitor, keyboard (versus 
the standard 84 keys on a laptop), mouse, and so on. Extended, or enhanced, replicators 

208 
Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
add other ports not found on the laptop, such as PC slots, sound, and more. The most com-
mon division between port replicators and docking stations is that port replicators dupli-
cate the ports the laptop already has to outside devices, and the docking station expands 
the laptop to include other ports and devices that the laptop does not natively have.
Laptops can support Plug and Play at three levels, depending on how dynamically 
they’re able to adapt to changes.
Cold Docking    The laptop must be turned off and back on for the change to be recognized.
Warm Docking    The laptop must be put in and out of suspended mode for the change to 
be recognized.
Hot Docking    The change can be made and is recognized while running normal operations.
Each docking station works a little differently, but there is usually a button you can 
press to undock the notebook from the unit. There may also be a manual release lever in 
case you need to undock when the button is unresponsive. Moreover, the docking station 
must be purchased from the same vendor you purchased the laptop from because docking 
stations are vendor and model specific.
Physical Laptop Lock and Cable Lock
Laptops can be easily stolen. Therefore, they come with a lock slot to which a cable lock 
can be attached. Figure 3.12 shows the lock slot, and Figure 3.13 shows the connected lock 
(sometimes called a Kensington lock).
F i g u r e   3 .12     Lock slot
Rotating/Removable Screen
Many mobile devices today have a removable screen. While it appears that the screen is 
removable, you are actually unhooking the keyboard because the computer is contained in 
the display. With the keyboard detached, you can use the device as a tablet, and with the 
keyboard attached, you can interact with the device as you would a laptop.

3.4 Explain the Characteristics of Various Types of Other Mobile Devices 
209  
F i g u r e   3 .13     Connected lock
Many of these same devices will also allow for the rotation of the screen when it is 
attached to the keyboard. This might be a rotation within the frame of the screen, or it 
could be a rotation in a circle.
Exam Essentials
Describe the purpose of special function keys.    In the lower-left corner of the keyboard is 
a key with blue text on it that says Fn. When this key is held, other keys with a similar blue 
marking (such as F1–F12) will perform a different function than their normal function.
Differentiate between docking stations and port replicators.    A docking station essentially 
allows a laptop computer to be converted to a desktop computer. Extended, or enhanced, 
replicators add other ports not found on the laptop, such as PC slots, sound, and more. The 
most common division between port replicators and docking stations is whether the periph-
eral provides network access and expands the laptop’s capabilities.
Describe approaches to the physical security of a laptop.    Laptops come with a lock slot to which 
a cable lock can be attached. Also, there is a lock on some models for the lid of the laptop.
3.4 Explain the Characteristics of 
Various Types of Other Mobile Devices
At one time, the term mobile devices referred only to notebook laptops, tablets, and PDAs. 
Today this category includes all sort of devices that at one time were only ideas. In this sec-
tion, you’ll look at digital devices that have had their capabilities greatly expanded, such as 

210 
Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
smart cameras that have become essentially computers with a lens, and smart watches and 
fitness monitors that almost become part of their owner. The following are the topics cov-
ered in exam objective 3.4:
■

Tablets
Tablet devices have been in existence in some form or fashion since the early 1990s. Early 
on they were proprietary devices that didn’t have a lot in common with desktop comput-
ers, but increasingly the two form factors have gravitated toward one another; now, many 
new tablets run the same operating systems that are run on desktop systems. Having 
said that, most tablet computers run one of three operating systems: Android, iOS, or 
Windows 8.1.
The tablet market was changed significantly with the release of the iPad by Apple. It was 
the most successful tablet ever at its time of release, and the devices set the standard for 
others to meet. Today, typical features of tablets include the following:
■
■
Cameras (in some cases dual)
■
■
GPS
■
■
Handwriting recognition
■
■
Solid-state hard drives
■
■
3G and 4G mobile support
Tablet devices today use touchscreen displays rather than keyboards, although 
keyboards can be attached. Some such as the Microsoft Surface can be attached and 
detached at will from a keyboard that also acts as a stand and a cover for the device. 
In most cases, they require applications written for the platform, although the Surface 
can run the Windows 8.1 operating system and thus can also run regular desktop 
applications.
Smartphones
As phones have become smarter and smarter, they more and more resemble computers 
rather than phones. Today’s smartphones are really computers that can make calls. They 
have touchscreen interfaces, an onscreen keyboard that can be brought up to input data, 
and sometimes even motion sensors and mobile payment mechanisms.

3.4 Explain the Characteristics of Various Types of Other Mobile Devices 
211  
Moreover, the drive by organizations and individuals to create applications for 
these devices has exploded. Every week it seems someone has designed and created an 
application that turns the phone into some new gadget! Because of this phenomenon, 
the smartphone has become almost part of the body to several younger generations of 
users.
Most of these devices run either the iOS or Android operating system, although 
Microsoft continues to release Windows phones that run a special Windows OS for the 
device. The latest is Windows 8.1, and there will be a Windows 10 version as well.
Wearable Technology Devices
Since the days of Dick Tracy’s futuristic phone watch, we have waited for wearable technol-
ogy to arrive, and it has. In this section, I’ll survey some of the latest examples of digital 
devices created to be worn.
Smart Watches
Smart watches that are computers on your wrist have arrived! Although the jury is still 
out on the long-term viability of the smart watch, when Apple introduced one in 2015, 
most in the industry began to take the devices seriously. These devices run either propri-
etary operating systems or Android. The Apple model runs an operating system called 
Watch OS.
These devices are typically paired to a smartphone for the purpose of accessing calls and 
messages, and they contain GPS features as well. The following are some of the features 
you may find in these smart watches:
■
■
Anti-lost alert
■
■
Time display
■
■
Call vibration
■
■
Caller ID
■
■
Answer call
■
■
Micro-USB input port
Fitness Monitors
While many smart watches can also act as fitness monitors, there is a class of devices that 
specializes in tracking your movement. Fitness monitors read your body temperature, heart 
rate, and blood pressure. They do this while also tracking where you are for the purpose of 
determining the distance you ran or walked and the time it took to do so.
Some of the devices, called fitness trackers, are wrist bands that can track the informa-
tion discussed and communicate wirelessly to an application located on a computer. One 
of these is shown in Figure 3.14. Other, more sophisticated units combine a strap that goes 
around the chest with a watch or band that collects the information gathered by the sensors 
in the band.

Glasses and Headsets
By now, everyone has heard about and probably seen Google Glass, the most well-known 
and recognizable computing device worn as glasses. Just in case you haven’t, Figure 3.15 
shows a drawing of the glasses. While the devices caused quite a stir, Google announced 
in early 2015 that sales to individuals would cease for two years while the technology is 
improved.

3.4 Explain the Characteristics of Various Types of Other Mobile Devices 
213  
While worn as glasses, there is a small screen just to the side of one of the eyes that 
houses the computer screen (think Cyborg). The user can view the screen at any time 
by just casting a glance to the screen. Many promising uses have been proposed for the 
devices, with a number in the healthcare field. Although sales of the devices to individuals 
was halted, sales to organizations that have or are working to find ways to use the glasses 
continue.
Another similar device that is not based on glasses but around a headset format is the 
HC1 headset computer by Zebra. It can respond to voice commands and body movements. 
One of these is shown in Figure 3.16.

Phablets
Phablets comprise a new category of mobile device that combine the size of a phone with 
the capability of a tablet. While larger than a smartphone, they are smaller than a tablet. 
Sales of these devices exceeded those of laptops and desktop computers in 2014, signaling a 
shift in how computers are used.
These devices typically use the same or similar operating systems as smartphones but 
provide a larger screen. They may also include a stylus for interacting with the screen, as 
shown in Figure 3.17.

E-readers
While these devices typically have Internet access and can be used for Internet browsing, 
the main job these devices were created for is reading. These devices have proven to be 
more popular with older users because younger users seem to have grown up reading every-
thing on a computer and see no reason for another device. Older users, on the other hand, 
who are still struggling with the move from reading printed material to reading on a device 
like the idea of a device dedicated to enhancing their reading experience.
The Kindle was the first of these devices to garner widespread acceptance. The Nook 
soon followed. Both enjoyed good sales until other rivals began to enter the market. Sales 
of these devices is now in decline because of the aging of the main customer base. The fol-
lowing are some of the features found in these devices:
■
■
Touchscreens
■
■
Buttons for turning pages
■
■
Editing tools
■
■
Wireless networking
■
■
Text-to-speech support
■
■
Digital rights management support
Smart Cameras
Smart cameras are cameras that have not only the ability to capture an image but also the 
ability to extract information from the image and even make decisions based on that infor-
mation. Some typical uses are as follows:
■
■
Unattended surveillance
■
■
Noncontact measurements
■
■
Part sorting and identification

GPS
A global positioning system (GPS) uses satellite information to plot the global location 
of an object and use that information to plot the route to a second location. GPS devices 
are integrated into many of the mobile devices discussed already and are used for many 
things, but when I use the term for a stand-alone device, I am usually referring to a navi-
gation aid.
These aids have grown in sophistication over time and now not only can plot your route 
but also help you locate restaurants, lodging, and other services along the way. Another use 
for these devices includes tracking delivery vehicles and rental cars.

3.5 Compare and Contrast Accessories 
and Ports of Other Mobile Devices
Mobile devices in many cases have the same connection types and ports as laptop and desk-
top computers, but the accessories can vary somewhat. In this section, you’ll look at the 
types of ports and accessories you will find on mobile devices. Specifically, I will cover the 
following topics:
■
■
Connection types
■
■
Accessories

216 
Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
Connection Types
While mobile devices do use some of the same ports and connection methods, they also use 
a few that you will not encounter on most laptop and desktop devices. This section covers 
connection types.
NFC
Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range technology that allows mobile devices to 
establish radio communication by touching one another or by coming in close proximity to 
one another. The technology was first used in Radio Frequency ID (RFID) tagging and was 
implemented on mobile devices first as a way to share short-range information and later as 
a method to make payments at a point of sale. It operates by reading tags, which are small 
microchips with antennae that can in some cases only be read and other cases can be read 
and written to. For more information on NFC, see the section “NFC” in Chapter 1.
A mobile device must have the support for NFC built in, and many already do. Special 
applications are available that make it easy to use the technology in various ways.
■
■
Making point-of-sale payments
■
■
Reading information stored in tags in posters and advertisements
■
■
Communication between toys used in gaming
■
■
Communication with peripherals
Proprietary, Vendor-Specific Ports (Communication/Power)
Many mobile devices have proprietary ports that they use either for power or for commu-
nication. While this was widespread at one point, vendors have gradually moved toward 
using standard physical implementations of both power and communication ports. While I 
can’t cover all of these, I can present the best examples, which are the ports used by Apple 
in its devices.
Apple uses what it calls the Lightning connector for power. Although it makes an adap-
tor for this connector to convert it to mini-USB (see the next section), it doesn’t encourage 
its use because of the limitations the adaptor places on the functionality of the proprietary 
connector.
The following are other examples of proprietary connectors:
■
■
The Sony-Ericsson power connector looks like USB but is not.
■
■
Nokia and Motorola have used coaxial in some power connectors.
For the most part, you will find that many vendors have chosen to adopt standard con-
nection types for both power and communication.
Micro-USB/Mini-USB
The two most common ports found on mobile devices are micro-USB and mini-USB. Both 
are small form-factor implementations of the USB standard, the latest of which is USB 3.1. 
In Figure 3.18, the mini-USB and micro-USB connectors are  compared to the regular USB 
connector.

Lightning
Earlier I discussed the Lightning connector from Apple. This is an eight-pin connector that 
while not standard has advantages over USB, according to Apple. The following are some 
of these advantages:
■
■
It can supply more power.
■
■
It can be inserted either way.
■
■
It is physically more durable than USB.
■
■
It can detect and adapt to connected devices.

Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
Bluetooth
Mobile devices also support Bluetooth wireless connections. For more information on 
Bluetooth, see the section “Bluetooth” in Chapter 1.
IR
While infrared (IR) connectors were once common on mobile devices, they disappeared 
only to reappear recently. This slow wireless method can convert your mobile device to a 
remote control! For more information on IR, see the section “IR” in Chapter 1.
Hotspot/Tethering
Another way that many mobile devices can connect to other devices is through a hotspot or 
when tethered to another device. Many mobile devices have the ability to act as an 802.11 
hotspot for other wireless devices in the area. There are also devices dedicated solely to per-
forming as a mobile hotspot.
When one mobile device is connected to another mobile device for the purpose of using 
the Internet connection, it is said to be tethered to the device providing the access. While 
use of this connection can be done by using 802.11, it can also be done connecting through 
Bluetooth or a USB cable between the devices. Typically this will incur an additional charge 
from your provider.
Accessories
Mobile devices require a lot of accessories to take advantage of many of the features they 
provide. While many of these are also commonly used with desktop and laptop devices, 
some are much more likely to be used with mobile devices. In this section, you’ll take a 
brief look at the types of accessories you may find attached to a mobile device.
Headsets
Headsets provide the ability to take your conversation offline or to listen to your music in 
private. They can be connected both through a wired connection, usually a 3.55 mm audio 
connector or USB, and by using Bluetooth to pair the device with the headset.
Speakers
Speakers are used in the same fashion as headsets. They can also be connected using 
the same options that include using USB, using a 3.55 mm audio plug, or by pairing the 
speakers with the devices using Bluetooth. This includes the speaker systems in many cars, 
which can now be paired with the devices using Bluetooth as well.
Game Pads
People seem to love to kill time playing games on their smartphones and other mobile 
devices, but they may find their level of enjoyment increased by connecting the devices to 
a game controller offering them many more input options. These controllers look like any 

3.5 Compare and Contrast Accessories and Ports of Other Mobile Devices 
219  
game ­controller, which can differ based on the game being played and the type of input 
required for the game.
These controllers can also be small, some fitting on a keychain. They typically are paired 
to the mobile device using the Bluetooth connection. Some of the newer game controllers 
for this purpose can be set on a table and the mobile device plugs physically into a slot or 
holder on the controller, making a connection with the controller. Figure 3.20 shows the 
layout of a typical game controller.

Chapter 3  ■  Mobile Devices   
Docking Stations
Docking stations include those used to hold the device and connect the device to a com-
puter for synchronization. They also are made to hold the device and connect it to speak-
ers. The stations typically look like the charging stations used to hold the early wireless 
landlines.
Moreover, since a new generation of users has used a smartphone for everything and 
may never have used a device any larger than a laptop, it is inevitable that docking stations 
used to connect PC peripherals to smartphones will be created. These devices will serve the 
same function as docking stations for laptops. At the time of this writing, the solutions cre-
ated so far are proprietary and have not been widely adopted.
Extra Battery Packs/Battery Chargers
Batteries are the lifeline of mobile devices. For a device to stay constantly connected, many 
users purchase extra battery packs that can be used to power the devices when the battery 
is dead and no power outlet is available. Some of these packs simply provide power to the 
device, while others store power used to charge the device’s battery. Figure 3.21 shows an 
example of a battery pack that can be charged while providing power to the device.
F i g u r e   3 . 21     Battery pack
Protective Covers/Waterproofing
While much work has been done to make mobile devices more sturdy and durable, they are 
still somewhat delicate pieces of electronics. For this reason, an entire industry has sprung 
up to provide protective covers for the devices. Some are made of a hard plastic material 
and protect the device from all but the worst impacts, while others go further and provide 
waterproofing as well.

3.5 Compare and Contrast Accessories and Ports of Other Mobile Devices

Credit Card Readers
Mobile devices can also accept connections from external credit card readers. Some of these 
physically connect to the smartphone, and others can communicate with the phone using 
Bluetooth. Many of them use the same jack used for the headphones. There is usually soft-
ware that has to be installed on the device as well and a processing agreement established 
with a provider. Figure 3.22 shows the Square reader.
F i g u r e   3 . 2 2     Square credit card reader
Memory/MicroSD
Secure digital (SD) cards are a type of flash memory. Micro-SD is the smallest of three stan-
dards. Many mobile devices have MicroSD slots or ports on them that allow you to connect 
one to the device. This allows you either to access data on the memory card or to move 
information to the memory card from the smartphone. For more information on MicroSD, 
see the section “Solid-State/Flash Drives” in Chapter 1.
Exam Essentials
Describe the most common connection types found on mobile devices.     These include 
Near Field Communication, proprietary ports, microUSB, miniUSB, Lightning, Bluetooth, 
and infrared.
Identify the most common mobile device accessories.    Mobile devices will accept game-

This chapter will focus on the exam topics related to hardware 
and network troubleshooting. I will follow the structure of the 
CompTIA A+ 220-901 exam blueprint, objective 4, and cover 
the six subobjectives that you will need to master before taking the exam.
4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot 
Common Problems Related to 
Motherboards, RAM, CPU, and Power 
with Appropriate Tools
While problems can occur with the operating system with little or no physical warning, 
that is rarely the case when it comes to hardware problems. Your senses will often alert 
you that something is wrong based on what you hear, smell, or see. This section discusses 
common issues with the main players. The following are the topics addressed in exam 
objective 4.1:

Common Symptoms
Once you have performed troubleshooting for some time, you will notice a pattern. With 
some exceptions, the same issues occur over and over and usually give you the same warn-
ings each time. This section covers common symptoms or warning signs. When you learn 
what these symptoms are trying to tell you, it makes your job easier.
Unexpected Shutdowns
It doesn’t get any more obvious that something is wrong when the computer just shuts 
down on its own. In some cases, a blue screen on the display with a lot of text precedes this 
shutdown. If that occurs, the problem is related to operating system and may not involve a 
hardware issue. Operating system issues related to the Blue Screen of Death are covered in 
the section “Proprietary Screen Crashes” later in this chapter.

228 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
One common reason for shutdowns is overheating. Often when that is the case, however, 
the system reboots itself rather than just shutting down. Reboots are covered later in this 
section.
Always check the obvious, such as the power cable and the source of power. Check to 
see whether a breaker flipped in the power box as well. Checking these items is an example 
of starting the process at the physical layer. If the computer is plugged into a power strip or 
UPS that has a fuse or breaker, check to see whether the fuse blew or the breaker flipped 
because of a power surge.
System Lockups
Sometimes the system just freezes up and will not respond to any keyboard input or mouse 
clicks. The difference between a blue screen and a system lockup is whether the dump 
message that accompanies a blue screen is present. With a regular lockup, things just stop 
working. As with blue screens, lockups have been greatly reduced with more recent versions 
of the Microsoft operating systems (a notable exception may occur with laptops, which go 
to hibernate and then occasionally do not want to exit this mode). If lockups occur, you 
can examine the log files to discover what was happening (such as a driver loading) and 
take steps to correct it.
From a hardware standpoint, freezes or lockups can be caused by the following:
Memory Problems    Memory problems include a bad or failing memory chip, using mem-
ory that’s too slow for the system, or using applications that require more memory than is 
present in the computer. Replace and upgrade the memory as required.
Virus or Malware    If the system freezes and there is still significant hard drive activity 
occurring, a virus could be present. Scan the system, preferably from an external source 
such as a flash drive or CD.
Video Driver    Bad video drivers can sometimes cause a lockup. Update the video driver. In 
the case of a driver you just updated, you can roll back the driver to the old driver until you 
can obtain a new version of the driver that does not cause issues.
POST Code Beeps
During the bootup of the system, a power-on self-test (POST) occurs, and each device is 
checked for functionality. If the system boots to the point where the video driver is loaded 
and the display is operational, any problems will be reported with a numeric error code.
If the system cannot boot to that point, problems will be reported with a beep code. 
Although each manufacturer’s set of beep codes and their interpretation can be found in 
the documentation for the system or on the website of the manufacturer, one short beep 
always means everything is OK. Some examples of items tested during this process include 
the following:
■
■
RAM
■
■
Video card
■
■
Motherboard

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common Problems 
229
 To interpret the beep codes in the case where you cannot read the error 
codes on the screen, use the chart provided at  www.computerhope.com/
beep.htm . 
 During startup, problems with devices that fail to be recognized properly, services that 
fail to start, and so on, are written to the system log and can also be viewed with Event 
Viewer. If no POST error code prevents a successful boot, this utility provides informa-
tion about what’s been going on system-wise to help you troubleshoot problems. Event 
Viewer shows warnings, error messages, and records of things happening successfully. 
You can access it through Computer Management, or you can access it directly from the 
Administrative Tools in Control Panel. 
 Blank Screen on Bootup 
 When the screen is blank after bootup and there are signs that the system has power and 
some functionality (perhaps you can hear the fan or see lights on the system), the problem 
could lie in several areas. Consider these possibilities: 
 
■
 Make sure the monitor is on. It has a power switch, so check it. 
 
■
 If you hear the fan but the system doesn’t boot, it could be the power to the mother-
board. Check and reseat the power cable to the motherboard. 
 
■
 Make sure the cable from the monitor to the system is connected properly and try 
changing it out with a known good cable. 
 
■
 Try a known good video card to rule out a bad card. 
 
■
 Ensure that the brightness setting is set high enough. 
 
■
 In cases where a laptop has been used to direct output to a second display, ensure that 
the image is being sent to the main display and not just to the external monitor. 
 BIOS Time and Settings Resets 
 If you fi nd that you are continually resetting the system time, it could be that the CMOS 
battery is dying. In the absence of an external time source, the time in the BIOS is where 
the system gets its cue for the date and time. Change the CMOS battery and the problem 
should be solved. 
 Attempts to Boot to Incorrect Device 
 When multiple volumes or partitions exist on the computer or there are multiple hard 
drives and maybe CD/DVD and fl oppy drives as well, there are multiple potential sources 
for the boot fi les. If the system delivers an “operating system not found” message, it could 
be that the system is looking in the wrong location for the boot fi les. 
 The boot order is set in the BIOS. Check the boot order and ensure that it is set to boot 
to the partition, volume, and hard drive where the boot fi les are located. If the device still 
has a fl oppy drive, check fi rst whether there is a fl oppy in the fl oppy drive. When the system 

230 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
is running down the list of potential sources of boot files, in all other cases if it looks in a 
location and finds no boot files, it will move on to the next location in the list. However, if 
a floppy is in the floppy drive and it checks the floppy drive and no boot files are present, it 
does not proceed but stops and issues the nonsystem disk message.
Boot problems can also occur with corruption of the boot files or missing components 
(such as the NTLDR file being “accidentally” deleted by an overzealous user). Luckily, dur-
ing the installation of the OS, log files are created in the %SystemRoot% or %SystemRoot%\
Debug folder (C:\WINNT and C:\WINNT\DEBUG or C:\Windows and C:\Windows\Debug, 
depending on the operating system). If you have a puzzling problem, look at these logs to 
see whether you can find error entries there. These are primarily helpful during installa-
tion. For routine troubleshooting, you can activate boot logging by selecting Enable Boot 
Logging from the Windows Advanced Options menu to create an ntbtlog.txt log file in 
the %systemroot% folder.
Continuous Reboots
If the system reboots on its own, consider the following possibilities:
■
■
Electrical problems such as brownouts (not a total loss of power but a sag in the power 
level) or blackouts can cause reboots.
■
■
Power supply problems can cause reboots as well. The power supply continually sends 
a Power_Good signal to the motherboard, and if this signal is interrupted, the system 
will reset.
■
■
Overheating is also a big cause of reboots. When CPUs get overheated, a cycle of 
reboots can ensue. Make sure the fan is working on the heat sink and the system fan is 
also working. If required, vacuum the dust from around the vents.
■
■
As overheating plays a large role in reboots, ensure a laptop is sitting on a flat surface 
that allows for proper cooling (not on a bed, pillow, or other soft surface).
No Power
Power problems usually involve the following issues and scenarios:
■
■
Check the power cord, and if it’s plugged into a power strip or UPS, ensure the strip 
is plugged in (and if it has a breaker, check to see whether it was tripped by a surge or 
whether the switch that turns off the entire strip has been inadvertently turned to the 
off position). In the case of a UPS, check whether the UPS battery is dead.
■
■
Try replacing the power supply with a known good unit to see whether the power sup-
ply failed.
Overheating
Under normal conditions, the PC cools itself by pulling in air. That air is used to dis-
sipate the heat created by the processor (and absorbed by the heat sink). When airflow is 

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common Problems 
231
restricted by clogged ports, a bad fan, and so forth, heat can build up inside the unit and 
cause problems. Chip creep—the unseating of components—is one of the more common 
byproducts of a cycle of overheating and cooling of the inside of the system.
Since the air is being pulled into the machine, excessive heat can originate from outside 
the PC as well because of a hot working environment. The heat can be pulled in and cause 
the same problems. Take care to keep the ambient air within normal ranges (approximately 
60–90 degrees Fahrenheit) and at a constant temperature.
Replacing slot covers is vital. Computers are designed to circulate air with slot covers in 
place or cards plugged into the ports. Leaving slots on the back of the computer open alters 
the air circulation and causes more dust to be pulled into the system.
Loud Noise
When it comes right down to it, there are not a lot of moving parts within a PC. When 
you hear noise, you can begin to readily narrow down the possible culprits. The most 
common are the fan and the hard drive. No matter what is responsible, you will want 
to take immediate steps to shut down the machine and start the replacement process. 
Change each component you suspect with a known good replacement until the noise 
stops.
Intermittent Device Failure
One of the most vexing issues to troubleshoot is one that comes and goes. When presented 
with this type of behavior, consider the following possibilities:
■
■
Try replacing the problem component with a known good one.
■
■
A bad motherboard can cause these types of problems when there are issues with its 
circuitry. Try replacing the motherboard with a known good motherboard.
Fans Spin: No Power to Other Devices
This issue was discussed in the section “Blank Screen on Bootup.”
Indicator Lights
Many of the components in the system have an indicator light that should be in a 
specific state during normal operation. Status lights are often found on the network 
interface card (NIC) as well as on the front of a desktop model and in the display area 
of a laptop.
On the NIC, a display other than a green light can indicate that there are problems with 
the network; more important, though, the lack of any light can indicate that the card itself 
has gone bad.
The hard drive, CD-ROM, and tape or DVD drive lights will be on when activity is 
occurring and will blink accordingly. The power light should be a steady green.

232 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
Smoke
Smoke is never a good thing. Shut the system down immediately to prevent further damage. 
This is usually a burning or overheating component, usually the CPU.
Burning Smell
A burning smell usually accompanies smoke but could be present after the smoke has ended 
because the burning component is now dead. Try to identify the damaged component 
through a visual inspection; if that is not possible, try to determine the damaged compo-
nent by replacing parts one by one until functionality returns.
Proprietary Screen Crashes
Some operating systems have a proprietary method of notifying the user that the worst may 
have just happened. In this section you’ll look at two of the most widely known methods.
BSOD
Once a regular occurrence when working with Windows, blue screens (also known as 
the Blue Screen of Death) have become much less frequent. Occasionally, systems will 
lock up, and you can usually examine the log files to discover what was happening 
when this occurred and then take the necessary steps to correct it. For example, if you 
see that a driver or application was loading before the crash, you can begin to isolate it 
as a possible problem. The details included in the BSOD error that comes up can help 
in troubleshooting the problem. It is often easy to query Microsoft’s Knowledge Base 
with the first part of the BSOD error to discover the component causing the problem. 
Often, the Knowledge Base article gives a detailed explanation of how to fix the prob-
lem as well.
In more recent versions of Windows (Windows 7, 8, and 8.1), information from such 
crashes is written to XML files by the operating system. When the system becomes stable, a 
prompt usually appears asking for approval to send this information to Microsoft. The goal 
that Microsoft has in collecting this data is to be able to identify drivers that cause such 
problems and work with vendors to correct these issues.
Better-known error messages include the following:
Data_Bus_Error    This error is described on the Microsoft website: “The most common 
cause of this error message is a hardware problem. It usually occurs after the installation 
of faulty hardware, or when existing hardware fails. The problem is frequently related to 
defective RAM, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM. If hardware has recently been added to the 
system, remove it and test to see if the error still occurs.”
Unexpected_Kernel_Mode_Trap    This error is described on the Microsoft website: “If 
hardware was recently added to the system, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing 
hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. Run hardware diagnostics 
supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner, to determine which 
hardware component has failed. For details on these procedures, see the owner’s manual 

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common Problems 
233
for your computer. Setting the CPU to run at speeds above the rated specification (known 
as overclocking the CPU) can also cause this error.”
Page_Fault_in_nonpaged_area    This error is described on the Microsoft website: 
“This Stop message usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event 
of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, either main memory, L2 
RAM cache, or video RAM). If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove 
it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty 
component. Run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on 
these procedures, see the owner’s manual for your computer.”
irq1_not_less_or_equal    This error is described on the Microsoft website: “This 
Stop message indicates that a kernel-mode process or driver attempted to access a memory 
address to which it did not have permission to access. The most common cause of this 
error is an incorrect or corrupted pointer that references an incorrect location in memory. 
A pointer is a variable used by a program to refer to a block of memory. If the variable has 
an incorrect value in it, the program tries to access memory that it should not. When this 
occurs in a user-mode application, it generates an access violation. When it occurs in kernel 
mode, it generates a STOP 0x0000000A message. If you encounter this error while upgrad-
ing to a newer version of Windows, it might be caused by a device driver, a system service, 
a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.”
machine_check_exception    This error is described on the Microsoft website: “This 
behavior occurs because your computer processor detected and reported an unrecover-
able hardware error to Windows XP.” To do this, the processor used the Machine Check 
Exception (MCE) feature of Pentium processors or the Machine Check Architecture 
(MCA) feature of some Pentium Pro processors. The following factors may cause this error 
message:
■
■
System bus errors
■
■
Memory errors that may include parity or error correction code (ECC) problems
■
■
Cache errors in the processor or hardware
■
■
Translation lookaside buffers (TLB) errors in the processor
■
■
Other CPU vendor-specific detected hardware problems
■
■
Vendor-specific detected hardware problems
Because Microsoft has ended support for XP, the best approach is to upgrade the operating 
system.
Pinwheel
While Microsoft users have the BSOD to deal with, Apple users have similarly come 
to have the same negative feelings about the Pinwheel of Death (PWOD). This is a 
multicolored pinwheel mouse pointer (shown in Figure 4.1) that signifies a temporary delay 
while the system “thinks.” In the death scenario, waiting until doomsday will yield no relief 
to the user.

F i g u r e   4 .1    Pinwheel
In many cases, the situation may not be as dire as it appears. It can be that a single appli-
cation is holding the device captive. If this is the case, either clicking the desktop or bring-
ing another application to the front will return control to the user. While that will solve the 
issue for the moment, there was some reason why that application caused the lockup, and it 
will probably occur again. Two things can be done to prevent this from occurring again.
First, it could be that the system permissions associated with the application and the files it 
uses have gotten corrupted. You can use Disk Utility to perform a “permissions repair,” which 
restores file or folder permissions to the state the OS and applications expect them to be in.
Second, it may help to clear the dynamic link editor cache. This is a cache of recently 
used entry points to the dynamic link library. If this cache gets corrupted, it can cause the 
SPOD. To clear the cache, follow these steps:
1.	
Launch Terminal, located at /Applications/Utilities/.
2.	
At the Terminal prompt, enter the following command. Please note this is a single line; 
some browsers may show this command spanning multiple lines.
sudo update_dyld_shared_cache -force
3.	
Press Enter or Return.
4.	
Enter the administrator account password.
5.	
Terminal may display warnings about mismatches in the dlyd cache. These are normal, 
and you can proceed.

235
On the other hand, if you are experiencing this spinning wheel at startup, the problem 
is more severe. It means that the system is corrupted. The recovery options will be found 
by booting to the recovery hard drive, which is a partition created for this purpose in OS 
X 10.7 Lion or 10.8 Mountain Lion. To do this, start the device, and after the chime, press 
and hold Command+R until a menu appears. Then select to boot to the recovery partition. 
Figure 4.2 shows the menu that will appear. You have four options:
■
■
Restore the system from a Time Machine backup, in which you select Restore From 
Time Machine Backup. Then use a backup to restore the system.
■
■
Boot to the Apple servers, which can be done only on newer systems. To do this, select 
Reinstall OS X. Of course, this will require an Internet connection to be working.
■
■
Get Help Online, which will allow you to use Safari to browse to the Apple support 
site. This will require an Internet connection to be working as well. To do this, select 
Get Help Online.
■
■
Repair the hard drive and permissions, in which you select Disk Utility from the menu. 
Click the First Aid tab and select Repair.

Distended Capacitors
A swollen or distended capacitor on the motherboard does not always indicate a failed 
or failing capacitor, but at the least it indicates one that is in poor health and should be 
replaced. A distended capacitor will look normal on the side, but the top of it will be 

236 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
swollen a bit, and there may be brown residue coming out of the top of the capacitor. This 
is caused by gassing of the electrolyte, meaning the electrolyte has been broken down into 
gas and no longer contributes to the capacitance of the capacitor. The symptoms of this are 
a system that reboots intermittently and will start only intermittently or not at all.
While replacing a failed capacitor is not easy and in some cases not worth the time and 
effort when compared with replacing the motherboard, to replace a failed capacitor, follow 
these steps:
1.	
Locate the failed capacitor. Look for those that exhibit any of the physical symptoms 
shown in Figure 4.3.
F i g u r e   4 . 3     Failed capacitors
Normal capacitor
2.	
Procure a replacement capacitor. It should have the following:
■
■
The same voltage
■
■
The same or larger capacity
■
■
The same external size
While you can use a capacitor that has a higher voltage or a larger capacity, it is 
best to use one that matches the one you are replacing.
3.	
Remove the battery from the board.
4.	
Use a soldering iron to heat the connection to the board until you can remove the old 
capacitor. Be careful not to heat the board so much that you damage the connections of 
other components.

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common Problems 
237
5.	
Clean the remaining hole, and if necessary, use a pin to enlarge the hole for the new 
capacitor.
6.	
Insert the new capacitor. Heat solder and allow it to flow into the hole to seal. Try to 
keep the remaining drop on the outside as small as possible.
Tools
There are troubleshooting tools that you should be familiar with that can aid you. This sec-
tion discusses some of the most important tools.
Multimeter
Multimeters were discussed in Chapter 2, “Networking.” To review, these can be used to 
check voltages found on power plugs coming from the power supply to ensure the proper 
voltage is being delivered to the hard drive, motherboard, and other components. If that is 
not the case, components will not function properly and could be damaged.
Power Supply Tester
Inexpensive devices called power supply testers can go a bit beyond simply checking the 
voltage of the power cables. One of the things these devices can check is the proper opera-
tion of the Power_Good signal. If this signal is not working correctly, the computer will not 
boot from the power button but will do so when you press Ctrl+Alt+Del.
Loopback Plugs
Loopback plugs are used to test the functionality of various types of ports, but their most 
common use is to test a network card. These plugs send a signal out of the card and then 
loop it back into the same card to test its operation. They look like an RJ-45 connector 
without the cable.
POST Card/USB
POST cards are plugged into one of the slots in the computer, and when the computer is 
booting, the card will generate error codes on an LED. These codes serve a similar purpose 
as the beep codes discussed in the section “POST Code Beeps.” In some cases, the system is 
incapable of generating the codes. These cards for laptops connect to an external port such 
as the mini-PCI slot or LPT Printer port. They receive their power from a USB cable when 
connected to the printer port.
Exam Essentials
Describe the common symptoms of hardware problems.    These symptoms include unex-
pected shutdowns, lockups, and reboots; POST code beeps; blank screens on bootup; loss 
of system timekeeping; attempts to boot to an incorrect device; overheating; loss of power; 
loud noises; intermittent device failures; smoke; a burning smell; and BSODs.

4.2 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot 
Hard Drives and RAID Arrays with 
Appropriate Tools
Hard drives must be operational for the system to function, and hard drive arrays such as 
RAID introduce an additional level of complexity. This section discusses issues with hard 
drives and RAID arrays. The topics addressed in exam objective 4.2 include the following:
■
■
Common symptoms
■
■
Tools
Common Symptoms
Hard drives and RAID arrays typically exhibit symptoms before they fail. Learning to read 
these clues is critical to troubleshooting. This section discusses the most common of these 
clues and symptoms.
Read/Write Failure
Read/write failures occur when areas of the hard drive require repeated attempts before 
successful reads or writes occur. This is because these areas are at least partially damaged, 
although perhaps not enough for these areas to be marked as bad sectors.
Slow Performance
Another symptom of hard drive issues is slow access to the drive. Oddly, one of the poten-
tial causes of this is insufficient memory. When this is the case, it causes excessive paging. 
Another cause can be a drive that needs to be defragmented. A fragmented drive results in 
it taking much longer for all the parts of a file to be located before the file will open. Other 
issues that cause slow performance are controller cards that need updating, improper data 
cables, and slower devices sharing the same cable with the hard drive.
Loud Clicking Noise
A loud clicking noise, sometimes referred to as the click of death, is caused by the read/
write heads making contact with the platters. After that happens, both the heads and the 
platters become damaged, and the system becomes unable to establish a successful starting 
point to read the drive. This is serious damage and cannot be repaired. Back up all the data 
if that’s still possible. If the drive is beyond readable, the only option to recover the data is 

4.2 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Hard Drives and RAID Arrays 
239
with the help of a professional data recovery service. At that point, you must balance the 
cost of the recovery with the value of the data. This is a case where performing regular 
backups saves the day!
Failure to Boot
A failure of the system to boot can be caused by a number of issues:
■
■
Failure of the system to locate the boot files. See the section “Attempts to Boot to 
Incorrect Device.”
■
■
If you are presented with an “IDE drive not ready” at startup, the drive may not be spinning 
fast enough to be read. Enable or increase the hard disk predelay time.
■
■
If you receive the message “Immediately back up all your data and replace your 
hard drive. A fault may be imminent,” take it seriously. This means the drive is 
using Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) to predict a 
failure.
■
■
The hard drive data cable or power cable may have become unseated. Sometimes even 
if the cable appears to be seated fine, reseating it can have a positive effect. Also ensure 
that the data cable has not been reversed.
Drive Not Recognized
If the system does not recognize the drive, the problem could be one of the following:
■
■
The hard drive data cable or power cable may have become unseated. See the “Failure 
to Boot” section.
■
■
If you just added a drive, ensure that both drives have not been set to master or slave 
and that the boot drive is set as master on the first channel.
■
■
If the system uses SATA and you just added a drive, ensure that all the onboard SATA 
ports are enabled.
■
■
If you just added a drive, ensure that there is no conflict between the new drive and 
another device.
■
■
If you receive the “No boot device available, strike F1 to retry boot, F2 for setup util-
ity” message, it could be incorrect drive geometry (probably not the case if this drive 
has been functioning properly before), bad CMOS battery, or inability to locate the 
active partition or master boot record.
OS Not Found
When you receive the “operating system not found” message, it’s usually a software error 
rather than a hardware error. It could be that the master boot record cannot be located or 
the active partition cannot be located. These issues can be corrected in Windows by reboot-
ing the computer into Recovery mode and executing one of several commands at the com-
mand line of the Recovery environment. See the “Recovery Console” section in Chapter 8, 
“Software Troubleshooting.”

240 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
RAID Not Found
RAID can be either software or hardware based. When hardware-based RAID is imple-
mented, a RAID controller card is installed into a slot and the RAID drives connect to that 
controller card. When the RAID array cannot be located, usually it’s a problem with the 
controller card.
One item to check after you just installed the RAID controller card is that RAID is set in 
the BIOS. It is also possible that the computer has a built-in RAID controller. If that is the 
case, there will be ports for the drives in the motherboard. Ensure that the two hard drives 
(or three) are connected to the same port group.
If the RAID system has been operational, check all the cables connecting the drives to 
the motherboard, reseating them to ensure a good connection. Also ensure the BIOS is still 
set to RAID.
If there is no integrated RAID controller and the controller card is installed in a slot, 
ensure that the card is seated properly (maybe even try reseating it). Also ensure that all the 
drives are securely connected to the ribbon cable coming from the controller card.
RAID Stops Working
In some cases, one of the drives in the RAID array will cease to function and, depending on 
the type of RAID, can cause the entire array to be unavailable.
If this is a RAID 1 or a mirrored set, you should still be able to access the other drive. 
To determine which drive is bad, remove each drive one by one and reboot until you have 
identified the bad drive. Replace the bad drive and use the RAID software to rebuild the 
array.
If this is a RAID 5 array, follow the same procedure. The bad news is that if more than 
one drive has failed, you will not be able to rebuild the array. You will need to create the 
array again after replacing the bad drives and then restore the data from backup.
Once the bad drives have been replaced, the system may rearrange the drives such that 
the system cannot locate the drive with the operating system. Use the RAID setup program 
that you access during bootup to set the boot order of the drives in the array with the drive 
with the operating system first in the list.
Proprietary Screen Crashes
Earlier in this chapter I discussed the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) and the Pinwheel of 
Death (PWOD). Use the guidelines in the next sections to approach these problems.
BSOD/Pinwheel
When presented with a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) or the Pinwheel of Death (PWOD), 
it’s often difficult to interpret the problem. Always try rebooting, which in many cases 
causes it to go away. When dealing with the ambiguity of the crash screen, it is often useful 
to ask yourself these questions:
■
■
Did I just make any changes?
■
■
Is there any component that has been exhibiting symptoms of a problem?

4.2 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Hard Drives and RAID Arrays 
241
 If you just changed a hard drive, made a hard drive confi guration change, installed a 
new driver, or have been dealing with hard drive issues, you have reason to suspect these 
actions as the source of the crash. Try reversing the change you made and rebooting; if that 
helps, it indicates something faulty or detrimental about your change. 
 If you have multiple drives, try removing them one by one and observe the effect on the 
crash. Once you have located the drive causing the crash, begin to consider what the prob-
lem with the drive is or simply replace it, if no possible remedy comes to mind. 
 SMART Errors 
 SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology; often written as S.M.A.R.T.) 
is a system included in hard drives and solid-state drives that detects and reports on drive 
reliability, with a goal of anticipating hardware failures. It requires software on the computer 
to read the data from the drives and performs its analysis during startup. 
 Errors reported by SMART should be accepted as predictions that the drive will soon 
fail, and you should back up all the data as soon as possible, even if the drive appears to be 
performing normally and passes other disk checks you may run. One error that you may 
be able to mitigate is overheating. If you can increase ventilation such that the error disap-
pears, you are probably safe to continue using the drive. 
 Tools 
 Troubleshooting and working on hard drives requires some tools, both hardware and soft-
ware. This section covers the tools used in the process of troubleshooting hard drives. The 
types of external enclosures encountered in the process of getting at the hard drives physi-
cally are also discussed. 
 Screwdriver 
 Screws of various sizes and types hold many parts of the PC together, from the case itself to 
internal hard drives in their drive bays. The following types of screwdrivers should be part 
of your toolkit when dealing with hard drive issues: 
 
■
 Phillips screwdriver (nonmagnetic). 
 
■
 Hex driver (looks like a screw driver with a head like a socket wrench). The most common 
size is the 3/16 inch, but you may also need the 1/4 inch ones as well. 
 Avoid using magnetic screwdrivers internally because the magnetic field 
can damage components. 
 External Enclosures 
 Before you can get to the hard drives, you have to open the external enclosure. Enclosure 
designs have evolved over the years, but this section covers one of the most common types 
and the approach to opening it. 

242 
Chapter 4 ■ Hardware and Network Troubleshooting 
 Unfasten the computer’s cover by removing any retaining screws at the back of the com-
puter. Some cases don’t have screws; instead, they have a sliding bar or latches that release 
the cover. Many of today’s PCs can be completely disassembled without a single tool. 
 Then, remove the cover by sliding or lifting it. The exact procedure varies greatly 
depending on the case. Figure  4.4 shows an example for a desktop-style case. 
 F I g u r E   4 . 4   Removing the enclosure 
Pull cover back, then up, to remove.
Remove screws.
 Don’t remove all the screws at the back of the computer! Some of these 
screws hold vital components (such as the power supply) to the case, and 
removing them will cause those components to drop into the computer. 
 CHKDSK 
 CHKDSK is an older MS-DOS utility that is used to correct logical errors in the FAT fi le-
system. The most common switch for the  chkdsk command is  /F , which fi xes the errors 
that it fi nds. Without  /f ,  chkdsk is an information-only command. 
 Format 
 When implementing a new hard drive and creating new partitions or volumes, you must 
format the partition or volume before data can be written to it. You can do this for both 
FAT and NTFS partitions by using the Disk Management utility or by using the formatting 
function that is available during the installation of an operating system. 
 Another older option is to use the  format command. It is executed at the command line 
and will not only format the volume or partition but will also erase all data, so you should 
be aware of that end result as well. To format the C: drive, you execute  format c: .

File Recovery Software
In some cases, a hard drive cannot be saved, but the data can be recovered. Data recovery 
companies can recover data from some of the most damaged hard drives you can imagine, 
but the cost is high. Before going to those lengths to recover data from damaged drives or 
simply to recover data that may have been inadvertently deleted, consider using data recov-
ery software. Popular examples are Data Rescue, Advanced Disk Recovery, and Recover 
My Files.
Bootrec
Bootrec.exe is a tool available on the installation DVD of Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 that can 
be used to repair the following:
■
■
Master boot record (MBR)
■
■
Boot sector
■
■
Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store
It is a command-line tool that becomes available when you reboot to the installation CD; 
choose Repair Your Computer, select the problematic operating system, and choose System 
Recovery Options. In the options presented, choose Command Prompt. The command and 
its options are shown here:
■
■
bootrec/fixmbr: Attempts to repair the master boot record
■
■
bootrec/fixboot: Writes a new boot sector to the system partition
■
■
bootrec/scanos: Scans the systems for supported installations and adds them to the 
list displayed at bootup
■
■
bootrec/rebuildbcd: Completely rebuilds the BCD store
Diskpart
Diskpart is command-line Disk Management utility in Windows. It enables you to 
manage objects (disks, partitions, or volumes) by using scripts or direct input at a 
command prompt. It can perform all the functions that can be done with the Disk 
Management utility and quite a few that cannot be done with Disk Management. 
In many ways, it is an updated version of fdisk. It can be used to create and manage 
volumes on the drive.
Defragmentation Tool
Defragmentation tools are used to reorganize the physical location of the data on the hard 
drive so as to locate all pieces of a file together in the same place. When this is done, it 
improves the performance of the drive. All operating systems come with built-in defrag-
mentation tools, and their operation can be scheduled for a time convenient to the user. 
This also frees the user (and the technician) from having to think about running the tool on 
a regular basis. Figure 4.5 shows the Drive Optimization tool in Windows 8.1. To arrive at

4.3 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot 
Common Video, Projector, and Display 
Issues
Video, projector, and display problems may not rate at the top of the priority list for technicians 
(unless the display is not functioning at all), but to a user, problems with their display may seem 
like a huge issue. This section discusses common video- and display-related symptoms and their 
possible sources. The topics addressed in exam objective 4.3 include the following:
■
■
Common symptoms
Common Symptoms
Display monitors and projectors can exhibit a wide range of symptoms when video-related 
problems arise. Some are as obvious as no signal whatsoever, whereas other symptoms 
can be so slight as to almost defy detection. This section discusses common symptoms and 
some approaches to dealing with these issues.
VGA Mode
When a display ceases to function at the resolution level supported by the video card and 
reverts to 16-bit VGA mode (low resolution in Windows 7 and Vista), the problem is almost 
always video drivers. If the issue arises during the installation of a new video card, then the 
driver was not found in the cache of drivers provided with the operating system.
Even if the video card is Plug and Play, the driver must be present. If it is not, the com-
puter will not be able to use the card and will revert to using VGA mode (low resolution in 
Windows 7). Another common problem associated with drivers is not having the current 
version—as problems are fixed, the drivers are updated, and you can often save a great deal of 
time by downloading the latest drivers from the vendor’s site early in the troubleshooting process.
The easiest way to see or change drivers in Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 is to click the 
Driver tab in the Properties dialog box for the device. For example, to see the driver asso-
ciated with the hard drive in Windows 7, double-click the hard drive in Device Manager 
(Start ➢ Control Panel ➢ Hardware And Sound ➢ Devices And Printers, and then click 
Device Manager in the Task list) and choose the Driver tab. Among other things, this 
shows the driver provider, date, version, and signer. You can choose to view details about 
it, update it, roll it back to a previous driver, or uninstall it. If the installation of the device 
resulted in VGA mode (low resolution in Windows 7), then you need to select Update 
Driver and point the system to the CD or local folder where the correct driver is located.
No Image Onscreen
When there is no image on the screen, the display is either dead or not receiving the signal 
from the computer. Check the cable from the back of the PC to the monitor, ensure it is 
tightly screwed in place, and reseat the cables if required. Also ensure that the monitor is 

246 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
plugged into a functional power outlet and that the brightness settings are high enough. 
Finally, for a laptop, you should use the appropriate Fn key to ensure that the signal isn’t 
being sent to an external monitor.
To eliminate the video card as the problem, connect a known good display to the com-
puter and see whether the same problem exists. If so, then the problem is not the display. If 
it works fine, the problem is the display. Displays do die and usually are not cost effective to 
repair. The usual solution is to replace the display.
If the card is the problem, try reseating it. If that provides no relief, insert a known good 
card. Operating in the same fashion as you did with the display, you can determine whether 
the video card is the problem.
Overheat Shutdown
When the video card is overheating, it can cause display problems and shutdowns. 
Overheating video cards usually exhibit symptoms like garbled output on the display or 
artifacts (covered later in this section). It also can result in flickers and flashes. In some 
cases, the display will cease functioning after being on a few seconds. After you restart the 
computer, the display again works for a few seconds and then fails.
When overheating is the problem, you must find the reason for the overheating. Clean all 
the dust out of the inside of the case and inspect all fans to ensure they are functioning—
especially the fan on the video card if one is present. If the problem has been happening for 
some time, the card may have become damaged. Try using a different card and see whether 
the problem goes away. You may need to replace the video card.
Projectors
With respect to projectors, when the bulbs are overheating, they may shut down to cool 
down. Simply waiting until the bulb has cooled and then restarting the projector will 
usually solve the problem. It may also be helpful to inform the users that many projectors 
will not allow the bulb to be restarted soon after you turn it off, so they may want to 
consider that if they intend to restart the projector soon after shutting it down.
Dead Pixels
Pixels are the small dots on the screen that are filled with a color; as a group they present 
the image you see on the screen. Two conditions can occur with the pixels: stuck pixels and 
bad or dead pixels.
Stuck pixels have been filled with a color and are not changing as required to display 
changes in the image. Dead pixels are simply black with no color in them.
When there are few of these and they are not clustered in the same spot, you may not 
even be able to notice them. When they build to the point where they are noticeable, they 
cannot be fixed. You may be able to get some satisfaction from the manufacturer depending 
on how old the monitor is and the policy of the vendor.
Artifacts
Artifacts are visual anomalies that appear on the screen. They might be pieces of images 
left over from a previous image or a “tear in the image” (it looks like the image is divided 
into two parts and the parts don’t line up).

4.3 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common Video, Projector, and Display Issues 
247  
Artifacts can be generated whenever hardware components such as the processor, 
memory chip, or cabling malfunction causing data corruption. It may be caused by physical 
damage, but the first thing to check is the overheating of the graphics processor or video 
card. Use the same techniques described in the section “Overheat Shutdown.”
Color Patterns Incorrect
When the image displayed uses incorrect color patterns or is garbled, the root of the problem 
could depend on when the condition presents itself. If the screen looks fine during the POST 
but then goes bad when Windows starts to load, it probably is because of an incorrect set-
ting of the video card. For example, it may be set to do something the card is incapable of 
doing. Restart in safe mode (which will cause the system to use the VGA driver) and check 
all the settings of the card while ensuring that it is not set for a resolution level for which the 
card is not capable. You may also try updating the driver if a new one is available.
If this problem occurs from the moment you turn the system on, the problem is hard-
ware, and you should check the monitor, cable, and card, replacing each with a known 
good piece until you isolate the bad component.
Dim Image
If the image is fine but dim, first check the brightness setting, usually found in the front of 
the monitor. If this is a laptop, remember there are function keys that when hit inadver-
tently will dim the screen as well. Check that.
If it is an LCD, the backlight may be going bad. You learned earlier that these are pencil-
sized lights that go behind the screen. They can be replaced on a laptop by following the 
procedure for opening the laptop lid (where the display resides) and replacing the backlight. 
Keep in mind that opening the case voids the warranty, so if you still have warranty left, 
make use of that option.
If it is the backlight on a desktop LCD, the backlight can be replaced for about $20, so it 
makes a repair worth doing if you want to open the monitor. Use the documentation or the 
vendor website for details on opening the case.
Projectors
When projectors have a dim image, it can be that the bulb is going bad. All bulbs have a 
stated lifetime that can be found in the documentation of the projector. The hours of life-
time that you find in the documentation have usually been stretched a bit, meaning toward 
the end of the lifetime the bulb will start to fade in brightness.
Flickering Image
When the image is flickering, check the cables and ensure they are seated properly. If that 
doesn’t help, try different cables because it could be a problem with the cable itself.
Another possible reason is a mismatch between the resolution settings and the refresh 
rate. If this is the problem, it will occur only when using the higher resolutions. You should 
increase the refresh rate to support the higher resolutions.
While you won’t see many CRT monitors, flickering on those can indicate a source of 
magnetic interference near the display, such as a radio. Degaussing CRT monitors can help.

248 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
Distorted Image
This behavior can be caused by problems with power. Try replacing the power cable, and 
if that doesn’t help, try plugging the monitor into a different wall outlet. Sometimes other 
devices on the same line (air conditioner, refrigerator, and so forth) can cause problems for 
the supply of power to the monitor.
Distorted Geometry
Distorted geometry can occur in projectors. It’s simpler to show the symptoms than it is 
to explain what causes it, but it is a defect in the optical lens system. Figure 4.6 shows the 
most common forms.

projector remote.

Burn-in
Burn-in is a condition that affected CRT monitors and still affects plasma and OLED 
displays. LCDs are generally not affected. The condition occurs when images are left for 
extended periods of time on the screen. The early screen savers were designed to prevent 
this in unattended displays by displaying a constantly changing image.
Software and utilities can be used to remedy burn-in but will have little effect if the 
burn-in is severe. It is also useful to know that the display will be most susceptible to 
this when it is new in the first few hours of operation. DVDs can be purchased that will 
“break in” a screen, and in some cases they can even eliminate existing burn-in if it is 
not severe.
Oversized Images and Icons
When a user is experiencing oversized images and icons, it is typically a misconfigured set-
ting. In the iOS operating system it could be that the zoom is on. In Windows 7 and 8.1 
there is a slider on the Display settings page, as shown in Figure 4.8, that can be used to 
enlarge all items on the screen. This setting is called Change The Size Of All Items. Check 
this setting and adjust as required.

Wired and Wireless Networks with 
Appropriate Tools
At one time, wireless networks were considered an extravagant and insecure addition to the 
enterprise network, but now users expect wireless access. No longer is it a business advan-

and wireless networks. The topics addressed in exam objective 4.4 include the following:

Common Symptoms
Network problems, usually manifesting themselves as an inability to connect to resources, 
can arise from many different sources. This section discusses some common symptoms of 
networking issues.
No Connectivity
When no connectivity can be established with the network, your troubleshooting approach 
should begin at the physical layer and then proceed up the OSI model. As components at 
each layer are eliminated as the source of the problem, proceed to the next higher layer. A 
simple yet effective set of steps might be as follows:
1.	
Check the network cable to ensure it is the correct cable type (crossover or straight 
through) and that it is functional. If in doubt, try a different cable.
2.	
Ensure that the NIC is functional and TCP/IP is installed and functional by pinging 
the loopback address 127.0.0.1. If required, install or reinstall TCP/IP and/or replace 
or repair the NIC.
3.	
Check the local IP configuration and ensure that the IP address, subnet mask, and 
gateway are correct. If the default gateway can be pinged, the computer is configured 
correctly for its local network and the problem lies beyond the router or with the 

4.4 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Wired and Wireless Networks 
251
destination device. If pings to the gateway are unsuccessful, ensure that the IP configu-
rations of the router interface and the computer are compatible and in the same subnet.
When dealing with a wireless network, ensure that the wireless card is functional. The 
wireless card is easily disabled with a keystroke on a laptop and should be the first thing to 
check. If the network uses a hidden SSID, ensure that the station in question is configured 
with the correct SSID.
APIPA/Link Local Addresses
Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is a TCP/IP feature Microsoft added to its oper-
ating systems. If a DHCP server cannot be found, the clients automatically assign them-
selves an IP address, somewhat randomly, in the 169.254.x.x range with a subnet mask of 
255.255.0.0. This allows them to communicate with other hosts that have similarly config-
ured themselves, but they will be unable to connect to the Internet or to any machines or 
resources that have DHCP-issued IP addresses.
If the network uses DHCP for IP configuration and the computer with the connectivity 
issue has an APIPA address, the problem is one of these three things:
■
■
The DHCP server is out of IP addresses.
■
■
The DHCP server is on the other side of a router and there is no functional DHCP 
relay present or no IP helper address configured on the router—all of which is to say 
the DHCP request is not reaching the DHCP server.
■
■
The computer has a basic connectivity issue preventing it from connecting to the net-
work (see the section “No Connectivity”).
In Chapter 2, you learned about a type of IPv6 address called a link local address that in 
many ways is like an APIPA address in that the device will generate one of these addresses 
for each interface with no intervention from a human, as is done with APIPA. The scope 
of the address is also the same, in that it is not routable and is good only on the segment 
where the device is located.
However, as is the case with APIPA addresses, if two devices that are connected to 
the same segment generate these addresses, they will be in the same network, and the 
two devices will be able to communicate. This is because the devices always generate 
the address using the same IPv6 prefix (the equivalent of a network ID in IPv4), which is 
fe80::/64. The remainder of the address is created by spreading the 48-bit MAC address 
across the last 64 bits, yielding an IPv6 address that looks like the following one:
FE80::2237:06FF:FECF:67E4/64
Limited Connectivity
In some cases, the computer has connectivity to some but not all resources. When this is the 
case, issues that may reside on other layers of the OSI model should come under consideration. 
These include the following:
Authentication Issues    Does the user have the permission to access the resource?
DNS Issues    You may be able to ping the entire network using IP addresses, but most 
access is done by name, not IP address. If you can’t ping resources by name, DNS is not 

252 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
functional, meaning either the DNS server is down or the local machine is not configured 
with the correct IP address of the DNS server. If recent changes have occurred in the DNS 
mappings or if your connection to the destination device has recently failed because of a 
temporary network issue that has been solved, you may need to clear the local DNS cache 
using the ipconfig/flushdns command.
Remote Problem    Don’t forget that establishing a connection is a two-way street, and if 
the remote device has an issue, communication cannot occur. Always check the remote 
device as well. Any interconnecting device between the computer and resource, such as a 
switch or router, should also be checked for functionality.
Local Connectivity
When a computer can communicate only on its local network or subnet, the problem is 
usually one of the following:
Incorrect Subnet Mask    Sometimes an incorrect mask will prevent all communication, but 
in some cases it results in successful connections locally but not remotely (outside the local 
subnet). The subnet mask value should be the same mask used on the router interface con-
necting to the local network.
Incorrect Default Gateway Address    If the computer cannot connect to the default gate-
way, it will be confined to communicating with devices on the local network. This IP 
address should be that of the router interface connecting to the local network.
Router Problem    If all users on the network are having connectivity problems, you likely 
have a routing issue that should be escalated to the proper administrators.
Intermittent Connectivity
When a connectivity issue comes and goes, it can be a hardware issue or a software issue. 
The following hardware components should be checked for functionality:
Network Cable    A damaged cable can cause intermittent connectivity.
Network Interface Card    If the NIC is not properly seated or has worked its way partially 
out of its slot, it can cause connections that come and go.
Interference    On a wireless network, cordless phones, microwave ovens, and other wireless 
networks can interfere with transmissions. Also, users who stray too far from the access 
point (AP) can experience a signal that comes and goes.
The following are software issues that can cause intermittent connectivity:
DHCP Issues    When the DHCP server is down or out of IP addresses, the problem will not 
manifest itself to those users who already have an IP address until their lease expires and they 
need a new address. In this case, some users will be fine and others will not, and then users 
who were fine earlier in the day may have problems later when their IP address lease expires.
DNS Problems    If the DNS server is down or malfunctioning, it will cause problems for DNS 
clients who need name resolution requests answered. For users who have already connected 

4.4 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Wired and Wireless Networks 
253
to resources in the last hour before the outage, connectivity to those resources will still be 
possible until the name to IP address mapping is removed from the client DNS resolver cache.
IP Conflict
IP address conflicts are somewhat rare when DHCP is in use, but they can still happen. 
DHCP servers and clients both check for IP duplication when the DHCP client receives an 
IP address, but the process doesn’t always work. Moreover, if someone with a statically 
configured IP address connects to the network with the same address as another machine, 
a conflict will exist.
Regardless of how the conflict occurs, it must be resolved because until it is, one or 
possibly both computers with the same address will not be able to operate on the network. 
You can determine the MAC address of the computer with which you are experiencing the 
conflict by using the ping command followed by the arp -d command.
Slow Transfer Speeds
Slow transmission on the network can be caused by hardware and software issues. Some of 
the physical issues that can cause slow performance are as follows:
Interference    Both wireless and wired networks can be affected by electromagnetic inter-
ference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). EMI will degrade network perfor-
mance. This can be identified by the poor operation you may experience. Be sure to run 
cables around (not over) ballasts and other items that can cause EMI. RFI is a similar issue 
introduced by radio waves. Wireless networks suffer even more from both of these issues.
Incorrect Cabling    The network can go only as fast as its weakest link. Using CAT3 
cabling, for example, will only allow the network to operate at 10 Mbps even if all the 
network cards are capable of 10 Gbps.
Malfunctioning NIC    Network interface cards (NICs) can malfunction and cause a broad-
cast storm. These broadcast packets fill the network with traffic that slows performance for 
all users. Use a protocol analyzer to determine the MAC address of the offending computer.
From a software standpoint, the following issues can result in less than ideal performance:
Router Misconfiguration    If the router is not configured correctly, it can cause slow per-
formance because of less than optimal routing paths. Escalate the issue to the appropriate 
administrators.
Switch Misconfiguration    An improperly implemented redundant switch network can 
result in switching loops that cause slow performance. Escalate the issue to the appropriate 
administrators.
Low RF Signal
In a wireless network, the signal coming from the AP has a distance limit. With some varia-
tion by standard, this is about 300 feet. However, this distance is impacted by obstructions 
and interference in the area. The WLAN design should include a site survey that identifies 
these issues and locates APs and antenna types in such a way as to mitigate these effects.

254 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
It is also useful to know that APs and some client radios have a setting to control signal 
strength. It is not a normal practice to change the setting in a laptop wireless card, but it 
may be necessary to change the transmit level on an AP. In many cases, it is actually benefi-
cial to reduce the transmit level of an AP in situations where it is interfering with other APs 
in your network or you want to limit the range of the signal to prevent it from leaving the 
building. This is especially true in high-density areas where several APs are collocated in 
the same area for increased throughput.
SSID Not Found
In an 802.11 WLAN, the service set identifier (SSID) is used as both a network name and 
in some cases the magic word that allows access to the network. One of the ways you can 
increase the security of a WLAN (not sufficient in and of itself but a good addition to a lay-
ered approach to WLAN security) is to “hide” the SSID. This is also referred to as disabling 
SSID broadcast. This is done by setting the AP to not list the SSID in the beacon frames. 
These frames contain the information that is used to populate the list of available wireless 
networks when you “scan” for wireless networks on your wireless device.
When the SSID is hidden, the only way a device can connect to the WLAN is to be con-
figured with a profile that includes the SSID of the WLAN. While every operating system is 
slightly different, to do this in Windows 8.1, you follow these steps:

Complete the network name, security type, encryption type, and security key; check 
the box Connect Even If The Network Is Not Broadcasting; and click Next. Now the 
profile is complete and you should be able to connect to the “hidden” network. To 
make it easier for the user, you may also want to check the box Start This Connection 
Automatically.
Hardware Tools
You have a number of tools at your disposal when troubleshooting. Some of these tools 
have already been discussed, and some are new to the discussion. This section discusses 
some of the main ones.
Cable Tester
Commonly used with network cabling, cable testers are used to verify that the cable you 
are using is good. You can perform many of the same tests with a multimeter. Although 
trading a known good cable for a suspected bad cable is also acceptable, a cable tester can 
help determine exactly what’s wrong with the cable.
Loopback Plug
Also called wrap plugs, loopback plugs take the signal going out and essentially echo it 
back. This allows you to test parallel, serial, and network ports to make certain they’re 
working correctly. This is a good way to eliminate or implicate the NIC as a problem.
Punch-Down Tools
A punch-down tool is used when you are securing cables to the patch panel that have been 
run from the wall outlets into the switch room. A wire is prepositioned into a slotted post, and 
then the punch-down tool is pressed down on top of the wire, over the post. Once the required 
pressure is reached, the internal spring is triggered, and the blade pushes the wire into the slot, 
cutting the insulation and securing the wire. Figure 4.12 shows a punch-down tool.

Tone Generator and Probe
Toner probes (also called tone generators) are used to locate the correct cable coming into 
a patch panel from the wall outlet when either connections have not been labeled or the

257
labels have been removed from the patch panel. They are two-piece units (sometimes called 
fox and hound) where one end sends a signal and the other end is used to locate the wires 
that contain the signal in the switch room. Figure 4.13 shows a set.
F i g u r e   4 .13     Toner probe
Wire Strippers
Wire strippers are used to prepare the end of a cable for the attachment of a connector. 
They are used to remove the plastic covering and any shielding to get to the wire pairs con-
tained in a twisted-pair wire. This functionality is often included with the crimper (see the 
next section).
Crimper
A crimper is used to attach a connector to a cable by securing each wire (eight of them in a 
twisted-pair wire) to the proper connector in an RJ-45 connector. It usually also includes a 
stripper as well. Figure 4.14 shows a coaxial crimper.

Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
Wireless Locator
A wireless locator is a hardware device that scans all channels or a specified channel for 
any 802.11 WLANs that may be in the area. They can be used to find a WLAN and to 
determine whether the network is broadcasting its SSID and whether security is enabled 
on the WLAN. It also can be used during the implementation of a WLAN to identity the 
channels used by the existing WLANs in the area so that an unused channel can be selected 
to avoid interference.
Command-Line Tools
Several command-line tools can be quite helpful.
ping
The ping command makes use of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to 
test connectivity between two devices. ping is one of the most useful commands in the 
TCP/IP. It sends a series of packets to another system, which in turn sends a response. 
The ping command can be extremely useful for troubleshooting problems with remote 
hosts.
The ping command indicates whether the host can be reached and how long it took for 
the host to send a return packet. On a LAN, the time is indicated as less than 10 millisec-
onds. Across WAN links, however, this value can be much greater. When the -a parameter 
is included, it will also attempt to resolve the hostname associated with the IP address. 
Figure 4.15 shows an example of a successful ping.
F i g u r e   4 .15     The ping command
ipconfig/ifconfig
The ipconfig command is used to view the IP configuration of a device and, when com-
bined with certain switches or parameters, can be used to release and renew the lease 
of an IP address obtained from a DHCP server and to flush the DNS resolver cache. Its 
most common use is to view the current configuration. Figure 4.16 show its execution 
with the /all switch, which results in a display of a wealth of information about the IP 
configuration.

4.4 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Wired and Wireless Networks 
259
F i g u r e  4 .16     Using ipconfig
ipconfig can be used to release and renew a configuration obtained from a DHCP 
server by issuing first the ipconfig /release command, followed by the ipconfig /renew 
command.
It is also helpful to know that when you have just corrected a configuration error (such 
as an IP address) on a destination device, you should ensure that the device registers its new 
IP address with the DNS server by executing the ipconfig /registerdns command.
It may also be necessary to clear incorrect IP address to hostname mappings that may 
still exist on the devices that were attempting to access the destination device. This can be 
done by executing the ipconfig /flushdns command.
If you are using a Linux or Unix system, the command is not ipconfig but ifconfig. 
Figure 4.17 shows an example of the command and its output. The ifconfig command 
with -a option shows all network interface information, even if the network interface is 
down.
tracert
The tracert command (called traceroute in Linux and Unix) is used to trace the path 
of a packet through the network. Its best use is in determining exactly where in the 
­network the packet is being dropped. It will show each hop (router) the packet crosses 
and how long it takes to do so. Figure 4.18 shows a partial display of a traced route to  
www.msn.com.

netstat
The netstat (network status) command is used to see what ports are listening on the TCP/
IP-based system. The -a option is used to show all ports, and /? is used to show what

4.4 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Wired and Wireless Networks 
261
other options are available (the options differ based on the operating system you are using). 
When executed with no switches, the command displays the current connections, as shown 
in Figure 4.19.
F i g u r e   4 .19    Using netstat
nbtstat
Microsoft networks use an interface called Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) 
to resolve workstation names with IP addresses. The nbtstat command can be used to 
view NetBIOS information. In Figure 4.20 it has been executed with the -n switch, which 
will display the NetBIOS names that are currently known to the local machine. In this case, 
this local machine is aware only of its own NetBIOS names.

net
The net command is one of the most powerful on the Windows-based network, as illus-
trated by net use. The options that can be used with the command differ slightly based on 
the Windows operating system you are using; you can view a full list by typing net /?.
The net use command is used on Windows-based clients to connect or disconnect from 
shared resources. You can see what is currently shared by typing net use without any 
other parameters, as shown in Figure 4.21.
F i g u r e   4 . 21     Typing net use lets you see what is currently shared.
netdom
The netdom command is a Windows tool used to manage Active Directory domains and 
trust relationships from the command line. It is built into the Windows Server 2008, 
Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 and also 
becomes available if you have the Active Directory Domain Services Tools that are part of 
the Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) installed on a Windows client machine 
like Windows 8.1.

4.4 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Wired and Wireless Networks 
263
The following are some of the tasks that can be performed with this tool:
■
■
Join a computer that runs Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista, Windows 7, 
Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 to a Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008, 
Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000, or Windows NT 4.0 domain.
■
■
Manage computer accounts for domain member workstations and member servers.
■
■
Establish one-way or two-way trust relationships between domains.
The command syntax is as follows:
NetDom <Operation> [<Computer>] [{/d: | /domain:} <Domain>] [<Options>]
NetDom help <Operation>

nslookup
The nslookup command a command-line administrative tool for testing and troubleshoot-
ing DNS servers. It can be run in two modes, interactive and noninteractive. While nonin-
teractive mode is useful when only a single piece of data needs to be returned, interactive 
allows you to query for either an IP address for a name or a name for an IP address without 
leaving nslookup mode. The command syntax is as follows:
nslookup [-option] [hostname] [server]
To enter interactive mode, simply type nslookup as shown next. When you do this, by 
default it will identify the IP address and name of the DNS server that the local machine 
is configured to use, if any, and then will go to the > prompt. At this prompt you can type 
either an IP address or a name, and the system will attempt to resolve the IP address to a 
name or the name to an IP address.
C:\> nslookup
   Default Server:  nameserver1.domain.com
   Address:  10.0.0.1

The following are other queries that can be run that may prove helpful when trouble-
shooting name resolution issues:
■
■
Looking up different data types in the database (such as Microsoft records)
■
■
Querying directly from another name server (different from the one the local device is 
configured to use)

4.5 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot and 
Repair Common Mobile Device Issues 
While Adhering to the Appropriate 
Procedures
Mobile devices have their own unique sets of issues that may not be encountered with desk-
top computers. This section discusses common issues and their solutions. Mobile devices 
require a different set of procedures for opening the case while protecting the integrity of 
the unit. The following topics are addressed in exam objective 4.5:
■
■
Common symptoms
■
■
Disassembling processes for proper reassembly
Common Symptoms
Not all mobile device issues are unique to mobile devices. They suffer from many of the 
same issues as desktop machines. However, some problems are unique to laptops and 
mobile devices or at least are more prone to occur with laptops, as you will learn in this 
section.

4.5 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot and Repair Common Mobile Device 
265
No Display
The backlight is the light in the device that powers the LCD screen. It can go bad over time 
and need to be replaced, and it can also be held captive by the inverter. The inverter takes 
the DC power the laptop is providing and boosts it up to AC to run the backlight. If the 
inverter goes bad, you can replace it on most models (it’s cheaper than the backlight).
Before going to the trouble of opening the case, however, ensure that the screen has not 
been inadvertently dimmed to the off position with the Fn keys or that the system has not 
been set to direct the output to an external monitor.
Dim Display
As with a blank display, the backlight and inverter can cause dimming problems, but in 
most cases the screen has been dimmed inadvertently with the Fn keys. It is also possible 
that the switch on the laptop that tells the system the lid is closed may be held down by 
some obstruction. Check that as well.
Flickering Display
Flickering screens can be caused by video drivers. The first thing to try is updating the 
driver. Another cause can be a low screen-refresh rate. Make sure the rate is set according 
to the documentation. Keep in mind that if you set it incorrectly, another symptom that 
may appear is more than one image displaying with the top image appearing transparent.
Flickering can also be caused by a loose connection. You may remember that a cable 
connects the display to the motherboard. Open the lid as described in Chapter 3, “Mobile 
Devices,” and reseat the cable.
Sticking Keys
Problems with keyboards can range from collecting dust (in which case you need to blow it 
out) to their springs wearing out. In the latter case, you can replace the keyboard (they cost 
about 10 times more than desktop keyboards) or choose to use an external one (provided 
the user isn’t traveling and having to lug another hardware element with them). As you can 
imagine, spilled liquids are often the cause of sticking keys.
Intermittent Wireless
Most laptops today include an internal wireless card. This is convenient, but it can be 
susceptible to interference (resulting in low signal strength) between the laptop and the 
AP. Do what you can to reduce the number of items blocking the signal between the two 
devices, and you’ll increase the strength of the signal. It is also possible that the cable 
that connects the antenna to the laptop needs to be reseated. Open the lid as described in 
Chapter 3.
Battery Not Charging
Most NiCad batteries build up memory, and that memory can prevent a battery from 
offering a full charge. The biggest issue with DC power problems is a battery’s inability to 

266 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
power the laptop as long as it should. If a feature is available to fully drain the battery, you 
should use it to eliminate the memory (letting the laptop run on battery on a regular basis 
greatly helps). If you can’t drain the battery and eliminate the memory effect, you should 
replace the battery.
Ghost Cursor/Pointer Drift
A second, or ghost, cursor can be caused when the laptop has a track pad that is too sensi-
tive. Some laptops and tablets also vent warm air through the keyboard, and when the lid 
gets left down, it heats up the track pad and causes this type of cursor behavior. Updating 
the driver for the touchpad has been known to help this problem. Another approach is to 
disable the touchpad completely and use an external mouse.
Pointer drift occurs when the mouse cursor slowly drifts across the screen with no assis-
tance from the user. In some cases, it occurs only on a second or third monitor and not the 
main monitor. If that is the case, there is a setting in the display properties that may solve 
the issue. In Windows 8.1, navigate to the display properties by right-clicking the display 
and select Preferences. Then in the menu at the bottom left of the resulting screen, choose 
Display. Then on the screen shown in Figure 4.22, select the check box next to the selection 
Let Me Choose One Scaling Level For All My Displays.
F i g u r e   4 . 2 2     Addressing pointer drift

4.5 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot and Repair Common Mobile Device 
267
In other cases, the problem is not related to multiple monitors at all. If you find that 
it is occurring only with certain applications, it may be neither a pointer nor device 
problem at all but rather an application issue. Finally, on some laptops and other small 
devices that use trackpads, it may be that you or the user are leaving your hand resting 
on a part of the device very close to the trackpad and it is picking that up and causing the 
pointer to move.
No Power
In the absence of AC power, the device will attempt to run off the battery. This solution is 
good for a time, but AC power must be available to keep the battery charged and the laptop 
running. Most laptops have an indicator light showing whether AC power is being received, 
and the AC cord typically has an indicator light on it as well to show that it’s receiving 
power. If no lights are lit on the cord or the laptop indicating that AC power is being 
received, try a different outlet or a different cord. Also try reseating the cord in the power 
adaptor. The cord between the wall and the adaptor is removable (to interchange for different 
countries’ outlet types), and sometimes it comes loose from the brick.
The presence of AC can affect the action of the NIC. To conserve power, the NIC is 
often configured not to be active when running on DC power (see Figure 4.23). In some 
laptop models, you can access this dialog box through Start ➢ Control Panel ➢ Internal 
NIC Configuration. If power problems arise, ensure that this setting is enabled.

268 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
In Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, use Device Manager to set Allow The Computer To Turn Off 
This Device To Save Power in the Properties ➢ Power Management tab. Then use the Power 
Options to set the NIC to Maximum Power Saving.
Num Lock Indicator Lights
Sometimes the Num Lock indicator light does not function. This can be a hardware issue, 
but many times it is a case of not understanding the process for enabling and disabling 
Num Lock. In many laptops you simply hit the key once to turn it on and again to turn it 
off. However, on some devices, you must also use the Fn key simultaneously. Spilling liq-
uids on the laptop can also cause these problems and usually requires taking the laptop in 
for service to clean the internal parts.
No Wireless Connectivity
When there is no wireless connectivity, it is usually one of two things:
■
■
The wireless capability is disabled (enabling and disabling this function is usually done 
with a key combination or a Fn key) because this is easy to disable inadvertently. This 
can also be a hardware switch on the side, front, or back of the case.
■
■
The wireless antenna is bad or the cable needs to be reseated.
No Bluetooth Connectivity
Bluetooth is also enabled and disabled with a key combination and can be disabled easily. 
The first thing to try is to reenable it. The second thing to try is to reseat the antenna cable. 
If all else fails, try a new antenna. Like the WLAN NIC, this can also be a hardware switch 
on the side, front, or back of the case.
Cannot Display to External Monitor
It’s always possible that a hardware issue is causing an external monitor to not work 
when connected to a laptop; but, again, in most cases the problem is an incomplete 
understanding of the key combination to use to send the output to the external  
monitor.
On some laptops you need to use the Fn key in combination with keys on the top row; 
on other laptops you simply use the top row keys. Before spending too much time trouble-
shooting, consult the documentation and ensure you are using the correct procedure. In 
some models, this can also be controlled from the video control panel or from within 
PowerPoint or other presentation software.
Touchscreen Nonresponsive
Tablets, phablets, and smartphones use a touchscreen interface that eliminates the 
need for a keyboard. Touchscreen monitors use two technologies: touch flow and mul-
titouch. Before we dive into solving a nonresponsive touchscreen, let’s review these 
technologies.

4.5 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot and Repair Common Mobile Device 
269
Touch Flow
Touch flow, or TouchFLO, is a user interface feature designed by HTC. It is used by drag-
ging your finger up and down or left and right to access common tasks on the screen. This 
movement is akin to scrolling the screen up and down or scrolling the screen left and right.
Multitouch
Multitouch allows the screen to recognize multiple simultaneous screen touches. This 
allows for movements such as those used for expanding or enlarging pictures with two 
fingers and then reducing them back again with the reverse movement.
The first thing that all documentation will tell you to try is to restart the device, and in 
many cases the documentation is not blowing smoke at you; it does actually solve the issue. 
Unfortunately, if the screen is broken or the wires are cut, this will not help, but you should 
always try this first.
Many devices, such as the Android operating system, have a Device Diagnostics tool, 
which can test, among other things, the touchscreen. To access this tool, a special key 
sequence is used on the same key pad where you dial phone numbers. When you hit the 
proper sequence (see the documentation), the menu for the tool will appear, as shown in 
Figure 4.24, which shows the menu for the Device Diagnostic tool for the Samsung S4. 
There are two tests found here that apply to the touchscreen, the TSP Dot Mode and the 
TSP Grid Mode.
F i g u r e   4 . 2 4     Samsung Device Diagnostics menu

270 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
TSP Dot mode allows you to verify that the screen is reading your touch. It will place a 
dot on the screen everywhere you touch it where it is reading the input. The TSP Grid mode 
allows you to test each section or grid of the screen. You can drag your finger across the 
screen and identify any dead spots that may be present.
If the device passes both of these tests, you have no problem with the screen; you have 
an issue with software, not hardware. Try removing the battery while the device is on (soft 
reset). If the device doesn’t allow this, it will typically have an operation you can execute 
called a simulated battery pull. If neither of these steps helps, the next step is to reboot the 
device to safe mode.
If booting to safe mode solves the issue, the issue lies in your application. It may be out-
dated or corrupt, so try reinstalling the latest version. If none of what I have discussed so far 
works, you are ready to get more extreme and perform a hard reset, which returns the device 
to the factory settings. Don’t do this until you have backed up all the data on the device. 
Also, do not do this if the device exhibited any hardware issues when you ran the diagnostics 
test. You will need it to work properly when you finish the reset so you can set up the phone 
again.
If the device fails the diagnostic test, you have a hardware issue. If the damage is from 
liquids, submerge the phone in 99 percent isopropyl alcohol. Dry the phone completely and 
turn it on. This has actually fixed some phones with water damage. Unfortunately, in most 
cases, when the diagnostic test fails, you have to replace the screen.
These same options are also available with touchscreens on devices like the Microsoft 
Surface as well. The same general approach applies with some variation (clean screen, 
restart, recalibrate the screen, install the latest updates, restore from backup, refresh, reset). 
The terms refresh and reset mean the same here as when dealing with laptops and desktops.
Apps Not Loading
Many times after a user purchases an app or accesses a free application, the app does not 
appear to load and function. The following are some possible solutions:
■
■
Close the problematic application and all other applications and start the process of 
opening the application anew. This process will be unique to the device. If you find the 
application to be missing when you attempt to restart it, download the app again.
■
■
Restart the device. When the device has started, if you find the application to be miss-
ing, download the app again.
■
■
Reauthorize the device. This means unauthorize the device to use the app and then 
authorize it again. This process will be unique to the device.
■
■
Uninstall the app and then reinstall it.
Slow Performance
Many of the causes of slow performance in mobile devices are the same as the causes of 
slow performance in desktop machines. For the purposes of this discussion, I will focus on 
performance that deteriorates after being acceptable as opposed to system performance that 

4.5 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot and Repair Common Mobile Device 
271
is poor from the outset (which could be a matter of insufficient resources such as RAM). 
Here is a list of possibilities:
■
■
The first thing to check is the presence of a virus. If the system seems to have an 
overabundance of disk activity, scan it for viruses, using a virus program that resides 
externally on a CD/DVD or memory stick.
■
■
Defragment the hard drive or, in the case of a smartphone, the memory. The more 
fragmented the storage is, the slower the access will be.
■
■
Check the space on the hard drive or memory. When the partition or volume where the 
operating system is located becomes full, performance will suffer. This is why it is a 
good idea to store data and applications on a different partition from that holding the 
system files.
■
■
Ensure the latest updates are installed. In many cases, updates help to solve perfor-
mance problems, so make sure they are current.
Some specific tips for smartphones are as follows:
■
■
Kill background apps that may be running.
■
■
Keep all apps up to date.
■
■
Turn off background data services such as Facebook, Twitter, and WeatherBug.
■
■
On an Android device, turn off Google Services.
Unable to Decrypt Email
Some mobile devices have trouble decrypting encrypted emails either because the selected 
encryption mechanism does not work using the device’s browser or because the device 
­cannot locate the certificate and corresponding key required to decrypt the message. Some 
vendors, such as Trend Micro, have simply chosen to not support any mobile browsers 
because of the large number in existence. In a case such as this, you will receive a message 
such as this:
Forward this email to m@zd.trendmicro.com and receive URLs to view 
the message on mobile devices.
Then an intermediate device will decrypt the email and send you a link, which is valid 
for a short period of time for you to view the email.
In other cases, the issue is the inability to locate the required certificate and key. The 
solution could be as simple as inserting a smart card containing the key. In other cases, 
you may need to install or reinstall the certificate and corresponding private key required 
to decrypt the messages. In other cases, it is an issue that can be solved by applying an 
operating system patch. Just one more reason for keeping all operating systems fully 
updated!
Finally, sometimes S/MIME is not enabled in the device. Many systems, such as 
BlackBerry, use S/MIME for encryption, and the receiving device must have this 
enabled.

272 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
Extremely Short Battery Life
There are a number of reasons that battery life is not what it should be in a mobile device. 
The following are some things that can drain a good battery:
■
■
Leaving display brightness too high
■
■
Constantly enabled wireless connections
■
■
Constantly enabled location services
■
■
Constantly enabled background data services
You may detect a trend in this list, and that is leaving things on! All of those services eat 
the battery. Setting the device to Airplane mode stops all of that battery sucking. Yes, you 
may have to manually turn it on to check email, but the convenience is eating the battery.
In other cases, the battery is nearing the end of its life. If using Airplane mode doesn’t 
help, it’s probably time for a new battery. All batteries have a limited number of recharges 
in them. Check the documentation of the device for guidance on this. If the battery does 
suddenly die shortly after a charge, it’s a red flag.
Overheating
When a mobile device is getting hot (and I’m talking very hot here, not just warm), it can be 
the battery. If you find that is the source of the heat, replace the battery. Beyond that, some 
issues that can cause or contribute to overheating are as follows:
■
■
Excessive gaming
■
■
Excessive browsing
■
■
Using the device while charging the device
On a laptop, excessive heat can indicate that the vents are blocked. It also can be a case 
of running too many things at once. Clean vents often and ensure they are not blocked 
when the device is on. Laptops need a hard, even surface so the vents can expel heat. This is 
why running a device on your lap produces so much heat.
Frozen System
Mobile devices can lock and become unresponsive just like desktop systems can and may 
do so for some the same reasons. But they have their own special set of issues that can 
cause this. The following are some things that you can try to prevent and/or unfreeze a 
system:
■
■
Clear the application memory cache, which can be overloaded. Closing all applications 
or restarting the device can solve this issue.
■
■
If the lockup occurred during texting, enable Airplane mode and then disable Airplane 
mode to force the device to reestablish the connection.
Many of the same issues that cause slow performance also cause lockups. Think of 
­lockups as the next step after slowness. Therefore, some of the same tactics discussed in  
the section “Slow Performance” apply here as well.

No Sound from Speakers
When no sound is coming from the speakers of a device, start by checking the obvious.
■
■
Is the volume on the device turned down?
■
■
Is the device set on vibrate or to “no sound”?
If the obvious has been checked, then consider when this issue arises. If it arises only 
when accessing certain sites or when using certain apps, it’s an issue with either site com-
patibility or with the application. In some cases, only taking out the battery and putting it 
back in (or using a function on the device that does the same) will solve an issue with an 
application.
If it occurs at all times, then try the following approaches:
■
■
Refresh the device (saves your data but not your apps).
■
■
Reset the device to factory defaults (back up all data!).
■
■
Check for any updates you may have missed.
GPS Not Functioning
When location services do not appear to be working (these are the services that make the 
GPS feature work), keep the following principles in mind:
■
■
Make sure it’s on!
■
■
Keep in mind it always works best outdoors rather than indoors.
■
■
Check for Internet access. If you don’t have that, you won’t have GPS services.
■
■
The first time you use the GPS service, it will take longer because it must find the GPS 
location.
■
■
As always, the first thing to try is restarting he device.
The GPS performance on some mobile devices can also be affected by the position of 
your hand on the device. If your hand covers the antenna used for GPS, performance can 
be negatively affected. It also has been reported that certain UV-protected windshields can 
block GPS.
Swollen Battery
Just as swollen capacitors are a bad thing, so are swollen batteries. A swollen battery 
occurs when the battery’s cells are overcharged because lithium-ion batteries react unfavor-
ably to overcharging. When you encounter a swollen battery, the only solution is to replace 
it. But you should practice the following safe battery handling procedures when dealing 
with swollen batteries:
■
■
Be careful not to puncture a swollen battery. The casing is under stress from the built-
up gasses within.
■
■
If the swollen state makes the battery difficult to remove, take the device to an expert 
for removal.

274 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
■
■
If you are able to safely remove the swollen battery, store it in a safe cool container and 
take it to an authorized acceptance center. Do not throw it in the trash!
To avoid a swollen battery altogether, follow the guidelines in the section “Extremely 
Short Battery Life” to extend the life of batteries.
Disassembling Processes for Proper Reassembly
Disassembling a laptop in such a way that you end up with no leftover parts after the reas-
sembly can be more of a challenge than with desktop machines. This section discusses best 
practices for this process.
Document and Label Cable and Screw Locations
With a desktop computer there is often plenty of empty space in the case. In a laptop, space 
is at a premium, and because of that, every screw is crucial! To avoid playing a guessing 
game about which screw goes where, you should create a map that tells you not only where 
each screw goes (and organize the screws by whatever naming convention you choose) but 
also where each cable plugs in. You should create this map as you disassemble the laptop 
and follow it carefully when reassembling it. Taking photos with your phone as you work 
can also suffice.
Organize Parts
As you disassemble the device, organize the parts in such a way that you can reverse your 
steps when it comes time to reassemble the laptop. Keep screws of the same type together 
and be careful about making assumptions about screws that appear to be the same kind. 
Keep all screws that hold a particular component in place together in the same place, 
perhaps in a cup or on a paper plate.
Another helpful idea is to maintain the parts in the same sequence in which they were 
taken off the laptop. This will help you remember which part must go back on before 
another, which may not be as obvious as you think when the time comes to put the laptop 
back together.
Refer to Manufacturer Resources
There is no better source of information about the idiosyncrasies of disassembling and 
reassembling a particular laptop model than the manufacturer documentation. No, it’s not 
cheating to look at that! Each model’s documentation has certain small tips that can save 
much time and grief.
Use Appropriate Hand Tools
Mobile device tools were discussed earlier in this chapter. The important message beyond 
what is provided there is to use the correct tools. If you render a screw useless by trying to 
take it out with the wrong kind of screwdriver, you will be wishing you had just bought the 
correct tool.

problems. This section will give you some general guidelines and common printing solu-
tions to resolve printing problems. The topics addressed in exam objective 4.6 include the 
following:

Common symptoms

Common Symptoms
There is no single shared device in the network that more users come in contact with and 
use every day than the printer. You may have to troubleshoot the common symptoms in this 
section on a daily basis, depending on your environment. Your ability to get a down printer 
working will make you more valuable to your employer.
Streaks
With laser printers, streaks usually indicate that the fuser is not fusing the toner properly 
on the paper. It could also be that the incorrect paper is being used. In laser printers, you 
can sometimes tell the printer that you are using a heavier paper. For dot matrix, you can 
adjust the platen for thicker paper.
If you can pick up a sheet from a laser printer, run your thumb across it, and have 
the image come off on your thumb, you have a fuser problem. The fuser isn’t heating the 
toner and fusing it onto the paper. This could be caused by a number of things—but all 
of them can be taken care of with a fuser replacement. For example, if the halogen light 

276 
Chapter 4 ■ Hardware and Network Troubleshooting 
inside the heating roller has burned out, that will cause the problem. The solution is to 
replace the fuser. The fuser can be replaced with a rebuilt unit, if you prefer. Rebuilt 
fusers are almost as good as new fusers, and some even come with guarantees. Plus, they 
cost less.  
 The whole fuser may not need to be replaced. You can order fuser compo-
nents from parts suppliers and then rebuild them. For example, if the fuser 
has a bad lamp, you can order a lamp and replace it in the fuser. 
 Another, similar problem happens when small areas of smudging repeat themselves 
down the page. Dents or cold spots in the fuser heat roller cause this problem. The only 
solution is to replace either the fuser assembly or the heat roller. 
 If an ink cartridge becomes damaged or develops a hole, it can put too much ink on 
the page, and the letters will smear. In this case, the solution is to replace the ink cartridge. 
(However, a small amount of smearing is normal if the pages are laid on top of each other 
immediately after printing.) Because damage is possible in the process, you need to be 
careful when refi lling cartridges, and many manufacturers do not suggest using refi lled car-
tridges at all. 
 With inkjet or dot-matrix printers, streaks can mean the printhead needs cleaning. If 
cleaning doesn’t help, try replacing the cartridge (inkjet) or the ribbon (dot matrix). 
 Faded Prints 
 In laser printers, faded output usually indicates that the toner cartridge is just about empty. 
You can usually remove it, shake it, and replace it and then get a bit more life out of it 
before it is completely empty, but it is a signal that you are near the end. 
 Another possibility is that the ink cartridge has dried out from lack of use. That’s why 
the manufacturers include a small suction pump inside the printer that primes the ink 
cartridge before each print cycle. If this priming pump is broken or malfunctioning, this 
problem will manifest itself, and the pump will need to be replaced. 
 For dot-matrix printers, faded printing means you need to replace the ribbon, which is 
the source of ink in those printer types. 
 Ghost Images 
 A problem unique to laser printers,  ghosting , means you can see light images of previously 
printed pages on the current page. This is caused by one of two things: bad erasure lamps or 
a broken cleaning blade. If the erasure lamps are bad, the previous electrostatic discharges 
aren’t completely wiped away. When the electrophotographic (EP) drum rotates toward 
the developing roller, some toner sticks to the slightly discharged areas. A broken cleaning 
blade, on the other hand, causes old toner to build up on the EP drum and consequently 
present itself in the next printed image. 
 Replacing the toner cartridge solves the second problem. Solving the fi rst problem 
involves replacing the erasure lamps in the printer. Because the toner cartridge is the least 

4.6 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Printers with Appropriate Tools 
277
expensive cure, you should try that fi rst. Usually, replacing the toner cartridge will solve the 
problem. If it doesn’t, you’ll then have to replace the erasure lamps. 
 Toner Not Fused to the Paper 
 In laser printers, when the toner does not fuse properly to the paper, it will streak and 
smudge. See the section “Streaks” for more information. 
 Creased Paper 
 Creased paper is a sign of a paper jam inside the printer that, although not grinding the entire 
operation to halt (see the “Paper Jam” section later in this section), is mangling your paper. 
Approach this problem with the same techniques described in the section “Paper Jam.”  
 Paper Not Feeding 
 When the paper is not feeding into the printer, it means the pickup rollers have hardened 
and lost their ability to pick up the paper. Replacing these rollers usually fi xes the problem. 
 In some cases, it’s not the rollers but the paper-feed sensor. It is designed to tell the 
printer when it is out of paper. Always try cleaning the sensor fi rst before replacing it. High 
humidity can also cause the paper to not feed properly. 
 Paper Jam 
 Laser printers today run at copier speeds. As a result, their most common problem is paper 
jams. Paper can get jammed in a printer for several reasons. First, feed jams happen when the 
paper-feed rollers get worn. The solution to this problem is easy: replace the worn rollers.  
 If your paper-feed jams are caused by worn pickup rollers, there is some-
thing you can do to get your printer working while you’re waiting for the 
replacement pickup rollers. Scuff the feed rollers with a pot scrubber pad 
(or something similar) to roughen up the feed rollers. This trick works only 
once. After that, the rollers aren’t thick enough to touch the paper. 
 Another cause of feed jams is related to the drive of the pickup roller. The drive gear (or 
clutch) may be broken or have teeth missing. Again, the solution is to replace it. To deter-
mine whether the problem is a broken gear or worn rollers, print a test page, but leave the 
paper tray out. Look into the paper-feed opening with a fl ashlight, and see whether the 
paper pickup rollers are turning evenly and don’t skip. If they turn evenly, the problem is 
more than likely worn rollers. 
 Worn exit rollers can also cause paper jams. These rollers guide the paper out of the 
printer into the paper-receiving tray. If they’re worn or damaged, the paper may catch on its 
way out of the printer. These types of jams are characterized by a paper jam that occurs just 
as the paper is getting to the exit rollers. If the paper jams, open the rear door and see where 
the paper is. If the paper is close to the exit roller, the exit rollers are probably the problem. 

278 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
The solution is to replace all the exit rollers. You must replace all of them at the same 
time, because even one worn exit roller can cause the paper to jam. Besides, they’re inex-
pensive. Don’t be cheap and skimp on these parts if you need to have them replaced.
Paper jams can be the fault of the paper. If your printer consistently tries to feed multiple 
pages into the printer, the paper isn’t dry enough. If you live in an area with high humidity, 
this could be a problem. Some solutions are pretty far-out but may work (such as keeping 
the paper in a Tupperware-type airtight container or microwaving it to remove moisture). 
The best all-around solution, however, is humidity control and keeping the paper wrapped 
until it’s needed. Keep the humidity around 50 percent or lower (but greater than 25 per-
cent if you can in order to avoid problems with electrostatic discharge). Poor paper quality 
can also cause this problem.
Finally, a metal, grounded strip called the static eliminator strip inside the printer drains 
the corona charge away from the paper after it has been used to transfer toner from the EP 
cartridge. If that strip is missing, broken, or damaged, the charge will remain on the paper 
and may cause it to stick to the EP cartridge, causing a jam. If the paper jams after reaching 
the corona assembly, this may be the cause.
No Connectivity
A number of software issues can cause printer problems. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell 
exactly where in the process the communication between the computer and the printer is 
breaking down. It could be that you are not establishing a connection with the printer, or it 
could be an incorrect setting or driver is preventing successful printing.
To determine whether it is a connectivity problem, ping the IP address of the printer. If 
you cannot ping the printer by IP address, that problem must be solved or all other trouble-
shooting of settings and drivers will be wasted effort. Use this simple test to rule out a net-
work connectivity problem.
If the printer is connected directly to the computer (locally connected), then check the 
cables. If they check out, ensure that the printer port is enabled and that the correct driver 
for the printer is installed.
Garbled Characters on Paper
Many problems with a printer that won’t work with the operating system or that prints the 
wrong characters can be traced to problems with its software. Computers and printers can’t 
talk to each other by themselves. They need interface software to translate software com-
mands into commands the printer can understand.
For a printer to work with a particular operating system, a driver must be installed 
for it. This driver specifies the page description language (PDL) the printer understands, 
as well as information about the printer’s characteristics (paper trays, maximum resolu-
tion, and so on). For laser printers, there are two popular PDLs: Adobe PostScript (PS) 
and Hewlett-Packard Printer Control Language (PCL). Almost all laser printers use one or 
both of these.
If the wrong printer driver is selected, the computer will send commands in the wrong 
language. If that occurs, the printer will print several pages of garbage (even if only one 

4.6 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Printers with Appropriate Tools 
279  
page of information was sent). This “garbage” isn’t garbage at all, but the printer PDL 
commands printed literally as text instead of being interpreted as control commands.
Vertical Lines on Page
Vertical lines can appear in either of two forms.
Vertical Black Lines on the Page
With laser printers, a groove or scratch in the EP drum can cause the problem of verti-
cal black lines running down all or part of the page. Because a scratch is lower than the 
surface, it doesn’t receive as much (if any) of a charge as the other areas. The result is that 
toner sticks to it as though it were discharged. Because the groove may go around the cir-
cumference of the drum, the line may go all the way down the page.
Another possible cause of vertical black lines is a dirty charge corona wire. A dirty 
charge corona wire prevents a sufficient charge from being placed on the EP drum. Because 
the EP drum has almost zero charge, toner sticks to the areas that correspond to the dirty 
areas on the charge corona wire.
The solution to the first problem is, as always, to replace the toner cartridge (or EP 
drum, if your printer uses a separate EP drum and toner). You can also solve the second 
problem with a new toner cartridge, but in this case that would be an extreme solution. It’s 
easier to clean the charge corona with the brush supplied with the cartridge.
When dealing with inkjet printers, vertical black lines on the page can mean the print 
head needs cleaning or that the print cartridge needs to be replaced.
Vertical White Lines on the Page
With laser printers, vertical white lines running down all or part of the page are relatively 
common problems on older printers, especially ones that see little maintenance. They’re 
caused by foreign matter (more than likely toner) caught on the transfer corona wire. The 
dirty spots keep the toner from being transmitted to the paper (at those locations, that is), 
with the result that streaks form as the paper progresses past the transfer corona wire.
The solution is to clean the corona wires. Some printers come with a small corona-wire 
brush to help in this procedure. To use it, remove the toner cartridge and run the brush in 
the charge corona groove on top of the toner cartridge. Replace the cartridge and use the 
brush to brush away any foreign deposits on the transfer corona. Be sure to put it back in 
its holder when you’re finished.
For inkjet printers, clean the print head first (or run the built-in cleaning cycle) and then 
try replacing the cartridge. This behavior is usually because of dust or debris.
Backed-Up Print Queue
Sometimes the printer will not print and all attempts to delete print jobs or clear the 
print queue fail. It’s almost as if the printer is just frozen. When this occurs, the best 
thing to do is restart the print spooler service on the computer that is acting as the 
print server. Unfortunately, all users will have to resend their print jobs after this, but 
at least the printer will be functional again.

280 
Chapter 4  ■  Hardware and Network Troubleshooting   
Low Memory Errors
A printer can have several types of memory errors. The most common is insufficient 
memory to print the page. Sometimes you can circumvent this problem by doing any of the 
following:
■
■
Turn off the printer to flush out its RAM and then turn it back on and try again.
■
■
Print at a lower resolution. (Adjust this setting in the printer’s properties in Windows.)
■
■
Change the page being printed so it’s less complex.
■
■
Try a different printer driver if your printer supports more than one PDL. (For exam-
ple, try switching from PostScript to PCL, or vice versa.) Doing so involves installing 
another printer driver.
■
■
Upgrade the memory, if the printer allows.
Access Denied
Printers are considered resources just like files and folders, and as such can have permis-
sions attached to them. When a user receives an access denied message, the user lacks the 
print permission. Typically, a printer that has been shared will automatically give all users 
the print permission, but when permissions have been employed to control which users can 
print to a particular printer, that default has been altered.
When checking permissions, keep in mind that in Windows, users may have permis-
sions derived from their personal account and from groups of which they are a member. 
You must ensure that users have not been explicitly denied print permission through their 
accounts or through any groups of which they are members. A single Deny will prevent 
them from printing, regardless of what other permissions they may have to the printer.
Also, print availability or print priority can affect access to the printer. Print availability 
is used to permit certain users to print only during certain times. With print priority, print 
jobs from certain users or groups are assigned a higher priority than other users or groups. 
These settings, usually set by an administrator, can prevent or delay successful printing.
Printer Will Not Print
If your printer isn’t spitting out print jobs, it may be a good idea to print a test page and see 
whether that works. The test page information is stored in the printer’s memory, so there’s 
no formatting or translating of jobs required. It’s simply a test to make sure your printer 
hears your computer. In addition to the Windows Print Test Page button, try the built-in 
test function on the printer if your printer has one. While the Windows test verifies driver 
and connectivity, testing or printing at the print device tests the device itself.
When you install a printer, one of the last questions it asks you is if you want to print 
a test page. If there’s any question, go ahead and do it. If the printer is already installed, 
you can print a test page from the printer Properties window. Just click the Print Test Page 
button and it should work. If nothing happens, double-check your connections and stop 
and restart the print spooler. If garbage prints, there is likely a problem with the printer’s 
memory or the print driver.

4.6 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Printers with Appropriate Tools 
281  
In many cases, a printer will not print because either the printer is not on, it doesn’t have 
power, or the print queue is stopped or paused. Printing a test page will identify these issues 
before they affect users.
Color Prints in Wrong Print Color
Incorrect colors or colors that are faint or washed out are often the result of a dirty print head, 
although it can also mean that one of the colors is running out. Head cleaning is a crucial oper-
ation that should be carried out at least once a month under normal usage. This is a procedure 
carried out in the properties or preferences of the printer (which may vary by printer).
You should not perform this procedure if the ink cartridges are low because it takes ink 
to do this. Check that first and, if they are low, replace any cartridges that need it and then 
run the head-cleaning procedure.
Unable to Install Printer
Installing a printer and attaching to a shared printer are two different operations in the 
Windows environment. Users with no administrative rights can attach to an existing shared 
printer, but installing a printer on the machine (which means that machine will function as 
the print server for that device) requires administrative permissions in the local machine. 
When an inability to install occurs, verify that you are logged into the computer with an 
administrator account.
Error Codes
Many laser printers include LCDs for interaction with the printer. When error codes 
appear, refer to the manufacturer’s manuals or website for information on how to interpret 
the codes and solve the problem causing them.
Printing Blank Pages
When an inkjet printer prints blank pages, the issue is usually a clogged print head. When 
these types of printers sit for an extended period without use, the ink that may be in the 
print head dries out, clogging the head. Consequently, when you print, everything else in the 
process occurs correctly, but the ink cannot get through the clogged head and you get no ink 
on the paper. The solution is to clean the head and replace any cartridges that may be low.
Another reason for this can be an incorrect print driver. This is not a typical symptom of 
a bad driver, but can still be the solution in some printers. Try updating and/or download-
ing the driver if clogged ink cartridges are not the issue.
If it is a laser printer, check the following items:
■
■
Empty toner cartridge
■
■
Malfunctioning laser shutter (prevents creation of image in the drum)
■
■
No voltage to the transfer roller (prevents transfer of toner from the drum to the paper)
■
■
No bias charge on the drum (prevents transfer of toner to the drum)
■
■
Defective laser scanner cable (prevents image creation on the drum)

282 
Chapter 4 ■ Hardware and Network Troubleshooting 
 No Image on Printer Display 
 When the display located on the physical printer is blank, it may be a formatter failure. 
While the failure of a formatter is not common, the solution, replacing the formatter, is 
not diffi cult. The formatter assembly is a self-contained unit that can be purchased and 
installed in the place of the bad formatter. 
 In some cases, the display may go into a sleep mode when not in use. If this is the 
case, touching the screen (if it is touchscreen) may wake it up. Make sure there is power 
to the unit, and if there is not, check the power supply. Finally, some screens have a 
brightness setting that may be set so low you can’t read it, so consider that possibility 
as well.  
 Tools 
 Tools are available in the crusade to keep the printers working. This section discusses some 
of the most important tools that should be present in your toolkit. 
 Maintenance Kit 
 For many printers, the scheduled maintenance includes installing maintenance kits. 
Maintenance kits typically include components designed to wear out. For example, for 
laser printers, they contain a fuser, transfer roller, pickup rollers (for the trays), separation 
rollers, and feed rollers. For dot-matrix or inkjet printers, the components in the kit will be 
different. 
 After installing the maintenance kit, you need to reset the maintenance 
counter as explained in the vendor’s documentation. 
 Toner Vacuum 
 Sometimes accidents occur and toner gets spilled on the fl oor or carpet. You should never 
vacuum this up with a regular household vacuum cleaner. Toner particles may create static-
electric charges when they rub against other particles or the interior of the vacuum or its 
hoses because of their electrostatic properties. If there is dust in the vacuum, static dis-
charge can ignite it and create a small explosion. This may damage the vacuum cleaner or, 
worse, start a fi re. 
 For spills into the printer, a special type of vacuum cleaner with an electrically conduc-
tive hose and a high-effi ciency (HEPA) fi lter may be needed for effective cleaning. These are 
called electrostatic discharge-safe (ESD-safe) or toner vacuums. Similar vacuums should be 
used for cleaning up larger toner spills. 
 Compressed Air 
 Although compressed air is a good approach for cleaning out the inside of the case of a 
desktop computer, it’s generally not a good idea to use compressed air to clean a printer. 

4.6 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Printers with Appropriate Tools 
283  
Most manufacturers warn against this. If you insist on using compressed air, blow the dust 
out of the printer and not into it. A lint-free cloth is the best for removing dust when you 
can get at it.
Printer Spooler
The print spooler service controls the print queue. This service can be stopped and 
started to solve many software-related problems. Locate this service in the Services 
console and right-click it; you can first start and then stop the service. This can also 
be done at the command line using the net stop spooler and net start spooler 
commands.

The previous chapters mostly focused on the hardware and physi-
cal elements of the computing environment. You looked at the 
hardware that makes up a personal computer’s and laptop’s phys-
ical components, as well as networking, printers, and operational procedures. That completes 
the coverage of the topics on the 220-901 exam, and this chapter marks a departure from that.
In this chapter, the focus is on operating systems (OSs). To be specific, the focus is on 
Microsoft Windows operating systems, which you must know well for the 220-902 certifi-
cation exam.
1.1 Compare and Contrast Various 
Features and Requirements of Microsoft 
Operating Systems (Windows Vista, 
Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1)
While there are many operating systems available, this exam asks that you know the 
intricacies of only four that run on the personal computer, and all four are versions of 
Microsoft Windows: Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1.
This section contains numerous tables because of the nature of the information that it 
covers. It is imperative that you be familiar with Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 
8, and Windows 8.1. Make certain you understand the features available in each of these 
versions of Windows as well as the editions that were made available for each of them. The 
topics covered in this chapter are as follows:

Upgrade paths
Features
There are a number of features that separate one operating system—and even one edition 
of an operating system—from another. These features range from utilities that may or may 
not be present, up to whether the operating system is 32-bit or 64-bit. The sections that fol-
low examine these features.

294 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
32-bit vs. 64-bit
The primary difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is the amount of data the processor 
(CPU) is able to process effectively. To run a 64-bit version of the operating system, you 
must have a 64-bit processor. To find out whether you are running the 32-bit or 64-bit 
version of Windows, you can look at the information shown in the System applet in the 
Control Panel in any of the Windows versions you need to know for this exam.
Aero, Gadgets, User Account Control, BitLocker, Shadow Copy, 
System Restore, Ready Boost, Sidebar, Compatibility Mode, 
Virtual XP Mode, Easy Transfer, Administrative Tools, Defender, 
Windows Firewall, Security Center, Event Viewer
There are a number of operating system features listed for this objective. Table 5.1 
describes each of the features.
A Note About Procedures in This Chapter
Throughout this chapter are procedures that describe the path to locate a tool or utility. 
There are several views in which the Control Panel (which is frequently involved in these 
paths) can be set (Large Icons, Small Icons, Category View, and so on). Because you 
should be familiar with these views, I have used both views in the paths. In each proce-
dure that had Control Panel tools as part of the path, I will tell you the view setting of  
Control Panel required for that path.
Ta b l e  5 .1    Windows features
Feature
Significance
Aero
The Aero interface offers a glass design that includes translucent win-
dows. It was new with Windows Vista.
Gadgets
These are mini programs, introduced with Windows Vista, that can be 
placed on the desktop (Windows 7) or on the Sidebar (Windows Vista), 
allowing them to run quickly and letting you personalize the PC (clock, 
weather, and so on). Windows 7 renamed these Windows Desktop Gad-
gets (right-click the desktop and click Gadgets in the context menu; then 
double-click the one you want to add).
In 2011, Microsoft announced it is no longer supporting the development 
or uploading of new gadgets.
Sidebar
Windows Vista had an area known as the Sidebar designed for gad-
gets that could be placed on the desktop. Windows 7 did away with the 
Sidebar, and the gadgets are now placed directly on the desktop. Inter-
estingly enough, though, sidebar.exe is the program that runs if any 
gadgets are installed.

295
Feature
Significance
User Account 
Control (UAC)
The UAC is intended to prevent unintentional or unauthorized changes to 
the computer by either prompting for permission to continue or requir-
ing the administrator password before continuing. Changes to this from 
Windows Vista allow you to control how strict UAC intercedes.
BitLocker
What CompTIA calls BitLocker allows you to use drive encryption to pro-
tect files—including those needed for startup and logon. This is available 
with the Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and Win-
dows 7 and the Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows 8 and 8.1.
For removable drives, BitLocker To Go provides the same encryption tech-
nology to help prevent unauthorized access to the files stored on them.
Shadow Copy
The Volume Shadow Copy Service creates copies that you can recover 
from should a file be accidentally deleted or overwritten. Windows 7 
adds to what Vista included by adding an interface for configuring stor-
age used by volume shadow copies.
ReadyBoost
This feature allows you to use free space on a removable drive to speed 
up a system by caching content and is used when you are running low 
on available memory. In Windows 7, it can work with a USB drive, flash 
memory, SD card, or CompactFlash. Up to eight devices can employ 
ReadyBoost in Windows 7 (each needing a minimum of 256 MB of free 
space). ReadyBoost is configured from the ReadyBoost tab of the proper-
ties dialog box for the removable media device.
Compatibility 
Mode
Program Compatibility is included with Windows 7 to configure pro-
grams to believe they are running with an older version of Windows. 
Using Category view, choose Start  Control Panel  Programs and then 
click Run Programs Made For Previous Versions Of Windows.
Virtual XP 
Mode
Included with Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate as well 
as Windows 8 is the ability to run applications in Windows XP Mode 
(XPM). This is a virtual client (emulating Windows XP Professional with 
Service Pack 3), which requires that you also download and install Win-
dows Virtual PC to use. This can be downloaded from the Windows Vir-
tual PC site at www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/.
You should have 2 GB RAM and 15 GB hard drive space for each virtual 
Windows instance.
Easy Transfer
This feature can be used to migrate a few accounts from one OS to 
another (for a large number of accounts, Microsoft recommends using 
the User State Migration Tool [USMT]). It transfers both the accounts and 
the files and settings of the user.
When transferring to Windows 7, you can download a version of Win-
dows Easy Transfer in either the 32-bit or 64-bit version for Windows 
Vista from www.microsoft.com/downloads.

Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Four items are not shown in Table 5.1 because they are large enough to warrant more 
discussion than the table allows: System Restore, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, and 
File Structure/Paths. Administrative Tools is a sizable portion of objective 1.4 and is not 
covered here to avoid needless repetition. The others are covered next.
System Restore
System Restore appears in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1. It 
allows you to restore the system to a previous point in time. You can access this feature 
from Start  All Programs  Accessories  System Tools  System Restore to roll back as 
well as to create a restore point.
To create a restore point, you should access the System Protection tab of the System 
Properties dialog box. In Windows 7, that path using Category View is Start  Control 
Panel  System And Security  System Protection  System Restore. In Windows Vista, 
the path is Start  All Programs  Maintenance  Backup And Restore Center  Create A 
Restore Point Or Change Settings  System Properties.
In Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, the path to System Restore is a bit more involved. Start 
by placing the cursor in the bottom-right corner of the screen and then click the Settings 
(gear) icon when the items appear on the right side of the screen. When another menu 
appears beneath that, select Change PC Settings.
You will then be presented with a menu on the left side of the screen; select Update 
And Recovery from this menu. When the submenu appears, select Recovery. At the next 
page, select Advanced Startup. This will restart the computer, and then you will land at 
the Advanced Startup screen. In the next three screens, select, in order, Troubleshooting, 
Advanced Options, and then System Restore. Once you’ve accessed System Restore, using it 
is no different from using it in Windows 7.
Event Viewer
Windows employs comprehensive error and informational logging routines. Every pro-
gram and process theoretically could have its own logging utility, but Microsoft has come 
up with a rather slick utility, Event Viewer, which, through log files, tracks all events on a 
Feature
Significance
Windows 
Firewall
Windows 7, as well as Windows Vista and Windows 8, incorporates Windows 
Firewall, which can be used to stop incoming and outgoing traffic. There are 
only three basic settings: On, Off, and Block All Incoming Connections.
Security Center
Rolled into the Action Center in Windows 7, this interface shows the sta-
tus of, and allows you to configure, the firewall, Windows Update, virus 
protection, spyware and unwanted software protection, Internet security 
settings, UAC, and network access protection.
Defender
A free antimalware program included in Windows Vista, Windows 7, 
Windows 8, and Windows 8.1. Originally an antispyware program, in 
Windows 8 it was upgraded to include antivirus as well.

particular Windows computer. Normally, though, you must be an administrator or a mem-
ber of the Administrators group to have access to Event Viewer.
The process for starting Event Viewer differs based on the operating system you are run-
ning, but always log in as an administrator (or equivalent). With Windows 7, using Small 
or Large icons view, choose Start  Control Panel  Administrative Tools  Event Viewer; 
on earlier systems, choose Start  Programs  Administrative Tools  Event Viewer (or you 
can always right-click the Computer desktop icon and choose Manage  Event Viewer). 
In the resulting window (shown in Figure 5.1), you can view the System, Application, and 
Security log files. If you are running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1, you will 
also see log files available for Setup and Forwarded Events.

other computers.
These log files can give a general indication of a Windows computer’s health.

298 
Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
 To access Event Viewer in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, just type  event viewer in the 
desktop Search box, and when the option for opening Event Viewer appears, select it. 
 One situation that does occur with Event Viewer is that the log fi les get full. Although 
this isn’t really a problem, it can make viewing log fi les confusing because there are so many 
entries. Even though each event is time- and date-stamped, you should clear Event Viewer 
every so often. To do this, open Event Viewer, and in Windows 7, right-click the log, choose 
Properties, and click the Clear Log button; in earlier OSs, choose Clear All Events from the 
Log menu. Doing so erases all events in the current log fi le, allowing you to see new events 
more easily when they occur. You can set maximum log size by right-clicking the log and 
choosing Properties. By default, when a log fi lls to its maximum size, old entries are deleted 
in fi rst in, fi rst out (FIFO) order. Clearing the log, setting maximum log size, and setting how 
the log is handled when full are done in the Log Properties dialog, as shown in Figure  5.2 . 
 F I g u r E 5 . 2   Log Properties dialog 
 You can save the log files before erasing them. The saved files can be 
burned to a CD or DVD for future reference. Often, you are required to 
save the files to CD or DVD if you are working in a company that adheres to 
strict regulatory standards. 

 In addition to just erasing logs, you can confi gure three different settings for what you 
want to occur when the fi le does reach its maximum size. The fi rst option is Overwrite 
Events As Needed (Oldest Events First), which replaces the older events with the new 
entries. The second option is Archive The Log When Full, Do Not Overwrite Events, which 
will create another log fi le as soon as the current one runs out of space. The third option, 
Do Not Overwrite Events (Clear Logs Manually), will not record any additional events 
once the fi le is full. 
 File Structures and Paths 
 In the Windows environment, users are required to authenticate in some way (even if it is 
just as Guest) before gaining access to a user account. The operating system then uses a 
user profi le to deliver the computer settings (theme, screen saver, and so on) that are confi g-
ured for them. It is important to realize that the user account (which authenticates the user) 
and the user profi le (which holds their settings) are two separate things—one is needed 
before the other. 
 Part of the user profi le involves allowing each user to have a set of fi les that are specifi c 
to them. The same set of folders is automatically created for each user. While the address 
bar for a user often simply shows the location as  edulaney , in reality the folder being 
viewed is beneath   %systemdrive%  \Users\ (usually  C:\Users\ ). 
 When settings need to apply to everyone who uses the machine, they can be 
placed in All Users instead of being copied beneath each user’s folder set.  
 Whereas user fi les are placed in folders specifi c to them, system fi les are those used by 
the operating system and are used by all users. In all the operating systems you need to 
know for the exam, these fi les are beneath   %systemroot%  , and many, such as  System32 , 
appear in the default path. A number of fi les reside in this directory, with most residing in 
subdirectories. 
 
 The variable   systemroot  (referenced as   %systemroot%  ) is usually set to 
 C:\Windows in the operating systems this exam focuses on. Because it is a 
variable, it can be changed to other values as well. 
 Temporary fi les are written to a system on an almost nonstop basis. The purpose behind 
these fi les is to hold any information that is needed for only a short time. In addition to 
temporary fi les used for print queues, you have cache from Internet sites and many other 
programs. You can manually pick fi les to delete, but one of the simplest solutions is to 
choose Properties for a drive and then click the General tab. A command button for the 
Disk Cleanup utility will appear, which you can use to delete most common temporary 
fi les, including the following:

Catalog files for the Content Indexer
The Program Files directory, beneath %systemdrive% (usually C:\), holds the files 
needed for each of the installed applications on a machine. Windows Vista also added a 
Program Data directory, which is hidden by default. It contains the settings needed for 
applications and works like the Local Settings folder did in previous operating systems. 
You will also find that any 64-bit version of Windows has two Program Files directories, 
one for 32-bit programs and another for 64-bit programs. The 32-bit program is called 
Program Files (x86). Keeping these two types of programs separate prevents placing any 
32-bit restriction on 64-bit applications.
Category View vs. Classic View
In most of the operating systems you need to know for this exam, there are two ways of 
viewing the Control Panel and applets—Classic and Category views. CompTIA prefers the 
Classic view, but both will be used throughout the book, with the view used specified with 
each procedure.
Side-by-Side Apps
Windows 8.1 allows you to run a Metro application (also called at various times Tileworld 
apps and modern apps; these are apps you get at the Windows Store) and a desktop applica-
tion at the same time, or up to four Metro apps at the same time, which on other devices 
such as a smartphone may not be possible.
To do this, you must split the screen into two parts, which can be done in two ways.
■
■
If you have a keyboard, you can press Windows+< or Windows+>. The current app’s 
window is now shoved to the left or right side. When you open a second app (from the 
Start screen or the app switcher), it fills the newly opened space.
■
■
You can also drag the left edge of an open app and divide the screen.
Metro UI
In both Windows and Windows 8.1, the user interface is different from earlier versions 
of Windows. The Start menu was removed, and the desktop replaced with a new look 
called Metro. This look resembles the interface of a smartphone or tablet and represents 
the Microsoft vision of a common interface on all devices. Information, settings, and 
applications are housed in tiles. Figure 5.3 shows this look.

F i g u r e  5 . 3     Start screen
This look received negative reaction from most desktop and laptop users and more posi-
tive reaction from those raised on the smartphone interface. Microsoft reacted by changing 
the name of the look to the Microsoft design language. While there were rumors of a return 
to the Start menu, Microsoft made the classic Start menu available in Windows 8.1 but by 
default stuck to its guns and continued to use a Start screen rather than a Start menu. (The 
Start screen is covered in the “Start Screen” section.)
Pinning
Pinning is the process of configuring an icon for a program on the taskbar so that it is eas-
ier to locate. It was introduced in Windows 7 and continued in Windows 8 and Windows 
8.1, and for frequently used applications, it saves navigating through the Start menu or 
Start screen to locate the application.
To pin the program to the taskbar in Windows 7, do one of the following:
■
■
If the program is running, right-click the program’s button on the taskbar (or drag the 
button toward the desktop) to open the program’s Jump List and then click Pin This 
Program To Taskbar.
■
■
If the program is not running, click Start, find the program’s icon, right-click the icon, 
and then click Pin To Taskbar.
To pin the program to the taskbar in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, follow these steps:
1.	
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen and then tap Search. (If you’re using a 
mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and 
then click Search.)
2.	
Enter the name of the program in the search box.

3.	
In the search results, swipe down on the program icon and then tap Pin To Taskbar (If 
you’re using a mouse, right-click Internet Explorer and then click Pin To Taskbar.)
OneDrive
OneDrive is the cloud-based storage feature formerly known as SkyDrive that is Microsoft’s 
answer to other cloud-based storage solutions such as Dropbox. User files that were stored 
in SkyDrive are still there, but in OneDrive. It is available in Windows 7, Windows 8, 
Windows 8.1, and Windows Vista with Service Pack 2 installed.
While the OneDrive desktop app must be installed on earlier versions of Windows 
(Vista, 7, and 8), this functionality is built into Windows 8.1. If you install the desktop 
app on a PC running Windows 8.1, Setup won’t appear. A setting will be installed that lets 
you use Office to work on OneDrive documents with other people at the same time, but no 
other features will be installed.
OneDrive will appear with its own section in File Explorer, as shown in Figure 5.4, and 
you can work with the drive as you would any external drive. Users get 15 GB free and can 
add storage for a monthly fee.
F i g u r e  5 . 4    OneDrive
Windows Store
The Windows Store is a site where you can purchase (in many cases the apps are free) 
Metro-style applications (the official name of the minute is Windows Store apps). It is 

available only to systems that can run these types of applications, which are Windows 8 
and Windows 8.1 or Windows RT.
In Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, in many cases you may encounter a file that requires 
an application that is not present on the device. In the past, you could always right-click 
the file, select Open With, and choose an application or look for one on the Internet. A new 
option is to look in the Windows Store. In many cases, if you do so, you may be presented 
with a choice of options, some of which may be free. It is also possible that from time to 
time you may get notifications that an application you have needed in the past may now be 
available in the Windows Store as well.
Multimonitor Taskbar
Prior to Windows 8, if you set up multiple monitors, you could have the taskbar only on the 
primary monitor, which meant you have go back to that monitor (which may not be where 
you are currently engaged) to access the taskbar. In Windows 8 and 8.1, you can now have 
your taskbar on all monitors by selecting the option in the properties of the taskbar, as 
shown in Figure 5.5.

Charms
Charms are a bit like icons and were introduced with Windows 8 and the Metro UI. 
They are organized on a Charms bar that will appear on the right side of the screen 
when invoked. With the mouse you bring up the bar by moving the cursor into the 
right corner of the desktop; on a touchscreen, you swipe from the right edge toward the 
center.
There are five charms there that are like doors to other lists of options. The five charms 
are Search, Share, Start, Devices, and Settings. The Start charm simply opens the Start 
screen, which replaces the Start menu. Figure 5.6 shows the Charms bar.
F i g u r e  5 .6     Charms bar
Start Screen
One of the more controversial changes that was made to the user interface with 
Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 was removing the Start menu and replacing it with the 
Start screen (shown previously in Figure 5.3). This is the screen that appears to be the 
future of all Windows operating systems, despite the resistance of many desktop and 
laptop users.

PowerShell
PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool that can be used to perform and therefore schedule 
and automate any function that can be done using other tools or the graphical interface. 
Functions are usually performed using cmdlets (pronounced “command-lets”), which are 
specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation.
Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 all include support for 
PowerShell. PowerShell Version 4.0 is integrated into Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, and 
the version of PowerShell in Windows 7 is updated when you add Service Pack 1. The ver-
sion in Windows Vista can be updated only to version 2.0 and only when adding Service 
Pack 2.
Live Sign in
Another change Microsoft made with Windows 8.1 that was not well received was the use 
of Windows Live accounts as the logon account for the operating system. Although it is 
possible to designate a local account as the Administrator account during the installation 
or configuration of the operating system, Microsoft doesn’t make the process simple and 
discourages the use of a local account at several points in the process.
The advantage to using a Microsoft account (this is any account used in the past to 
interact with Microsoft, such as a Hotmail, Xbox, or Office365 account) is that you can 
use to log into all your devices that are set up in this fashion with the account, and you can 
synchronize the desktop and data between the devices to make the experience on all devices 
as consistent as possible. Another advantage is that an account is required to get apps from 
the Windows Store. Moreover, some of the built-in apps require the use of a Windows Live 
account anyway (Calendar, Mail, and People).
The disadvantage is that if you have no Internet access, you can’t be authenticated and 
validated by the Windows Live sign-in services. Luckily, Internet access is required only 
during the first time you log onto the device using your Windows Live account. After that, 
if you attempt to log in with no Internet access, you will be instructed to use the last pass-
word you used to log in. It will be looking for the last Windows Live password that was 
validated.
Action Center
The Action Center is part of the Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 
8.1 operating systems. This tool centralizes a number of security- and maintenance-related 
functions in one place. While the tool began life called the Windows Security Center in 
Windows Vista, its name was changed to Action Center in Windows 7.
Figure 5.7 shows the latest version of the Action Center in Windows 8.1. The Security 
section contains nine different security functions that can be monitored and configured 
from here, while the Maintenance section likewise contains six maintenance-related func-
tions and tools.

Upgrade Paths
There are several things to be aware of regarding upgrade paths, including the difference 
between in-place upgrades, compatibility tools, and the Windows Upgrade Advisor.
Differences Between In-Place Upgrades
One Windows operating system can often be upgraded to another, if compatible. With the 
case of Windows 7, it is even possible to upgrade from one edition of the operating system to 
another. When you are faced with a scenario in which you cannot upgrade, you can always 
do a clean installation. There’s one more thing to consider when evaluating installation meth-
ods. Some methods work only if you’re performing a clean installation and not an upgrade.

Vista.

If there is one thing to be learned from Tables 5.3 through 5.5, it is that Microsoft is 
nothing if not optimistic. For your own sanity, though, I strongly suggest that you always 
take the minimum requirements with a grain of salt. They are minimums. Even the recom-
mended requirements should be considered minimums. Bottom line: Make sure you have 
a good margin between your system’s performance and the minimum requirements listed. 
Always run Windows on more hardware rather than less!

 Certain features in Windows 7 have further hardware requirements that 
are listed here: 
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/

 The easiest way to see whether your current hardware can run Windows 7 is to 
download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor available here:

 Upgrading to Windows Vista 
 With Windows Vista you can upgrade to various versions based on the operating system that 
you are coming from. Table  5.6 lists the upgrade paths for each Windows Vista version based 
on the operating system you are coming from. Those listed as “No” must be clean installations.

 For the exam, recognize that no version of Windows older than Windows 
XP can be upgraded to Windows Vista. 
 Note that Windows Vista Enterprise does not appear in Table  5.6 because it is typically 
done as a clean install. The only “upgrade” possibility with it is that it can be installed over 
Windows Vista Business. Note as well that where “N/A” appears in Table  5.6 , it is always 
possible to do a repair installation or clean installation but not a true upgrade. 
 A clean installation is one that keeps no previous settings and copies over 
or removes the old operating system. An upgrade installation is one that 
keeps previous settings (usually related to accounts and configuration) 
from the older operating system. A repair installation involves keeping the 
same operating system and performing a reinstall of system files. 
 Upgrading to Windows 7 
 If you want to do an upgrade instead of a clean installation, review the upgrade options in Table 
 5.7 (it is worth pointing out again that a “No” does not mean you can’t buy the upgrade version 
of Windows 7 but rather that you can’t keep your fi les, programs, and settings).

Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
 The Enterprise versions play by different rules since they are licensed directly 
from Microsoft. In the case of Windows 7, both Windows Vista Business and 
Windows Vista Enterprise can be upgraded to Windows 7 Enterprise.  
 Those operating systems not listed in Table  5.7 do not include any upgrade options 
to Windows 7 and cannot be done with upgrade packages (you must buy the full 
version of Windows 7). An easy way to remember upgrade options for the exam is that 
you must have at least Windows Vista to be able to upgrade to Windows 7. In the real 
world, the Windows Vista machine should be running Service Pack 1 at a minimum, 
and you can always take an earlier OS and upgrade it to Vista SP1 and then upgrade to 
Windows 7.  
 As of this writing, Service Pack 1 is the latest available for Windows 7, 
Service Pack 2 is the latest available for Windows Vista, the Windows 8.1 
upgrade is the latest for Windows 8, and there is no service pack as yet for 
Windows 8.1. You can find the latest here: 
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/service-packs  
 In the past, all service packs used to be cumulative—meaning you needed to 
load only the last one. Starting with XP SP3, however, all Windows service 
packs released have been incremental, meaning that you must install the 
previous ones before you can install the new one. 
 Microsoft created the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to help with the upgrade to this 
operating system. You can download the advisor from  http://windows.microsoft.com/
upgradeadvisor . It will scan your hardware, devices, and installed programs for any 
known compatibility issues. Once it is fi nished, it will give you advice on how to resolve 
the issues found and recommendations on what to do before you upgrade. The reports are 
divided into three categories: System Requirements, Devices, and Programs. 
 After all incompatibilities have been addressed, the upgrade can be started from an 
installation disc or from a download (preferably to a USB drive). If the setup routine does 
not begin immediately on boot, look for the  setup.exe fi le and run it. When the Install 
Windows page appears, click Install Now. 
 You’ll be asked if you want to get any updates (recommended) and to agree to the license 
agreement. After you’ve done so, choose Upgrade for the installation type and follow the 
steps to walk through the remainder of the installation. I highly recommend that after the 
installation is complete, you run Windows Update to get the latest drivers. 
 New to Windows 7 is the ability at any time to upgrade from one edition of 
the operating system to a higher one (for example, from Home Premium 
to Professional) using the Windows Anytime Upgrade utility in the System 
And Security section of the Control Panel (it can also be accessed by click-
ing the Start button and choosing All Programs; scroll down the list and 
choose Windows Anytime Upgrade). 

Upgrading to Windows 8
With Windows 8 you can upgrade based on the operating system that you are coming from. 
Table 5.8 lists the upgrade paths for each Windows version based on the operating system 
you are coming from. Those listed as “No” must be clean installations.

Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Windows Upgrade OS Advisor
The Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor from Microsoft can be useful in any upgrade pro-
cess. It will check your system, verify that it can run the desired operating system, and give 
you a report of any identified compatibility issues. There are also versions for Windows 7, 
Windows 8, and Windows 8.1.
To begin the upgrade, insert the DVD, and the Setup program should automatically 
begin (if it doesn’t, run setup.exe from the root folder). From the menu that appears, 
choose Install Now and then select Upgrade when the Which Type Of Installation Do You 
Want? screen appears. Answer the prompts to walk through the upgrade.
Booting from the DVD is also possible but recommended only if the method just 
described does not work. When you boot, you will get a message upon startup that says 
Press Any Key To Boot From CD, and at this point you simply press a key. (Don’t worry 
that it is a DVD and not a CD.)
Compatibility Tools
Beyond the Compatibility Mode discussed in the Table 5.1, several other features are avail-
able to enhance the compatibility of the operating system with the applications you are run-
ning. First there is the Windows Compatibility Center, a site you can access that will scan 
your device for compatible device drivers, app updates, and downloads. You just enter the 
name of the program, and it will tell you whether it is supported; if you need a driver or an 
update, it will provide it.
In some cases, it may not be possible to use an application without creating a shim, 
which is a small piece of software that communicates between the unsupported application 
and the operating system. This is done with an Application Compatibility toolkit. There are 
such toolkits for Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1. Their use is 
beyond the scope of this book.
Exam Essentials
Understand version and edition differences of Windows.    For each version of Windows 
(Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1), know how to group the edi-
tions (Home, Professional, and so on) according to similarity and explain how one group 
differs from the other.
Know the system requirements of Windows.    You should know the minimum system 
requirements for Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1.
Understand upgrading.    You should know that an installation overwrites any existing 
files, whereas an upgrade keeps the same data/application files.

1.2 Given a Scenario, Install Windows 
PC Operating Systems Using 
Appropriate Methods
The focus of this objective is on installing and configuring the Windows operating systems 
discussed in the previous section. Some of the topics that CompTIA lists here also appear 
beneath other objectives and they are touched on here only to avoid needless repetition. The 
topics covered in this section include the following:
■
■
Boot methods
■
■
Types of installations
■
■
Partitioning
■
■
Filesystem types/formatting
■
■
Loading alternate third-party drivers when necessary
■
■
Workgroup vs. domain setup
■
■
Time/date/region/language settings
■
■
Driver installation and software and Windows updates
■
■
Factory recovery partition
■
■
Properly formatted boot drive with the correct partitions/format
Boot Methods
You can begin the installation or upgrade process by booting from a number of sources. There are 
eight in particular that CompTIA wants you to be familiar with: USB, CD-ROM, DVD, PXE, 
solid-state or flash drives, NetBoot, external/hot swappable drives, and internal hard drives.
USB
Most systems will allow you to boot from a USB device, but you must often change the 
BIOS settings to look for USB first. Using a large USB drive, you can store all the necessary 
installation files on the one device and save the time of needing to swap media.
CD-ROM
The most commonly used for an attended installation is the CD-ROM/DVD boot (they are 
identical). Since Windows 7 and newer come only on DVD, though, CD-ROM applies to 
older operating systems and not this one.

316 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
DVD
A DVD boot is the most common method of starting an installation.
PXE
Booting the computer from the network without using a local device creates a Preboot 
Execution Environment (PXE). Once it is up, it is common to load the Windows 
Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) into RAM as a stub operating system and install the 
operating system image to the hard drive.
WinPE can be installed onto a bootable CD, USB, or network drive using the copype
.cmd command. This environment can be used in conjunction with a Windows deployment 
from a server for unattended installations.
Solid-State/Flash Drives
If boot files and installation files are located on a solid-state drive or flash drive and the 
device is set to look on those drives for boot files, you can boot from these devices and 
install the operating system in the same way that you boot from a CD or DVD drive.
NetBoot
NetBoot is a method developed by Apple that allows an Apple device to boot from a net-
work location rather than from the hard drive. The device uses DHCP to receive a network 
configuration and to receive the IP address of a TFTP server from which the device will 
download an operating system image from a server. This entire process is similar to the 
way an IP phone learns through DHCP the IP address of the server from which it down-
loads its configuration file.
NetInstall is a related Apple technology that uses a similar process to install an image on 
an Apple device. It is similar in concept to Windows Deployment Services.
External/Hot-Swappable Drives
Just as boot files can be located on a USB drive, CD, DVD, and flash drive, they can also 
be located on an external hard drive. Most of these drives are also hot-swappable (you can 
connect and remove them with the devices on). As always, you will probably have to alter 
the boot order of the device so that it looks on the external drive before the other drives if 
boot files are also located in these locations.
Internal Hard Drive (Partition)
Finally, the most common location of boot files is on the internal hard drive. These files are 
placed there during the installation and will be executed as long as the device is set to look 
for them there. By default most systems are set to look on the internal hard drive first, and 
even if the device is not set to look there first, it will eventually boot to those files if there 
are no boot files located on any of the other drives or boot sources.

1.2 Given a Scenario, Install Windows PC Operating Systems 
317
Types of Installations
Operating system installations can be lumped into two generic methods: attended or unat-
tended. During an attended installation, you walk through the installation and answer the 
questions as prompted. Questions typically ask for the product key, the directory in which 
you want to install the OS, and relevant network settings.
As simple as attended installations may be, they’re time-consuming and administrator-
intensive in that they require someone to fill in a fair number of fields to move through the 
process. Unattended installations allow you to configure the OS with little or no human 
intervention. Table 5.10 shows you four common unattended installation methods and 
when they can be used.

Another decision you must make is which method you are going to use to access the 
Windows installation files. It is possible to boot to the installation DVD and begin the 
installation process. However, your system must have a system BIOS that is capable of sup-
porting bootable media.
If you don’t have a bootable DVD, you must first boot the computer using some other 
bootable media, which then loads the disk driver so that you can access the installation 
program on the DVD.
Creating an Image
Creating an image isn’t actually an objective, but it is something important that you’ll 
need to know how to do in the real world. Creating an image involves taking a snap-
shot of a model system (often called a reference computer) and then applying it to other 
systems (see the section “Image Deployment” later). A number of third-party vendors 
offer packages that can be used to create images, and you can use the system prepara-
tion tool, or Sysprep. The Sysprep utility works by making an exact image or replica of 
the reference computer (sometimes also called the master computer), to be installed on 
other computers. Sysprep removes the master computer’s security ID (a process some-
times called generalization) and will generate new IDs for each computer the image is 
used to install.

318 
Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
 All Sysprep does is create the system image. You still need a cloning utility 
to copy the image to other computers. 
 Perhaps the biggest caveat to using Sysprep is that because you are making an exact 
image of an installed computer (including drivers and settings), all the computers that you 
will be installing the image on need to be identical (or close) to the confi guration of the 
master computer. Otherwise, you would have to go through and fi x driver problems on 
every installed computer. Sysprep images can be installed across a network or copied to a 
CD or DVD for local installation. Sysprep cannot be used to upgrade a system; plan on all 
data on the system (if there is any) being lost after a format. 
 Similar to Sysprep, ImageX is the preferred command-line utility for 
imaging Windows 7. You can find more information about it at  http://
technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722145(v=ws.10) . 
 Several third-party vendors provide similar services, and you’ll often hear the process 
referred to as  disk imaging or  drive imaging . The third-party utility makes the image, and 
then the image fi le is transferred to the computer without an OS. You boot the new system 
with the imaging software and start the image download. The new system’s disk drive is 
made into an exact sector-by-sector copy of the original system. 
 Imaging has major upsides. The biggest one is speed. In larger networks with multiple 
new computers, you can confi gure tens to hundreds of computers by using imaging in just 
hours, rather than the days it would take to individually install the OS, applications, and 
drivers. 
 Unattended Installation 
 Answering the myriad of questions posed by Windows Setup doesn’t qualify as exciting 
work for most people. Fortunately, there is a way to answer the questions automatically: 
through an unattended installation. In this type of installation, an  answer fi le is supplied 
with all the correct parameters (time zone, regional settings, administrator username, and 
so on), so no one needs to be there to tell the computer what to choose or to hit Next 500 
times. 
 Unattended installations are great because they can be used to upgrade operating sys-
tems. The fi rst step is to create an answer fi le. Generally speaking, you’ll want to run a test 
installation using that answer fi le fi rst before deploying it on a large scale because you’ll 
probably need to make some tweaks to it. After you create your answer fi le, place it on a 
network share that will be accessible from the target computer. (Most people put it in the 
same place as the Windows installation fi les for convenience.) 
 Boot the computer that you want to install on using a boot disk or CD, and estab-
lish the network connection. Once you start the setup process, everything should run 
automatically. 

1.2 Given a Scenario, Install Windows PC Operating Systems 
319
Upgrade
An upgrade involves moving from one operating system to another and keeping as many of 
the settings as possible. An example of an upgrade would be changing the operating system 
on a laptop computer from Windows Vista to Windows 7 and keeping the user accounts 
that existed.
It is also possible to upgrade from one edition of an operating system to another—
for example, from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 7 Ultimate. This is known as a 
Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade.
Clean Install
With a clean installation, you overwrite the operating system that existed on a machine and 
place a new one there. An example of a clean installation would be changing the operat-
ing system on a laptop from Windows Vista to Windows 7. The user accounts and other 
settings that existed with Windows Vista would be removed in the process and need to be 
re-created under Windows 7.
Repair Installation
A repair installation overwrites system files with a copy of new ones from the same operat-
ing system version and edition. For example, a laptop running Windows 7 is hanging on 
boot, and the cause is traced to a corrupted system file. A repair installation can replace 
that corrupted file with a new one (from the DVD or other source) without changing the 
operating system or settings (for configuration, accounts, and so on).
Multiboot
Multiple operating systems can exist on the same machine in one of two popular formats: in a 
multiboot configuration or in virtual machines. With a multiboot configuration, when you boot 
the machine, you choose which operating system you want to load of those that are installed. 
You could, for example, boot into Windows Vista, reboot and bring up Windows 7, reboot and 
bring up Windows 8, and test a software application you’ve created in each OS. It is possible, in 
this scenario, to have multiple editions of the same OS installed (Professional, Ultimate, and so 
forth) and choose which to boot into in order to test your application. The key to this configu-
ration, however, is that you can have only one operating system running at a time.
An alternative to multiboot that has become more popular in recent years is to run vir-
tual machines. You could boot into Windows 7, for example, and run a virtual machine of 
Windows Vista and one of Windows 8 and test your application in the three environments 
that are all running at the same time.
Remote Network Installation
Older Windows Server operating systems have a feature called Remote Installation Service 
(RIS), which allows you to perform several network installations at one time. Beginning 
with Windows Server 2003 SP2, RIS was replaced by Windows Deployment Service 
(WDS). This utility offers the same functionality as RIS.

320 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
A network installation is handy when you have many installs to do and installing by 
CD is too much work. In a network installation, the installation CD is copied to a shared 
location on the network. Then individual workstations boot and access the network share. 
The workstations can boot either through a boot disk or through a built-in network boot 
device known as a PXE ROM. Boot ROMs essentially download a small file that contains 
an OS and network drivers and has enough information to boot the computer in a limited 
fashion. At the least, it can boot the computer so it can access the network share and begin 
the installation.
Image Deployment
System images created with Sysprep and other tools can be deployed for installation on 
hosts across the network. The Windows Automated Installation Kit (AIK) can be useful for 
this purpose (http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd349348.aspx).
Recovery Partition
In the past, many devices that were purchased with the operating system installed by the 
OEM came with recovery media that could be used to boot the device and recover or 
replace the operating system if needed. Now many come with an additional partition on the 
drive called a recovery partition. The users could use specific key sequence during bootup 
that would cause the device to boot to the recovery partition and make available tools to 
either recover the installation or replace it. The downside of this approach is that if the hard 
drive fails or if the partition is overwritten, the receiver partition is useless. In an effort to 
address this concern, many OEMs now make available recovery media if requested by the 
user.
Refresh/Restore/Reset
Windows 8 and 8.1 offer three methods of dealing with a device that either won’t boot, is 
corrupted, or is simply performing badly. These two options are refresh and restore, and it 
is critical that you understand the consequences of each. When a refresh is performed, the 
user’s data is unaffected, while the operating system is returned to the factory default state. 
While the data remains intact, any applications or programs that the user installed will be 
gone. All default applications that come with the system will remain, and any purchased 
from the Windows Store will remain as well. When a restore is performed, the system is 
retired to a point in time in the past. It removes no user data, but any configuration changes 
made or programs and service packs installed since that point in time will be gone. A third 
option is the reset, which removes all data and programs and reinstalls a fresh version of 
the operating system.
Partitioning
For a hard disk to be able to hold files and programs, it has to be partitioned and format-
ted. Partitioning is the process of creating logical divisions on a hard drive. A hard drive 
can have one or more partitions. Formatting is the process of creating and configuring a 

1.2 Given a Scenario, Install Windows PC Operating Systems 
321
file allocation table (FAT) and creating the root directory. Several filesystem types are sup-
ported by the various versions of Windows, such as FAT16, FAT32, and NTFS (partitions 
are explored later in the discussion of disk management under objective 1.4).
The partition that the operating system boots from must be designated as active. Only 
one partition on a disk may be marked active. Each hard disk can be divided into a total of 
four partitions, either four primary partitions or three primary and one extended partition. 
Some of the other possibilities are examined in the following sections.
Dynamic
Partitions can be made dynamic, which—as the name implies—have the ability to be con-
figured and reconfigured on the fly. The big benefit they offer is that they can increase in 
size (without reformatting) and can span multiple physical disks. Dynamic partitions can 
be simple, spanned, or striped.
Dynamic partitions that are simple are similar to primary partitions and logical drives 
(which exist on basic partitions, discussed next). This is often the route you choose when 
you have only one dynamic disk and want the ability to change allocated space as needed.
Spanned means that you want space from a number of disks (up to 32) to appear as a 
single logical volume to the users. A minimum of two disks must be used, and no fault tol-
erance is provided by this option.
Striped is similar to spanned in that multiple disks are used, but the big difference is 
that data is written (in fixed-size stripes) across the disk set in order to increase I/O perfor-
mance. Although read operations are faster, a concern is that if one disk fails, none of the 
data is retrievable (like spanned, there is no fault tolerance).
Basic
With basic storage, Windows drives can be partitioned with primary or logical partitions. 
Basic partitions are a fixed size and are always on a single physical disk. This is the simplest 
storage solution and has been the traditional method of storing data for many years.
You can change the size of primary and logical drives by extending them into additional 
space on the same disk. You can create up to four partitions on a basic disk, either four pri-
mary or three primary and one extended.
Primary
A primary partition contains the boot files for an operating system. In older days, the oper-
ating system had to also be on that partition, but with the Windows versions you need to 
know for this exam, the OS files can be elsewhere as long as the boot files are in that pri-
mary partition.
Primary partitions cannot be further subdivided.
Extended
Extended partitions differ from primary in that they can be divided into one or more logi-
cal drives, each of which can be assigned a drive letter.

322 
Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
 Logical 
 In reality, all partitions are logical in the sense that they don’t necessarily correspond to one 
physical disk. One disk can have several logical divisions (partitions). A logical partition is 
any partition that has a drive letter. 
 Sometimes, you will also hear of a logical partition as one that spans mul-
tiple physical disks. For example, a network drive that you know as drive H: 
might actually be located on several physical disks on a server. To the user, 
all that is seen is one drive, or H:. 
 GPT 
 Devices that use the Unifi ed Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specifi cation (discussed 
in the section “1.1 Given a Scenario, Confi gure Settings and Use BIOS/UEFI Tools on a 
PC” in Chapter  1 ) instead of a BIOS also use a partitioning standard called GUID Partition 
Table (GPT). Since 2010, most operating systems support this and using a master boot 
record (MBR), which is the alternative method of booting to a legacy BIOS fi rmware inter-
face. Today, almost all operating systems support it, and many  only support booting from a 
GPT rather than MBR. 
 Moreover, it is also used on some BIOS systems because of the limitations of MBR parti-
tion tables, which was the original driver for the development of UEFI and GPT to begin 
with. MBR works with disks up to 2 TB in size, but it can’t handle disks with more than 2 
TB of space. MBR also supports only up to four primary partitions, so to have more than 
four, you had to make one of your primary partitions an “extended partition” and create 
logical partitions inside it. GPT removes both of these limitations. It allows up to 128 par-
titions on a GPT drive. 
 Filesystem Types/Formatting 
 New Technology Filesystem (NTFS) is available with all the versions of Windows you need 
to know for the exam, but all versions also recognize and support FAT16 and FAT32. The 
fi le table for the NTFS is called the Master File Table (MFT). 
 This section lists the major fi lesystems that are used with Windows and the differences 
among them. 
 ExFAT 
 Extended File Allocation Table (exFAT) is a Microsoft fi lesystem optimized for fl ash drives. 
It is proprietary and has also been adopted by the SD Card Association as the default fi le-
system for SDXC cards larger than 32 GB. The proprietary nature and licensing require-
ments make this fi lesystem diffi cult to use in any open source or commercial software. This 
fi lesystem is supported in Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1. It is also supported in 
Windows Vista with either Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2. 

1.2 Given a Scenario, Install Windows PC Operating Systems 
323
FAT32
FAT, which stands for File Allocation Table, is an acronym for the file on a filesystem used 
to keep track of where files are. It’s also the name given to this type of filesystem, intro-
duced in 1981. The largest FAT disk partition that could be created was approximately 2 
GB. FAT32 was introduced along with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2. As disk sizes 
grew, so did the need to be able to format a partition larger than 2 GB. FAT32 was based 
more on VFAT than on FAT16. It allowed for 32-bit cluster addressing, which in turn 
provided for a maximum partition size of 2 TB (2048 GB). It also included smaller cluster 
sizes to avoid wasted space (discussed later). FAT32 support is included in current Windows 
versions.
NTFS
Introduced along with Windows NT (and available on Windows 7, Vista, Windows 8, and 
Windows 8.1), NT File System (NTFS) is a much more advanced filesystem in almost every 
way than all versions of the FAT filesystem. It includes such features as individual file security 
and compression, RAID support, and support for extremely large file and partition sizes and 
disk transaction monitoring. It is the filesystem of choice for higher-performance computing.
CDFS
While not a filesystem that can be used on a hard drive, CD-ROM File System (CDFS) is 
the filesystem of choice for CD media and has been used with 32-bit Windows versions 
since Windows 95. A CD mounted with the CDFS driver appears as a collection.
NFS
Network File System (NFS) is a distributed filesystem protocol originally developed by Sun 
Microsystems. While it is supported on some Windows systems, it is primarily used on 
Unix-based systems; the SMB-based Common Internet File System (CIFS) is more common 
on Windows systems for access to resources on other devices. To support NFS, Windows 
systems make available the client for NFS. While the client for NFS is available in Windows 
Vista and Windows 7, the Services for the Network File System (NFS) feature is available 
only in the Windows 8 Enterprise edition. This feature is not available in Windows 8 and 
Windows 8 Pro editions.
ext3, ext4
ext3 and ext4 are Linux filesystems. While ext4 has the following advantages, it should 
be noted that it is not compatible with Windows, while ext3 is. The following are the 
strengths of ext4:
■
■
It supports individual file sizes up to 16 TB.
■
■
The overall maximum ext4 filesystem size is 1 EB (exabyte); 1 EB = 1024 PB (pet-
abyte), and 1 PB = 1024 TB (terabyte).
■
■
The directory can contain 64,000 subdirectories as opposed to 32,000 in ext3.

324 
Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
 
■
 You can mount an existing ext3 fs as ext4 fs (without having to upgrade it). 
 
■
 It improves the performance and reliability of the filesystem when compared to ext3. 
 
■
 In ext4, you also have the option of turning off the journaling feature. 
 Quick Format vs. Full Format 
 When you’re installing any Windows OS, you will be asked fi rst to format the drive using 
one of these disk technologies. Choose the disk technology based on what the computer 
will be doing and which OS you are installing. 
 To format a partition, you can use the  FORMAT command.  FORMAT.EXE is available with 
all versions of Windows. You can run  FORMAT by using the command prompt or by right-
clicking a drive in Windows Explorer and selecting Format. However, when you install 
Windows, it performs the process of partitioning and formatting for you if a partitioned 
and formatted drive does not already exist. You can usually choose between a  quick format 
or a  full format . With both formats, fi les are removed from the partition; the difference is 
that a quick format does not then check for bad sectors (a time-consuming process). 
 Be extremely careful with the  FORMAT command! When you format a drive, 
all data on the drive is erased. 
 Load Alternate Third-Party Drivers When Necessary 
 During the installation of Windows, it may be necessary to load a third-party driver that 
you update later. The goal during installation is to get the operating system up and running 
and in a state where you can interact with it. Some of the drivers included with media are 
not the latest from the vendor but can be used to complete the installation. Once instal-
lation is done, you can access the website of third-party vendors and download and then 
install the latest drivers. 
 Time/Date/Region Language Settings 
 During installation of the operating system, you are asked to choose the correct settings for 
the local time, date, and region. As was mentioned earlier, the goal during installation is to 
complete the process as quickly as possible, and you may need to tweak these settings later. 
 Once the installation is complete, there are a number of ways to change these values, 
the easiest of which is to right-click the clock in the lower-right corner of the taskbar and 
choose Adjust Date/Time. In the Control Panel, you can choose the Region And Language 
applet to confi gure date and time formats, as well as change language and location settings. 
Language interface packs (LIPs) are available that can be installed to modify what appears 
in wizards, dialog boxes, and such (see  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/
Install-or-change-a-display-language for more information).

325
Driver Installation, Software, and Windows Updates
During the installation process of Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 
8.1, you will be presented with the option to download any required updates and new 
driver packages that may have become available since the time the installation DVD was 
created. If the device will have an active Internet connection, you may want to take advan-
tage of this because it will download the required files and make them part of the installa-
tion. If this is not an option, you can always perform this step by visiting Windows Update 
after the installation.
Properly Formatted Boot Drive with Correct Partitions/
Format
Clearly it important to properly create and format the boot drive prior to the installation. 
Please review the sections “Partitioning,” “File System Types/Formatting,” and “Quick 
Format vs. Full Format.”
Other Concerns
This objective also lists a number of other topics that can be lumped into two areas: workgroup 
vs. domain, and factory recovery partitions. These reappear beneath other objectives within this 
domain and are not discussed here since they are explored elsewhere in this chapter.
Exam Essentials
Know the difference between basic and dynamic partitions.    Basic partitions are a fixed 
size and are always on a single physical disk. Dynamic partitions can increase in size (with-
out reformatting) and can span multiple physical disks.
Be familiar with the various boot methods.    You can begin the installation or upgrade 
process by booting from a number of sources. There are four in particular that CompTIA 
wants you to be familiar with: USB, CD-ROM, DVD, and PXE. The most commonly used 
for an attended installation is the CD-ROM/DVD boot.
1.3 Given a Scenario, Apply Appropriate 
Microsoft Command-Line Tools
Although the exam is on the Windows operating systems, it tests many concepts that 
carry over from the Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS), which was discussed 
earlier. MS-DOS was never meant to be extremely friendly. Its roots are in CP/M, which 

326 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
was based on the command line, and so is MS-DOS. In other words, they all use long 
strings of commands typed in at the computer keyboard to perform operations. Some 
people prefer this type of interaction with the computer, including many folks with 
technical backgrounds (such as yours truly). Although Windows has left the full com-
mand-line interface behind, it still contains a bit of DOS, and you get to it through the 
command prompt.
Although you can’t tell from looking at it, the Windows command prompt is actually a 
Windows program that is intentionally designed to have the look and feel of a DOS com-
mand line. Because it is, despite its appearance, a Windows program, the command prompt 
provides all the stability and configurability you expect from Windows. You can access a 
command prompt by running CMD.EXE.
A number of diagnostic utilities are often run at the command prompt. Since knowledge 
of each is required for the exam, they are discussed next in the order given. The commands 
in this section include the following:

1.3 Given a Scenario, Apply Appropriate Microsoft Command-Line Tools 
327
TASKKILL
The TASKKILL.EXE utility is used to terminate processes. Those processes can be identi-
fied by either name or process ID number (PID), and the process can exist on the machine 
where the administrator is sitting (the default) or on another machine, in which case you 
signify the other system by using the /S switch.
The /IM parameter is used to specify an image name of a process to kill and can include 
wildcard (*) characters. If the process ID number is used in place of the name, then the 
/PID switch is needed. The processes in question are the same that can be killed through 
the Task Manager.
BOOTREC
The BOOTREC.EXE utility can be run to interact with the MBR, boot sector, or boot configu-
ration data (BCD) store.
To run the tool, you must boot from the installation disc, choose the Repair Your 
Computer option, and enter the Recovery Environment. Choose Command Prompt from 
System Recovery Options and then type bootrec.exe.
The options for BOOTREC are /FIXBOOT (to write a new boot sector), /FIXMBR (to write a 
new MBR), /REBUILDBCD (to rebuild the BCD store), or /SCANOS (to scan all disks for instal-
lations the Boot Manager menu is not listing).
SHUTDOWN
The SHUTDOWN.EXE utility can be used to schedule a shutdown (complete or a restart) locally 
or remotely. A variety of reasons can be specified and announced to users for the shutdown. 
Three parameters to be aware of are /S (turns the computer off), /R (restarts the computer), 
and /M (lets you specify a computer other than this one).
TASKLIST
The TASKLIST.EXE utility is used at the command line to see a list of all the running pro-
cesses (and their process ID number), similar to what you see in the GUI by using Task 
Manager. By default, it shows the processes on the current machine, but the /S switch 
can be used to see the processes on a remote machine. /SVC will show the services hosted 
in each process, and you can use /U if you need to run the command as another user (/P 
allows you to specify a password associated with that user).
MD
The MD command is used to make directories. It’s a shorthand version of the MKDIR com-
mand. Table 5.11 describes its use and switches (I discuss RD and CD next).

Ta b l e  5 .11    CD, MD, and RD use and switches
Command
Purpose
CD [path]
Changes to the specified directory.
CD /D [drive:][path]
Changes to the specified directory on the drive.
CD ..
Changes to the directory that is up one level.
CD\
Changes to the root directory of the drive.
MD [drive:][path]
Makes a directory in the specified path. If you don’t specify a 
path, the directory will be created in your current directory.
RD [drive:][path]
Removes (deletes) specified directory.
RD /S [drive:][path]
Removes all directories and files in the specified directory, 
including the specified directory itself.
RD /Q [drive:][path]
Quiet mode. It won’t ask whether you’re sure you want to delete 
the specified directory when you use /S.
RD
The RD command is used to remove directories. It’s a shorthand version of the RMDIR com-
mands. Table 5.11 describes its use and switches.
CD
The CD command is used to change (or display). It’s a shorthand version of the CHDIR com-
mand. Table 5.11 describes its use and switches.
DEL
The DEL command is used to delete files and directories at the command line. Wildcards 
can be used with it. ERASE performs the same operations.
FORMAT
The FORMAT command is used to wipe data off disks and prepare them for new use. Before 
a hard disk can be formatted, it must have partitions created on it. (Partitioning was done 
in the DOS days with the FDISK command, but as I just mentioned, that command does not 

1.3 Given a Scenario, Apply Appropriate Microsoft Command-Line Tools 
329
exist in Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1, having been replaced 
with  DISKPART .) The syntax for  FORMAT is as follows: 
 FORMAT [volume] [switches] 
 The   volume  parameter describes the drive letter (for example,  D: ), mount point, or vol-
ume name. Table  5.12 lists some common  FORMAT switches. 
 TA b l E 5 .12   FORMAT switches 
Switch
Purpose
 /FS:[ filesystem ] 
Specifies the type of filesystem to use (FAT, FAT32, or NTFS)
 /V:[ label ] 
Specifies the new volume label
 /Q 
Executes a quick format
 There are other options as well to specify allocation sizes, the number of sectors per 
track, and the number of tracks per disk size. However, I don’t recommend that you use 
these unless you have a specifi c need. The defaults are just fi ne. 
 So, if you wanted to format your D: drive as NTFS with a name of HDD2, you would 
type the following: 
 
 FORMAT D: /FS:NTFS /V:HDD2 
 
 
 Before you format anything, be sure you have it backed up or be prepared 
to lose whatever is on that drive! 
 COPY 
 The  COPY command does what it says: it makes a copy of a fi le in a second location. (To 
copy a fi le and remove it from its original location, use the  MOVE command.) Here’s the syn-
tax for  COPY : 
 
 COPY [filename] [destination] 
 
 It’s pretty straightforward. There are several switches for  COPY , but in practice they are 
rarely used. The three most used ones are  /A , which indicates an ASCII text fi le;  /V , which 
verifi es that the fi les are written correctly after the copy; and  /Y , which suppresses the 

330 
Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
prompt asking whether you’re sure you want to overwrite fi les if they exist in the destina-
tion directory. 
 The  COPY command cannot be used to copy directories. Use  XCOPY for that 
function. 
 One useful tip is to use wildcards. For example, in DOS (or at the command 
prompt), the asterisk ( * ) is a wildcard that means  everything . So, you could 
type   COPY *.EXE  to copy all files that have an  .EXE extension, or you 
could type   COPY *.*  to copy all files in your current directory. 
 XCOPY 
 If you are comfortable with the  COPY command, learning  XCOPY shouldn’t pose too many 
problems. It’s basically an extension of  COPY with one notable exception—it’s designed to 
copy directories as well as fi les. The syntax is as follows: 
 XCOPY [source] [destination][switches] 
 There are 26  XCOPY switches; Table  5.13 lists some of the commonly used ones. 
 TA b l E 5 .13   XCOPY switches 
Switch
Purpose
/A 
Copies only files that have the Archive attribute set and does not clear the 
attribute. This is useful for making a quick backup of files while not dis-
rupting a normal backup routine.
/E 
Copies directories and subdirectories, including empty directories.
/F 
Displays full source and destination filenames when copying.
/G 
Allows copying of encrypted files to a destination that does not support 
encryption.
/H 
Copies hidden and system files as well.
/K 
Copies attributes. (By default,  XCOPY resets the Read-Only attribute.)

1.3 Given a Scenario, Apply Appropriate Microsoft Command-Line Tools 
331
Switch
Purpose
/O
Copies file ownership and ACL information (NTFS permissions).
/R
Overwrites read-only files.
/S
Copies directories and subdirectories but not empty directories.
/U
Copies only files that already exist in the destination.
/V
Verifies each new file.
Perhaps the most important switch is /O. If you use XCOPY to copy files from one location to 
another, the filesystem creates a new version of the file in the new location without changing the 
old file. In NTFS, when a new file is created, it inherits permissions from its new parent direc-
tory. This could cause problems if you copy files. (Users who didn’t have access to the file before 
might have access now.) If you want to retain the original permissions, use XCOPY /O.
ROBOCOPY
The ROBOCOPY command (Robust File Copy for Windows) is included with Windows 7, 
Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 and has the big advantage of being able to accept a plethora 
of specifications and keep NTFS permissions intact in its operations. The /MIR switch, for 
example, can be used to mirror a complete directory tree.
You can find an excellent TechNet article on how to use Robocopy at http://technet
.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ec85e01678.aspx.
DISKPART
The DISKPART command shows the partitions and lets you manage them on the computer’s 
hard drives. A universal tool for working with hard drives from the command line, it 
allows you to convert between disk types, extend/shrink volumes, and format partitions 
and volumes, as well as list them, create them, and so on. You can find a list of all the avail-
able commands at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490893.aspx.
SFC
The System File Checker (SFC) is a command line–based utility that checks and verifies the 
versions of system files on your computer. If system files are corrupted, the SFC will replace 
the corrupted files with correct versions.

 To run the SFC, you must be logged in as an administrator or have administrative privi-
leges. If the System File Checker discovers a corrupted system fi le, it will automatically 
overwrite the fi le by using a copy held in the   %systemroot% \system32\dllcache directory. 
If you believe that the  dllcache directory is corrupted, you can use  SFC /SCANNOW , 
SFC /SCANONCE ,  SFC /SCANBOOT , or  SFC /PURGECACHE to repair its contents. 
 The  C:\Windows\System32 directory is where many of the Windows sys-
tem files reside. 

1.3 Given a Scenario, Apply Appropriate Microsoft Command-Line Tools 
333
If you attempt to run SFC, or many other utilities, from a standard command prompt 
in Windows Vista, for example, you will be told that you must be an administrator 
running a console session in order to continue. Rather than opening a standard com-
mand prompt, choose Start  All Programs  Accessories and then right-click Command 
Prompt and choose Run As Administrator. The UAC will prompt you to continue, and 
then you can run SFC without a problem.
CHKDSK
You can use the Windows CHKDSK utility to create and display status reports for the hard 
disk. CHKDSK can also correct filesystem problems (such as cross-linked files) and scan for 
and attempt to repair disk errors. CHKDSK can be run from the command line or you can 
use a version in Windows Explorer.
To use the non-command-line version, right-click the problem disk and select Properties. 
This will bring up the Properties dialog box for that disk, which shows the current status of 
the selected disk drive.
By clicking the Tools tab at the top of the dialog box and then clicking the Check Now 
button in the Error-Checking section, you can start CHKDSK.
GPUDATE
Configuration settings on Windows devices can be controlled through the use of policies. 
These policies can be applied on a local basis or on a domain and organizational unit basis 
when a device is a member of an Active Directory domain. When changes are made by an 
administrator to these policies, some types of changes will not take effect until the next 
schedule refresh time.
An administrator can force a device to update its policies after a change by executing the 
gpupdate command on the device. This is the syntax of the command:
gpupdate [/target:{computer|user}] [/force] [/wait:value] [/logoff] [/boot]
The parameters are as follows:
■
■
/target: { computer | user }: Processes only the Computer settings or the current 
User settings. By default, both the computer settings and the user settings are processed.
■
■
/force: Ignores all processing optimizations and reapplies all settings.
■
■
/wait: value: Number of seconds that policy processing waits to finish. The default 
is 600 seconds. 0 means “no wait,” and -1 means “wait indefinitely.”
■
■
/logoff: Logs off after the refresh has completed. This is required for those Group 
Policy client-side extensions that do not process on a background refresh cycle but that 
do process when the user logs on, such as user Software Installation and Folder Redi-
rection. This option has no effect if there are no extensions called that require the user 
to log off.

334 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
■
■
/boot: Restarts the computer after the refresh has completed. This is required for 
those Group Policy client-side extensions that do not process on a background refresh 
cycle but do process when the computer starts up, such as computer Software Instal-
lation. This option has no effect if there are no extensions called that require the com-
puter to be restarted.
GPRESULT
Group policies can be applied to Windows devices at the local, OU, and domain levels, and 
when the policies are applied to the device, the results can be somewhat confusing because 
of variables that can affect how the policies interact with one another. If you need to deter-
mine the policies that are in effect for a particular device, you can execute the gpresult 
command on the device, and it will list the currently applied and defective polies. This is 
the command syntax:
gpresult [/s <COMPUTER> [/u <USERNAME> [/p [<PASSWORD>]]]] [/user
[<TARGETDOMAIN>\]<TARGETUSER>] [/scope {user | computer}]
{/r | /v | /z | [/x | /h] <FILENAME> [/f] | /?}
The parameters are as follows:
■
■
/s <COMPUTER>: Specifies the name or IP address of a remote computer. Do not use 
backslashes. The default is the local computer.
■
■
/u <USERNAME>: Uses the credentials of the specified user to run the command. The 
default user is the user who is logged on to the computer that issues the command.
■
■
/p [<Password>]: Specifies the password of the user account that is provided in the 
/u parameter. If /p is omitted, gpresult prompts for the password. /p cannot be used 
with /x or /h.
■
■
/user [<TARGETDOMAIN>\]<TARGETUSER>: Specifies the remote user whose data is to be 
displayed.
■
■
/scope {user | computer}: Displays data for either the user or the computer. If /scope 
is omitted, gpresult displays data for both the user and the computer.
■
■
[/x | /h] <FILENAME>: Saves the report in either XML (/x) or HTML (/h) format at 
the location and with the filename that is specified by the FILENAME parameter. This 
cannot be used with /u, /p, /r, /v, or /z.
■
■
/f: Forces gpresult to overwrite the filename that is specified in the /x or /h option.
■
■
/r: Displays summary data.
■
■
/v: Displays verbose policy information. This includes detailed settings that were 
applied with a precedence of 1.
■
■
/z: Displays all available information about Group Policy. This includes detailed set-
tings that were applied with a precedence of 1 and higher.

■
■
[FileName]: Specifies a particular file or group of files for which you want to see a listing.
■
■
/p: Displays one screen of the listing at a time. To see the next screen, press any key on 
the keyboard.
■
■
/q: Displays file ownership information.
■
■
/w: Displays the listing in wide format, with as many as five filenames or directory 
names on each line.
■
■
d: Same as /w but files are sorted by column.
■
■
i: Displays only the names of those directories and files with the attributes you specify.
■
■
/o [[:]SortOrder]: Controls the order in which DIR sorts and displays directory 
names and filenames.
■
■
/t [[:]TimeField]: Specifies which time field to display or use for sorting.
■
■
/s: Lists every occurrence, in the specified directory and all subdirectories, of the 
specified filename.
■
■
/b: Lists each directory name or filename, one per line, including the filename exten-
sion. /b does not display heading information or a summary. /b overrides /w.
■
■

extended characters to lowercase.
■
■
/n: Displays a long list format with filenames on the far right of the screen.
■
■
/x: Displays the short names generated for files on NTFS and FAT volumes. The display 
is the same as the display for /n, but short names are displayed after the long name.
■
■
/c: Displays the thousand separator in file sizes.
■
■
/4: Displays four-digit year format.
EXIT
EXIT is a command that can be used to quit the current batch script, quit the current sub-
routine, or quit the command processor (CMD.EXE). This is the syntax of the command:
EXIT [/B] [exitCode]

336 
Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
 The parameters are as follows: 
 
■
/B : When used in a batch script, this option will exit only the script (or subroutine) but 
not  CMD.EXE . 
 
■
exitCode : Sets the  %ERRORLEVEL% to a numeric number. If quitting  CMD.EXE , set the pro-
cess exit code to  no . 
 HELP 
 The  HELP command does what it says: it gives you help. Actually, if you just type   HELP  and 
press Enter, your computer gives you a list of system commands you can type. Type the 
name of a command you want to know about after typing  HELP . For example, type   HELP 
RD  and press Enter, and you will get information about the  RD command. 
 EXPAND 
 The  EXPAND command is used to open compressed update fi les. By using this command, you 
can open and review the update. This is the syntax of the command: 
 expand [-r] source [destination] [-d source.cab [-f:files]] [source.cab 
[-f:filesdestination]] 
 The parameters are as follows: 
 
■
 [-r] : Renames expanded files. 
 
■
 [destination] : Specifies where files are to be expanded. If  source is multiple files 
and  -r is not specified,  destination must be a directory.  destination can consist of 
a drive letter and colon, a directory name, a filename, or a combination of any of these. 
 
■
 [-d source.cab] : Displays a list of files in the source location. Does not expand or 
extract the files. 
 
■
 [-f:files] : Specifies the files in a cabinet ( .cab ) file that you intend to expand. You 
can use wildcards ( * and  ? ). 
 
■
 source.cab : Specifies the files to expand.  source can consist of a drive letter and colon, 
a directory name, a filename, or a combination. You can use wildcards ( * and  ? ). 
 
■
 [/?] : Displays help at a command prompt. 
 [command name] /? 
 You can also get help information by typing   /?  after a command. 
 
 The  /? switch is slightly faster and provides more information than the 
 HELP command. The  HELP command provides information only for system 
commands (it does not include network commands). For example, if you 
type   help ipconfig  at a command prompt, you get no useful informa-
tion (except to try  /? ); however, typing   ipconfig /?  provides the help file 
for the  ipconfig command.

Commands Available with Standard Privileges vs. Administrative 
Privileges
In Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, some commands are 
unavailable to a user logged in with a standard privilege account. This set of commands 
can be executed only if the user is logged on with an administrator account or possesses 
an administrative account and references it by using the runas command. When this com-
mand is used and references an administrative account, privileges for that command only 
are elevated.
This is the syntax of the runas command:
runas [{/profile | /noprofile}] [/env] [{/netonly | /savecred}]
[/smartcard] [/showtrustlevels] [/trustlevel] /user:<UserAccountName>
"<ProgramName> <PathToProgramFile>"
The parameters are as follows:
■
■
/profile: Loads the user’s profile. This is the default. This parameter cannot be used 
with the /netonly parameter.
■
■
/no profile: Specifies that the user’s profile is not to be loaded. This allows the appli-
cation to load more quickly, but it can also cause a malfunction in some applications.
■
■
/env: Specifies that the current network environment be used instead of the user’s 
local environment.
■
■
/netonly: Indicates that the user information specified is for remote access only. This 
parameter cannot be used with the /profile parameter.
■
■
/savecred: Indicates if the credentials have been previously saved by this user. This 
parameter is not available and will be ignored on Windows Vista Home or Windows 
Vista Starter Editions. This parameter cannot be used with the /smartcard parameter.
■
■
/smartcard: Indicates whether the credentials are to be supplied from a smartcard. 
This parameter cannot be used with the /savecred parameter.
■
■
/showtrustlevels: Displays the trust levels that can be used as arguments to /trustlevel.
■
■
/trustlevel: Specifies the level of authorization at which the application is to run. Use 
/showtrustlevels to see the trust levels available.
■
■
/user:<UserAccountName> "<ProgramName> <PathToProgramFile>": Specifies the 
name of the user account under which to run the program, the program name, and the 
path to the program file. The user account name format should be <User>@<Domain> or 
<Domain>\<UserAccountName>.
Exam Essentials
Know the main command-line utilities.    Those discussed in this chapter include the ones 
CompTIA wants you to know for the exam. Among these are: /?, CD, CHKDSK, COPY, FORMAT, 
MD, RD, SFC, TRACERT, and XCOPY.

338 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Know the switches for specified commands.    CompTIA expects you to know the switches 
for the most common utilities. Make sure you look at each command and utility listed in 
the objectives and the switches and parameters for each that have been listed in this section.
1.4 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate 
Microsoft Operating System Features 
and Tools
This objective requires you to know how to work at the command line and run common 
command-line utilities available with the Windows-based operating systems, as well as use 
administrative tools. Some of the material here overlaps with other objectives, but you’ll 
want to make certain you know each utility discussed.
Although most of the information presented about Windows utilities and adminis-
tration should seem like second nature to you (on-the-job experience is expected for 
A+ certification), you should read these sections thoroughly to make certain you can 
answer any questions that may appear about them. The topics covered in this section 
include the following:
■

Administrative tools
■
■
MSCONFIG
■
■
Task Manager
■

System utilities
Table 5.15 lists the administrative tools, and the purpose for each, that you need to know 
for this objective. The majority of these run in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
Ta b l e  5 .15     Windows administrative tools
Tool
Purpose
Computer 
Management
The Computer Management Console is a power-packed interface and 
includes the following system tools: Device Manager, Event Viewer, 
Shared Folders, Performance/Performance Logs And Alerts (based on 
the OS you are running, you may also see Local Users And Groups, or 
Task Scheduler, here as well). Computer Management also has the  
Storage area, which lets you manage removable media, defragment your 
hard drives, or manage partitions through the Disk Management utility. 
Finally, you can manage system services and applications through  
Computer Management as well.
Device Manager Device Manager shows a list of all installed hardware and lets you add 
items, remove items, update drivers, and more.

Tool
Purpose
Users And 
Groups
If Local Users And Groups is not visible in the left pane of MMC, choose  
File  Add/Remove Snap-in and select Local Users And Groups from the 
list of possible snap-ins. You can choose to manage the local computer or 
another computer (requiring you to provide its address). The built-in groups 
for a domain are a superset of local groups.
Local Users And Groups is not available for Windows 7 editions lower 
than Professional. In all other editions, you must manage user accounts 
using the User Accounts applet in the Control Panel, and you cannot 
create or manage groups. The default users created are Administrator, 
Guest, and the administrative account created during the install.
Local Security 
Policy
The Local Security Policy (choose Start and then enter secpol.msc) 
allows you to set the default security settings for the system. This feature 
is available only in Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Win-
dows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8 Ultimate, Windows 8 
Professional (old Business), and Windows 8 Enterprise editions.
Performance 
Monitor
Performance Monitor differs a bit in versions but has the same purpose 
throughout: to display performance counters. While lumped under one 
heading, two tools are available—System Monitor and Performance 
Logs And Alerts. System Monitor will show the performance counters 
in graphical format. The Performance Logs And Alerts utility will collect 
the counter information and then send it to a console (such as the one in 
front of the admin so they can be aware of the problem) or event log.
Services
This interface is listed, and discussed, with the Run line utilities later in 
this objective.
System 
Configuration
MSCONFIG, known as the System Configuration utility, helps you trouble-
shoot startup problems by allowing you to selectively disable individual 
items that normally are executed at startup. It works in all versions of Win-
dows, although the interface window is slightly different among versions.
Task Scheduler
Task Scheduler allows you to configure jobs to automatically run unat-
tended. For the run frequency, you can choose any of the following 
options: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, One Time Only, When The Computer 
Starts, or When You Log On.
You can access a job’s advanced properties any time after the job has 
been created. To do so, double-click the icon for the job in the Scheduled 
Tasks screen. In the resulting dialog box, you can configure such things 
as the username and password associated with the job, the actual com-
mand line used to start the job (in case you need to add parameters to it), 
and the working directory.
At any time, you can delete a scheduled job by deleting its icon, or you 
can simply disable a job by removing the check mark from the Enabled 
box on the Task tab of the task’s properties dialog box. For jobs that are 
scheduled to run, a picture of a clock appears in the bottom-left corner of 
the icon; jobs not scheduled to run do not have that clock.

Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Tool
Purpose
Component 
Services
Component Services is an MMC snap-in that allows you to administer, 
as well as deploy, component services and to configure behavior such as 
security (Component Services is located beneath Administrative Tools).
Data Sources
ODBC Data Source Administrator (located beneath Administrative Tools) 
allows you to interact with database management systems.
Print 
Management
Available in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, Print Management (located 
beneath Administrative Tools) allows you to manage multiple printers 
and print servers from a single interface.
Print Management is not available for Windows 7 in any edition lower 
than Windows 7 Professional. In all later editions of Windows (Vista, 8, 
8.1), you must manage individual printers using the Printers applet in the 
Control Panel.
Windows Mem-
ory Diagnostic
The Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool (located beneath Administrative 
Tools) can be used to check a system for memory problems. For the tool 
to work, the system must be restarted. The two options that it offers are 
to restart the computer now and check for problems or wait and check 
for problems on the next restart.
Upon reboot, the test will take several minutes, and the display screen 
will show which pass number is being run and the overall status of the 
test (percentage complete). When the memory test concludes, the sys-
tem will restart again, and nothing related to it is apparent until you log 
in. If the test is without error, you’ll see a message that no errors were 
found. If anything else is found, the results will be displayed.
Windows 
Firewall
Windows Firewall (Start  Control Panel  Windows Firewall) is used to 
block access from the network, and in Windows 7, it is divided into sepa-
rate settings for private networks and public networks.
While host-based firewalls are not as secure as other types of firewalls, 
this provides much better protection than previously and is turned on by 
default. It is also included in the Security component of the Action Center 
and can be tweaked significantly using the Advanced Settings.
Advanced 
Security
Continuing the discussion of Windows Firewall, once you click Advanced 
Settings, Windows Firewall with Advanced Security opens. Here, you 
can configure inbound and outbound rules as well as import and export 
policies and monitor. Monitoring is not confined only to the firewall; you 
can also monitor security associations and connection security rules. In 
short, Windows Firewall with Advanced Security is an incredibly pow-
erful tool that builds on what Windows Vista started. Not only can this 
MMC snap-in do simple configuration, but it can also configure remote 
computers and work with Group Policy.

MSCONFIG
The MSCONFIG system configuration tool features different tabs based on the 
Windows version you are running, but the key ones are General, Boot, Services, Startup, 
and Tools.
General    On the General tab, you can choose the startup type. There are three sets of 
options: Normal, Diagnostic, and Selective. A normal startup loads all drivers and services, 
whereas a diagnostic startup loads only the basic drivers and services. Between the two 
extremes is the selective startup that gives you limited options on what to load. Figure 5.8 
shows the General tab.
F i g u r e  5 . 8    General tab
Boot    The Boot tab shows the boot menu and allows you to configure parameters such 
as the number of seconds the menu should appear before the default option is chosen and 
whether you want go to safe boot. You can toggle on/off the display of drivers as they 
load during startup and choose to log the boot, go with basic video settings, and similar 
options. Figure 5.9 shows the Boot tab.
Services    The Services tab shows the services configured and their current status. From 
here, you can enable or disable all and hide Microsoft services from the display (which 
greatly reduces the display in most cases). Figure 5.10 shows the Services tab.

Startup    The Startup tab shows the items scheduled to begin at startup, the command 
associated with them, and the location where the configuration is done (usually, but not 
always, in the Registry). From here, you can enable or disable all. If a particular startup 
item has been disabled in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, the date and time it was disabled 
will appear in the display. Figure 5.11 shows the Startup tab for Windows 7 and earlier.
F i g u r e  5 .11    Startup tab on Windows 7
This functionality has been moved to Task Manager in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1; 
Figure 5.12 shows the Startup tab.
Tools    The Tools tab contains quick access to some of the most useful diagnostic tools in 
Windows. You can launch such items as the Registry Editor as well as many Control Panel 
applets, and you can enable or disable User Account Control (UAC). Figure 5.13 shows the 
Tools tab.
Task Manager
This tool lets you shut down nonresponsive applications selectively in all Windows versions. 
In current versions of Windows, it can do so much more. Task Manager allows you to see 
which processes and applications are using the most system resources, view network usage, 
see connected users, and so on. To display Task Manager, press Ctrl+Alt+Del and click the 
Task Manager button to display it. You can also right-click an empty spot in the taskbar 
and choose it from the pop-up menu that appears.

345
 To get to the Task Manager directly in any of the Windows versions, you 
can press Ctrl+Shift+Esc. 
 In Windows Vista and Windows 7, Task Manager has six tabs: Applications, Processes, 
Performance, Networking, and Users. The Networking tab is shown only if your sys-
tem has a network card installed (it is rare to fi nd one that doesn’t). The Users tab is 
displayed only if the computer you are working on is a member of a workgroup or is a 
stand-alone computer. The Users tab is unavailable on computers that are members of a 
network domain. In Windows 8 and 8.1, there is an additional tab called Details, and the 
Applications tab is replaced with the App History tab. Let’s look at these tabs, in the order 
of their appearance, in more detail in Windows 8.1. 
 Applications 
 The Applications tab (shown in Figure  5.14 ) lets you see which tasks are open on the 
machine. You also see the status of each task, which can be either Running or Not 
Responding. If a task or application has stopped responding (that is, it’s hung), you can select 
the task in the list and click End Task. Doing so closes the program, and you can try to open 
it again. Often, although certainly not always, if an application hangs, you have to reboot the 
computer to prevent the same thing from happening again shortly after you restart the appli-
cation. You can also use the Applications tab to switch to a different task or create new tasks.

App History (Windows 8 and 8.1 Only)
The App history tab in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 (shown in Figure 5.15) displays the 
history of the usage of Metro apps only.
F i g u r e  5 .15     App History tab
Processes
The Processes tab (shown in Figure 5.16) lets you see the names of all the processes 
running on the machine. You also see the user account that’s running the process, as 
well as how much CPU and RAM resources each process is using. To end a process, 
select it in the list and click End Process. Be careful with this choice since ending some 
processes can cause Windows to shut down. If you don’t know what a particular pro-
cess does, you can look for it in any search engine and find a number of sites that will 
explain it.

347
F i g u r e  5 .16    Processes tab
You can also change the priority of a process in Task Manager’s Processes display by 
right-clicking the name of the process and choosing Set Priority. The six priorities, from 
lowest to highest, are as follows:
Low    For applications that need to complete sometime but that you don’t want interfering with 
other applications. On a numerical scale from 0 to 31, this equates to a base priority of 4.
Below Normal    For applications that don’t need to drop all the way down to Low. This 
equates to a base priority of 6.
Normal    The default priority for most applications. This equates to a base priority of 8.
Above Normal    For applications that don’t need to boost all the way to High. This equates 
to a base priority of 10.
High    For applications that must complete soon, when you don’t want other applications 
to interfere with the application’s performance. This equates to a base priority of 13.
Realtime    For applications that must have the processor’s attention to handle time-critical 
tasks. Applications can be run at this priority only by a member of the Administrators 
group. This equates to a base priority of 24.

348 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
If you decide to change the priority of an application, you’ll be warned that changing the 
priority of an application may make it unstable. You can generally ignore this option when 
changing the priority to Low, Below Normal, Above Normal, or High, but you should heed 
this warning when changing applications to the Realtime priority. Realtime means that the 
processor gives precedence to this process over all others—over security processes, over 
spooling, over everything—and is sure to make the system unstable.
Task Manager changes the priority only for that instance of the running application. 
The next time the process is started, priorities revert to that of the base (typically Normal).
Services
The Services tab (shown in Figure 5.17) lists the name of each running service, as well as 
the process ID associated with it, its description, its status, and its group. A button labeled 
Services appears on this tab, and clicking it will open the MMC console for Services, where 
you can configure each service. Within Task Manager, right-clicking a service will open a 
context menu listing three choices: Start Service, Stop Service, and Go To Process (which 
takes you to the Processes tab).

 Performance 
 The Performance tab (shown in Figure  5.18 ) contains a variety of information, including 
overall CPU usage percentage, a graphical display of CPU usage history, page-fi le usage in 
megabytes, and a graphical display of page-fi le usage. 
 F I g u r E 5 .18   Performance tab 
 This tab also provides you with additional memory-related information such as physical 
and kernel memory usage, as well as the total number of handles, threads, and processes. 
Total, limit, and peak commit-charge information also displays. Some of the items are 
beyond the scope of this book, but it’s good to know that you can use the Performance tab 
to keep track of system performance. Note that the number of processes, CPU usage per-
centage, and commit charge always display at the bottom of the Task Manager window, 
regardless of which tab you have currently selected. 
 On Windows 7 this pane has a button marked Resource Monitor, which 
breaks down resource usage on a per-process basis. 

350 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Networking
The Networking tab (shown in Figure 5.19) provides you with a graphical display of 
the performance of your network connection. It also tells you the network adaptor 
name, link speed, and state. If you have more than one network adaptor installed in 
the machine, you can select the appropriate adaptor to see graphical usage data for that 
adaptor.
F i g u r e  5 .19    Networking tab
Users
The Users tab (shown in Figure 5.20) provides you with information about the users 
connected to the local machine. You’ll see the username, ID, status, client name, and 
session type. You can right-click any connected user to perform a variety of functions, 
including sending the user a message, disconnecting the user, logging off the user, and 
initiating a remote-control session to the user’s machine.

Use Task Manager whenever the system seems bogged down by an unresponsive application.
Details Tab (Windows 8 and 8.1 Only)
The Details tab (shown in Figure 5.21) displays information about the processes that are 
running on the computer. A process can be an application that you start or subsystems and 
services that are managed by the operating system.
Disk Management
In Windows, you can manage your hard drives through the Disk Management component. 
To access Disk Management, access the Control Panel and double-click Administrative 
Tools. Then double-click Computer Management. Finally, double-click Disk Management.
The Disk Management screen lets you view a host of information regarding all the 
drives installed in your system, including CD-ROM and DVD drives. The list of devices in 
the top portion of the screen shows you additional information for each partition on each 
drive, such as the filesystem used, status, free space, and so on. If you right-click a partition 
in either area, you can perform a variety of functions, such as formatting the partition and 
changing the name and drive letter assignment. For additional options and information, 
you can also access the properties of a partition by right-clicking it and selecting Properties.
The basic unit of storage is the disk. Disks are partitioned (primary, logical, extended) 
and then formatted for use. With the Windows operating systems this exam focuses on, 
you can choose to use either FAT32 or NTFS; the advantage of the latter is that it offers 
security and many other features that FAT32 can’t handle. Both Windows 7 and Windows 
Vista can be installed only in NTFS, but they will recognize FAT partitions.

352 
Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
 If you’re using FAT32 and want to change to NTFS, the convert utility will 
allow you to do so. For example, to change the E: drive to NTFS, the com-
mand is  convert e: /FS:NTFS . 
 Once the disk is formatted, the next building block is the directory structure, in which you 
divide the partition into logical locations for storing data. Whether these storage units are called 
directories or folders is a matter of semantics—they tend to be called  folders when viewed in 
the graphical user interface (GUI) and  directories when viewed from the command line.  
 Drive Status 
 The status of a drive can have a number of variables associated with it (System, Boot, and 
so on), but what really matters is whether it falls into the category of  healthy or  unhealthy .

As the title implies, if it is healthy, it is properly working, and if it is unhealthy, you need to 
attend to it and correct problems. In Figure  5.22 you can see in the Status column of Disk 
Management that all drives are healthy.

 You can fi nd a list of status states that are possible and require action at  http://
technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771775.aspx. 
 Mounting 
 Drives must be mounted before they can be used. Within Windows, most removable media 
(fl ash drives, CDs, and so forth) are recognized when attached and mounted. Volumes on 
basic disks, however, are not automatically mounted and assigned drive letters by default. 
To mount them, you must manually assign them drive letters or create mount points in 
Disk Management. 
 You can also mount from the command line using either the Diskpart or 
Mountvol utility. 

354 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Initializing
Initializing a disk makes it available to the disk management system, and in most cases the 
drive will not show up until you do this. Once the drive has been connected or installed, 
this should be done. Initializing the drive can be done at the command using diskpart or in 
the Disk Management tool. You need to know that initialization will wipe out the drive! To 
use diskpart to perform the initialization on 2 TB drives and smaller, follow these steps:
1.	
Open the Start menu, type diskpart, and press Enter.
2.	
Type list disk and press Enter.
3.	
Type select disk X (where X is the number your drive shows up as) and press Enter.
4.	
Type clean and press Enter.
5.	
Type create partition primary and press Enter.
6.	
Type format quick fs=ntfs and press Enter.
7.	
Type assign and press Enter.
8.	
Type exit and press Enter.
To use diskpart to perform the initialization on drives that are 2.5 TB drives and larger, 
follow these steps:
1.	
Open the Start menu, type diskpart, and press Enter.
2.	
Type list disk and press Enter.
3.	
Type select disk X (where X is the number your drive shows up as) and press Enter.
4.	
Type clean and press Enter.
5.	
Type convert gpt and press Enter.
6.	
Type create partition primary and press Enter.
7.	
Type format quick fs=ntfs and press Enter.
8.	
Type assign and press Enter.
9.	
Type exit and press Enter.
To use Disk Management, follow this procedure:
1.	
Install the drive and reboot the device.
2.	
In the search line, type Disk Management and press Enter. With the drive connected, 
you will get the pop-up box shown in Figure 5.23.
3.	
If you got the pop-up, choose either MBR or GPT and click OK.
If you didn’t get the pop-up, then right-click and select to initialize the newly added 
drive under where it says Disk #, as shown in Figure 5.24.
Extending Partitions
It is possible to add more space to partitions (and logical drives) by extending them into 
unallocated space. This is done in Disk Management by right-clicking and choosing Extend 
or using the Diskpart utility.

Splitting Partitions
Just as you can extend a partition, you can also reduce the size of it. While generically 
known as splitting the partition, the menu option in Disk Management is Shrink. By 
shrinking an existing partition, you are creating another with unallocated space that can 
then be used for other purposes. You can shrink only basic volumes that use the NTFS file-
system (and space exists) or that do not have a filesystem.
Shrinking Partitions
It is also possible to shrink a volume from its size at creation. To do so in Disk 
Management, access the volume in question, right-click the volume, and select Shrink 
Volume, as shown in Figure 5.25.

This will open another box that will allow you to control how much you want to shrink 
the volume, as shown in Figure 5.26.
Assigning/Changing Drive Letters
Mounting drives and assigning drive letters are two tasks that go hand-in-hand. When you 
mount a drive, you typically assign it a drive letter to be able to access it. Right-clicking a 
volume in Disk Management gives the option Change Drive Letter And Paths, as shown in 
Figure 5.27.
Adding Drives
When removable drives are added, the Windows operating system is configured, by default, 
to identify them and assign a drive letter. When nonremovable drives are added, you must 
mount them and assign a drive letter, as mentioned earlier.
Adding Arrays
Arrays are added to increase fault tolerance (using RAID) or performance (striping). Disk 
Management allows you to create and modify arrays as needed.

Storage Spaces
Configuring storage spaces is a fault tolerance and capacity expansion technique that can 
be used as an alternative to the techniques described earlier when discussing dynamic vol-
ume types. It enables you to virtualize storage by grouping industry-standard disks into 
storage pools and then creating virtual disks called storage spaces from the available capac-
ity in the storage pools. This means that, from a high level, you have to do three tasks to 
use storage spaces.
1.	
Create a storage pool, which is a collection of physical disks.
2.	
From the storage pool, create a storage space, which can also be thought of as a virtual 
disk.
3.	
Create one or more volumes on the storage space.
First let’s look at creating the pool from several physical disks. Each of the disks 
must be at least 4 GB in size and should not have any volumes in them. The number of 
disks required depends on the type of resiliency you want to provide to the resulting 
storage space. Resiliency refers to the type of fault tolerance desired. Use the following 
guidelines:
■
■
For simple resiliency (no fault tolerance), only a single disk is required for the pool.
■
■
For mirror resiliency, two drives are required.
■
■
For party resiliency (think RAID 5), three drives are required.
To create the pool, access the Control Panel using any of the methods discussed so far 
and click the applet Storage Spaces. On the resulting page, select the option Create A New 
Pool And Storage Space. On the Select Drives To Create Storage Pools page, the drives that 
are available and supported for storage pools will appear, as shown in Figure 5.28.
F i g u r e  5 . 2 8     The Select Drives To Create A Storage Pool page

1.4 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Microsoft Operating System Features 
359
In this case, only one drive is eligible, so you can create only a simple type pool. Check 
the drive and click the Create Pool button at the bottom of the page. On the next page, 
give the space a name, select a drive letter, and choose the filesystem (NTFS or REFS), 
the resiliency type (in this case you can select only Simple), and the size of the pool. 
Figure 5.29 shows the pool as Myspace, with a drive letter of F, an NTFS filesystem, 
simple resiliency, and a maximum size of 100 GB. When you click Create Storage Space, 
the space will be created. Be aware that any data on the physical drive will be erased in 
this process!
F i g u r e  5 . 2 9     Creating a storage space
When the process is finished, the new space will appear on the Manage Storage Spaces 
page. Now you have a pool and a space derived from the pool. The last step is to create a 
volume in the storage space. If you now access Disk Management, you will see a new vir-
tual disk called Myspace. It will be a basic disk, but you can convert it to dynamic by right-
clicking it and selecting Convert To Dynamic Disk. This will allow to you shrink or delete 
the existing volume if you desire.

Other (User State Migration Tool [USMT],  
Windows Upgrade Advisor, Windows  
Easy Transfer)
Several Microsoft tools can assist in the transfer from one operating system to another. 
This section discusses three of those tools.
User State Migration Tool
Microsoft Windows User State Migration Tool (USMT) allows you to migrate user file 
settings related to the applications, desktop configuration, and accounts. Version 4.0 
works with Windows 7, is part of the Windows Automated Installation Kit (AIK), and 
can be found at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd560801(WS.10)
.aspx. Version 3.0 works with Windows Vista. You can download this tool from 
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722032.aspx. If all you are doing is 
a simple migration from one OS to another, you do not need this tool, but it is invalu-
able during large deployments.
Windows Easy Transfer
If you are migrating only a few accounts, Microsoft recommends Windows Easy Transfer 
instead of USMT. This tool works with Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows 8, and 
Windows 8.1. When transferring to Windows 7, for example, a version of Windows Easy 
Transfer can be downloaded in either 32-bit or 64-bit version for Windows Vista from www
.microsoft.com/downloads.
Windows Upgrade Advisor
The Windows Upgrade Advisor is a tool that you can use to determine whether a computer 
has the resources required to run a new operating system. There is a version of this tool 
for each of the operating systems discussed (Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and 
Windows 8.1). The tool scans the computer and generates a report detailing any issues that 
may arise because of insufficient resources.
System Utilities
Table 5.16 lists the utilities CompTIA singles out as relevant to know for this section. All of 
these can be started from Start  Run by entering their name and pressing Enter.

1.4 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Microsoft Operating System Features 
361
Ta b l e  5 .16    System utilities
Utility
Purpose
MSCONFIG
Discussed previously, the MSCONFIG configuration utility is useful for 
looking at start-related settings.
REGEDIT
Used to open and edit the Registry. Regedit does not have save or 
undo features (though you can import and export); once you make a 
change, you’ve made the change for better or worse, and this is not a 
place to play around in if you’re not sure what you’re doing.
The Registry is divided into five “hives” that hold all settings. The two 
main hives are HKEY_USERS (which contains settings for all users) 
and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (which contains settings for the machine 
itself). HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a subset of HKEY_USERS holding 
information only on the current user. HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG and 
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT are both subsets of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE 
for the current configuration.
COMMAND
Starts a command prompt window intentionally designed to have the 
look and feel of a DOS command line. Because it is, despite its appear-
ance, a Windows program, the command prompt provides all the sta-
bility and configurability you expect from Windows.
SERVICES.MSC
An MMC snap-in that allows you to interact with the services running 
on the computer. The status of the services will typically be either 
started or stopped, and you can right-click and choose Start, Stop, 
Pause, Resume, or Restart from the context menu. Services can be 
started automatically or manually, or they can be disabled. If you 
right-click the service and choose Properties from the context menu, 
you can choose the startup type as well as see the path to the execut-
able and any dependencies.
MMC
Starts the management console, allowing you to run any snap-in 
(such as SERVICES.MSC).
MSTSC
Remote Desktop Connection Usage is used to configure remote desk-
top connections.
NOTEPAD
Starts a simple editor. You can edit a file that already exists or create 
a new one.
EXPLORER
Starts the Windows interface, allowing you to interact with files and 
­folders.
(continues)

Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Utility
Purpose
MSINFO32
The System Information dialog box, this tool displays a thorough list 
of settings on the machine. You cannot change any values from here, 
but you can search, export, save, and run a number of utilities. It is 
primarily used during diagnostics because it is an easy way to display 
settings such as IRQs and DMAs.
DXDIAG
The DirectX Diagnostic tool (which has the executable name dxdiag) 
allows you to test DirectX functionality, with a focus on display, 
sound, and input. When started, you can also verify that your drivers 
have been signed by Microsoft. DirectX is a collection of APIs related 
to multimedia.
Defrag
Defrag is a tool that can be used to reorganize the data on a drive such 
that all parts of each file are located in the same place, improving per-
formance.
System restore
System Restore is a tool that be used to create restore points, 
or snapshots of an system at certain points in time that can be 
returned to when a system gets corrupted. When a restore is 
­performed, it leaves all data unaltered but returns the operating 
system settings to the state they were in when the restore point 
was created.
Windows Update
Windows is a tool that can be used to automate the process of check-
ing for updates and patches. Once the feature is enabled, the system 
will check with the Update website for missing patches on a schedule 
and keep the device up-to-date. You have four choices when it comes 
to the update process:
Install Updates Automatically: Downloads the updates and installs 
them when they are available
Download Updates And Let Me Choose When To Install: Downloads 
the updates and notifies the user
Check For Updates But Let Me Choose Whether To Download And 
Install Them: Just notifies the user an update is available
Never Check For Updates: Stops all update notifications

SERVICES.MSC, MMC, MSTSC, NOTEPAD, EXPLORER, MSINFO32, and DXDIAG.
1.5 Given a Scenario, Use Windows 
Control Panel Utilities
The Control Panel is often the first place to turn for configuration settings. The applets 
contained within allow you to customize the system and personalize it for each user.
There are a number of applets that every version of Windows has in common, but 
CompTIA specifically singles out a number of them for you to know. The topics covered in 
this chapter include the following:

Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Security
On the Security tab, as shown in Figure 5.31, you can choose both a zone and security level 
for the zone. The zones include Internet, Local Intranet, Trusted Sites, and Restricted Sites. 
The default security level for most of the zones is between High and Medium-High, but 
you can also select lower levels.
Privacy
Privacy settings, as shown in Figure 5.32, allow you to configure the privacy level, choose 
whether you want to provide location information, use Pop-up Blocker, and disable tool-
bars (and extensions) when InPrivate Browsing starts.

Display
This dialog box lets you configure screensavers, colors, display options, and monitor 
drivers.
Resolution
The resolution settings vary based on the OS, but typically they range from Low (800 × 600) 
to High (1280 × 800).
Color Depth
Color depth is either the number of bits used to indicate the color of a single pixel, in a bit-
mapped image or video frame buffer, or the number of bits used for each color component 
of a single pixel. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, this can be set on the Monitor tab of 
the properties of the adaptor, as shown in Figure 5.37.
F i g u r e  5 . 3 7    Windows 7 color depth
In Windows 8 and 8.1, color depth, resolution, and refresh rate are all the same drop-
down box and are found after clicking the List All Modes button on the Adapter tab of the 
display, as shown in Figure 5.38.

F i g u r e  5 . 3 8     Windows 8.1 color depth, refresh rate, and resolution
Refresh Rate
The refresh rate is the number of times in a second that a display updates its buffer and is 
expressed in hertz. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, the refresh rate is set using a drop-
down box just above the setting for color depth (see Figure 5.37). In Windows 8 and 8.1, 
the setting is located as described in the previous section, “Color Depth.”
User Accounts
This dialog box lets you create and manage user accounts, parental controls, and related 
settings. The default users created are Administrator, Guest, and the administrative 
account created during the install.
Folder Options
This dialog box lets you configure the look and feel of how folders are displayed in 
Windows Explorer.
View Hidden Files
On the View tab, shown in Figure 5.39, beneath Advanced Settings, you can choose the 
option Show Hidden Files, Folders, And Drives, and this will allow you to see those items.

View Options
Along with the setting that allows you to hide or show file extensions and to show hidden 
files are a number of other settings that affect what you see when you use File Explorer (as 
shown in Figure 5.39).
The opposite of this—the default setting—is Don’t Show Hidden Files, Folders, Or Drives. 
Radio buttons allow you to choose only one of these options.
A related check box that you should also clear in order to see all files is Hide Protected 
Operating System Files (Recommended). When this check box is cleared, those files will 
also appear in the view you are seeing.
Hide Extensions
On the View tab, shown in Figure 5.39, beneath Advanced Settings, you must clear the check box 
Hide Extensions For Known File Types in order for the extensions to be shown with the files.
General Options
You can configure the layout on the General tab of Folder Options (shown in Figure 5.40). 
Browsing options allow you to choose whether each folder will open in its own folder or 
the same folder. The Navigation Pane setting allows you to control what items are included 
in the tree structure that appears to the left when using File Explorer.

System
This utility allows you to view and configure various system elements. From within this 
one relatively innocuous panel, you can make a large number of configuration changes to 
a Windows machine. The different versions of Windows have different options available 
in this panel, but they will include some of the following: General, Network Identification, 
Device Manager, Hardware, Hardware Profiles, User Profiles, Environment, Startup/
Shutdown, Performance, System Restore, Automatic Updates, Remote, Computer Name, 
and Advanced.
The General tab gives you an overview of the system, such as OS version, registration 
information, basic hardware levels (Processor and RAM), and the service pack level that’s 
installed, if any.
Performance (Virtual Memory)
Performance settings are configured on the Advanced tab, as shown in Figure 5.41. 
Clicking the Settings button allows you to change the visual effects used on the system

As the name implies, the Windows Firewall applet can be used to manage the firewall 
included with the operating system. Figure 5.44 shows an example. In this case, the comput-
er’s firewall settings are being managed by the domain administrator. When the computer is 
outside of that network, the firewall settings are available to the user of the computer.

Power Options
Here you can configure different power schemes to adjust power consumption dictating 
when devices—the display and the computer—will turn off or be put to sleep. Through 
the Advanced Settings, you can configure the need to enter a password to revive the 
devices, as well as configure wireless adaptor settings, Internet options (namely, 
JavaScript), and the system sleep policy. Common choices include the following:
■
■
Standby puts your computer into energy-saving mode, where it uses little power.
■
■
Hibernate saves your workspace (all your open windows) and then turns the computer off.
■
■
Sleep/suspend puts your computer into an even deeper energy-saving mode than 
Standby, where it uses even less power.

1.5 Given a Scenario, Use Windows Control Panel Utilities 
377
Power plans are collections of power settings that determine when various compo-
nents in the device are shut down. There are some built-in plans available to you or you 
can create your own. There are three default plans: Balanced, which strikes a balance 
between performance and saving power; Power Saver, which errs on the side of saving 
power at the expense of performance; and High Performance, which errs on the side of 
performance over power saving. These options appear on the opening page when you 
open Power Options, as shown in Figure 5.45. To create a power, select Create A Power 
Plan from the tree menu on the left.
Programs and Features
Formerly known as Add/Remove Programs, this tool allows you to manage the pro-
grams running on the machine and the Windows features as well. Windows Features 
are tools and utilities that come with the operating system that may or may not be 
installed and running. You can uninstall any program you have installed here. When 
you select Turn Windows Features On Or Off from the menu on the left, you get a box 
that allows you to enable and disable Windows features, as shown in Figure 5.46.

Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
HomeGroup
In Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, but not Windows Vista, is an applet 
called HomeGoup. The purpose of HomeGroup (Start  Control Panel  HomeGroup) 
is to ­simplify home networking (the sharing of files and printers). Figure 5.47 shows 
the Homegroup applet for a device that is not currently connected to its home network. 
Windows 7 Starter can only join a HomeGroup, while all other editions of Windows 7 can 
both join and ­create a HomeGroup. The location must be set to Home.
Shared files can include libraries (a big feature of Windows 7). All computers participat-
ing in the HomeGroup must be running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1, and the 
network cannot extend outside of the small group.
Devices and Printers
While Windows Vista still makes use of the Add Printer Wizard, in Windows 7, Windows 
8, and Windows 8.1 the Devices And Printers applet is now where printers and other devices 
are managed. This tool is divided into three sections with printers in one, multimedia devices 
in another, and other devices in a third, as shown in Figure 5.48. To manage any device, you 
right-click the device and select its properties. The printers also can be double-clicked, and 
you can see what’s printing, manage the print queue, and adjust additional settings.

Sound
While Windows Vista still uses Hardware And Sound, the Windows 7, Windows 8, and 
Windows 8.1 operating systems have a Control Panel item called Sound that is used to 
manage all sound settings. You can manage the input devices (microphones, lines in) and 
the output devices (speakers, headphones) in one place. Moreover, you can enable and dis-
able the various Windows sounds that you hear when certain events occur. Figure 5.49 
shows the Sound applet.
Troubleshooting
Available only in Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, this applet (Start  Control 
Panel  Troubleshooting) is used to provide a simple interface to attack many common prob-
lems. All links preceded by a shield require administrator permissions to run and are often 
tied to UAC prompts before continuing. Most of the problems found will be “automatically 
fixed” without any prompts. For example, clicking the link Improve Power Usage will start 
the Power Troubleshooter and then fix problems that it identifies. Clicking the link to get help 
from a friend brings up Remote Assistance, allowing someone to connect to this computer. 
You can also offer to be the one helping another. Figure 5.50 shows this applet.

Network and Sharing Center
In Windows Vista, two applets were used to manage network settings, Network 
Connections and the Network Setup Wizard. In Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 
8.1, all the settings that were available there have been combined in an applet called 
Network And Sharing Center, where many sharing functions have also been relo-
cated. While most of the tools are dedicated to creating and managing both wireless 
and wired network connections, as you will see when I discuss sharing in detail in 
the ­section “3.3 Compare and Contrast Differences of Basic Windows OS Security 
Settings” in Chapter 7, some Advanced sharing functions are available in this applet. 
Figure 5.51 shows this applet.
Device Manager
Device Manager was discussed in several sections so far including Table 5.15 on 
Windows administrative tools and the section “1.4 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate 
Microsoft Operating System Features and Tools” earlier in this chapter. Figure 5.52

Client/Desktop
CompTIA offers a number of exams and certifications on networking (Network+, Server+, 
and so on), but to become A+ certified, you must have good knowledge of basic networking 
skills as they relate to the Windows operating system.
It’s important to know how network addressing works and the features offered in the 
Windows operating systems to simplify configuration. CompTIA expects you to have a 
broad range of knowledge in this category on some obscure features (such as QoS). The 
topics covered in this chapter include the following:
■
■
HomeGroup vs. a workgroup
■
■
Domain setup
■
■
Network shares/administrative shares/mapping drives
■
■
Printer sharing vs. network printer mapping

HomeGroup vs. Workgroup
As you learned in objective 1.5, HomeGroup offers a simplified way to set up a home net-
work. It allows you to share files (including libraries) and prevent changes from being made 
to those files by those sharing them (unless you give them permission to do so).

384 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
All computers participating in the HomeGroup must be running Windows 7, 
Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 and the network can never grow beyond a limited size. 
While all editions of Windows 7 can join a HomeGroup, not all can create a HomeGroup. 
Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 clients can do both.
An alternative to make sharing easier in the home is to add all the computers to a 
peer-to-peer network. A peer-to-peer network, one of two network types you can create 
in Windows (also known as a workgroup), consists of a number of workstations (two 
or more) that share resources among themselves. The resources shared are tradition-
ally file and print access, and every computer has the capacity to act as a workstation 
(by accessing resources from another machine) and as a server (by offering resources to 
other machines).
The other network type is client-server (or a domain). The primary distinction between 
workgroups and client-server networks is where security is controlled: locally on each 
workstation or centrally on a server. A domain is a centrally managed group of computers 
and physical proximity does not matter; the computers within a domain may all be on the 
same LAN or spread across a WAN.
The advantage of a peer-to-peer network is that the cost is lower; you need only add 
cards and cables to the computers you already have if you’re running an operating system 
that allows such modifications. With a server-based network, you must buy a server—a 
dedicated machine—and thus the costs are higher. It’s never recommended that a peer-to-
peer network be used for more than 10 workstations because the administration and man-
agement become so significant that a server-based network makes far greater sense.
Domain Setup
In a domain (also known as a client-server network), users log on to the server by supply-
ing a username and password. They’re then authenticated for the duration of their session. 
Rather than requiring users to give a password for every resource they want to access 
(share-level), security is based on how they authenticated themselves at the beginning of 
their session. This is known as user-level security, and it’s much more powerful than share-
level security.
To join a computer to a domain, use the following procedures in Vista:
1.	
Open Control Panel (Start  Control Panel).
2.	
Select System And Maintenance.
3.	
Click the System section.

1.	
Open System by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer, and then clicking 
Properties.
2.	
Under Computer Name, Domain, And Workgroup Settings, click Change Settings. If 
you’re prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or 
provide confirmation.
3.	
Click the Computer Name tab and then click Change.
4.	
Under Member Of, click Domain.
5.	
Type the name of the domain that you want to join and then click OK.
You will be asked to type your username and password for the domain. Once you are 
successfully joined to the domain, you will be prompted to restart your computer. You must 
restart your computer before the changes take effect.
To join a computer to a domain, use the following procedures in Windows 8 and 8.1:
1.	
Open System by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if 
you’re using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the 
mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering System in the search box, and 
tapping or clicking System.
2.	
Under Computer Name, Domain, And Workgroup Settings, click Change Settings. You 
might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.
3.	
Click Network ID and follow the steps on your screen. You will select a domain and 
enter the fully qualified name of the domain.
Network Shares/Administrative Shares Mapping 
Drives
Network shares can be mapped to drives to appear as if the resources are local. The NET 
USE command is used to establish network connections via a command prompt. For exam-
ple, to connect to a shared network drive and make it your M drive, you would use the 
­syntax net use m: \\server\share. Figure 5.53 shows an example of mapped drives. 
This can also be done in File Explorer, as shown in Figure 5.54.
NET USE can also be used to connect to a shared printer: net use lpt1: \\
printername.

386 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
An administrative share is one that is hidden to those file browsing. To connect to these 
drives, you must reference the name of the drive. While you can create a hidden drive at any 
time simply by adding a  dollar sign at the end of its name, there are some default adminis-
trative drives.

Printer Sharing vs. Network Printer Mapping
In Chapter 1 in the section “Public/Shared Devices,” you learned how to share a printer 
that is connected locally to a computer. It is also possible to connect to a network printer 
that is one that is not tied to a computer but has its own IP address and probably built-in 
print server. To connect or map a user’s device to one of these devices, follow the procedure 
to add a shared printer, and on the page you normally enter the UNC path to the shared 
printer, select the option Add A Printer Using A TCP/IP Address Or Hostname, as shown 
in Figure 5.55, and click Next.

Establishing Networking Connections
When configuring the connection method for accessing the Internet, the three choices 
Windows offers are This Computer Connects Directly To The Internet, This Computer 
Connects Through A Residential Gateway Or Another Computer, and Other. If you choose 
the first option, you can turn on Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) and allow this machine 
to serve as a proxy. The network connection you configure can be wireless or wired, dial-
up, or a VPN.
VPN    A virtual private network (VPN) is used when you want to connect from a remote location 
(such as home) to the company’s network (authenticating the user and encrypting the data).
Dialups    Dial-up connections are used when a modem must be used to gain access. 
Typically, the dial-up connection is to an Internet service provider (ISP) and used in remote 
locations where faster forms of access are not available.
Wireless    A wireless connection uses one of the 802.11 technologies, along with encryp-
tion (discussed in Chapter 7, “Security”) to connect to the network.
Wired    A wired connection uses a wire to connect the computer to the network. Typically, 
this is an Ethernet cable, such as 100BaseT (discussed in Chapter 2, “Networking”), which 
connects to a hub or switch and offers network access to the host.
WWAN (Cellular)    A wireless wide area network (WWAN) connection is one that uses cellular to 
connect the host to the network. A wireless service provider (such as AT&T, Sprint, or T-Mobile) 
will provide a card that is plugged into the host to make the cellular connection possible.

Connect To The Internet
Use for connection to a proxy server or other device 
intended to provide Internet access. This includes 
wireless, broadband, and dial-up.
Set Up A Wireless Router Or  
Access Point
If the wireless device will be connected to this 
machine, this is the option to use.
Manually Connect To A Wireless 
Network
If you have a wireless network already in place and 
the device (such as the router) is not directly con-
nected to this machine, then use this option.
Set Up A Wireless Ad Hoc (Com-
puter-To-Computer) Network
This is meant for peer-to-peer resource sharing via 
wireless network cards and typically a temporary 
connection.
Set Up A Dial-Up Connection
If you live in the middle of nowhere and the only way 
to access a network is by using a dial-up modem, 
then this is the option to select.
Connect To A Workplace
If you are needing to dial into a VPN from a remote 
location, this is the option to use.
Regardless of which option you choose, you will need to fill out the appropriate 
fields for the device to be able to communicate on the network. With TCP/IP, required 
values are an IP address for the host, subnet mask, address for the gateway, and DNS 
information.
Proxy Settings
Proxy settings identify the proxy server to be used to gain Internet access. The proxy server 
is responsible for making the Internet access possible and may utilize Network Address 
Translation (NAT) to translate between the public network (Internet) and the private 
­network (on which the host sits). These settings are configured in Internet Options, as 
shown in Figure 5.57, using the LAN Settings button in the Connections tab, which opens 
the dialog shown in Figure 5.57.

Remote Desktop Connection
Remote Desktop, which is not included in the Home editions of the operating systems, 
allows members of the Administrators group to gain access to the workstation. (You 
can specifically allow other users as well.) By default, Remote Desktop is not enabled on 
Windows 7 or Windows Vista, but you can enable it from Remote Settings in the Control 
Panel applet System And Security. To enable Remote Desktop connections in Windows 
Vista and Windows 7, follow these steps:
1.	
Right-click the Computer icon and choose Properties, or you can type system into the 
Start menu search box and then find the entry for System.
2.	
Click the Remote Settings link on the left side.
3.	
Select one of the two options allowing Remote Desktop connections, as shown in 
Figure 5.58.
To enable Remote Desktop connections in Windows 8 and 8.1, follow these steps:
1.	
Open the desktop Control Panel and find the System panel there, or you can search for 
Remote Access in the Start menu or Start screen.
2.	
Click Allow Remote Access To Your Computer.

Remote Assistance
Remote Assistance is a tool that allows you to connect to a remote computer to provide 
assistance to another user currently logged into that computer. When you connect via 
Remote Assistance, you do not have to log into that computer; instead, invitations are sent 
from the host computer to you so you can take over the computer. You can use the remote 
computer (the host computer) as if you are sitting in front of it. The user on the other end 
can watch your activities onscreen. At any time, either user can terminate the session. To 
configure this feature, follow these steps:
1.	
Type Remote.
2.	
Click Settings under the Search box.
3.	
Click Allow Remote Assistance Invitations To Be Sent From This Computer. The Sys-
tem Properties dialog box appears, with the Remote tab showing.
4.

Home vs. Work vs. Public Network Settings
In Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows 8, when you make a new connection, you 
are asked to identify whether it is a home network, work network, or public network. If 
you choose one of the first two, network discovery is on by default, allowing you to see 
other computers and other computers to see you. If you choose Public, network discovery is 
turned off. In Figure 5.61, you can see that the device is connected to a public network.
Firewall Settings
Windows Firewall (Start  Control Panel  Windows Firewall) is used to block access from 
the network. In Windows 7, it is divided into separate settings for private networks and 
public networks.
Exceptions
Exceptions are configured as variations from the rules. Windows Firewall will block incom-
ing network connections except for the programs and services that you choose to allow 
through. For example, you can make an exception for Remote Assistance to allow commu-
nication from other computers when you need help (the scope of the exception can be set to 
F i g u r e  5 .61     Public network

394 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
allow any computer, only those on the network, or a custom list of allowed addresses you 
create). Exceptions can include programs as well as individual ports.
Configuration
Most of the configuration is done as network connection settings. You can configure both 
ICMP and Services settings. Examples of ICMP settings include allowing incoming echo 
requests, allowing incoming router requests, and allowing redirects. Examples of services 
often configured include an FTP server, Post-Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3), and web 
server (HTTP).
Enabling/Disabling Windows Firewall
On the General tab of Windows Firewall, it is possible to choose the radio button Off (Not 
Recommended). As the name implies, this turns Windows Firewall completely off. The 
other radio button option, On (Recommended), enables the firewall. You can also toggle 
the check box Don’t Allow Exceptions. This option should be enabled when you’re connect-
ing to a public network in an unsecure location (such as an airport or library), and it will 
then ignore any exceptions that were configured.
Configuring an Alternative IP Address in Windows
Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows 8 and 8.1 all allow the use of an alternate IP 
address. This is an address that is configured for the system to use in the event the first 
choice is not available. The first choice can be either a dynamic or static address, and the 
alternate is used only if the primary cannot be found or used, such as when the DHCP 
server is down.
The Properties dialog box for each instance of IPv4—on any of the Windows operating 
systems this exam focuses on—contains an Alternate Configuration tab. To make changes, 
you must click it.
IP Addressing
Two radio buttons appear on the Alternate Configuration tab, as shown in Figure 5.62: 
Automatic Private IP Address and User Configured. The default is the first, meaning 
that the alternate address used is one in the APIPA range (169.254.x.x). Selecting User 
Configured requires you to enter a static IP address to be used in the IP address field. The 
entry entered must be valid for your network for it to be usable (see Chapter 2 for more 
information on IP addressing).
Subnet Mask
When you select the User Configured radio button on the Alternate Configuration tab, you 
must enter a value in the Subnet Mask field. This value must correspond with the subnet 
values in use on your network and work with the IP address you enter in the field above 
(see Chapter 2 for more information on subnet addresses).

1.6 Given a Scenario, Install and Configure Windows Networking 
395
DNS
When you select the User Configured radio button on the Alternate Configuration tab, you 
should enter values in the fields Preferred DNS Server and Alternate DNS Server. These 
entries are needed in order to translate domain names into IP addresses (see Chapter 2 for 
more information on DNS).
Gateway
When you select the User Configured radio button on the Alternate Configuration tab, you 
must enter a value in the Default Gateway field. This value must correspond with the subnet 
values and the IP address you enter in the fields above. This address identifies the router to 
be used to communicate outside the local network (see Chapter 2 for more information on 
default gateways).
Network Card Properties
Like other devices, network cards can be configured to optimize performance. Configuration 
is done through the Properties dialog box for each card.

Half Duplex/Full Duplex/Auto
Duplexing is the means by which communication takes place.
■
■
With full duplexing, everyone can send and receive at the same time. The main 
advantage of full-duplex over half-duplex communication is performance. NICs 
can operate twice as fast in full-duplex mode as they do normally in half-duplex 
mode.
■
■
With half duplexing, communications travel in both directions, but in only one 
direction at any given time. Think of a road where construction is being done on 
one lane—traffic can go in both directions but in only one direction at a time at 
that location.
■
■
With auto duplexing, the mode is set to the lowest common denominator. If a card 
senses another card is manually configured to half duplex, then it also sets itself at 
that.
Duplexing is set using the Advanced tab on the Properties of the network card, as shown 
in Figure 5.63.
F i g u r e  5 .6 3     Setting speed and duplex

Speed
The speed allows you to configure whether the card should run at its highest possible set-
ting. You often need to be compatible with the network on which the host resides. If, for 
example, you are connecting a workstation with a 10/100BaseT card to a legacy network, 
you will need to operate at 10 MBps to match the rest of the network. This is done along 
with duplex, as shown in Figure 5.63.
Wake-on-LAN
Wake-on-LAN (WoL) is an Ethernet standard implemented via a card that allows a “sleep-
ing” machine to awaken when it receives a wakeup signal.
QoS
Quality of Service (QoS) implements packet scheduling to control the flow of traffic and help 
with network transmission speeds. No properties can be configured for the service itself.
BIOS (Onboard NIC)
While some older devices may have network cards installed in slots, most devices now have 
integrated or built-in network interfaces on the motherboard. While these interfaces will be 
recognized and set up automatically, if you find you do not see an integrated interface when 
you go to Network And Sharing, you may need to enable the interface in the BIOS. The steps 
to locate this setting are specific to the BIOS on the machine, but if you identify the BIOS ven-
dor and the version, you should be able to look up the steps on the BIOS vendor website.
Exam Essentials
Know what values are needed for network connectivity.    Regardless of which network 
access method you choose, you will need to fill out the appropriate fields for the device to 
be able to communicate on the network. With TCP/IP, required values are an IP address for 
the host, subnet mask, address for the gateway, and DNS information.
Understand the purpose of HomeGroup.    The HomeGroup feature was added to Windows 
7 as a simplified way to set up a home network. It works only with Windows 7 and allows 
you to share files (including libraries) and resources.
1.7 Perform Common Preventive

Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Best practices exist to define what should be done to keep systems maintained. The first 
section under this objective focuses on the best practices related to preventive maintenance, 
and the second section explores the tools used to put many of those practices into play. The 
topics covered in this chapter include the following:
■

Best practices

Tools
Best Practices
Preventive maintenance is more than just manipulating hardware; it also encompasses 
running software utilities on a regular basis to keep the filesystem fit. These utilities can 
include scheduled backups, check disks, defragmentation, and updates.
Scheduled Backups
Backups are duplicate copies of key information, ideally stored in a location other than the 
one where the information is currently stored. Backups include both paper and computer 
records. Computer records are usually backed up using a backup program, backup systems, 
and backup procedures.
The primary starting point for disaster recovery involves keeping current backup copies 
of key data files, databases, applications, and paper records available for use. Your organi-
zation must develop a solid set of procedures to manage this process and ensure that all key 
information is protected. A security professional can do several things in conjunction with 
systems administrators and business managers to protect this information. It’s important to 
think of this problem as an issue that is larger than a single department.
The information you back up must be immediately available for use when needed. If a 
user loses a critical file, they won’t want to wait several days while data files are sent from a 
remote storage facility. Several types of storage mechanisms are available for data storage.
Working Copies    Working copy backups—sometimes referred to as shadow copies—are 
partial or full backups that are kept on the premises for immediate recovery purposes. 
Working copies are frequently the most recent backups that have been made.
Typically, working copies are intended for immediate use. These copies are often 
updated on a frequent basis.
Many filesystems used on servers include journaling. Journaled filesystems (JFSs) include 
a log file of all changes and transactions that have occurred within a set period of time 
(such as the last few hours). If a crash occurs, the operating system can look at the log files 
to see which transactions have been committed and which ones haven’t. This technology 
works well and allows unsaved data to be written after the recovery and the system (usu-
ally) to be successfully restored to its condition before the crash.
Onsite Storage    Onsite storage usually refers to a location on the site of the computer 
center that is used to store information locally. Onsite storage containers are available that 
allow computer cartridges, tapes, and other backup media to be stored in a reasonably 
protected environment in the building.

1.7 Perform Common Preventive Maintenance Procedures 
399
Onsite storage containers are designed and rated for fire, moisture, and pressure resis-
tance. These containers aren’t fireproof in most situations, but they’re fire-rated: a fireproof 
container should be guaranteed to withstand damage regardless of the type of fire or tem-
peratures, whereas fire ratings specify that a container can protect the contents for a spe-
cific amount of time in a given situation.
If you choose to depend entirely on onsite storage, make sure the containers you acquire 
can withstand the worst-case environmental catastrophes that could happen at your loca-
tion. Make sure as well that those containers are in locations where you can easily find 
them after the disaster and access them (near exterior walls, and so on).
Offsite Storage    Offsite storage refers to a location away from the computer center where 
paper copies and backup media are kept. Offsite storage can involve something as simple as 
keeping a copy of backup media at a remote office, or it can be as complicated as a nuclear-
hardened high-security storage facility. The storage facility should be bonded, insured, and 
inspected on a regular basis to ensure that all storage procedures are being followed.
Determining which storage mechanism to use should be based on the needs of the orga-
nization, the availability of storage facilities, and the budget available. Most offsite storage 
facilities charge based on the amount of space you require and the frequency of access you 
need to the stored information.
Three methods exist to back up information on most systems.
Full Backup    A full backup is a complete, comprehensive backup of all files on a disk or 
server. The full backup is current only at the time it’s performed. Once a full backup is 
made, you have a complete archive of the system at that point in time. A system shouldn’t 
be in use while it undergoes a full backup because some files may not get backed up. Once 
the system goes back into operation, the backup is no longer current. A full backup can be 
a time-consuming process on a large system.
Incremental Backup    An incremental backup is a partial backup that stores only the infor-
mation that has been changed since the last full or incremental backup. If a full backup were 
performed on a Sunday night, an incremental backup done on Monday night would contain 
only the information that changed since Sunday night. Such a backup is typically consider-
ably smaller than a full backup. This backup system requires that each incremental backup 
be retained until a full backup can be performed. Incremental backups are usually the fastest 
backups to perform on most systems, and each incremental tape is relatively small.
Differential Backup    A differential backup is similar in function to an incremental backup, 
but it backs up any files that have been altered since the last full backup; it makes dupli-
cate copies of files that haven’t changed since the last differential backup. If a full backup 
was performed on Sunday night, a differential backup performed on Monday night would 
capture the information that was changed on Monday. A differential backup completed on 
Tuesday night would record the changes in any files from Monday and any changes in files 
on Tuesday. As you can see, during the week each differential backup would become larger; 
by Friday or Saturday night, it might be nearly as large as a full backup. This means the 
backups in the earliest part of the weekly cycle will be very fast, and each successive one 
will be slower.

400 
Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
When these backup methods are used in conjunction with each other, the risk of loss can 
be greatly reduced. You should never combine an incremental backup with a differential 
backup. One of the major factors in determining which combination of these three methods 
to use is time—ideally, a full backup would be performed every day. Several commercial 
backup programs support these three backup methods. You must evaluate your organiza-
tional needs when choosing which tools to use to accomplish backups.
Almost every stable operating system contains a utility for creating a copy of configura-
tion settings necessary to reach the present state after a disaster. As an administrator, you 
must know how to do backups and be familiar with all the options available to you.
Scheduled Disk Maintenance
Several additional maintenance operations can be used on a regular basis to prevent perfor-
mance issues that will arise from simply using the devices. This section covers two impor-
tant performance-enhancing maintenance tasks.
Scheduled Check Disks
I recommend that in addition to backups you also regularly run CHKDSK. You can so by 
manually running the tool, or you can configure Task Scheduler to run it on a routine basis.
To manually run it, you can start chkdsk.exe in a command window, or you can right-
click the drive in My Computer, choose Properties, click the Tools tab, and select Check Now.
Scheduled Defragmentation
Defragmenting the disk moves the files on the disk so the data is contiguously located when 
possible. Both volume and file fragmentation occurs as files continue to grow through nor-
mal usage, and thus defragmentation should be done on a regular basis.
Just as you can right-click a drive in My Computer, choose Properties, and click the 
Tools tab to start a CHKDSK routine, you can also start defragmentation from here by 
selecting Defragment Now. The Task Scheduler can be used to schedule the program 
(Defrag.exe or Dfrgntfs.exe) to regularly run.
Windows Updates
Windows Updates were discussed in the section “Driver Installation, Software and Windows 
Updates.” After the installation, however, you should configure the system to regularly check 
for and install updates. To do this in Windows Vista, follow these steps:

install updates to other Microsoft software programs installed on the machine. You should 
make a practice of routinely checking with vendors of other programs you use for patches 
they release, many of which address issues of security and functionality.
Always check the patches on test machines before applying them to production 
machines—they may occasionally disrupt or affect operations your company relies on.
Driver/Firmware Updates
Device drivers are the software stubs that allow devices to communicate with the operat-
ing system. Called drivers for short, they’re used for interacting with printers, monitors, 
network cards, sound cards, and just about every type of hardware attached to the PC. 
One of the most common problems associated with drivers isn’t having the current ver-
sion. As problems are fixed, the drivers are updated, and you can often save a great deal of 
time by downloading the latest drivers from the vendor’s site early in the troubleshooting 
process. The easiest way to change drivers in Windows is to right-click the device in Device 
Manager and select Update Driver Software, as shown in Figure 5.64.

Chapter 5  ■  Windows Operating Systems  
Any software that is built into a hardware device is called firmware. Firmware is typi-
cally in flash ROM and can be updated as newer versions become available. An example of 
firmware is the software in a laser printer that controls it and allows you to interact with it 
at the console (usually through a limited menu of options).
Firmware and driver updates are often released by hardware vendors. You should rou-
tinely check their sites for patches and updates that you need to download and install.
Antivirus/Antimalware Updates
While malware will be discussed extensively in Chapter 7, antivirus and antimalware 
updates should be regularly updated (with particular interest paid to the definition files). 
While steps and options to configure these updates are unique to each product, with respect 
to the built-in Windows tools, such as Windows Defender, those definitions will be updated 
along with other updates you receive from Windows Update.

Tools
A number of tools are available to ensure the safety of your data and the operating system. 
This section discusses five tools you need to know about: Backup, Check Disk, Defrag, 
System Restore, and Recovery Image.
Backup
The Backup utility allows you to create the backups discussed regarding best practices ear-
lier. To access this tool in Windows Vista, follow these steps:
1.	
Click Start.
2.	
Click Control Panel.
3.	
Double-click Backup And Restore Center.
4.	
Click Back Up Files.
5.	
When the User Account Control dialog box opens, click Continue.
6.	
Decide where you want to save your backup.
7.	
Choose the option that you want to use to back up.
8.	
Click Next.
9.	
On the Which Disks Do You Want To Include In The Backup? dialog box, select the 
disks you want to back up.
10.	 Click Next.
11.	 On the Which File Types Do You Want To Include In The Backup? dialog box, 
uncheck any files types you do not want to back up.
12.	 Click Next.
13.	 Select how often you want your backups to happen.
14.	 Click Save Settings And Start Backup.
15.	 Insert blank media into the appropriate drive. When prompted, insert each new disc 
and label each one as instructed.
To perform this in Windows 7, follow these steps:
1.	
Right-click the drive and select Properties. Then click the Tools tab and click the Back 
Up Now button.
2.	
In the Back Up Or Restore Your Files window, click the link to set up a backup.
3.	
Windows will search for a suitable drive to store the backup, or you can also choose a 
location on your network.
4.	
Select either of the following:
■
■
Let Windows Choose (What To Backup)
■
■
Let Me Choose (What To Backup)
5.	
If you chose Let Me Choose, select the files and folder to include in the backup.

Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
 6. 
 Review the backup job and make sure everything looks correct. 
 7. 
 Schedule the days and times the backup occurs. 
 8. 
 Save the backup settings and start the backup. 
 In Windows 8 and 8.1, backups are done through the File History tool. To do this, you 
have to set up a drive for File History. Follow these instructions: 
 1. 
 Swipe in from the right edge of the screen and then tap or Search or point to 
the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click 
Search. 
 2.  Enter  File History settings in the search box, and then tap or click File History 
 settings. 
 3.  Tap or click Select A Drive, and choose the network or external drive you want 
to use. 
 4. 
 Select Turn On File History. 
 File History only backs up copies of files that are in the  Documents ,  Music , 
Pictures ,  Videos , and  Desktop folders and the OneDrive files available 
offline on your PC. If you have files or folders elsewhere that you want 
backed up, you can add them to one of these folders. 
 System Restore 
 To access the System Restore tool, choose the System applet in the Control Panel and then 
the System Protection tab (see Figure  5.65 ). By clicking the System Restore button, you can 
revert to an earlier restore point and circumvent problems that have recently occurred with 
system settings or corrupted fi les. 
 From here, you can also manually create a restore point, confi gure what is included in a 
restore point, and specify how much space you are allowing to be used for saving these fi les 
(setting the space to 0 percent effectively disables the creation of restore points). 
 Recovery Image 
 A  recovery image , also known as a  system image , is an image that includes all the drives 
required for Windows to run as well as default system settings, programs, and fi les. If you 
replace a failed hard drive in a workstation, you can use the recovery image to replicate the 
initial settings (you can’t choose individual items to restore) and then turn to the backups to 
bring the system back up-to-date. 
 Many OEM vendors include a recovery image with new systems they ship. That image 
may be on a recovery disc (CD or DVD) or on a partition that can be accessed after POST. 
Obviously, vendors prefer the partition approach since it saves shipping any physical item, 
but it is of no use at all in the event of a full failure of the hard drive. 

Disk Maintenance Utilities
Several tools are available in Windows to help keep the disk system operating at peak per-
formance. While I discussed scheduling CHKDSK and the graphical version of Defrag in 
the section “Scheduled Disk Maintenance,” in this section I will talk a bit more in depth 
about these tools.
Check Disk
Check Disk is a Windows graphical utility for finding and fixing logical errors and option-
ally for checking each sector of the physical disk and relocating any readable data from 
damaged spots.
Check Disk isn’t a menu command on the Start menu. To run it, display the Properties 
box for a hard disk and then select the Check Now button in the Error-Checking section of 
the Tools tab, as shown in Figure 5.66.

Chapter 5 ■ Windows Operating Systems
 Do not be confused by CHKDSK—an old MS-DOS utility used to correct 
logical errors in the FAT. The most common switch for the  CHKDSK com-
mand is  /F , which fixes the errors that it finds. Without  /F , Chkdsk acts as 
an “information only” utility. 
 Defrag 
 Disk Defragmenter reorganizes the fi le storage on a disk to reduce the number of fi les that 
are stored noncontiguously. This makes fi le retrieval faster because the read/write heads on 
the disk have to move less. 
 F I g u r E 5 .6 6   The Tools tab for a hard drive 

There are two versions of Disk Defragmenter: a Windows version that runs from within 
Windows and a command-line version (DEFRAG.EXE). In addition to being on the Tools tab 
(shown in Figure 5.66), the Windows version is located on the System Tools submenu on 
the Start menu (Start  All Programs  Accessories  System Tools  Disk Defragmenter).
The available switches for the command-line version of DEFRAG.EXE in Windows 8.1 
include the following:
■
■
/A: Perform analysis on the specified volumes.
■
■
/C: Perform the operation on all volumes.
■
■
/D: Perform a traditional defrag (this is the default).
■
■
/E: Perform the operation on all volumes except those specified.
■
■
/H: Run the operation at normal priority (the default is low).
■
■
/K: Perform slab consolidation on the specified volumes.
■
■
/L: Perform a retrim on the specified volumes.
■
■
/M: Run the operation on each volume in parallel in the background.
■
■
/O: Perform the proper optimization for each media type.
■
■
/T: Track an operation already in progress on the specified volume.
■
■
/U: Print the progress of the operation on the screen.
■
■
/V: Print verbose output containing the fragmentation statistics.
■
■
/X: Perform free space consolidation on the specified volumes.
Exam Essentials

While the overwhelming percentage of devices you will come 
into contact with will be Windows devices, you will also 
encounter other operating systems. The Linux operating sys-
tem and the Mac OS are increasingly found in enterprise networks in situations where their 
strengths can be leveraged. There are also many other technologies that you may not be 
directly managing, but you should still be familiar with them and understand their pur-
pose. This chapter will focus on these areas.
2.1 Identify Common Features and 
Functionality of the Mac OS and Linux 
Operating Systems
In your career, you are almost certain to come in contact with both the Linux and Mac 
OS operating systems (since 2001 the Mac OS system has been called OS X, so you may 
consider those terms interchangeable). Despite that these systems constitute only a small 
percentage of the total number of devices found in the enterprise, the proponents of both 
of these systems are cult-like in their devotion to both operating systems. Linux is prob-
ably used more often, in part because many proprietary operating systems that reside on 
devices such as access points, switches, routers, and firewalls are Linux-based. In this 
section of the chapter, you will be introduced to some of the common features and func-
tions in these operating systems. The subobjectives covered in this section include the 
following:

Best Practices
Like with any operating system, Linux and Mac OS will function better and with more 
reliability with the proper care. This section will discuss some of the best practices that 
have been developed over the years for using these operating systems.

2.1 Identify Common Features and Functionality of the Mac OS 
415
Scheduled Backups
In Linux, backups of data can be scheduled using the rsync utility from the command line. 
While there is another utility, cp, that can be used, rsync prevents unnecessary copying 
when the destination file has not been changed. It also can operate locally and remotely. It 
also encrypts the transfer. The basic syntax is as follows, where the a switch tells rsync to 
work in “archive” mode:
rsync -a [source dir] [destination dir]
As with any command-line utility, you can create batch files and schedule these 
backups.
In Mac OS, you can also use rsync, but another tool is available. With Time Machine, 
you can back up your entire Mac, including system files, apps, music, photos, e-mails, and 
documents. When Time Machine is enabled, it automatically backs up your Mac and per-
forms hourly, daily, and weekly backups of your files.
Scheduled Disk Maintenance
Because Linux systems manage the disk differently than Windows, they need no defrag-
mentation. There is a maintenance task you may want to schedule in Linux. From time 
to time you should run a filesystem checker called fsck. This is a logical filesystem 
checker.
The Mac OS needs defragmentation in only a small number of cases. If the user 
creates large numbers of multimedia files and the drive has been filling for quite some 
time, the system may benefit from defragmentation. However, in most cases, this is not 
required.
One task that is beneficial to execute from time to time is to check the health of the 
disk using the Disk Utility’s Verify Disk functionality. While many disk operations 
(including the use of Time Machine) require booting to a different drive to perform the 
operation on the drive in question, Disk Utility can perform a live verification without 
doing this.
System Updates/App Store
Many of the versions of Linux now make updates much easier than in the past. Both 
Ubuntu and Fedora offer a GUI tool (shocking!) for this. In Ubuntu, for example, choosing 
System ➢ Administration and then selecting the Update Manager entry will open Update 
Manager. When it opens, click the Check button to see whether there are updates available. 
Figure 6.1 shows a list of available updates.
Of course, you can still do this from the command line. Follow these steps:
1.	
Open a terminal window.
2.	
Issue the command sudo apt-get upgrade.
3.	
Enter your user’s password.

4.	
Look over the list of available updates and decide whether you want to go through 
with the entire upgrade.
5.	
When the desired updates have been selected, press the Install Updates button.
6.	
Watch as the update happens.
F i g u r e   6 .1    Ubuntu Update Manager
In Mac OS, updates can come either directly from Apple or from the Apple Store. To 
make updates automatic, access Software Update preferences, where you can set it to daily, 
monthly, or weekly, as shown in Figure 6.2.

Patch Management
While in the past patch management in Linux and Mac OS presented more of a challenge 
than with Windows, today the same tool used to manage patches with Windows (System 
Center Configuration Manager) can now be used to patch additional systems such as Linux 
and Mac. There are also third-party tools such as Spacewalk that can manage updates.
Driver/Firmware Updates
Updating drivers and firmware in Linux can be done either during the installation or 
afterward. Some versions such as Red Hat recommend installing first and then performing 
the upgrade. While the upgrade process varies from version to version, in Ubuntu either 
you can wait until a new version of the OS is released (which is once every six months)
and get the update from the Software Update Center, or you can access what is called a 
personal package archive (PPA). These PPAs are repositories containing drivers that can 
be easily made available to the Ubuntu Update Manager by adding the PPA to the local 
system. Once added, the drivers will appear as available when you access the local Ubuntu 
Update Manager, as shown in Figure 6.3.
In Red Hat, driver and firmware updates download the driver update RPM package from 
the location specified by Red Hat or your hardware vendor. Then locate and double-click the 
file that you downloaded. The system might prompt you for the root password, after which it 
will present the Installing packages box, shown in Figure 6.4. Then click Apply.

F i g u r e   6 . 4    Installing packages
On Mac OS, firmware and driver updates are obtained from the Apple Support site. 
After downloading the update, the system will restart, and while a gray screen appears, the 
update will be applied.
Antivirus/Antimalware Updates
All the major antivirus and antimalware vendors create products for both Mac and com-
mercial versions of Linux. Updates to the engines and definitions for these applications are

done in a similar fashion to Windows. Checks for updates can be scheduled just as is done 
in Windows.
Tools
Tools exist to perform maintenance, some of which I have already mentioned. This section 
will cover some of these utilities and functions.
Backup/Time Machine
For all Linux versions, backup tools are available for free and for a fee. You can also use 
the tar and cpio command-line utilities to construct full or partial backups of the system. 
Each utility constructs a large file that contains, or archives, other files. In addition to file 
contents, an archive includes header information for each file it holds. Table 6.1 lists the 
parameters of the tar command.
Ta b l e  6 .1    tar parameters

On Mac OS you can use Time Machine, discussed earlier in the section “Scheduled 
Backups.” Figure 6.5 shows this tool and some of its options.

Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
F i g u r e   6 . 5     Time Machine
Restore/Snapshot
In Linux, the snapshot feature provides the ability to create a volume image of a device at 
a particular instant without causing a service interruption. When a change is made to the 
original device (the origin) after a snapshot is taken, the snapshot feature makes a copy of 
the changed data area as it was prior to the change so that it can reconstruct the state of 
the device. You can use the -s argument of the lvcreate command to create a snapshot 
volume.
To restore a snapshot, first change the directory to where the snapshots are located. 
Once there, change to the hidden subdirectory called .snapshot. There you will find 
directories such as nightly.0, nightly.1, …, nightly.2, hourly.0, hourly.1, …, and 
hourly.10 (use the ls to command to see them). Change to the directory that still contains 
your file and copy it to its original location.
You can use the Time Machine tool to restore files in Mac. The steps are as follows:
1.	
Select the Time Machine icon from the menu.
2.	
Select Enter Time Machine.
3.	
You’ll be taken to the Time Machine window. Here you can navigate to the file or 
folder you need to retrieve.
4.	
Locate the file or folder and click the Restore button.
5.	
Time Machine will copy that file to its original location on your hard disk.

Image Recovery
Recovering an entire image in either system is not different from restoring a single file. In 
Linux, you can use the rsync utility to restore a snapshot. On Mac you use Disk Utility 
in conjunction with a backup of the system and the OS media. To do this, follow these 
steps:
1.	
Connect the external hard drive that contains the backup to the Mac to which you are 
restoring.
2.	
Insert the OS X CD and restart it.
3.	
Hold down the C key while booting to boot to the Mac OS X CD and select your language.
4.	
From the Utilities menu, select Disk Utility.
5.	
Select the drive the backup is stored on.
6.	
Select the Restore tab. Select that disk and drag that to the Source window. If you cre-
ated a .dmg image, you’ll need to click the drive you saved the image to (do not drag it), 
click Image, and select the disk image from the drive you stored it on.
7.	
In the left pane of Disk Utility, click your hard drive and drag it to the Destination window.
8.	
Check the Erase Destination check box to erase your old hard drive and replace it with 
the disk image you’ve selected as the source.
9.	
Click Restore. Click OK to verify.

Shell/Terminal
In Linux, a shell is a command-line interface, of which there are several types. A terminal is 
a window that appears when you press Ctrl+Alt+T. They both accept commands, but they 
are two separate programs. The following are some differences:
■
■
A terminal window can run different shells depending on what you have configured.
■
■
Certain interactive applications can be run in the terminal emulator and they will run 
in the same window.
■
■
Remote logins, using a program like SSH, can be run from inside a terminal window.
Mac OS calls the shell Terminal, and you can find it under Applications ➢ Utilities ➢ 
Terminal, as shown in Figure 6.6.

Screen Sharing
In Linux, you can share a screen with others by using third-party tools, but you can also do 
it using the following procedure as a root user:
1.	
Change permissions to allow users to get added to the session by typing chmod u+s /
usr/bin/screen (which allows a user to run an executable file of the specific owner 
who is launching the screen).
2.	
Change the access permission of the screen mode by typing chmod 755 /var/run/
screen.
3.	
Log out from SSH as a root user.
4.	
Type the command Screen to start the new screen.

2.1 Identify Common Features and Functionality of the Mac OS 
423
5.	
Change the screen mode from single user to multiuser. Press Ctrl+A and then type 
':multiuser on' //.
6.	
Add the user into the screen (in this case the user is jack), press Ctrl+A, and then type 
':acl name' // Ex: :acladd jack -.
7.	
The user joins the screen so that both can work in the same terminal by typing screen 
-x name_of_screen_session.
In Mac, a screen-sharing tool is built in. In OS X Yosemite, the process is as follows:
1.	
Open Sharing preferences (choose Apple menu ➢ System Preferences and then click 
Sharing).
2.	
Select the Screen Sharing check box. If Remote Management is selected, you must dese-
lect it before you can select Screen Sharing.
3.	
To specify who can share your screen, select one of the following:
■
■
All users: Anyone with a user account on your Mac can share your screen.
■
■
Only these users: Screen sharing is restricted to specific users.
4.	
If you selected Only These Users, click Add at the bottom of the users list, and then do 
one of the following:
■
■
Select a user from Users & Groups, which includes all the users of your Mac.
■
■
Select a user from Network Users or Network Groups, which includes everyone on 
your network.
5.	
To let others share your screen without having a user account on your Mac, click Com-
puter Settings, and then select one or both of the following:
■
■
Anyone may request permission to control screen: Before other computer users 
begin screen sharing your Mac, they can ask for permission instead of entering a 
username and password.
■
■
VNC viewers may control screen with password: Other users can share your 
screen using a VNC viewer app—on iPad or a Windows PC, for example—by 
entering the password you specify here.
Force Quit
Force quit can be used on a Mac to stop an unresponsive application. To use this function, 
follow these steps:
1.	
Choose Force Quit from the Apple menu or press Command-Option-Esc.
2.	
Select the unresponsive app in the Force Quit Applications window, as shown in 
Figure 6.7, and then click Force Quit.
In Linux you can use the xkill feature to kill a program you click. To do this, follow 
these steps:
1.	
Press Alt+F2 and type in gnome-terminal to open a terminal session.
2.	
Inside the terminal type in sudo xkill, then click any window to kill it.

Features
Now that you have looked at maintenance on these systems, let’s examine some of 
the key features you will find in the Mac OS and Linux variants. You can find many 
of these features in Windows with different names and different combinations of 
functions.
Multiple Desktops/Mission Control
In Apple, Mission Control provides a quick way to see everything that’s currently open on 
your Mac. To use Mission Control, do one of the following:
■
■
Swipe up with three or four fingers on your trackpad.
■
■
Double-tap the surface of your Magic Mouse with two fingers.
■
■
Click the Mission Control icon in the Dock or Launchpad.
■
■
On an Apple keyboard, press the Mission Control key.
Regardless of how you invoke Mission Control, all your open windows and spaces are 
visible, grouped by app. You can also use the tool to create desktops that are called spaces 
and place certain apps in certain spaces. Moreover, you can switch between the spaces in 
the same session.
When you enter Mission Control, all your spaces appear along the top of your screen. 
The desktop you’re currently using is shown below the row of spaces. To move an app 
window to another space, drag it from your current desktop to the space at the top of the 
screen.

425
To switch between spaces, do one of the following:
■
■
Enter Mission Control and click the space you want at the top of the Mission Control 
window.
■
■
Swipe three or four fingers left or right across your trackpad to move to the previous or 
next space.
■
■
Press Ctrl+Right Arrow or Ctrl+Left Arrow on your keyboard to move through your 
current spaces. Then click a window to bring it to the front of your view.
In Linux you can do this using what are called workspace switchers, which must be 
activated. For example, Figure 6.8 shows the activation window in Ubuntu Unity. Once it’s 
activated, you can create and populate workspaces and use Workspace Switcher to move 
from one to another, much like you do in Mac.

Key Chain
Keychain is the password management system in OS X. It can contain private keys, certifi-
cates, and secure notes. In Mac OS X, keychain files are stored in ∼/Library/Keychains/, /
Library/Keychains/, and /Network/Library/Keychains/. Keychain Access is a Mac OS X 
application that allows a user to access the Keychain and configure its contents.

Spot Light
Spot Light is a search tool built into Mac systems. To open Spot Light, click the magnifying 
glass icon in the upper-right corner of the menu bar, or press Command+spacebar from any 
app. Spot Light results can include dictionary definitions, currency conversions, and quick 
calculations. It will search the Web as well, but you can limit its scope to just search the Mac.
iCloud
iCloud is Apple’s cloud storage solution, much like OneDrive in Windows. It also allows for the 
automatic synchronization of information across all devices of the user. In addition, it can be used 
to locate an iPhone and can be a location to which a backup can be stored. All Mac users are pro-
vided with 5 GB of free storage and then can purchase additional storage for a monthly fee.
Gestures
Gestures are used in Mac to interact with a touchscreen. It is based on using multitouch, 
which allows you to touch the screen in more than one place and initiate specific subrou-
tines called gestures such as when expanding or reducing a photo.
Finder
While Finder can also be used on a Mac to search for files, its main function is a filesystem 
navigation tool, much like Windows Explorer. To open a new Finder window, click the Finder 
icon in the Dock and then select File ➢ New Window. Figure 6.9 shows a Finder window.

Remote Disk
Remote Disk is an icon that appears under Devices as well as under Computer that allows 
you to see which computers on the same network have drives available to share. When 
computers on the same network have disk sharing enabled and are online, you can high-
light that icon to see a list of them. To share optical discs from a Mac that has a built-in or 
external optical drive, use these steps:
1.	
On the Mac that has an optical drive, choose System Preferences from the Apple 
menu.
2.	
Click the Sharing icon in the System Preferences window.
3.	
Enter a name in the Computer Name field.
4.	
Enable the check box DVD Or CD Sharing.
5.	
You can also restrict who has access to your optical drive by selecting Ask Me Before 
Allowing Others To Use My DVD Drive.
Dock
The Dock is the series of icons that appear usually on the bottom of the screen on a Mac. It 
provides quick access to applications that come with the Mac, and you can add your own 
items to the Dock as well. In many ways, it is like the taskbar in Windows. It keeps apps on 
its left side. Folders, documents, and minimized windows are kept on the right side of the 
Dock. Figure 6.10 shows the Dock.

Boot Camp
Boot Camp is a utility on a Mac that allows you to create a multiboot environment. While 
Apple only supports using the tool to install a version of Windows, it has been used to also 
create a bootable version of Linux. The Boot Camp Assistant, shown in Figure 6.11, guides 
the user through the process of setting up the system.

Basic Linux Commands
While you may not be expected to be an expert in Linux, you will be responsible for knowing 
some basic Linux commands. This section will go over the main ones you need to know.
ls
The ls command lists information about the files in the current directory. Its syntax is as follows:
ls [OPTION]… [FILE]...
While the file options are too numerous to mention here, they mostly specify the format 
of the output. For a complete listing and their use, see http://linuxcommand.org/man_
pages/ls1.html.
grep
The grep command is used to search text or to search the given file for lines containing a 
match to the given strings or words. Its syntax is as follows, where PATTERN is the pattern 
you are trying to match:
grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]

2.1 Identify Common Features and Functionality of the Mac OS 
429
It has options that govern the matching process as well as options that specify the output. For 
more information on the options and their use, see www.computerhope.com/unix/ugrep.htm.
cd
The cd command is used to change the current directory just as it does at the Windows 
command line. Its syntax is as follows:
cd [option] [directory]
The parameters that can be used with this command are as follows:
■
■
-L: This option forces symbolic links to be followed. In other words, if you tell cd to 
move into a directory, which is actually a symbolic link to a directory, it moves into the 
directory the symbolic link points to.
■
■
-P: This option uses the physical directory structure without following symbolic links. 
In other words, change into the specified directory only if it actually exists as named; 
symbolic links will not be followed. This is the opposite of the -L option, and if they 
are both specified, this option will be ignored.
■
■
-e: If the -P option is specified and the current working directory cannot be deter-
mined, this option tells cd to exit with an error. If -P is not specified along with this 
option, this option has no function.
shutdown
The shutdown command brings the system down in a secure way. Its syntax is as follows:
shutdown [-akrhPHfFnc] [-t sec] time [message]
There are too many parameters to list here. For more information, see www
.computerhope.com/unix/ushutdow.htm.
pwd vs. passwd
While the passwd command changes passwords for user accounts, the pwd command prints the full 
path name of the current working directory. The syntax for the passwd command is as follows:
passwd [options] [LOGIN]
For information on the numerous options that can be used, see www.computerhope.com/
unix/upasswor.htm.
The syntax for the pwd command is as follows:
pwd [OPTION]…
The options that can be used are:
■
■
-L, ––logical: If the contents of the environment variable PWD provide an absolute 
name of the current directory with no . or .. components, then output those contents, 
even if they contain symbolic links. Otherwise, fall back to the default -P handling.

430 
Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
■
■
-P, ––physical: This prints a fully resolved name for the current directory in which all 
components of the name are actual directory names and not symbolic links.
■
■
––help: This displays a help message and exits.
■
■
––version: This displays version information and exits.
mv
While the mv command can be used to move or rename a file in Linux, it’s usually used to 
move a file. In that scenario, the syntax is as follows:
mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
For information on the parameters that can be used, see www.computerhope.com/unix/
umv.htm.
cp
The cp command is used to copy files and directories. Its syntax is as follows:
cp [OPTION]… SOURCE… DIRECTORY
For information on the parameters that can be used, see www.computerhope.com/unix/
ucp.htm.
rm
The rm command removes (deletes) files or directories when it is combined with the -r 
option. The syntax is as follows:
rm [OPTION]… FILE…
For information on using parameters, see www.computerhope.com/unix/urm.htm.
chmod
The chmod command is used to change the permissions of files or directories. Its syntax is 
as follows:
chmod options permissions filename
For information on using parameters, see www.computerhope.com/unix/uchmod.htm.
cmkdir
The cmkdir command is used to create a Cryptographic File System (CFS) directory. These 
directories are stored in encrypted format. The command will prompt you for a password 
that will be used to encrypt the directory. The syntax of the command is as follows:
Cmkdir  [option] directory

2.1 Identify Common Features and Functionality of the Mac OS 
431
For information concerning possible options, see www.linuxcertif.com/man/1/cmkdir/.
chown
The chown command is used to change the ownership of a file. The syntax is as follows, 
where new_owner is the username or the numeric user ID (UID) of the new owner and 
object is the name of the target file, directory, or link:
chown [options] new_owner object(s)
The ownership of any number of objects can be changed simultaneously. The options  
are as follows:
■
■
-R operates on filesystem objects recursively.
■
■
-v (verbose) option provides information about every object processed.
■
■
-c reports only when a change is made.
iwconfig/ifconfig
The ifconfig and iwconfig commands are used to configure network interfaces. While the 
ifconfig command is dedicated to wired connections, the iwconfig command is used on 
wireless interfaces. Here is the syntax of the two commands:
iwconfig interface [essid X] [nwid N] [mode M] [freq F] [channel C]
[sens S ] [ap A ] [nick NN ] [rate R] [rts RT] [frag FT] [txpower T]
[enc E] [key K] [power P] [retry R] [commit]
For information on the options, see www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/iwconfig8.html.
ifconfig interface [aftype] options | address …
For information on the options, see http://linux.die.net/man/8/ifconfig.
ps
The ps command displays information about a selection of the active processes. Its syntax 
is as follows:
ps [options]
For information on the use of the options, see http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ps1.html.
q
The q command is used to quit the Unix full-screen editor called vi. It can be used in two ways:
■
■
:q (CR): Quits vi without saving, provided no changes have been made since the last save
■
■
:q! (CR): Quits vi without saving, leaving the file as it was in the last save

432 
Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
su/sudo
The sudo command can be added at the front of a command to execute the command using root 
privileges. For example, to remove a package with root privileges, the command is as follows:
sudo apt-get remove {package-name}
The su command is used to change from one user account to another. When the com-
mand is executed, you will be prompted for the password of the account to which you are 
switching, as shown here:
$ su mact
password:
mact@sandy:∼$
apt-get
apt-get is the command-line tool for working with Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) soft-
ware packages. These tools install packages on your system. The syntax of the command is 
as follows:
apt-get [-asqdyfmubV] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file]
[-t=target_release][-=architecture] {update | upgrade |
dselect-upgrade | dist-upgrade |install pkg [{=pkg_version_number |
/target_release}]… | remove pkg… | purge pkg… | source pkg
[{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]… |  build-dep pkg
[{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]… |  download pkg
[{=pkg_version_number |  /target_release}]… |  check | clean |
autoclean | autoremove | {-v | –version} |  {-h | –help}}
For additional information on its use and the options, see www.computerhope.com/unix/
apt-get.htm.
vi
The vi command is used to invoke the vi editor (mentioned in the section about the q com-
mand) which is a full-screen editor with two modes of operation: command mode that 
causes action to be taken on the file, and insert mode in which entered text is inserted into 
the file. To enter vi, you use vi filename. If the file named filename exists, then the first 
page (or screen) of the file will be displayed; if the file does not exist, then an empty file and 
screen are created into which you may enter text. To exit this mode when done, use one of 
the following commands, based on your intentions:
■
■
:x<Return>: Quits vi, writing out the modified file to the file named in the original 
invocation
■
■
:wq<Return>: Quits vi, writing out the modified file to the file named in the original 
invocation

■
■
:q<Return>: Quits (or exits) vi
■
■
:q!<Return>: Quits vi even though the latest changes have not been saved for this vi call
dd
The dd command copies a file, converting the format of the data in the process, according 
to the operands specified. Its syntax is as follows:
dd [OPERAND]...
or as follows:
dd OPTION
For information on the available operands and options, see www.computerhope.com/

Exam Essentials
Describe the maintenance tasks that are considered best practices in Linux and 
Mac operating systems.    These tasks include scheduled backups, disk maintenance, system 
updates, patch management, driver and firmware updates, and antivirus and antimalware 
updates.
Identify tools used in the execution of maintenance and other routine tasks.    Some of 
these tasks include backup, Time Machine, restore, snapshot, image recovery, Disk Utility, 
screen sharing, and Force Quit.
Differentiate some of the features of the Linux and Mac operating systems.    Among these 
features are multiple desktops, Mission Control, Keychain, Spot Light, iCloud, gestures, 
Finder, Remote Disk, Dock, and Boot Camp.

shutdown, pwd, passwd, mv, cp, rm, chmod, cmkdir, chown, iwconfig/ifconfig, ps, q, 
su/sudo, apt-get, vi, and dd.
2.2 Given a Scenario, Set Up and Use 
Client-Side Virtualization
A client-side virtualized computer is one that is an instance of an operating system that is 
managed centrally on a server and executed locally. One key feature of this approach is that 
while a constant connection to the server is not required for the system to function,  
the operating system disk image is updated and backed up by synchronizing regularly with 
a server. This section will look at the setup of a client-side virtualization scenario. The 
subobjectives covered in this section include the following:

 Hypervisor 
 Purpose of Virtual Machines 
 Traditionally, workstations can have multiple operating systems installed on them but run 
only one at a time. By running virtualization software, the same workstation can be run-
ning Window 7 along with Windows Server 2008 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (or almost 
any other operating system) at the same time, allowing a developer to test code in various 
environments as well as cut and paste between virtual machines (VMs). 
 From a networking standpoint, each of the VMs will typically need full network access, 
and confi guring the permissions for each can sometimes be tricky. 
 Resource Requirements 
 The resource requirements for virtualization are largely based on what environments you 
are creating. The hardware on the machine must have enough memory, hard drive space, 
and processor capability to support the virtualization. You also need the software to make 
virtualization possible (discussed in the next section). 
 Emulator Requirements 
 XP Mode is a free emulator from Microsoft that you can download and use as a virtual 
emulator. A number of others are also available. In most cases, the motherboard and asso-
ciated BIOS settings need no alteration to provide services to these VMs. Some of the newer 
virtualization products, however (such as Microsoft’s Hyper-V, Windows 7 Virtual PC, 
and Windows 8 Client Hyper-V), require that the motherboard support hardware-assisted 
virtualization. The benefi t derived from using hardware-assisted virtualization is it reduces 
overhead and improves performance. 
 VMware Player allows you to work in multiple environments on one sys-
tem. For more information, go to  www.vmware.com/products/player . 
 Security Requirements 
 Tales of security woes that can occur with attackers jumping out of one VM and accessing 
another have been exaggerated. Although such threats are possible, most software solutions 
include suffi cient protection to reduce the possibility to a small one. 

2.3 Identify Basic Cloud Concepts 
435  
Most virtualization-specific threats focus on the hypervisor (the software that allows the 
VMs to exist). If the hypervisor can be successfully attacked, the attacker can gain root-
level access to all virtual systems. While this is a legitimate issue—and one that has been 
demonstrated as possible in most systems (including VMware, Xen, and Microsoft Virtual 
Machine)—it is one that has been patched each time it has appeared. The solution to most 
virtualization threats is to always apply the most recent patches and keep the systems 
up-to-date.
Network Requirements
Network access is not a requirement in every virtual environment (for example, if you were 
decoding an application that would run only locally) but is often needed in most. During 
implementation of the virtualization, you can configure the network functionality for the 
machine (known as internal) or combine elements of the network together to provide net-
work virtualization (known as external). The difference between internal and external 
implementations is usually based on which software package you are using.
Hypervisor
The hypervisor is the software that allows the VMs to exist.
Exam Essentials
Be familiar with virtualization terminology.    The hypervisor is the software that allows 
the VMs to exist. VMs are separate instances of an operating system and function indepen-
dently of one another on a host physical machine.
Know security concerns related to virtualization.    Most virtualization-specific threats 
focus on the hypervisor. If the hypervisor can be successfully attacked, the attacker can 
gain root-level access to all virtual systems.
2.3 Identify Basic Cloud Concepts
Increasingly, organizations are utilizing cloud-based storage instead of storing data in local 
data centers. The advantages to this approach include the ability to access the data from 
anywhere, the ability to scale compute resources to meet demand, and robust fault toler-
ance options. This section will look at various cloud models and some of the concepts that 
make it a viable option for the enterprise. The subobjectives covered in this section include 
the following:
■
■
SaaS
■
■
IaaS

SaaS
When an enterprise contracts with a third party to provide cloud services, there is a range of 
options, differing mostly in the division of responsibilities between the vendor and the client. 
Software as a service (SaaS) involves the vendor providing the entire solution. This includes the 
operating system, the infrastructure software, and the application. The company may provide 
you with an e-mail system, for example, whereby it hosts and manages everything for you.
IaaS
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) involves the vendor providing the hardware platform or 
data center, and the company installs and manages its own operating systems and appli-
cation systems. The vendor simply provides access to the data center and maintains that 
access.
PaaS
Platform as a service (PaaS) involves the vendor providing the hardware platform or data 
center and the software running on the platform. This includes the operating systems and 
infrastructure software. The company is still involved in managing the system.
Public vs. Private vs. Hybrid vs. Community
When a company pays another company to host and manage this environment, it is called 
a public cloud solution. If the company hosts this environment itself, it is a private cloud 
solution.
There is trade-off when a decision must be made between the two architectures. The 
private solution provides the most control over the safety of your data but also requires 
the staff and the knowledge to deploy, manage, and secure the solution. A public cloud 
puts your data’s safety in the hands of a third party, but that party is often more capable 
and knowledgeable about protecting data in this environment and managing the cloud 
environment.
When the solution is partly private and partly public, the solution is called a hybrid 
solution. It may be that the organization keeps some data in the public cloud but may keep 
more sensitive data in a private cloud, or the organization may have a private cloud that 

2.3 Identify Basic Cloud Concepts 
437  
when overtaxed may utilize a public cloud for additional storage space or additional com-
pute resources.
Finally, a community cloud is one that is shared by multiple organizations for some com-
mon purpose. This could be to share data for a joint project, for example.
Rapid Elasticity
One of the advantages of a cloud environment is the ability to add resources as needed on 
the fly and release those resources when they are no longer required. This makes for more 
efficient use of resources, placing them where needed at any particular point in time. These 
include CPU and memory resources. This is called rapid elasticity because it occurs auto-
matically according to the rules for resource sharing that have been deployed.
On-Demand
In a cloud environment, it is typically possible for customers to add additional compute 
resources at any time to their cloud solution without involving the cloud provider. This is 
called on-demand resource utilization and results in the customer paying for what is used, 
rather than paying for unused resources.
Resource Pooling
Resource pooling is a cloud concept whereby collections of resources (CPU and memory) 
are stored in containers called pools. These pools can be configured to be shared by cer-
tain virtual systems. The relative priority to the usages of the resources is controlled by the 
configuration of what are called resource shares. It is also possible to use another concept 
in combination with resource shares called resource guarantees. These settings are used to 
ensure that certain systems always have required resources. Finally, resource limits can be 
used to prevent a system from monopolizing the resources in the pool.
Measured Service
Measured service is a term used to describe the process of tracking resource utilization by 
the customer for the purpose of charging for those resources. This works much in the same 
way that a utility company charges the organization only for the power used in a period. In 
this case, the customer is charged for the compute resources utilized in a period.
Exam Essentials

models with respect to the various responsibilities of the vendor and the customer.

2.4 Summarize the Properties and 
Purpose of Services Provided by 
Networked Hosts
To provide service to a network, you must be versed in the various roles that servers may 
play in the network. Armed with this knowledge, you can better ensure the proper func-
tion of these servers. There will also be a number of other network devices and appliances. 
This section will look at both topics. The subobjectives covered in this section include the 
following:
■
■
Server roles
■
■
Internet appliance
■
■
Legacy/embedded systems
Server Roles
Servers are computers that provide some type of shared service to the hosts on the network. 
There are many roles that servers can play, but this section will discuss some of the more 
common server roles, focusing on those you are most likely to find in your network.
Web Server
Web servers are used to provide access to information for users connecting to the server 
using a web browser, which is the client part of the application. The browser uses HTTP as 
its transfer mechanism. These servers can be contained within a network and are available 
only within the network (called an intranet server), or they can be connected to the Internet 
where they can be reached from anywhere. To provide security, a web server can be config-
ured to require and use HTTPS, which uses SSL to encrypt the connection with no effort 
on the part of the user.
File Server
File servers are used to store files that can be accessed by the users in the network. 
Typically, users are encouraged or even required to store any important data on these  
servers rather than on their local hard drives because these servers are typically backed up 
on a regular basis, whereas the user machines typically are not. These servers will have 
significant amounts of storage space and may even have multiple hard drives configured in 
a RAID system to provide quicker recovery from a drive crash than could be provided by 
recovering with the backup.

2.4 Summarize the Properties 
439
Print Server
Print servers are used to manage printers, and in cases where that is their only role, they 
will manage multiple printers. These servers provide the spooler service to the printers 
that it manages, and when you view the print queue, you are viewing it on the print server. 
Many enterprise printers come with a built-in print server, which makes using a dedicated 
machine for the role unnecessary.
DHCP Server
DHCP servers are used to automate the process of providing an IP configuration to 
devices in the network. These servers respond to broadcast-based requests for a con-
figuration by offering an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway to the DHCP 
client. While these options provide basic network connectivity, many other options can 
also be provided, such as the IP address of a TFTP server that IP phones can contact to 
download a configuration file.
DNS Server
DNS servers resolve device and domain names (website names) to IP addresses, and vice 
versa. They make it possible to connect to either without knowing the IP address of the 
device or of the server hosting the website. Clients are configured with the IP address of a 
DNS server (usually through DHCP) and make requests of the server using what are called 
queries. The organization’s DNS server will be configured to perform the lookup of IP 
addresses for which it has no entry in its database by making requests of the DNS servers 
on the Internet, which are organized in a hierarchy that allows these servers to more effi-
ciently provide the answer. When they have completed their lookup, they return the IP 
address to the client so the client can make a direct connection using the IP address.
Proxy Server
A proxy server is one that makes Internet connections on the behalf of users in a network. 
In doing so, it prevents them from making direct connections to the Internet and provides 
a point of exit at which you can control their access in a variety of ways. For example, you 
may allow certain users to have complete access to the Internet with no restrictions, while 
other groups of users may be restricted in the sites they can visit and the activities in which 
they may participate.
An additional feature of these servers is their role in web caching. Web caching is the 
process of retrieving a web page for a user and then caching that web page so that another 
request for the page by the same users or other users can be served locally without return-
ing to the Internet to retrieve the page. It results in faster page retrievals in cases where the 
page has been cached.
Mail Server
Mail servers run e-mail server software and use SMTP to send and receive e-mail on behalf 
of users who possess mailboxes on the server. Those users will use a client e-mail protocol 

440 
Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
to retrieve their e-mail from the server. Two of the most common are POP3, which is a 
retrieve-only protocol, and IMAP4, which has more functionality and can be used to man-
age the e-mail on the server.
Authentication Server
An authentication server is one that accepts and verifies the credentials of users. Typically, 
it not only authenticates them but also provides them with access to resources using single 
sign-on. Single sign-on allows a user to authenticate once and not be required to authenticate 
again to access the resources to which they have been given access. One of the best examples 
of this is a domain controller in a Windows Active Directory domain. These servers are the 
point to which all users are directed when they need to log in to the network.
Internet Appliance
Beyond the roles that you can assign to servers by installing server software, there are 
network appliances that are dedicated to performing a particular function. In many cases, 
they perform better than a similar product that is software based. This section will look at 
several of the most common ones.
UTM
Unified threat management (UTM) is an approach that involves performing multiple 
security functions within the same device or appliance. The functions may include the 
following:

On-appliance reporting
UTM makes administering multiple systems unnecessary. However, some feel that UTM 
creates a single point of failure and favor creating multiple layers of devices as a more 
secure approach.
IDS
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a system responsible for detecting unauthorized 
access or attacks. It can verify, itemize, and characterize threats from outside and inside the 
network. Most IDSs are programmed to react in certain ways in specific situations. Event

notification and alerts are crucial to IDSs. These notifications and alerts inform administra-
tors and security professionals when and where attacks are detected. The most common 
way to classify an IDS is based on its information source: network based or host based.
The most common IDS, a network-based IDS (NIDS), monitors network traffic on a 
local network segment. To monitor traffic on the network segment, the network interface 
card (NIC) must be operating in promiscuous mode. An NIDS can monitor only the net-
work traffic. It cannot monitor any internal activity that occurs within a system, such as an 
attack against a system that is carried out by logging on to the system’s local terminal. An 
NIDS is affected by a switched network because generally an NIDS monitors only a single 
network segment.
IPS
An intrusion prevention system (IPS) scans traffic on a network for signs of malicious 
activity and then takes some action to prevent it. An IPS monitors the entire network. You 
need to be careful to set an IPS’s filters in such a way that the generation of false positives 
and false negatives are kept to a minimum. False positives indicate an unwarranted alarm, 
and false negatives indicate troubling traffic that does not generate an alarm.
Legacy/Embedded Systems
An embedded system is a computer system with a specific function within a larger comput-
ing system. Embedded systems are present in many Internet-connected devices such as VoIP 
phones and routers, but they are also increasingly found in devices such as home appliances 
and automobiles. Legacy embedded systems are those that have been handed down from 
one version of a system to another with no major revision.
Exam Essentials

and IDS.
2.5 Identify Basic Features of Mobile 
Operating Systems
Computer operating systems are not the only type of operating system with which you will 
come into contact. Many tablets, smartphones, and other small devices will have operat-
ing systems that are designed to run on devices that have different resource capabilities and 

442 
Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
therefore require different systems. This section will look at operating systems for such 
mobile devices. The subobjective covered in this section includes the following:
■
■
Android vs. iOS vs. Windows
Android vs. iOS vs. Windows
Although certainly not the only operating systems made for today’s highly capable mobile 
devices, the Android and iOS operating systems are the most widely used. However, 
you may find that some mobile devices are running a Windows operating system. In this 
section, the three systems are compared and contrasted.
Open Source vs. Closed Source/Vendor Specific
The Android operating system from Google is built on a Linux kernel with a core set of 
libraries that are written in Java. It is an open source operating system, which means that 
developers have full access to the same framework APIs used by the core applications.
Apple iOS is a vendor-specific system made by Apple. Developers must use the software 
development kit (SDK) from Apple and register as Apple developers.
The Windows operating system, which is the most widely used for desktops and laptops, 
may also be found on some mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, but it is not 
used as widely for these device types as iOS and Android. This is one of the best examples 
of closed source software.
App Source (Play Store, App Store, and Market)
Applications (apps) for mobile devices are where all the exciting functionality comes from 
on mobile devices. There are thousands of developers creating apps that will do everything 
but wash your car for you. Although many are free, some you must purchase.
Apps for Android systems can be obtained from Google Play Store or many other sites. 
Android Market is an app that can be installed on tablets that makes it easy to search for 
apps, games, and widgets.
Apple tightly controls the sale of apps (again, many are free) by making them available 
only on the Apple App Store site.
Screen Orientation (Accelerometer/Gyroscope)
Both accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used by mobile devices to determine the move-
ment and tilt of the device. This means the device can tell which way the screen is being 
held. It uses this information to automatically adjust the display orientation appropriately 
with no action on the part of the user.
Either can be used, but since they exhibit slightly different characteristics, one works 
better for some types of movement and the other for other types of movement. The bottom 
line is that either will work, but they work better together.
The iOS operating system in the iPhone uses an accelerometer and a gyroscope to sense 
the movement and tilt of the device. The Android used only an accelerometer in earlier 
models, but since a gyroscope improves the performance, the newer models include both.

2.5 Identify Basic Features of Mobile Operating Systems

Screen Calibration
For a touchscreen device to operate correctly—that is, for it to properly interpret your 
touch and react accordingly—it must be calibrated correctly. When you touch an item on 
the screen and nothing happens or a movement that normally results in an expected reac-
tion does not, the calibration of the device is off.
Many devices contain a built-in calibration tool. When you use the tool, it will ask you 
to touch the screen in various ways, which results in it relearning how to react to your 
touch. It can be a long process but will usually result in a solution to the problem. Consult 
the documentation for the device to locate the calibration tool.
GPS and Geotracking
Some devices use cell towers to get GPS information, while others (such as Android phones) 
get GPS information directly from satellites. The upside to getting this from a satellite is that 
no cell phone service is required for the GPS to work. It is worth noting, however, that when 
GPS is on, it is using the battery, so you might want to turn it off when you are not using it. 
The iPhone uses a combination of GPS, cell towers, and Wi-Fi towers to plot your location.
One thing that has caused some controversy is the issue of geotracking. Both iPhone and 
Android devices record the location of the device periodically and send this information to 
a central location. This upsets some users because U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
officials have disclosed that they retain the right to access this information when they deem 
necessary.
Wi-Fi Calling
Wi-Fi calling is a generic term that refers to extending mobile voice, data, and multi-
media applications over IP networks. Generic Access Network (GAN) is another earlier 
term of which you may have heard that refers to the same general concept. It allows cell 
phone packets to be forwarded on an IP network when available rather than using the cel-
lular network of which the device is also capable. This allows the user to use an 802.11 
connection when available, conserving the use of their data plan and in some cases 
providing better performance.
Launcher/GUI
A launcher is a program that locates and starts another program. It provides shortcuts to 
computer programs and stores the shortcuts in one place so they are easier to find. Android 
can use many launchers, some of which are free and others that require a license. Many of 
these launchers are dedicated to a specific function such as viewing documents on the home 
page as on a desktop. These launchers are GUI based and usually provide the user with 
additional items in their menus and additional screens and functionalities.
Virtual Assistant
Virtual assistants are programs built into mobile devices that can assist in looking up 
information on behalf of the users. The best-known example is Siri, the assistant that can 

444 
Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
respond to voice requests and commands in the iPhone. Android also supports voice recog-
nition with its voice actions, allowing you to dictate texts and e-mails, play music, or show 
a map with voice commands. Also, the Google Now feature has a voice command feature 
and can act as a simple virtual assistant by delivering weather and traffic updates, sports 
scores, and other information you may be interested in. Many more robust virtual assistant 
apps are available on Google Play.
SDK/APK
Software development kits (SDKs) and application development kits (ADKs) are sets of 
tools provided to third-party developers to assist in the development of applications that 
will run on the Google or Android operating system. It is in the interest of Google and 
Apple to support this effort because many users choose a system based on the available 
applications for the product. One of the reasons the Windows Phone has not seen the 
success many hoped is the dearth of applications created for the phone.
Emergency Notification
Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) are emergency messages sent by authorized government 
alerting authorities through your mobile carrier. The types of messages, some of which are 
already available, are as follows:
■
■
Extreme weather warnings
■
■
Local emergencies requiring evacuation or immediate action
■
■
AMBER alerts
■
■
Presidential alerts during a national emergency
Most mobile devices already come equipped to receive these messages, and in some mod-
els you can disable some of the messages that you do not want to receive. You cannot dis-
able the presidential messages that may come in an emergency.
Mobile Payment Service
One of the newer uses of mobile devices is wireless mobile payment systems. With special 
software and a piece of hardware that attaches to the device and accepts the sliding of a 
credit card, the mobile device can become a cash register. Newer Android phones now have 
Near field communication (NFC) allowing Google Wallet to perform contactless payments 
too. Apple iPhone 6 and some iPads utilize NFC to enable Apple Pay to do the same. To 
merchants located in outdoor areas such as festivals and flea markets, this has given them 
another way to easily accept card charges.
Exam Essentials

mobile payment services.
2.6 Install and Configure Basic Mobile 
Device Network Connectivity and E-mail
For mobile devices to deliver the functionality that most expect, they must be connected 
to a network. To use e-mail (one of the most important functions to many users), the 
device must be set up properly as well. The subobjectives covered in this section include the 
following:

■
Wireless/cellular data network (enable/disable)
■
■
Bluetooth

Wireless/Cellular Data Network (Enable/Disable)
Like most computing devices, mobile devices provide more robust functionality when con-
nected to a network (especially if that network is the Internet). Two types of networks can 
be used to gain access to the Internet: cell phone networks and Wi-Fi networks.
Cell phone networks have in the past been the second choice because the performance 
is not as good as an 802.11 Wi-Fi connection. With the introduction of 4G Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) technologies, however, the performance delivered by the cell network may 
become more competitive.
In either case, most mobile devices will have the ability to make an 802.11 connec-
tion or use the cell network. If you want to disable the automatic connection to the cell 
phone network or if it somehow got turned off and needs to be turned back on, you can 
do this through the settings. One example of the steps to access these settings is Settings 

446 
Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
➢ Wireless ➢ Mobile ➢ Enable Data (select or deselect this). This is only one navigational 
example, and you should consult the documentation that came with the device.
Making a Wi-Fi connection is much like doing so with a laptop. In the settings of the 
device will be a section for Wi-Fi (in iPhone it’s called Wi-Fi, and in Android it’s called 
Wireless And Networks). When you access it, you will see all the Wi-Fi networks within 
range. Just as you would do with a laptop, select one and attempt to connect to the Wi-Fi 
network. If the connection requires a password, you will have to supply it. You also can 
preconfigure a wireless profile for commonly used secure wireless networks as well as those 
where the service set identifier (SSID) has been hidden.
Hotspot
Hotspots are publicly provided points of access to an 802.11 wireless network connected to 
the Internet. They typically have little or no security configured to make it as easy as possi-
ble for users to connect. There are also devices that have been created by vendors that allow 
a single device to act as a hotspot for other devices in the area. Sometimes these are called 
mobile hotspots. Some mobile devices can be turned into mobile hotspots with a software 
upgrade or an addition to the service plan.
Tethering
Tethering is the process of sharing the Internet connection of one device with another device. 
Connection of the phone or tablet with other devices can be done over wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), 
over Bluetooth, or with a physical connection using a cable, for example through USB. It also 
may be done by using a mobile hotspot or by using a similar feature on a mobile device.
Airplane Mode
Since airlines do not permit enabling the wireless connection on mobile devices during 
takeoff and landing, vendors created a mode called Airplane mode in which this function is 
turned off but all other functionality (games and other applications not requiring Internet 
access) is still fully functional.
Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that is used to create a wireless connection 
between digital devices. One of its applications is to create connections between mobile 
devices and items such as speakers, headphones, external GPS units, and keyboards. Before 
you can take advantage of this technology, the devices must be configured to connect to one 
another. This section will discuss how to configure a Bluetooth connection.
Enable Bluetooth
On Android mobile devices, follow these steps:
1.	
From the Home screen, select the Menu button. From the menu, choose Settings ➢ 
Wireless And Networks ➢ Bluetooth.

2.6 Install and Configure Basic Mobile Device Network Connectivity 
447
2.	
Once Bluetooth is selected, wait until a check mark appears next to Bluetooth. Blue-
tooth is now enabled.
On iOS mobile devices, follow these steps:
1.	
On the main page, choose Settings ➢ General ➢ Bluetooth.
2.	
Tap the slider to enable Bluetooth.
Enable Pairing
Pairing a mobile device with an external device (speaker, headphone, and so forth) will 
enable the two devices to communicate. The first step is to enable pairing. This is much 
simpler than it sounds. For either mobile operating system, simply turn the external device 
on and you are ready for the next step. In some cases, you may need to make the external 
device discoverable. Check the documentation for the external device to see whether this is 
the case and how you do this.
Find Device for Pairing
Now that the external device is on and transmitting a signal, the mobile device is ready for 
pairing.
On an Android mobile device, follow these steps:
1.	
On the Settings menu, select Bluetooth Settings. The device will begin to scan for Blue-
tooth devices in the area.
2.	
When the external device appears in the list of detected devices, tap it. If no PIN code 
is required, the devices will pair.
On an iOS mobile device, when Bluetooth is enabled, it automatically starts scanning for 
Bluetooth devices. When your device appears in the list, select it. If a PIN is required, move 
on to the next step.
Enter Appropriate PIN Code
Many external devices will ask for a PIN when you select the external device from the list of dis-
covered devices. In many cases, the PIN is 0000, but check the manual of the external device.
Test Connectivity
Once the previous steps are complete, test communication between the two devices. 
If you’re using a headset, turn on some sound and see whether you can hear it in the 
headphones.
Corporate and ISP E-mail Configuration
E-mail is one of the most important functions that people access on their mobile devices. 
This section will discuss how to configure e-mail on the device. The following procedures 
are common examples, and your specific device may differ slightly. Please consult the docu-
mentation for your device.

Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
Server Address
Before you can access e-mail on your mobile device, you must know the settings for the 
e-mail server of your e-mail provider. There are two protocols that can be used to access 
e-mail accounts: POP3 and IMAP. If your account offers the use of IMAP, you should 
select it in the following steps because IMAP accounts have more functionality.
You will need the following information to complete this setup:
■
■
The FQDN of your POP3 server or IMAP server (this server receives the e-mails sent to 
you, so it’s sometimes called incoming)
■
■
The FQDN of your SMTP server (this server sends your e-mail to the recipient’s e-mail 
server, so it’s sometimes called outgoing)
■
■
The port numbers used for both server types
■
■
The security type used (if any)
POP3
On an Android mobile device, follow these steps:
1.	
Click your device’s e-mail icon. On the page that follows, select Add Account.

Port and SSL Settings
With either operating system, you can (and should) select to use security if your e-mail 
server supports it. This will encrypt all traffic between the mobile device and the e-mail 
server. The choices offered are usually SSL or TLS, so you will need to know which of these 
is in use.
Exchange and S/MIME
In many cases, your work e-mail will be hosted on a Microsoft Exchange server. The setup 
is not so very different but does require more information.
■
■
Exchange server address
■

of the Exchange Server or its IP address and click Next.
5.	
Finally, select the items you want to sync automatically with the e-mail server and click 
Done.
With respect to the S/MIME configuration, you need the following:
■
■
A digital encryption certificate for yourself as the sender
■
■
A copy of the digital public key from your intended recipient
■
■
An e-mail program capable of handling S/MIME e-mail
Exchange supports S/MIME, so that part is taken care of. Once you have obtained your 
certificate, you must import it into your device and make it available to the e-mail program. 
Your certificate must be obtained from a certificate authority company such as VeriSign. 
The steps to this process will vary from organization to organization. Once you have 
downloaded the certificate, place it at a location on the device where you can find it during 
the import process.
Typically, the certificate will come to you in an e-mail that you should open on the 
Android device. When you click the enrollment link in the e-mail, you will be required 
to enter the password you set when you requested the certificate. Then you will create 
another password (called a PKCS#12 passphrase) that you will need during the certificate 
installation.
When the certificate downloads to the device, it will go into the Downloads folder. Now 
you have to add it to your credentials. Follow these steps:
1.	
Navigate to Settings ➢ Security and select Install From Storage.
2.	
Locate your downloaded certificate file (it’s a .pfx file).
3.	
Enter your PKCS#12 passphrase (this is the one you created just before the downloads, 
not the one you created during enrollment).
4.	
Set the certificate name and its use (e-mail).
The certificate is now available to use to encrypt e-mail.
For iOS, follow the organizational steps to request a certificate. When the e-mail arrives, 
open it on the iOS device as you did in Android. Then follow these steps:
1.	
Open the Mail app and find the message that contains the .p12 file. Tap the file icon to 
load it.

2.6 Install and Configure Basic Mobile Device Network Connectivity 
451
2.	
An Install Profile pop-up will appear for the identity certificate. Tap Install.
3.	
A warning that this is an unsigned profile may appear. If that happens, tap Install Now 
to acknowledge it.
4.	
You will be prompted for your passcode. Enter the passcode you use to unlock your 
iPad or iPhone when it’s at the lock screen.
5.	
You’ll then be asked for the password for the certificate. Enter the passphrase you came 
up with when you created the .p12 file on your Mac.
6.	
You may see a note that the certificate is Not Trusted. That’s OK.
7.	
Push the Home button. Find the Settings app and start it.
8.	
In Settings, find Mail, Contacts, Calendars and select it.
9.	
In the list of accounts, find the account for this e-mail address and tap it.
10.	 Tap the Account line.
11.	 Scroll down until you see Advanced. Tap it.
12.	 Scroll down until you see the S/MIME section.
13.	 Make sure S/MIME is turned on.
14.	 Tap Sign. Make sure that the certificate for this account is selected and that Sign is 
turned on. (If you tap the (i) icon, you should see that the certificate is Trusted.)
15.	 Tap Advanced or Back to go back to the Advanced screen.
16.	 Tap Encrypt by Default. Again, select the correct certificate, and make sure Encrypt By 
Default is turned on.
17.	 Back out until you’re at the Account screen and then tap Done to accept the changes.

As you can imagine, setting up iCloud e-mail on an iOS device is simple because the 
applications all reside in the Apple ecosystem. First set up an iCloud e-mail account. 
If you have an e-mail address that ends with @mac.com or @me.com, you already have 
an equivalent address that’s the same except it ends with @icloud.com. On your iOS 
device, simply go to Settings ➢ iCloud, turn on Mail, and then follow the onscreen 
instructions.
PRI Updates/PRL Updates/Baseband Updates
The product release information (PRI) is the connection between the mobile device and the 
radio. From time to time this may need updating, and when done, it may add features or 
increase data speed.
The preferred roaming list (PRL) is a list of radio frequencies residing in the memory of 
some kinds of digital phones. It lists frequencies the phone can use in various geographic 
areas. Each area is ordered by the bands the phone should try to use first. Therefore, it’s a 
priority list for which towers the phone should use.
When roaming, the PRL may instruct the phone to use the network with the best roam-
ing rate for the carrier, rather than the one with the strongest signal at the moment. As car-
rier networks change, an updated PRL may be required.
The baseband is the chip that controls all the GSM and 3G phone RF waves. An update 
makes the code in the chip current.
All mobile devices may require one or more of these updates at one point or another. In 
many cases, these updates will happen automatically, or “over the air.” In many cases, you 
may be required to disable Wi-Fi and enable data for these to occur.
PRL
In Android phones, the location of the PRI update option will differ, but you’ll generally 
find it in one of a few places in the Settings menu.
■
■
Settings ➢ System Updates ➢ Update PRL
■
■
Settings ➢ Sprint System Updates ➢ Update PRL
■
■
Settings ➢ About Phone ➢ Update PRL
In iOS, there is no separate PRL update command on iOS devices, but running a profile 
update will force an update of the PRL.
PRI
A PRI update is a flash process. This usually occurs in over-the-air updates. When 
done manually, it involves acquiring the file and then performing a flash process 
with the bootloader, which in many cases also updates the radio (see the next sec-
tion). The flash process can result in a useless device (bricked), so follow the vendor 
instructions.

2.6 Install and Configure Basic Mobile Device Network Connectivity

Radio Firmware
The radios in mobile devices are equipped with firmware that, like all firmware, may need 
an update from time to time. In Android, follow these steps:
1.	
Download the Radio zip file.
2.	
Rename it to update.zip.
3.	
Copy it to the root of your phone’s SD card.
4.	
Turn off your phone.
5.	
Start up in Recovery mode by holding Home and pressing Power.
6.	
Press Alt+S to apply the update.
7.	
Once the update is applied, press Home+Back to reboot the phone. The phone will 
start to boot up and then continue applying the update. Once this is completed, the 
Recovery menu will ask you for the second time to reboot the phone via Home+Back.
8.	
Double-check the baseband has been updated properly via choosing Menu ➢ Settings ➢ 
About Phone. Scroll down until you see the baseband version. You should see the radio 
version on this row. If not, you will need to update the radio again.
In iOS, follow these steps:
1.	
After downloading the desired firmware, connect the device to your computer and 
select it in iTunes. Mac users hold down the Option key, while Windows users hold 
down the Shift key.
2.	
Click the Update or Restore button, select the IPSW file you recently downloaded, and 
click Choose. Your device should now begin to update. Take note that certain browsers 
may change the .ipsw file into a .zip file. If this should occur, just rename it to end in 
.ipsw, and iTunes will recognize it.
IMEI vs. IMSI
International Mobile Equipment Identification (IMEI) is used to identify a physical phone 
device, while International Mobile Subscriber Identification (IMSI) is used to identify a 
Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card.
VPN
Many users need to use the mobile devices to connect to the corporate network. This 
should be done using a VPN connection. To set up a VPN connection in Android, follow 
these steps:
1.	
Open the Settings app and tap More under Wireless And Networks. (On Android 2.3, 
tap Wireless And Networks.)

2.7 Summarize Methods and 
Data Related to Mobile Device 
Synchronization
Keeping information in sync between your desktop or laptop and your mobile device is 
one of the features that many users want to take advantage of. There are many types of 
information that can be synced, applications that can be installed to perform the synchro-
nization, and a number of connection methods that can be used to do this. This section 
discusses mobile device synchronization. The topics addressed in this section include the 
following:

2.7 Summarize Methods and Data Related to Mobile Device Synchronization 
457
Types of Data to Synchronize
Users may be interested in maintaining a consistency between the state of data that exists 
on the laptop or desktop and the state of the same data on a mobile device. This section 
discusses common types of data.
Contacts
No one wants to enter a long list of contacts into a mobile device when that same list 
already exists in your e-mail account. Using push synchronization (push means it’s auto-
matic and requires no effort on the part of the user), you ensure that any changes made to 
the contact list either on the mobile device or on the desktop will be updated on the other 
device the next time you make a connection to the e-mail account from the other device. It 
will also update if the mobile device makes a direct connection to the desktop (covered later 
in “Connection Types to Enable Synchronization”).
Programs
Program data from applications such as databases can also be synchronized between 
servers and mobile devices. A good example is the synchronization of the data entered into 
handheld devices used by the wait staff in restaurants and the server in the back room of 
the restaurant. Another example is the synchronization of data from handheld scanners in 
a warehouse with a server that may or may not be onsite. This seamless automatic updating 
makes the entire operation more productive.
E-mail
Even more important to users than their contacts is the state of their e-mail. The mobile 
device will synchronize the contacts, calendar items, and e-mail each time the mobile 
device makes contact with the e-mail account. This results in a consistent state between 
what is seen on the desktop and what is seen on the mobile device. Push synchronization 
will usually allow you to configure the push schedule, such as every 30 minutes. To pre-
serve battery life, push sync should take place less frequently.
Pictures
Pictures are another item that users frequently want to view from their mobile device 
without going through the process of manually downloading them to the device. 
Synchronization allows the pictures stored on the desktop (or even a share on a server) to 
be available on the mobile device, even the one you just added an hour ago.
Music
Music files can also be included in the sync process. This helps to keep your library avail-
able on the mobile device. When you start talking about music and video files (see the next 
section), a word of a caution is in order. These large files can quickly add up and fill the 

458 
Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
hard drive and also add significantly to your data usage if the sync is happening over a 
wireless cell phone connection using a data plan. They can also be hard on the battery.
Videos
Video libraries can be kept consistent across devices using synchronization. Be aware of the 
effect of these large files on your drive space, battery level, and data usage if you are sync-
ing wirelessly through a cell phone network.
Calendar
The calendar is a critical application for both work and play. All mobile devices support 
syncing the calendar between devices. In some cases, it may require a small application, 
especially when the e-mail system of which the calendar is part of is in a different ecosys-
tem (for example, Google Mail and an iPhone).
Bookmarks
Bookmarks of frequently visited websites make everyone’s day easier, and when the same 
ones are available in the browser of all your devices, including your mobile devices, it dou-
bles the benefit. Bookmarks are another item that can be configured to sync automatically.
Documents
Technology to sync documents located in multiple locations has been around for some 
time now. Users have come to expect this functionality, and it is present in modern mobile 
devices as well. Users want to be able to work anywhere on any device and this facilitates 
that.
Location Data
In some cases, users may decide to allow an application to track their location for the pur-
pose of tailoring search results. When this is done, it can be a onetime thing or the users 
can give the application ongoing permission to do so. Most device browsers will indicate 
this with some sort of icon or indicator on that page. These setting can also be synchro-
nized between devices as well.
Social Media Data
While social media was once a guilty distraction, today even businesses and organiza-
tions use social media. When users have multiple accounts, many mobile platforms such 
as Google and Apple offer applications that can allow them to track and post to multiple 
accounts at once, reducing the time required to “check and update” the accounts.
e-books
Many users have accounts that give them access to books in digital format or e-books. 
Naturally, they want to have access to these books (and other content types) on all their 

2.7 Summarize Methods and Data Related to Mobile Device Synchronization 
459  
devices. Not only can this be done, but the sync process can keep their various devices up-
to-date with the latest position of a bookmark in the book or of new items that have been 
highlighted or notes that have been made.
Synchronization Methods
When synchronizing these various data types, there are two basic ways to make this hap-
pen. In this section, you’ll look at both approaches.
Synchronize to the Cloud
One synchronization method that is gaining in popularity (as are all things “cloud”) 
is synchronizing all your devices to a cloud server. This provides a central location for 
your data, settings, and all other items listed in the “Types of Data to Synchronize” sec-
tion. This can be set up such that all devices update with the cloud as soon as they attain 
Internet access.
Synchronize to the Desktop
Another approach is to set up a sync process directly between two devices such as a smart-
phone and a desktop computer. In this case, the two devices will sync with one another at 
any time they find themselves on the same network such as a home wireless network.
Mutual Authentication for Multiple Services
Mutual authentication is a process whereby not only does the server verify the credential of 
the client but the client also verifies the credential of the server. It adds additional security 
to the process. Both Android and iOS devices support this type of authentication, typically 
using SSL. One of the challenges presented to performing this type of authentication in 
mobile devices is their relative lack of processing power when compared with desktop and 
laptop systems.
Software Requirements to Install  
the Application on the PC
Some devices come with a sync feature installed, but for the most robust functionality 
(for example, syncing between devices with different operating systems such as iPhone to 
Android and Android to BlackBerry), synchronization applications that will do a much bet-
ter job than the built-in applications can be purchased either at the Apple Store site or in 
other app marketplaces.
When obtaining one of these, ensure that your device meets all the requirements of the 
application. These applications will call for certain minimum requirements on the mobile 
device to operate correctly, so observe these guidelines to ensure a successful installation 
and operation.

460 
Chapter 6  ■  Other Operating Systems and Technologies   
Connection Types to Enable Synchronization
The synchronization process can be carried out over several methods of connection 
between the devices. In some cases, you can connect the mobile device to the laptop or 
desktop using a USB connector. In other cases, you can establish a Bluetooth connection 
from the mobile device and the desktop. Finally, an 802.11 WLAN can also be used to 
establish this connection. In some instances, the synchronization application will allow 
you to introduce a shared folder into the scenario (like Dropbox, for example), which then 
allows you to use the Internet to sync from the laptop to the Dropbox and then from the 
Dropbox to the mobile device.

Given the ever-increasing need for security knowledge in the 
real world, CompTIA expects those who become A+ certified 
to have a basic knowledge and understanding of the ­principles 
behind it. The subobjectives in this category do a good job of providing a ­thorough over-
view of the topic.
3.1 Identify Common Security Threats 
and Vulnerabilities
This objective explores security threats and vulnerabilities. A number of important topics 
are discussed in this section that fall into the realm of two broad categories: social engi-
neering and malware. You’ll look at malware and then several different types of attacks, 
as well as some of the reasons your network is vulnerable. This list is far from inclusive 
because new variants of each are being created by miscreants on a regular basis. The list is, 
however, everything CompTIA expects you to know for the exam. Subobjectives covered in

3.1 Identify Common Security Threats and Vulnerabilities 
467
 Malware 
 We’ve all been battling malicious, invasive software since we bought our fi rst computers. 
This software can go by any number of names—virus, malware, and so on—but if you 
aren’t aware of their presence, these uninvited intruders may damage the data on your hard 
disk, destroy your operating system, and possibly spread to other systems. 
 You want to make certain that your systems, and the data within them, are kept as 
secure as possible. Security prevents others from changing the data, destroying it, or inad-
vertently harming it. In this section, I’ll cover common types of malware. 
 Spyware 
 Spyware differs from other malware in that it works—often actively—on behalf of a third 
party. Rather than self-replicating, like viruses and worms, spyware is spread to machines 
by users who inadvertently ask for it. The users often don’t know they have asked for it but 
have done so by downloading other programs, visiting infected sites, and so on. 
 The spyware program monitors the user’s activity and responds by offering unsolicited 
pop-up advertisements (sometimes known as  adware ), gathers information about the user 
to pass on to marketers, or intercepts personal data such as credit card numbers. 
 Viruses 
 Viruses can be classifi ed as polymorphic, stealth, retroviruses, multipartite, armored, com-
panion, phage, and macro viruses. Each type of virus has a different attack strategy and 
different consequences. 
 Estimates for losses due to viruses are in the billions of dollars. These 
losses include financial loss as well as lost productivity. 
 The following sections will introduce the symptoms of a virus infection, explain how a virus 
works, and describe the types of viruses you can expect to encounter and how they generally 
behave. I’ll also discuss how a virus is transmitted through a network and look at a few hoaxes. 
 Symptoms of a Virus/Malware Infection 
 Many viruses will announce that you’re infected as soon as they gain access to your sys-
tem. They may take control of your system and fl ash annoying messages on your screen or 
destroy your hard disk. When this occurs, you’ll know that you’re a victim. Other viruses 
will cause your system to slow down, cause fi les to disappear from your computer, or take 
over your disk space. 
 Because viruses are the most common malware, the term  virus is used in 
this section. 

468 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
You should look for some of the following symptoms when determining whether a virus 
infection has occurred:
■
■
The programs on your system start to load more slowly. This happens because the 
virus is spreading to other files in your system or is taking over system resources.
■
■
Unusual files appear on your hard drive, or files start to disappear from your system. 
Many viruses delete key files in your system to render it inoperable.
■
■
Program sizes change from the installed versions. This occurs because the virus is 
attaching itself to these programs on your disk.
■
■
Your browser, word-processing application, or other software begins to exhibit 
unusual operating characteristics. Screens or menus may change.
■
■
The system mysteriously shuts itself down or starts itself up and does a great deal of 
unanticipated disk activity.
■
■
You mysteriously lose access to a disk drive or other system resources. The virus has 
changed the settings on a device to make it unusable.
■
■
Your system suddenly doesn’t reboot or gives unexpected error messages during 
startup.
This list is by no means comprehensive. What is an absolute, however, is that you 
should immediately quarantine the infected system. It is imperative that you do all you 
can to contain the virus and keep it from spreading to other systems within your network 
or beyond.
How Viruses Work
A virus, in most cases, tries to accomplish one of two things: render your system inop-
erable or spread to other systems. Many viruses will spread to other systems given the 
chance and then render your system unusable. This is common with many of the newer 
viruses.
If your system is infected, the virus may try to attach itself to every file in your system 
and spread each time you send a file or document to other users. When you give removable 
media to another user or put it into another system, you then infect that system with the 
virus.
Most viruses today are spread using email. The infected system attaches a file to any 
email that you send to another user. The recipient opens this file, thinking it’s something 
you legitimately sent them. When they open the file, the virus infects the target system. 
The virus might then attach itself to all the emails the newly infected system sends, which 
in turn infects the recipients of the emails. Figure 7.1 shows how a virus can spread from a 
single user to thousands of users in a short time using email.
Types of Viruses
Viruses take many different forms. The following sections briefly introduce these forms and 
explain how they work. These are the most common types, but this isn’t a comprehensive list.

3.1 Identify Common Security Threats and Vulnerabilities 
469
 The best defense against a virus attack is to install and run antivirus 
software. The software should be on all workstations as well as the server. 
Armored Virus  An  armored virus is designed to make itself diffi cult to detect or analyze. 
Armored viruses cover themselves with protective code that stops debuggers or disassem-
blers from examining critical elements of the virus. The virus may be written in such a way 
that some aspects of the programming act as a decoy to distract analysis while the actual 
code hides in other areas in the program. 
 From the perspective of the creator, the more time it takes to deconstruct the virus, the 
 longer it can live. The longer it can live, the more time it has to replicate and spread to as 
many machines as possible. The key to stopping most viruses is to identify them quickly 
and educate administrators about them—the very things that the armor intensifi es the 
 diffi culty of accomplishing. 
 Companion Virus  A  companion virus attaches itself to legitimate programs and then 
creates a program with a different fi lename extension. This fi le may reside in your

Chapter 7  ■  Security  
­system’s temporary directory. When a user types the name of the legitimate program, the 
­companion virus executes instead of the real program. This effectively hides the virus from 
the user. Many of the viruses that are used to attack Windows systems make changes to 
­program pointers in the Registry so that they point to the infected program. The infected 
program may perform its dirty deed and then start the real program.
Macro Virus    A macro virus exploits the enhancements made to many application 
­programs. Programmers can expand the capability of applications such as Microsoft Word 
and Excel. Word, for example, supports a mini-BASIC programming language that allows 
files to be manipulated automatically. These programs in the document are called macros. 
For example, a macro can tell your word processor to spell-check your document automati-
cally when it opens. Macro viruses can infect all the documents on your system and spread 
to other systems via email or other methods.
Multipartite Virus    A multipartite virus attacks your system in multiple ways. It may 
attempt to infect your boot sector, infect all your executable files, and destroy your applica-
tion files. The hope here is that you won’t be able to correct all the problems and will allow 
the infestation to continue. The multipartite virus in Figure 7.2 attacks your boot sector, 
infects application files, and attacks your Word documents.

Phage Virus    A phage virus alters other programs and databases. The virus infects all 
these files. The only way to remove this virus is to reinstall the programs that are infected. 
If you miss even a single incident of this virus on the victim system, the process will start 
again and infect the system once more.
Polymorphic Virus    Polymorphic viruses change form in order to avoid detection. 
The virus will attempt to hide from your antivirus software. Frequently, the virus will 

3.1 Identify Common Security Threats and Vulnerabilities 
471
encrypt parts of itself to avoid detection. When the virus does this, it’s referred to as 
mutation . The mutation process makes it hard for antivirus software to detect com-
mon characteristics of the virus. Figure  7.3 shows a polymorphic virus changing its 
characteristics to avoid detection. In this example, the virus changes a signature to fool 
 antivirus software.

 A  signature is an algorithm or other element of a virus that uniquely 
 identifies it. Because some viruses have the ability to alter their signature, 
it is crucial that you keep signature files current, whether you choose 
to manually download them or configure the antivirus engine to do so 
automatically. 
Retrovirus  A  retrovirus attacks or bypasses the antivirus software installed on a com-
puter. You can consider a retrovirus to be an anti-antivirus. Retroviruses can directly 
attack your  antivirus software and potentially destroy the virus defi nition database fi le. 
Destroying this information without your knowledge would leave you with a false sense 
of security. The virus may also directly attack an antivirus program to create bypasses for 
itself. 
 Stealth Virus  A  stealth virus attempts to avoid detection by masking itself from applica-
tions. It may attach itself to the boot sector of the hard drive. When a system utility or pro-
gram runs, the stealth virus redirects commands around itself in order to avoid detection. 
An infected fi le may report a fi le size different from what is actually present in order to 
avoid detection. Figure  7.4 shows a stealth virus attaching itself to the boot sector to avoid 
detection. Stealth viruses may also move themselves from fi le A to fi le B during a virus scan 
for the same reason.

Worms
A worm is different from a virus in that it can reproduce itself, it’s self-contained, and it 
doesn’t need a host application to be transported. Many of the so-called viruses that have 
made the news were actually worms. However, it’s possible for a worm to contain or deliver 
a virus to a target system.
By their nature and origin, worms are supposed to propagate, and they use whatever ser-
vices they’re capable of to do that. Early worms filled up memory and bred inside the RAM 
of the target computer. Worms can use TCP/IP, email, Internet services, social media sites, 
or any number of possibilities to reach their target.
Trojans
Trojan horses are programs that enter a system or network under the guise of another 
program. A Trojan horse may be included as an attachment or as part of an installation 
program. The Trojan horse can create a back door or replace a valid program during instal-
lation. It then accomplishes its mission under the guise of another program. Trojan horses 
can be used to compromise the security of your system, and they can exist on a system for 
years before they’re detected.
The best preventive measure for Trojan horses is to not allow them entry into your sys-
tem. Immediately before and after you install a new software program or operating system, 
back it up! If you suspect a Trojan horse, you can reinstall the original programs, which 
Present Virus Activity
New viruses and threats are released on a regular basis to join the cadre of those already 
in existence. From an exam perspective, you need be familiar with the world only as it 
existed at the time the questions were written. From an administrative standpoint, how-
ever, you need to know what is happening today.

should delete the Trojan horse. A port scan may also reveal a Trojan horse on your system. 
If an application opens a TCP or IP port that isn’t supported in your network, you can 
track it down and determine which port is being used. 
 Rootkits 
 Rootkits have become the software exploitation program du jour. Rootkits are software pro-
grams that have the ability to hide certain things from the operating system. With a rootkit, 
there may be a number of processes running on a system that don’t show up in Task Manager, 
or connections may be established/available that don’t appear in a Netstat display—the rootkit 
masks the presence of these items. The rootkit does this by manipulating function calls to the 
operating system and fi ltering out information that would normally appear. 
 Unfortunately, many rootkits are written to get around antivirus and antispyware pro-
grams that aren’t kept up-to-date. The best defense you have is to monitor what your sys-
tem is doing and catch the rootkit in the process of installation. 
 Ransomware 
 Ransomware is a type of malware that usually encrypts the entire system or an entire drive 
with an encryption key that only the hacker possesses. Once he encrypts the machine, he 
will hold the data residing on the device hostage until a ransom is paid. 
 The latest version of this attack arrives as an attachment that appears to be a 
resume. However, when the attachment is opened, the malware uses software called 
Cryptowall to encrypt the device. What usually follows is a demand for $500 to 
decrypt the device.  
 Phishing 
Phishing is a form of social engineering in which you simply ask someone for a piece of 
information that you are missing by making it look as if it is a legitimate request. An email 
might look as if it is from a bank and contain some basic information, such as the user’s 
name. In the email, it will often state that there is a problem with the person’s account or 
access privileges. They will be told to click a link to correct the problem. After they click 
the link—which goes to a site other than the bank’s—they are asked for their username, 
password, account information, and so on. The person instigating the phishing can then 
use the values entered there to access the legitimate account. 
 One of the best counters to phishing is to simply mouse over the Click Here 
link and read the URL. Almost every time it is pointing to an adaptation of 
the legitimate URL as opposed to a link to the real thing. 
 The only preventive measure in dealing with social-engineering attacks is to educate 
your users and staff to never give out passwords and user IDs over the phone or via email 
or to anyone who isn’t positively verifi ed as being who they say they are. 

474 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
When you combine phishing with Voice over IP (VoIP), it becomes known as vishing and 
is just an elevated form of social engineering. While crank calls have been in existence since 
the invention of the telephone, the rise in VoIP now makes it possible for someone to call you 
from almost anywhere in the world, without the worry of tracing, caller ID, and other fea-
tures of the land line, and pretend to be someone they are not in order to get data from you.
Spear Phishing
Two other forms of phishing to be aware of are spear phishing and whaling, and they 
are similar in nature. With spear phishing, the person conducting it uses information 
that the target would be less likely to question because it appears to be coming from a 
trusted source. As an example, instead of Wells Fargo sending you a message telling you 
to click here to fix a problem with your account, the message that comes in appears to 
be from your spouse and it says to click here to see a video of your children from last 
Christmas. Because it appears far more likely to be a legitimate message, it cuts through 
the user’s standard defenses like a spear and has a higher likelihood of being clicked. 
Generating the attack requires much more work on the part of the miscreant and often 
involves using information from contact lists, friend lists from social media sites, and so 
on.
Whaling is nothing more than phishing, or spear phishing, for big users. Instead of 
sending out a To Whom It May Concern message to thousands of users, the whaler identi-
fies one person from whom they can gain all the data they want—usually a manager or 
owner—and targets the phishing campaign at them.
Spoofing
Spoofing is the process of masquerading as another user or device. It is usually done for the 
purpose of accessing a resource to which the hacker should not have access or to get through 
a security device such as a firewall that may be filtering traffic based on a source IP address.
Spoofing can take various forms. The hacker may change his IP address to one that 
belongs to a trusted user or device to get through a firewall filtering at the IP layer. In 
other cases, he might spoof the MAC address of a trusted device to defeat layer-two secu-
rity applied on a switch or wireless access point (AP). It could also be the spoofing of a 
username and password to access a resource. Finally, it might be the spoofing of an email 
address to launch one of the email-based attacks.
Social Engineering
Social engineering is a process in which an attacker attempts to acquire information about 
your network and system by social means, such as by talking to people in the organization. 
A social-engineering attack may occur over the phone, by email, or by a visit. The intent is 
to acquire access information, such as user IDs and passwords. When the attempt is made 
through email or instant messaging, this is known as phishing (discussed earlier) and often 

3.1 Identify Common Security Threats and Vulnerabilities 
475  
is made to look as if it is coming from sites where users are likely to have accounts (eBay 
and PayPal are popular).
These types of attacks are relatively low-tech and are more akin to con jobs. Take the 
following example. Your help desk gets a call at 4 a.m. from someone purporting to be 
the vice president of your company. She tells the help-desk personnel that she is out of 
town to attend a meeting, her computer just failed, and she is sitting in a Kinko’s trying 
to get a file from her desktop computer back at the office. She can’t seem to remember her 
password and user ID. She tells the help-desk representative that she needs access to the 
information right away or the company could lose millions of dollars. Your help-desk rep 
knows how important this meeting is and gives the vice president her user ID and pass-
word over the phone.
Another common approach is initiated by a phone call or email from your software ven-
dor, telling you that they have a critical fix that must be installed on your computer system. 
If this patch isn’t installed right away, your system will crash and you’ll lose all your data. 
For some reason, you’ve changed your maintenance account password and they can’t log 
on. Your systems operator gives the password to the person. You’ve been hit again.
Shoulder Surfing
Shoulder surfing involves nothing more than watching someone when they enter their sensi-
tive data. They can see you entering a password, typing in a credit card number, or enter-
ing any other pertinent information. The best defense against this type of attack is simply 
to survey your environment before entering personal data. Privacy filters can be used that 
make the screen difficult to read unless you are directly in front of it.
Zero-Day Attack
Vulnerabilities are often discovered in live environments before a fix or patch exists. Such 
vulnerabilities are referred to as zero-day vulnerabilities. A zero-day attack occurs when 
security vulnerability in an application is discovered on the same day the application is 
released. Monitoring known hacking community websites can often provide an early alert 
because hackers often share zero-day exploit information. Honeypots or honeynets can also 
provide forensic information about hacker methods and tools for zero-day attacks.
New zero-day attacks are announced on a regular basis against a broad range of 
technology systems. You should create an inventory of applications and maintain a list of 
critical systems to manage the risks of these attack vectors.
Zombie/Botnet
A bot is a type of malware that installs itself on large numbers of computers through infected 
emails, downloads from websites, Trojan horses, and shared media. Once installed, the bot 
has the ability to connect back to the hacker’s computer. After that, his server controls all 
the bots located on these machines. At a set time, the hacker may direct the bots to take 
some action, such as direct all the machines to send out spam messages, mount a DoS attack, 

476 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
or perform phishing or any number of malicious acts. The collection of computers that act 
together is called a botnet, and the individual computers are called zombies. By recruiting 
many zombies to assist in the attack, the attacker greatly magnifies the effect of the attack.
Brute Forcing
A brute-force attack is a password attack that operates by attempting every possible combi-
nation of characters that could be in a password. These can be performed online or offline. 
While given enough time and enough processing power, any password can be cracked, so 
most enterprises use some sort of password policy that locks an account after a certain 
number of incorrect attempts. For this reason, online attacks are largely unsuccessful.
In contrast, the offline mode of the attack requires the attacker to steal the password 
file first but enables an unconstrained guessing of passwords, free of any application- or 
network-related rate limitations.
Dictionary Attacks
Dictionary attacks rely on the use of large files that contain words from the dictionary. 
These attacks are most often attempts to crack an encrypted password by encrypting each 
word in the dictionary file using the same algorithm used to encrypt the users’ password 
and then comparing this value to the encrypted password for a match. These attacks are 
performed offline to eliminate the disabling of the account through password policies.
Noncompliant Systems
Upon infection, some viruses destroy the target system immediately. The saving grace is 
that the infection can be detected and corrected. Some viruses won’t destroy or otherwise 
tamper with a system; they use the victim system as a carrier. The victim system then 
infects servers, file shares, and other resources with the virus. The carrier then infects the 
target system again. Until the carrier is identified and cleaned, the virus continues to harass 
systems in this network and spread.
You should use some type of enterprise-grade malware management system that scans 
the network for noncompliant devices. Most of these systems can automate the entire pro-
cess of locating, isolating, and remediating noncompliant devices.
Violations of Security Best Practices
In a properly secured organization, securities policies should exist that define the mini-
mum security measures expected of users. These policies will drive the development of the 
AUP. This policy describes in some detail the actions and functions that are allowed on 
the networks and those that are not. These rules should always be designed to follow and 
encourage the use of security best practices. A critical component of this document is the 
specification of consequences for noncompliance.

3.2 Compare and Contrast Common Prevention Methods 
477
 Tailgating 
 Tailgating is the term used for someone being so close to you when you enter a build-
ing that they are able to come in right behind you without needing to use a key, a card, 
or any other security device. Many social-engineering intruders needing physical access 
to a site will use this method of gaining entry. Educate users to beware of this and other 
social-engineering ploys and prevent them from happening. 
 Mantraps are a great way to stop tailgating. A mantrap is a series of two doors 
with a small room between them that helps prevent unauthorized people from 
entering a building. For more information see the section “Mantrap.”  
 Man-in-the-Middle 
 A man-in-the-middle attack is one in which the hacker uses one of several techniques to posi-
tion himself in the middle of a current communication session between two devices. One way 
he might do this is by polluting the arp cache (mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses) 
such that the users on either end of the session think they are sending data to one another when 
in reality they are sending it to the hacker. This allows him to monitor the entire conversation.  
 Exam Essentials 
Know the characteristics and types of viruses used to disrupt systems and networks.  Several 
different types of viruses are fl oating around today. The most common ones are polymorphic 
viruses, stealth viruses, retroviruses, multipartite viruses, and macro viruses. 
 Know the various types of social engineering.  Social-engineering variants include 
shoulder surfi ng (watching someone work) and phishing (tricking someone into believing 
they are communicating with a party other than the one they are communicating with). 
Variations on phishing include vishing and whaling as well as spear phishing. 
 3.2 Compare and Contrast Common 
Prevention Methods 
 A great many of the security issues that plague networks today can be solved through the 
implementation of basic security elements. Some of those elements are physical (locked doors) 
and others digital (antivirus software), but all share the goal of keeping out problems. 
 This objective is divided into four topic areas: physical security, digital security, user 
education/AUP, and the principle of least privilege. As you study for the exam, know what 

478 
Chapter 7 ■ Security
types of physical security elements you can add to an environment to secure it. Know 
as well what types of digital security you should implement to keep malware at bay. 
Understand that the fi rst line of defense is the users and that you need to educate them to 
understand why security is important. You should follow the principle of least privilege to 
prevent users from inadvertently causing harm. The following are subobjectives covered in 
this section:

 Physical Security 
 Physical security is a grab bag of elements that can be added to an environment to aid in 
securing it. It ranges from key fobs to retinal scanners. In this section, you will examine the 
list of components in the order given by CompTIA. 
 Lock Doors 
 One of the easiest ways to prevent people intent on creating problems from physically 
entering your environment is to lock your doors and keep them out. A key aspect of access 
control involves  physical barriers . The objective of a physical barrier is to prevent access 
to computers and network systems. The most effective physical barrier implementations 
require that more than one physical barrier be crossed to gain access. This type of approach 
is called a  multiple-barrier system. 
 Ideally, your systems should have a minimum of three physical barriers. The fi rst bar-
rier is the external entrance to the building, referred to as a  perimeter , which is protected 
by burglar alarms, external walls,  fencing , surveillance, and so on. An  access list should 
exist to specifi cally identify who can enter and be verifi ed by a guard or someone in author-
ity. The second barrier is the entrance into the building and could rely on such items as  ID 
badges to gain access. The third barrier is the entrance to the computer room itself (and 
could require fobs, or keys). Each of these entrances can be individually secured, moni-
tored, and protected with alarm systems. 
 Think of the three barriers this way: outer (the fence), middle (guards, 
locks, and mantraps), and inner (key fobs). 
 Although these three barriers won’t always stop intruders, they will potentially slow 
them down enough that law enforcement can respond before an intrusion is fully devel-
oped. Once inside, a truly secure site should be dependent on a physical token for access to 
the actual network resources.

Mantrap
A mantrap is a series of two doors with a small room between them. The user is authenti-
cated at the first door and then allowed into the room. At that point, additional verifica-
tion will occur (such as a guard visually identifying the person), and then they are allowed 
through the second door. These doors are normally used only in very high security situ-
ations. Mantraps also typically require that the first door is closed, prior to enabling the 
second door to open. Figure 7.5 shows a mantrap design.

Cable Locks
While not all devices support this, larger mobile devices such as laptops come with a notch 
where you can attach a cable lock and lock the device to something solid like you would 
lock a bicycle to a rack. This may even be advisable on some desktop systems if those sys-
tems are vulnerable to theft and they contain sensitive data. Users who carry company 
devices that support cable locks should be instructed to never leave the device unattended 
and, if necessary, lock the device to an immovable object.
Securing Physical Documents/Passwords/Shredding
It is amazing the information that can be gleaned from physical documents even in the age 
when there is such a push to go paperless. Dumpster diving is a common physical access 
method. Companies normally generate a huge amount of paper, most of which eventually 
winds up in dumpsters or recycle bins. Dumpsters may contain information that is highly 
sensitive in nature (such as passwords after a change and before the user has the new one 
memorized). In high-security and government environments, sensitive papers should be 

480 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
either shredded or burned. Most businesses don’t do this. In addition, the advent of “green” 
companies has created an increase in the amount of recycled paper, which can often con-
tain all kinds of juicy information about a company and its individual employees.
Biometrics
Biometric devices use physical characteristics to identify the user. Such devices are becom-
ing more common in the business environment. Biometric systems include hand scanners, 
retinal scanners, and possibly soon, DNA scanners. To gain access to resources, you must 
pass a physical screening process. In the case of a hand scanner, this may include identify-
ing fingerprints, scars, and markings on your hand. Retinal scanners compare your eye’s 
retinal pattern to a stored retinal pattern to verify your identity. DNA scanners will exam-
ine a unique portion of your DNA structure to verify that you are who you say you are.
With the passing of time, the definition of biometric is expanding from simply identify-
ing physical attributes about a person to being able to describe patterns in their behavior. 
Recent advances have been made in the ability to authenticate someone based on the key 
pattern they use when entering their password (how long they pause between each key, 
the amount of time each key is held down, and so forth). A company adopting biometric 
technologies needs to consider the controversy they may face (some authentication methods 
are considered more intrusive than others). It also needs to consider the error rate and that 
errors can include both false positives and false negatives.
ID Badges
ID badges can be any form of identification intended to differentiate the holder from every-
one else. This can be as simple as a name badge or photo ID.
Key Fobs
Key fobs are named after the chains that used to hold pocket watches to clothes. They are 
security devices that you carry with you that display a randomly generated code that you 
can then use for authentication. This code usually changes quickly (every 60 seconds is 
probably the average), and you combine this code with your PIN for authentication.
RFID Badge
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a wireless, no-contact technology used with badges 
or  cards and their accompanying reader. The reader is connected to the workstation and 
validates against the security system. This increases the security of the authentication process 
because you must be in physical possession of the smart card to use the resources. Of course, 
if the card is lost or stolen, the person who finds the card can access the resources it allows.
Smart Card
A smart card is a type of badge or card that gives you access to resources, including buildings, 
parking lots, and computers. It contains information about your identity and access privileges. 
Each area or computer has a card scanner or a reader in which you insert your card.

3.2 Compare and Contrast Common Prevention Methods 
481  
Smart cards are difficult to counterfeit, but they’re easy to steal. Once a thief has a smart 
card, that person has all the access the card allows. To prevent this, many organizations 
don’t put any identifying marks on their smart cards, making it harder for someone to uti-
lize them. Many modern smart cards require a password or PIN to activate the card, and 
they employ encryption to protect the card’s contents.
Tokens
Physical tokens are anything that a user must have on them to access network resources 
and are often associated with devices that enable the user to generate a one-time password 
authenticating their identity. SecurID, from RSA, is one of the best-known examples of a 
physical token; learn more at www.rsa.com/node.aspx?id=1156.
Privacy Filters
Privacy filters are either film or glass add-ons that are placed over a monitor that prevent 
the data on the screen from being readable when viewed from the sides. Only the user sit-
ting directly in front of the screen is able to read the data. This is a good mitigation to 
shoulder surfing.
Entry Control Roster
At any physical location where users are arriving and departing the facility, users should be 
authenticated through one of the mechanisms discussed in this section. There should be a 
recording of each user arriving and departing. This can be either a record of all successful 
and unsuccessful authentications on a log or, in the case of visitors who have no network 
account, a physical identification process of some sort. In any case, there should be an entry 
control roster in the form of a physical document that shows when each person entered and 
left the facility. This will serve as a backup in case the log is lost.
Digital Security
Whereas physical security under this objective focused on keeping individuals out, digital 
security focuses mostly on keeping harmful data/malware out. The areas of focus are anti-
virus software, firewalls, antispyware, user authentication/strong passwords, and directory 
permissions. Each of these is addressed in the sections that follow.
Antivirus/Antimalware
The primary method of preventing the propagation of malicious code involves the use of anti-
virus software. Antivirus software is an application that is installed on a system to protect it 
and to scan for viruses as well as worms and Trojan horses. Most viruses have characteristics 
that are common to families of a virus or viruses. Antivirus software looks for these charac-
teristics, or fingerprints, to identify and neutralize viruses before they impact you.
More than 200,000 known viruses, worms, bombs, and other malware have been 
defined. New ones are added all the time. Your antivirus software manufacturer will 

482 
Chapter 7 ■ Security
usually work hard to keep the defi nition database fi les current. The defi nition database fi le 
contains all the known viruses and countermeasures for a particular antivirus software 
product. You probably won’t receive a virus that hasn’t been seen by one of these compa-
nies. If you keep the virus defi nition database fi les in your software up-to-date, you prob-
ably won’t be overly vulnerable to attacks. 
 The best method of protection is to use a layered approach. Antivirus soft-
ware should be at the gateways, at the servers, and at the desktop. If you 
want to go one step further, you can use software at each location from 
different vendors to make sure you’re covered from all angles. 
 Firewalls 
 Firewalls are one of the fi rst lines of defense in a network. There are different types of 
fi rewalls, and they can be either stand-alone systems or included in other devices such as 
routers or servers. You can fi nd fi rewall solutions that are marketed as hardware-only and 
others that are software-only. Many fi rewalls, however, consist of add-in software that is 
available for servers or workstations. 
 Although solutions are sold as “hardware-only,” the hardware still runs 
some sort of software. It may be hardened and in ROM to prevent tamper-
ing, and it may be customized—but software is present nonetheless. 
 The basic purpose of a fi rewall is to isolate one network from another. Firewalls are 
becoming available as appliances, meaning they’re installed as the primary device separating 
two networks.  Appliances are freestanding devices that operate in a largely self-contained 
manner, requiring less maintenance and support than a server-based product. 
 Firewalls function as one or more of the following: 
 
■
 Packet filter 
 
■
 Proxy firewall 
 
■
 Stateful inspection firewall 
 To understand the concept of a firewall, it helps to know where the term 
comes from. In days of old, dwellings used to be built so close together 
that if a fire broke out in one, it could easily destroy a block or more before 
it could be contained. To decrease the risk of this happening, firewalls were 
built between buildings. The firewalls were huge brick walls that separated 
the buildings and kept a fire confined to one side. The same concept of 
restricting and confining is true in network firewalls. Traffic from the out-
side world hits the firewall and isn’t allowed to enter the network unless 
otherwise invited. 

3.2 Compare and Contrast Common Prevention Methods 
483
 The fi rewall shown in Figure  7.6 effectively limits access from outside networks, while 
allowing inside network users to access outside resources. The fi rewall in this illustration is 
also performing proxy functions.

 Although firewalls are often associated with outside traffic, you can place 
a firewall anywhere. For example, if you want to isolate one portion of your 
internal network from others, you can place a firewall between them. 
 The following list discusses three of the most common functions that fi rewalls perform: 
Packet Filter Firewalls  A fi rewall operating as a  packet fi lter passes or blocks traffi c to 
specifi c addresses based on the type of application. The packet fi lter doesn’t analyze the 
data of a packet; it decides whether to pass it based on the packet’s addressing information. 
For instance, a packet fi lter may allow web traffi c on port 80 and block Telnet traffi c on 
port 23. This type of fi ltering is included in many routers. If a received packet request asks 
for a port that isn’t authorized, the fi lter may reject the request or simply ignore it. Many 
packet fi lters can also specify which IP addresses can request which ports and allow or 
deny them based on the security settings of the fi rewall. 
 Packet fi lters are growing in sophistication and capability. A packet fi lter fi rewall can 
allow any traffi c that you specify as acceptable. For example, if you want web users to 
access your site, then you confi gure the packet fi lter fi rewall to allow data on port 80 to 
enter. If every network were exactly the same, fi rewalls would come with default port 
settings hard-coded, but networks vary, so the fi rewalls don’t include such settings. 
 Proxy Firewalls  A  proxy fi rewall  can be thought of as an intermediary between your 
network and any other network. Proxy fi rewalls are used to process requests from an out-
side network; the proxy fi rewall examines the data and makes rule-based decisions about 
whether the request should be forwarded or refused. The proxy intercepts all the packages 
and reprocesses them for use internally. This process includes hiding IP addresses. 

484 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
The proxy firewall provides better security than packet filtering because of the 
increased intelligence that a proxy firewall offers. Requests from internal network users 
are routed through the proxy. The proxy, in turn, repackages the request and sends it 
along, thereby isolating the user from the external network. The proxy can also offer 
caching, should the same request be made again, and can increase the efficiency of data 
delivery.
A proxy firewall typically uses two network interface cards (NICs). This type of firewall 
is referred to as a dual-homed firewall. One of the cards is connected to the outside net-
work, and the other is connected to the internal network. The proxy software manages the 
connection between the two NICs. This setup segregates the two networks from each other 
and offers increased security. Figure 7.7 illustrates a dual-homed firewall segregating two 
networks from each other.
The proxy function can occur at either the application level or the circuit level. 
Application-level proxy functions read the individual commands of the protocols that are 
being served. This type of server is advanced and must know the rules and capabilities 
of the protocol used. An implementation of this type of proxy must know the difference 
between GET and PUT operations, for example, and have rules specifying how to execute 
them. A circuit-level proxy creates a circuit between the client and the server and doesn’t 
deal with the contents of the packets that are being processed.

proxy servers also provide full auditing, accounting, and other usage information that 
wouldn’t normally be kept by a circuit-level proxy server.
Stateful Inspection Firewalls    The last section on firewalls focuses on the concept of state-
ful inspection. Stateful inspection is also referred to as stateful packet filtering. Most of 
the devices used in networks don’t keep track of how information is routed or used. After a 

3.2 Compare and Contrast Common Prevention Methods 
485  
packet is passed, the packet and path are forgotten. In stateful inspection (or stateful packet 
filtering), records are kept using a state table that tracks every communications channel. 
Stateful inspections occur at all levels of the network and provide additional security, espe-
cially in connectionless protocols such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Internet 
Control Message Protocol (ICMP). This adds complexity to the process. Denial-of-service 
(DoS) attacks present a challenge because flooding techniques are used to overload the state 
table and effectively cause the firewall to shut down or reboot.
User Authentication/Strong Passwords
You can set up many different parameters and standards to force the people in your orga-
nization to conform. In establishing these parameters, it’s important that you consider the 
capabilities of the people who will be working with these policies. If you’re working in an 
environment where people aren’t computer savvy, you may spend a lot of time helping them 
remember and recover passwords. Many organizations have had to reevaluate their security 
guidelines after they’ve invested great time and expense to implement high-security systems.
Setting authentication security, especially in supporting users, can become a high-
maintenance activity for network administrators. On one hand, you want people to be able 
to authenticate themselves easily; on the other hand, you want to establish security that 
protects your company’s resources. In a Windows server domain, password policies can 
be configured at the domain level using Group Policy objects. Variables you can configure 
include password complexity, length, and time between allowed changes.
A good password includes both uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers and 
symbols. Be wary of popular names or current trends that make certain passwords predict-
able. For example, during the first release of Star Wars, two of the most popular passwords 
used on college campuses were C3PO and R2D2. This created a security problem for cam-
pus computer centers. Educate users to not use personal information that one could easily 
guess about them, such as their pet names, anniversary, or birthdays.
Multifactor Authentication
There are three factors of authentication: knowledge factors (something you know, such as 
a password), characteristic factors (some physical characteristic, such as a thumbprint), and 
behavioral factors (something you do, such a voice analysis).
When more than one of these factors is required to authenticate, it is called multifactor 
authentication. It is not multifactor authentication if it uses two forms of the same factor of 
authentication such as a password and a PIN (both knowledge factors). An example of mul-
tifactor authentication is the requirement of a PIN and a retina scan.
Directory Permissions
As a user, there is not much that can be done to improve or change the security of the 
directory services deployed. However, you can ensure that you don’t become a tool for an 
attacker bent on compromising your organization’s security.
■
■
Ensure that your client is using the most secure form of authentication encryption sup-
ported by both your client and the authentication servers.

486 
Chapter 7 ■ Security
 
■
 Use encrypted software and protocols whenever possible, even for internal 
communications. 
 
■
 Change your password according to the company’s password policy. 
 
■
 Use a company-established minimum character password that is unique for each 
account. While many companies set the minimum at 8 characters, it is not uncommon 
to see this set at 16. 
 
■
 Never write your password down, or if you do, divide it up into several pieces and store 
each in a different secure location (such as a home safe, a gun cabinet, a chemical sup-
ply locker, or a safety deposit box). 
 
■
 Never share your password or your logon session with another person; this includes 
your friends, spouse, and children. 
 
■
 Verify that your client always interacts with an authentication server during the net-
work logon process and does not use cached credentials. 
 
■
 Allow all approved updates and patches to be installed onto your client. 
 
■
 Ensure that all company data is copied back to a central file server before disconnect-
ing from a logon session. 
 
■
 Back up any personal data onto verified removable media. 
 
■
 Never walk away from a logged-on workstation. 
 
■
 Employ a password-protected screensaver. 
 
■
 Don’t use auto-logon features. 
 
■
 Be aware of who is around you (and may be watching you) when you log on and when 
you work with valuable data. 
 
■
 Never leave a company notebook, mobile phone, or PDA in a position where it can be 
stolen or compromised while you are away from the office. Cable locks should be used 
to keep notebooks securely in place whenever you are off site. 
 As for the permission on directories themselves, that is governed by NTFS, 
which was discussed in Chapter  6 , “Operating Systems.” 
 The protection of a directory service is based on the initial selection of network operat-
ing system and its deployment infrastructure. After these foundational decisions are made, 
you need to fully understand the technologies employed by your selected directory services 
system and learn how to make the most functional yet secure environment possible. This 
will usually require the addition of third-party security devices, applications, services, and 
solutions. 
 VPN 
 Virtual private network (VPN) connections are remote access connections that allow users 
to securely connect to the enterprise network and work as if they were in the offi ce. These 

3.2 Compare and Contrast Common Prevention Methods 
487  
connections use special tunneling protocols that encrypt the information being transferred 
between the user and the corporate network. Anywhere users, business partners, or vendors 
are allowed remote access to the network, VPN connections should be used. VPNs were 
discussed in Chapter 6.
DLP
Data loss prevention (DLP) solutions are designed to prevent sensitive material from 
purposefully or inadvertently escaping the organization. These solutions allow you to 
specify exactly what actions each user may take with respect to a document. For exam-
ple, it may allow the document to be read but neither printed nor forwarded to another 
user.
Disabling Ports
One of the basic principles of security is to reduce the attack surface of all devices. This 
means shutting off all services and application that are not required and to close all ports 
not being used. With respect to switches and hubs, this means disabling any ports that 
do not have devices connected to them. If this is not done, anyone could walk up to any 
unused wall outlet, plug in a device, get an IP address through DHCP, and be on your 
network.
Access Control Lists
Access control lists are sets of rules configured on a router or firewall that control the type 
of traffic allowed to enter or leave an interface. These lists are what make packet filtering 
firewalls work. Using these lists, an administrator can at a granular level define who can 
send specific types of traffic to specific locations. For example, you could prevent a user 
from using Telnet to connect to the sales server, without preventing him from using Telnet 
to any other devices and without impacting any of his other activities.
Smart Card
Smart cards were discussed in the section “Physical Security” earlier in this chapter. While 
the emphasis there was on using smart cards for physical security, these cards can also be 
used to log on to the network and thus to access resources.
Email Filtering
While email filtering is typically discussed in the context of preventing spam, the orga-
nization must also be concerned about the contents and types of email sent by the users. 
Because the users are representing the organization in everything they do, you want them 
to follow certain guidelines. Email filtering allows for the recognition and the blocking of 
messages that contain content that is not compliant with these guidelines. Configuring the 
filtering solution in such a way that it recognizes and blocks noncompliant emails while 
leaving compliant emails unaffected can be a tremendous challenge.

488 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
Trusted/Untrusted Software Sources
Users frequently download and install software and not always from the safest sources. 
While policies should definitely reflect the desire of the organization to prevent unauthor-
ized software downloads and installation, you may have to go beyond policies and imple-
ment a software restriction tool that prevents users from doing this. If you want to prevent 
all downloads and installations by users, you can use a Group Policy in Windows to require 
administrator privileges to do any downloading or installing. If your goal is to allow some 
installations but not others, you can use additional policies to define exactly which applica-
tions are allowed and which are not.
User Education/AUP
The most effective method of preventing viruses, spyware, and harm to data is education. 
Teach your users not to open suspicious files and to open only those files that they’re rea-
sonably sure are virus-free. They need to scan every disk, email, and document they receive 
before they open them. You should also have all workstations scheduled to be automatically 
scanned on a regular basis.
While education is important, in most cases you must attempt to control what users do. 
An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a document that specifies what users can and cannot do, 
and it should be signed by all during the hiring process. This creates a contract that can be 
used later to form the basis for disciplinary measures. These measures or consequences for 
noncompliance should be spelled out ahead of time.
Principle of Least Privilege
The concept of least privilege is a simple one: when assigning permissions, give users 
only the permissions they need to do their work and no more. This is especially true with 
administrators. Users who need administrative-level permissions should be assigned two 
accounts: one for performing nonadministrative, day-to-day tasks and the other to be used 
only when performing administrative tasks that specifically require an administrative-level 
user account. Those users should be educated on how each of the accounts should be used.
The biggest benefit to following this policy is the reduction of risk. The biggest headache 
with following this policy is trying to deal with users who may not understand it. A man-
ager, for example, may assert that he should have more permission than those who report 
to him, but giving those permissions to him also opens up all the possibilities for inadver-
tently deleting files, crippling accounts, and so forth.
A least privilege policy should exist, and be enforced, throughout the enterprise. Users 
should have only the permissions and privileges needed to do their jobs and no more. ISO 
standard 27002 (which updates 17799) sums it up well: “Privileges should be allocated 
to individuals on a need-to-use basis and on an event-by-event basis, i.e., the minimum 
requirement for their functional role when needed.” Adopting this as the policy for your 
organization is highly recommended.

There is an entire domain dedicated to security for A+. Add to that, CompTIA is heavily 
into security certifications with Security+ and CASP (CompTIA Advanced Security 
Practitioner), so you can see how important the topic is to those creating the exam. Because 
of that, make sure you have a good understanding of the topics covered here.
You want to make certain that your systems, and the data within them, are kept as 
secure as possible. The security prevents others from changing the data, destroying it, or 
inadvertently harming it. This can be done by assigning users the least privileges possible 
and hardening as much of the environment as possible. The following are the subobjectives

User and Groups
There are a number of groups created on the operating system by default. The following 
sections look at the main ones of these.

490 
Chapter 7 ■ Security
 Administrator 
 The Administrator account is the most powerful of all: it has the power to do everything 
from the smallest task all the way up to removing the operating system. Because of the 
great power it holds and the fact that it is always created, many who try to do harm will 
target this account as the one they try to break into. To increase security, during the instal-
lation of the Windows operating systems in question, you are prompted for a name of a 
user who will be designated as the Administrator. The power then comes not from being 
truly called Administrator (it might now be tmcmillan, mcmillant, or something similar) 
but from being a member of the Administrators group (notice the plural for the group and 
singular for the user). 
 Since members of the Administrators group have such power, they can inadvertently do 
harm (such as accidentally deleting a fi le that a regular user could not). To protect against 
this, the practice of logging in with an Administrators account for daily interaction is 
strongly discouraged. Instead, system administrators should log in with a user account 
(lesser privileges) and change to the Administrators group account (elevated privileges) only 
when necessary. 
 Power User 
 The Power Users group is not as powerful as Administrators group. Membership in this 
group gives read/write permission to the system, allowing them to install most soft-
ware but keeping them from changing key operating system fi les. This is a good group 
for those who need to test software (such as programmers) and junior administrators. 
While the Power Users group exists in Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 and 
8.1, it is mostly there for legacy purposes and no longer has any more privileges than a 
standard user.  
 Guest 
 The Guest account is created by default (and should be disabled) and is a member of the 
Guests group. For the most part, members of Guests have the same rights as Users except 
they can’t get to log fi les. The best reason to make users members of the Guests group is if 
they are accessing the system only for a limited time. 
 As part of operating system security, we usually recommend you 
rename the default Administrator and Guest accounts that are created at 
installation. 
 Standard User 
 This group is the default that regular users belong to. Members of this group have read/
write permission to their own profi le. They cannot modify system-wide Registry settings 
or do much harm outside of their own account. Under the principle of least privilege, users 

3.3 Compare and Contrast Differences of Basic Windows OS Security Settings 
491
should be made a member of the Users group only unless qualifying circumstances force 
them to have higher privileges. 
 NTFS vs. Share Permissions 
 The New Technology File System (NTFS) was introduced with Windows NT to address 
security problems. Before Windows NT was released, it had become apparent to Microsoft 
that a new fi lesystem was needed to handle growing disk sizes, security concerns, and the 
need for more stability. NTFS was created to address those issues. 
 Although FAT was relatively stable, if the systems that were controlling it kept run-
ning, it didn’t do well when the power went out or the system crashed unexpectedly. One 
of the benefi ts of NTFS was a transaction tracking system, which made it possible for 
Windows NT to back out of any disk operations that were in progress when Windows NT 
crashed or lost power. 
 With NTFS, fi les, directories, and volumes can each have their own security. NTFS’s 
security is fl exible and built in. Not only does NTFS track security in ACLs, which can 
hold permissions for local users and groups, but each entry in the ACL can specify what 
type of access is given—such as Read, Write, Modify, or Full Control. This allows a great 
deal of fl exibility in setting up a network. In addition, special fi le-encryption programs 
were developed to encrypt data while it was stored on the hard disk. 
 Microsoft strongly recommends that all network shares be established using NTFS. 
Several current operating systems from Microsoft support both FAT32 and NTFS. 
It’s possible to convert from FAT32 to NTFS without losing data, but you can’t do the 
operation in reverse (you would need to reformat the drive and install the data again 
from a backup tape). 
 If you’re using FAT32 and want to change to NTFS, the convert utility will 
allow you to do so. For example, to change the E drive to NTFS, the com-
mand is  convert e: /FS:NTFS . 
 Share permissions apply only when a user is accessing a fi le or folder through the 
network. Local permissions and attributes are used to protect the fi le when the user 
is local. With FAT and FAT32, you do not have the ability to assign “extended” or 
“extensible” permissions, and the user sitting at the console effectively is the owner of 
all resources on the system. As such, they can add, change, and delete any data or fi le 
that they want. 
 With NTFS as the fi lesystem, however, you are allowed to assign more comprehensive 
security to your computer system. NTFS permissions are able to protect you at the fi le level. 
Share permissions can be applied to the directory level only. NTFS permissions can affect 
users logged on locally or across the network to the system where the NTFS permissions 
are applied. Share permissions are in effect only when the user connects to the resource via 
the network. 

492 
Chapter 7 ■ Security
 Share and NTFS permissions are not cumulative. Permission must be 
granted at both levels to allow access. Moreover, the effective permission 
that the user has will be the most restrictive of the combined NTFS permis-
sion and the combined share permissions. 
 Allow vs. Deny 
 Within NTFS, permissions for objects fall into one of three categories: allow, not allow, 
and deny. When viewing the permissions for a fi le or folder, you can check the box for 
Allow, which effectively allows that group that action. You can also uncheck the box for 
Allow, which does not allow that group that action. Alternatively, you can check the box 
Deny, which prevents that group from using that action. There is a difference between not 
allowing (a cleared check box) and Deny (which specifi cally prohibits), and you tend not to 
see Deny used often. Deny, when used, trumps other permissions. 
 Permissions set at a folder are inherited down through subfolders, unless otherwise 
changed. Permissions are also cumulative: if a user is a member of a group that has read 
permission and a member of a group that has write permission, they effectively have both 
read and write permission. 
 Moving vs. Copying Folders and Files 
 When you copy a fi le, you create a new entity. When you move a fi le, you simply relocate it 
and still have but one entity. This distinction is important when it comes to understanding 
permissions. A copy of a fi le will generally have the permissions assigned to it that are placed 
on newly created fi les in that folder—regardless of what permissions were on the original fi le. 
 A moved fi le, on the other hand, will attempt to keep the same permissions as it had in 
the original location. Differences will occur if the same permissions cannot exist in the new 
location—for example, if you are moving a fi le from an NTFS volume to FAT32, the NTFS 
permissions will be lost. If, on the other hand, you are moving from a FAT32 volume to an 
NTFS volume, new permissions will be added that match those for newly created entities. 
 Folder copy and move operations follow similar guidelines to those with fi les. 
 File Attributes 
 Permissions can be allowed or denied individually on a per-folder basis. You can assign any 
combination of the values shown in Table  7.1 . 
 TA b l E  7.1   NTFS directory permissions 
NTFS Permission
Meaning
Full Control
This gives the user all the other choices and the ability to change 
permission. The user also can take ownership of the directory or 
any of its contents.

493  
NTFS Permission
Meaning
Modify
This combines the Read & Execute permission with the Write per-
mission and further allows the user to delete everything, including 
the folder.
Read & Execute
This combines the permissions of Read with those of List Folder 
Contents and adds the ability to run executables.
List Folder Contents
The List Folder Contents permission (known simply as List in pre-
vious versions) allows the user to view the contents of a directory 
and to navigate to its subdirectories. It does not grant the user 
access to the files in these directories unless that is specified in file 
permissions.
Read
This allows the user to navigate the entire directory structure, view 
the contents of the directory, view the contents of any files in the 
directory, and see ownership and attributes.
Write
This allows the user to create new entities within the folder, as well 
as to change attributes.
Clicking the Advanced button allows you to configure auditing and ownership prop-
erties. You can also apply NTFS permissions to individual files. This is done from the 
Security tab for the file. Table 7.2 lists the NTFS file permissions.

Ta b l e   7.1    NTFS directory permissions  (continued)

494 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
By default, the determination of NTFS permissions is based on the cumulative NTFS 
permissions for a user. Rights can be assigned to users based on group membership and 
individually; the only time permissions do not accumulate is when the Deny permission is 
invoked.
Shared Files and Folders
You can share folders, and the files beneath them, by right-clicking them and choos-
ing Share With (Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows 8) from the context menu. 
In Windows 7, the context menu asks who you want to share the folder or file with (see 
Figure 7.8).
F i g u r e   7. 8     Sharing a folder in Windows 7
The options you see on the context menu will depend on the type of network you are 
connected to—a domain, a workgroup, or a Homegroup (the one shown in Figure 7.8). If 
you turn on password-protected sharing (the default), the person accessing the share has to 
give a username and password to access the shared entity.
The advanced sharing settings will come up if you try to share something in one of 
the Public folders or make other changes. This interface, shown in Figure 7.9, can also be

accessed through the Network and Sharing Center applet in the Control Panel and is used 
to change network settings relevant to sharing.
F i g u r e   7. 9     Advanced sharing in Windows 7
Administrative Shares vs. Local Shares
Administrative shares are created on servers running Windows on the network for adminis-
trative purposes. These shares can differ slightly based on which OS is running but always 
end with a dollar sign ($) to make them hidden. There is one for each volume on a hard 
drive (c$, d$, and so on) as well as admin$ (the root folder, usually c:\windows), and print$ 
(where the print drivers are located). These are created for use by administrators and usu-
ally require administrator privileges to access.
Local shares, as the name implies, are those created locally and are visible with the icon 
of a group of two individuals.
Permission Propagation
As mentioned earlier in the discussion of permissions, permissions are cumulative. A 
user who is a member of two groups will effectively have the permissions of both groups 
combined.

496 
Chapter 7 ■ Security
 Inheritance 
 Inheritance is the default throughout the permission structure unless a specifi c setting 
is created to override this. A user who has read and write permissions in one folder will 
have that in all the subfolders unless a change has been made specifi cally to one of the 
subfolders. 
 System Files and Folders 
 System fi les are usually fl agged with the Hidden attribute, meaning they don’t appear when 
a user displays a directory listing. You should not change this attribute on a system fi le 
unless absolutely necessary. System fi les are required for the OS to function. If they are vis-
ible, users might delete them (perhaps thinking they can clear some disk space by deleting 
fi les they don’t recognize). Needless to say, that would be a bad thing! 
 User Authentication 
 You already know that users are authenticated by identifying themselves and providing 
credentials. You also have learned that these credentials can take many forms depending on 
the authentication factors in use. In the following section, you will be introduced to a fea-
ture found in almost all modern authentication systems, single sign-on. 
 Single Sign-On 
 One of the big problems that larger systems must deal with is the need for users to access 
multiple systems or applications. This may require a user to remember multiple accounts 
and passwords. The purpose of a single sign-on (SSO) is to give users access to all the appli-
cations and systems they need when they log on. This is becoming a reality in many envi-
ronments, including Kerberos, Microsoft Active Directory, Novell eDirectory, and some 
certifi cate model implementations. 
 Single sign-on is both a blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing in that once 
users are authenticated, they can access all the resources on the network 
and browse multiple directories. It’s a curse in that it removes the doors 
that otherwise exist between the user and various resources. 
 Run as Administrator vs. Standard User 
 One of the security recommendations from Microsoft is to have administrative users log 
on with a standard user account and, when necessary, elevate the privileges of the account 
temporarily to perform a task and then remove those permission when the task is complete. 
 This is done by running the task, tool, or utility as an administrator. This can be done 
by right-clicking the tool and selecting Run as Administrator. Once the tool is closed, that 

3.3 Compare and Contrast Differences of Basic Windows OS Security Settings 
497  
security session ends, and the permissions are returned to those of a standard user. Having 
these highly privileged accounts logged in as infrequently as possible helps prevent hackers 
from gaining control of these accounts when they are live.
BitLocker
BitLocker is the whole drive encryption tool that can also seal a device such that it will not 
boot if any system files are altered. It can also lock the drive to a particular machine, prevent-
ing stealing the drive and connecting to another device. BitLocker was covered in Chapter 6.
BitLocker To Go
BitLocker To Go provides the same encryption technology to help prevent unauthorized 
access to the files stored on removable drives.
EFS
The Encrypting File System (EFS) is an encryption tool built into Windows Vista Business, 
Enterprise and Ultimate, Windows 7, and Windows 8 or 8.1 Professional or Enterprise. 
(EFS is not fully supported on Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, and Windows 
7 Home Premium.) It allows a user to encrypt files that can be decrypted only by the user 
who encrypted the files. It can be used only on NTFS volumes but is simple to use.
To encrypt a file in Windows 8.1, simply right-click the file, access the files properties, 
and on the General tab click the Advanced button. That will open the Advanced Attributes 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 7.10. On this page, check the box to Encrypt Contents To 
Secure Data.

Know the difference between single sign-on and multifactor authentication.    Single sign-
on is the concept of having the user be authenticated on all services they access after log-
ging in once. Multifactor authentication is not the opposite of single sign-on but merely 
requires more than one entity to be authenticated, for security purposes.
Know the NTFS permissions.    Permissions can be allowed or denied individually on a 
per-folder and per-file basis. Know the values shown in Tables 7.1 and 7.2.
3.4 Given a Scenario, Deploy and 
Enforce Security Best Practices to 
Secure a Workstation
In the previous objectives, the importance of user education has been mentioned. The user 
represents the weakest link in the security chain, whether the harm comes to them in the 
form of malware, social engineering, or simply avoidable mistakes. The workstation repre-
sents the digital arm of the user and must be properly and adequately secured to keep the 
user—and the network—protected.
A number of best practices are involved with securing a workstation. While a checklist 
could take many pages, depending on your environment, CompTIA has identified five that 
should appear on any roster. The following are the subobjectives covered in this chapter:

Password Best Practices
One of the strongest ways to keep a system safe is to employ strong passwords and educate 
your users in the best security practices. In this section, you’ll explore various techniques 
that can enhance the security of your user passwords.
Setting Strong Passwords
Passwords should be as long as possible. Most security experts believe a password of 10 
characters is the minimum that should be used if security is a real concern. If you use only 
the lowercase letters of the alphabet, you have 26 characters with which to work. If you 

3.4 Given a Scenario, Deploy and Enforce Security Best Practices 
499
add the numeric values 0 through 9, you’ll get another 10 characters. If you go one step fur-
ther and add the uppercase letters, you’ll then have an additional 26 characters, giving you 
a total of 62 characters with which to construct a password. 
 Most vendors recommend that you use nonalphabetical characters such as 
#, $, and % in your password, and some go so far as to require it. 
 If you used a 4-character password, this would be 62 × 62 × 62 × 62, or approximately 
14 million password possibilities. If you used 5 characters in your password, this would 
give you 62 to the fi fth power, or approximately 920 million password possibilities. If you 
used a 10-character password, this would give you 62 to the tenth power, or 8.4 × 10 17 (a 
very big number) possibilities. As you can see, these numbers increase exponentially with 
each position added to the password. The 4-digit password could probably be broken in a 
fraction of a day, whereas the 10-digit password would take considerably longer and con-
sume much more processing power. 
 If your password used only the 26 lowercase letters from the alphabet, the 4-digit pass-
word would have 26 to the fourth power, or 456,000 password combinations. A 5-charac-
ter password would have 26 to the fi fth power, or more than 11 million, and a 10-character 
password would have 26 to the tenth power, or 1.4 × 10 14 . This is still a big number, but it 
would take considerably less time to break it. 
 
 To see tables on how quickly passwords can be surmised, visit  www.lock-
down.co.uk/?pg=combi&s=articles . 
 Mathematical methods of encryption are primarily used in conjunction with other 
encryption methods as part of authenticity verifi cation. The message and the hashed value 
of the message can be encrypted using other processes. In this way, you know that the mes-
sage is secure and hasn’t been altered. 
 Password Expiration 
 The longer that a password is used, the more likely it is that it will be compromised in some 
way. It is for this reason that requiring users to change their passwords at certain intervals 
increases the security of their passwords. You should require users to set a new password 
every 30 days (more frequently for higher security networks), and you must also prevent 
them from reusing old passwords. Most password management systems have the ability to 
track previously used password and to disallow users from recycling old passwords. 
 Changing Default Usernames/Passwords 
 Default accounts represent a huge weakness in that every miscreant knows they exist. 
When an operating system is installed, whether on a workstation or a server, there are 
certain accounts created, and since the wrongdoer already knows the account name, it 

500 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
simplifies the process of getting into an account by requiring them to supply only the pass-
word. The first thing they will try, of course, is the default password if one exists.
Screensaver Required Password
A screensaver should automatically start after a short period of idle time, and that screen-
saver should require a password before the user can begin the session again. This method of 
locking the workstation adds one more level of security.
BIOS/UEFI
Passwords should be configured and required to access either the BIOS or UEFI settings on 
all devices. If this is not the case, it would be possible for someone to reboot a device, enter 
the settings, change the boot order, boot to an operating system residing on a USB or opti-
cal drive, and use that OS as a platform to access data located on the other drives. While 
this is a worst-case scenario, there is also much less mayhem a malicious person could cause 
in the BIOS and UEFI.
Requiring Passwords
Make absolutely certain you require passwords (such a simple thing to overlook in a small 
network) for all accounts, and change the default passwords on system accounts.
Account Management
While I touched on one account management technique previously (preventing the reuse of 
passwords), there are a number of additional account management best practices that you 
should know and implement.
Restricting User Permissions
When assigning user permissions, follow the principle of least privilege (discussed earlier) 
by giving users only the bare minimum they need to do their job. Assign permissions to 
groups, rather than users, and make users members of groups (or remove them from them) 
as they change roles or positions.
Login Time Restrictions
Most users have a set work schedule, and it is only during these works hours that the user 
should access the network and its resources. Since an active account is an account vulner-
able to misuse, any time in which you can disable an account while still allowing users 
to do their jobs enhances security, since a disabled account cannot be used for malicious 
purposes.
For this reason, many administrators allow users to log in only during certain hours. 
Typically, access is allowed from about an hour before their workday until about an hour 
after the day ends (to allow some flexibility). For certain users who tend to work through-
out the day and night, this system may not work.

3.4 Given a Scenario, Deploy and Enforce Security Best Practices 
501
Disabling Guest Account
To secure the system, disable all accounts that are not needed (especially the guest account). 
Next, rename the accounts if you can (Microsoft won’t allow you to rename an account to 
Administrator). Finally, change the passwords from the defaults and add them to the cycle 
of passwords that routinely get changed.
Failed Attempts Lockout
Earlier you learned that a brute-force attack is a password attack that attempts all char-
acter combinations until the password is discovered. You also learned that the attacks are 
typically performed offline and not in a live environment. Why is that? Because almost all 
password systems are set up to allow only a set number of failed password attempts before 
the account is locked. While this policy may generate more password reset calls than you 
would like, that effect can be mitigated by implementing a complementary policy that 
allows the account to be automatically reenabled after a set amount of time (say five min-
utes). When this policy is communicated to the users, they know just to wait for five min-
utes and try again.
Timeout/Screen Lock
While the relative sensitivity of the data appearing on the screen of a user’s computer can 
vary from time to time and from user to user, it is a good practice to protect that informa-
tion when someone steps away from the device. Moreover, when the device is in an out-
of-the-way location, it may even afford someone the chance to browse the device. For this 
reason, you should require a password-protected screensaver on all devices that kicks in 
after a short period of inactivity.
Disable AutoRun
It is never a good idea to put any media in a workstation that you do not know where it 
came from or what it is. The reason is that the media (CD, DVD, USB) could contain mal-
ware. Compounding matters, that malware could be referenced in the Autorun.inf file, 
causing it to be summoned when the media is inserted in the machine and requiring no 
other action. Autorun.inf can be used to start an executable, access a website, or do any of 
a large number of different tasks. The best way to prevent a user from falling victim to such 
a ploy is to disable the AutoRun feature on the workstation.
Microsoft has changed (by default, disabled) the AutoRun function on Windows Vista, 
Windows 7 and Windows 8, though running remains the default action for PCs using 
Windows XP through Service Pack 3. The reason Microsoft changed the default action 
can be summed up in a single word: security. That text-based Autorun.inf file not only 
can take your browser to a web page but can also call any executable file, pass along vari-
able information about the user, or do just about anything else imaginable. Simply put, 
it is never a good idea to take any media that you have no idea where it came from or 
what it holds and plug it into your system. Such an action opens up the user—and their 

502 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
network—to any number of possible tribulations. An entire business’s data could be jeopar-
dized by such a minuscule act if a harmful CD were placed in a computer at work by some-
one with elevated privileges.
Data Encryption
While data encryption is possible both on a drive level (BitLocker) and on an individual 
file level (EFS), always keep in mind the cost of encryption and save this tool for instances 
where you really need it. By cost I mean that any encrypted file must be decrypted to be 
opened and encrypted again to be saved. This requires CPU cycles on the device. If you 
attempt to encrypt everything, the performance of the device may make it practically unus-
able. You must strike a balance between security and usability.
Patch/Update Management
While many patches and updates either repair something that doesn’t work or add some 
additional functionality, many of them close a security hole. These are called hotfixes 
because they come out as soon as they are available and you need to apply them as soon as 
possible (after testing them in a nonproduction environment).
For best results in patch management, you should deploy an automated system that can 
check for, download, and make available to the network all patches and updates for all 
systems. A good example of such a system is Microsoft Windows Server Update Services 
(WSUS), which can manage the updates for both servers and clients and for other operating 
systems as well.
Exam Essentials
Understand the need for good passwords.    Passwords are the first line of defense for pro-
tecting an account. A password should be required for every account, and strong passwords 
should be enforced. Users need to understand the basics of password security and work to 
keep their accounts protected by following company policies regarding passwords.
List some techniques that enhance account management.    These techniques include but are 
not limited to disabling unused accounts, requiring frequent password changes, preventing 
the reuse of passwords, requiring complex passwords, and defining login hours for users.

Methods for Securing Mobile Devices

are increasingly used to store valuable data and to perform functions once the domain of 
laptops and desktops, the need to secure these devices has grown. In this section, methods

Policies and procedures
Screen Locks
One of the most basic (but not necessarily the most utilized) security measures you can 
take is to implement a screen lock on the device. This is akin to implementing the password 
you use to log on to your desktop or laptop, but it’s amazing how few people use this basic 
security measure. This can prevent someone from using the mobile device if it is stolen. 
There are several ways screen locks can be implemented, and in the following sections 
you’ll examine each method.
Fingerprint Lock
A fingerprint lock is one that uses the fingerprint of the user as credentials to authenticate 
the user and, when successful authentication completes, unlocks the screen. Because it relies 
on biometrics, it is for the most part more secure than using a passcode or a swipe.
Face Lock
A face lock is one that one that uses a facial scan of the user to authenticate the user and, 
when successful authentication completes, unlocks the screen. It also is more secure than a 
passcode or swipe process.
Swipe Lock
Swipe locks use a gesture or series of gestures, sometimes involving the movement of an 
icon to open the screen. In some cases, they require only knowledge of the mobile platform 

504 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
in use; they offer no security to the process because no authentication of the user is occur-
ring. In other instances like Android, they require a pattern between nine dots to be swiped 
to unlock the device.
Passcode Lock
Setting the password on an Android phone is done by navigating to Settings Location & 
Security   Change Screen Lock. On the Change Screen Lock page, you can set the length of 
time the device remains idle until the screen locks as well as choose a method from None, 
Pattern, PIN, or Password. Select Password and then enter the desired password.
On an iOS-based device, navigate to Settings   Settings   Passcode Lock to set the pass-
word and Settings   General   Auto-Lock to set the amount of time before the iPhone locks.
Remote Wipes
Remote wipes are instructions sent remotely to a mobile device that erase all the data when 
the device is stolen. In the case of the iPhone, this feature is closely connected to the locater 
application (discussed in the next section). To perform a remote wipe on an iPhone (which 
requires iOS 5), navigate to Settings   iCloud. On this tab, ensure that Find My iPhone is 
enabled (set to On). Next, use the browser to go to iCloud.com and log in using the Apple 
ID you use on your phone.
Next, select the icon Find My iPhone. The location of the phone will appear on a map. 
Click the i icon next to the location. On the dialog box that opens, select Remote Wipe. 
You will be prompted again to ensure that is what you want to do. Select Wipe Phone.
The Android phones do not come with an official remote wipe. You can, however, install 
an Android app that will do this. Once the app, Lost Android, is installed, it works in the 
same way the iPhone remote wipe does. In this case, you log into the Lost Android website 
using your Google login. From the site, you can locate and wipe the device.
Android Device Manager, which is loaded on newer versions of Android, is available for 
download to any version of Android from 2.3 onward providing almost identical function-
ality to that of the iPhone.
Locator Applications
Locator applications like the Lost Android app for Android are available where apps are 
sold for Androids. These apps allow you to locate the device, to lock the device, and even to 
send a message to the device offering a reward for its return. Finally, you can remote wipe 
the device as well. The iOS devices and the newer Android devices have this feature built 
in, and it performs all the same functions.
Remote Backup Applications
Backing up your data with the iPhone can be done by connecting the device to a Mac and 
using iTunes to manage the content. (The data can also be backed up to a PC that has 

3.5 Compare and Contrast Various Methods for Securing Mobile Devices 
505  
iTunes.) As users start to use the mobile device as their main tool, this may not be an opti-
mal way to manage backups. New apps like Mozy are available that perform an online 
backup, which is attractive because the laptop or desktop where you backed up your data is 
not always close at hand but the Internet usually is.
Android has always taken a cloud approach to backups. There are many Android apps 
now that can be used to back up data to locations such as Dropbox or Box.net.
Failed Login Attempts Restrictions
Most of us have become accustomed to the lockout feature on a laptop or desktop that 
locks out an account after a certain number of failed login attempts. This feature is avail-
able on a mobile device and can even be set to perform a remote wipe of the device after 
repeated failed login attempts.
On the iOS, the Erase Data function can be set to perform a remote wipe after 10 failed 
passcode attempts. After 6 failed attempts, the iPhone locks out users for a minute before 
another passcode can be entered. The device increases the lockout time following each 
additional failed attempt.
The Android does not have this feature built in but does provide the APIs that allow 
enterprise developers to create applications that will do this.
Antivirus/antimalware
Mobile devices can suffer from viruses and malware just like laptops and desktops. Major 
antivirus vendors such as McAfee and Kaspersky make antivirus and antimalware products 
for mobile devices that provide the same real-time protection that the products do for desk-
tops. The same guidelines apply for these mobile devices: keep them up-to-date by setting 
the device to check for updates whenever connected to the Internet.
Patching/OS Updates
Security patches and operating system updates are available on an ongoing basis for both 
the iOS and the Android. For the iPhone, both operating system updates and security 
patches are available at the Apple support site. Automatic updates can be enabled for the 
device in iTunes. Use the Check For Updates button located in the middle of iTunes.
An auto-update feature is built into Android, and you can also manually check for 
patches and updates by navigating to Settings   About Phone   System Updates. Selecting 
these options will cause the phone to check for, download, and install patches or updates.
Biometric Authentication
Most mobile devices now offer the option to incorporate biometrics as an authentication 
mechanism. The two most common implementations of this use fingerprint scans or facial 
scans or facial recognition technology. While there can be issues with both false negatives 

506 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
(the denial of a legitimate user) and false positives (the admission of an illegitimate user), 
they offer much better security than other authentication mechanisms.
Full Device Encryption
Full device encryption is available for smartphones and other mobile devices. Most compa-
nies choose to implement this through the use of an enterprise mobility management system 
since it can also manage the installation of updates, the tracking of devices, and the deploy-
ment of remote wipes and GPS location services when needed. There are also third-party 
applications that can provide full device encryption.
Multifactor Authentication
Authentication factors describe the method used to verify the user’s identity. There are 
three available authentication factors:
■
■
Something you know (such as a password)
■
■
Something you are (such as a fingerprint)
■
■
Something you have (such as a smart card)
When two different types of factors are required (such as something you know and 
something you have), it is called multifactor authentication. It is important for you to 
understand that using two or more of the same type of factors (such as a password and a PIN, 
both something you know) is not multifactor authentication. However, when multifactor 
authentication is used for mobile devices, the level of security is significantly increased.
Authenticator Applications
Authenticator applications, such as Google Authenticator, make it possible for a mobile 
device to use a time-based one-time password (TOTP) algorithm with a site or system that 
requires such authentication. In the setup operation, the site provides a shared secret key 
to the user over a secure channel to be stored in the authenticator app. This secret key will 
be used for all future logins to the site. The user will enter a username and password into 
a website or other server, generate a one-time password for the server using TOTP running 
locally, and type that password into the server as well. The server will then also run TOTP 
to verify the entered one-time password. While Google makes versions for multiple mobile 
platforms, there are also other third-party solutions.
Trusted Sources vs. Untrusted Sources
Applications and utilities for mobile devices can come from both trusted and untrusted 
sources. An example of a trusted source is the official Google Play site or the Apple Store. 
That doesn’t mean these are the only trusted sources, but users should treat this issue with 
the same approach they have been taught with regard to desktop and laptop computers.

3.5 Compare and Contrast Various Methods for Securing Mobile Devices 
507  
Any piece of software, be it an application, tool, or utility, can come with malware 
attached. Users should be trained to regard any software downloads with suspicion. It may 
be advisable to use an enterprise mobility management system to prevent users from down-
loading any software to a company-owned mobile device. You also may want to deselect 
the setting shown in Figure 7.11, which is an Android device setting. Apple devices warn 
users with a pop-up message when they download from an unknown source.
F i g u r e   7.11    Allowing applications from unknown sources
Firewalls
Because today’s mobile devices function more like laptops and desktop systems, they need 
the same protection. Mobile device firewall products are those that install on the device 
and protect the device in the same way a personal firewall on a desktop system, such as the 
Windows Firewall, does.
The disadvantage to this approach is that the software runs continuously, thus 
placing an ongoing load on the battery. Likewise, intrusion prevention and intrusion 

508 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
detection software can be placed on mobile devices, again with the same effect on bat-
tery lifetime.
If you need another reason to invest in an enterprise mobility management system, this 
is it. Most solutions include a firewall product of some sort in the suite. One consideration 
when choosing a solution is to balance the features you need against the memory footprint 
of the solution because memory is a scarce resource in mobile devices.
Policies and Procedures
With the introduction of mobile devices to the network, changes and additions may be called 
for in the organizational security policy. As procedures are derived from broader policies, these 
changes will also impact the procedures that users are required to follow. In this section, you’ll 
look at two issues that need to be considered with respect to policies and procedures.
BYOD vs. Corporate Owned
One of the decisions that must be made is whether to allow only company-owned mobile 
devices on the network or to allow personal devices as well. Many organizations have 
launched bring your own device (BYOD) initiatives. While this certainly makes the users 
happy, it brings with it new challenges in securing a wide range of user devices running on 
all sorts of platforms.
One of the ways enterprises have successfully implemented these initiatives without 
sacrificing the security of the network is by turning to enterprise mobility management sys-
tems. These systems can be used to control a wide variety of mobile devices and to manage 
the installation of updates, the tracking of devices, and the deployment of remote wipes and 
GPS location services when needed. Without one of these utilities, deploying BYOD can be 
a security nightmare.
Profile Security Requirements
The baseline or minimum security settings required on all mobile devices must be deter-
mined and standardized. This may require the creation of multiple security profiles based 
on different mobile device models and types, but the theory is the same. By defining a col-
lection of security settings, implementing them on all devices, and constantly monitoring 
the settings for changes, you can ensure that these settings are maintained.
Exam Essentials

include passcode locks, remote wipes, locator applications, failed login attempt restrictions, 
and remote backup applications.

date and set the mobile device to automatically check for OS updates and patches.

3.6 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Data Destruction and Disposal Methods 
509
 3.6 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate 
Data Destruction and Disposal Methods 
 Think of all the sensitive data written to a hard drive. The drive can contain information 
about students, clients, users—anyone and anything. That hard drive can be in a desktop 
PC, a laptop, or even a printer (many laser printers above consumer grade offer the ability 
to add a hard drive to store print jobs). If it falls into the wrong hands, you can lose valu-
able data but also risk a lawsuit for not properly protecting privacy. An appropriate data 
destruction/disposal plan should be in place to avoid any potential problems. 
 Since data on media holds great value and liability, that media should never be sim-
ply tossed away for prying eyes to stumble upon. For the purposes of this objective, I’ll 
talk about hard drives, and there are three key concepts to understand in regard to them: 
formatting, sanitation, and destruction. Formatting prepares the drive to hold new infor-
mation (which can include copying over data already there). Sanitation involves wiping the 
data on the drive, whereas destruction renders the drive no longer usable. The subobjectives 
covered in this section include the following: 
 
■
 Physical destruction 
 
■
 Recycling or repurposing best practices 
 While this objective is heavily focused on hard drives, it is also possible to 
have data stored on portable flash drives, backup tapes, CDs, or DVDs. In 
the interest of security, I recommend that you destroy them before dispos-
ing of them as well. 
 Physical Destruction 
 Physically destroying the drive involves rendering the component no longer usable. While 
the focus is on hard drives, you can also physically destroy other forms of media, such as 
fl ash drives and CD/DVDs. 
 Shredder 
 When it comes to DVDs and CDs, many commercial paper shredders include the ability to 
destroy them. Paper shredders, however, are not able to handle hard drives, and you need a 
shredder created for just such a purpose. Jackhammer makes a low-volume model that will 
destroy eight drives per minute and carries a suggested list price of just under $30,000. 
 Drill/Hammer 
 If you don’t have the budget for a hard drive shredder, you can accomplish similar results in 
a much more time-consuming way with a power drill. The goal is to physically destroy the 

510 
Chapter 7 ■ Security
platters in the drive. Start the process by removing the cover from the drive—this is nor-
mally done with a Torx driver (while #8 does not work with all, it is a good one to try fi rst). 
You can remove the arm with a slotted screwdriver and then the cover over the platters 
using a Torx driver. Don’t worry about damaging or scratching anything because nothing is 
intended to be saved. Everything but the platters can be tossed away. 
 As an optional step, you can completely remove the tracks using a belt sander, grinder, 
or palm sander. The goal is to turn the shiny surface into fi ne powder. This adds one more 
layer of assurance that nothing usable remains. Always be careful to wear eye protection 
and not breathe in any fi ne particles that you generate during the grinding/destruction 
process. 
 Following this, use the power drill to create the smallest particles possible. A drill press 
works much better for this task than trying to hold the drive and drill it with a handheld 
model. Finally you can use a hammer to destroy the platters as well and it provides a cer-
tain level of satisfaction if the drive died and you had to restore it from backup. 
 Even with practice, you will find that manually destroying a hard drive is 
time-consuming. There are companies that specialize in this and can do it 
efficiently. One such company is Shred-it, which will pick it up from you 
and provide a chain-of-custody assurance and a certificate of destruction 
upon completion. You can find out more about what it offers here: 
www.shredit.com/shredding-service/What-to-shred/Hard-drive-
destruction.aspx  
 Electromagnetic/Degaussing 
 Degaussing involves applying a strong magnetic fi eld to initialize the media (this is also 
referred to as disk wiping). This process helps ensure that information doesn’t fall into the 
wrong hands. 
 Since degaussing uses a specifi cally designed electromagnet to eliminate all data on the 
drive, that destruction also includes the factory prerecorded servo tracks. You can fi nd wand 
model degaussers priced at just over $500 or desktop units that sell for up to $30,000.  
 Degaussing hard drives is difficult and may render the drive unusable. 
 Incineration 
 A fi nal option that exists for some forms of storage is to burn the media. Regardless of 
whether the media is a hard drive, CD, DVD, solid-state drive, or fl oppy disk, the media 
must be reduced to ash, or in the case of hard drive platters, the internal platters must be 
physically deformed using heat. 

3.6 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Data Destruction and Disposal Methods 
511
 Certificate of Destruction 
 Certifi cates of destruction are documents that attest to either the physical destruction of the 
media on which sensitive data was located or a scientifi cally approved method of removing 
the data from a drive. In a later section of this chapter, you will be introduced to some 
methods of removal that are both approved and unapproved. 
 These documents are typically issued to the organization by a storage vendor or cloud pro-
vider to prove either that the data has been removed or that the media has been destroyed.  
 Recycling or Repurposing Best Practices 
 While destroying the media is certainly a way to safeguard the data, in some cases you 
want to reuse the media. It is possible to safely do so if you follow certain practices for 
removing the data while avoiding others. In this section, you’ll learn about methods of 
removal, some of which are both recommended and others you should avoid. 
 Low-Level Format vs. Standard Format 
 Multiple levels of formatting can be done on a drive. A standard format—accomplished 
using the operating system’s format utility (or similar)—can mark space occupied by fi les as 
available for new fi les without truly deleting what was there. Such erasing—if you want to 
call it that—doesn’t guarantee that the information isn’t still on the disk and recoverable. 
 A low-level format (typically accomplished only in the factory) can be performed on the 
system, or a utility can be used to completely wipe the disk clean. This process helps ensure 
that information doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. 
 IDE hard drives are low-level formatted by the manufacturer. Low-level formatting must 
be performed even before a drive can be partitioned. In low-level formatting, the drive con-
troller chip and the drive meet for the fi rst time and learn to work together. Because IDE 
drives have their controllers integrated into the drive, low-level formatting is a factory pro-
cess with these drives. Low-level formatting is not operating system dependent. 
 Never low-level format IDE or SCSI drives! They’re low-level formatted 
from the factory, and you may cause problems by using low-level utilities 
on these types of drives. 
 The main thing to remember for the exams is that most forms of formatting included with 
the operating system do not actually completely erase the data. Formatting the drive and then 
disposing of it has caused many companies problems when the data has been retrieved by 
individuals who never should have seen it using applications that are commercially available.  
 Overwrite 
 Overwriting the drive entails copying over the data with new data. A common practice is 
to replace the data with 0s. A number of applications allow you to recover what was there 

512 
Chapter 7  ■  Security  
prior to the last write operation, and for that reason, most overwrite software will write the 
same sequence and save it multiple times.
Drive Wipe
If it’s possible to verify beyond a reasonable doubt that a piece of hardware that’s no longer 
being used doesn’t contain any data of a sensitive or proprietary nature, that hardware can 
be recycled (sold to employees, sold to a third party, donated to a school, and so on). That 
level of assurance can come from wiping a hard drive or using specialized utilities.
If you can’t be assured that the hardware in question doesn’t contain important data, the 
hardware should be destroyed. You cannot, and should not, take a risk that the data your 
company depends on could fall into the wrong hands.
Exam Essentials
Understand the difference between standard and low-level formatting.    Standard format-
ting uses operating system tools and makes the drive available for holding data without 
truly removing what was on the drive (thus the data can be recovered). A low-level format 
is operating system independent and destroys any data that was on the drive.
Understand how to physically destroy a drive.    A hard drive can be destroyed by tossing it 
into a shredder designed for such a purpose, or it can be destroyed with an electromagnet 
in a process known as degaussing. You can also disassemble the drive and destroy the plat-
ters with a drill or other tool that renders the data irretrievable.
3.7 Given a Scenario, Secure SOHO

Wireless Specific
Wireless networks present their own unique set of challenges that wired networks do not. 
The communication methods are somewhat different, as are the attack methods. In this 
section, security issues that are relevant only to a WLAN are discussed.
Changing Default SSID
Every wireless AP or wireless router on the market comes with a default SSID. Cisco mod-
els use the name tsunami, for example. You should change these defaults and create a new 
SSID to represent your WLAN. Typically, when hackers see a default SSID, they make the 
assumption (a reasonable one to make) that if the SSID was left to the default, the adminis-
trator password was as well. Moreover, if you also failed to change that, hackers can now 
log in, take over your AP, and lock you out.
Setting Encryption
The available types of wireless encryption (WEP, WPA, WPA2, and so on) were discussed 
in Chapter 2, “Networking.” Know that you should always enable encryption for any 
SOHO network you administer and that you should choose the strongest level of encryp-
tion you can work with. Keep in mind that WEP is no longer considered secure and WPA is 
considered weak, so avoid their use if possible.
Disabling SSID Broadcast
One method of “protecting” the network that is often recommended is to turn off the SSID 
broadcast. The AP is still there and can be accessed by those who know about it, but it pre-
vents those who are just scanning from finding it. This should be considered a weak form 
of security because there are still other ways, albeit a bit more complicated, to discover the 
presence of the AP besides the SSID broadcast.
Antenna and Access Point Placement
Antenna placement can be crucial in allowing clients to reach the AP. There isn’t any one 
universal solution to this issue, and it depends on the environment in which the AP is 
placed. As a general rule, the greater the distance the signal must travel, the more it will 
attenuate, but you can lose a signal quickly in a short space as well if the building materials 
reflect or absorb the signal. You should try to avoid placing APs near metal (which includes 
appliances) or near the ground. Placing them in the center of the area to be served, and high 
enough to get around most obstacles, is recommended.
On the other end of the spectrum, you have to contend with the problem of the signal 
traveling outside your intended network (known as signal leakage) and being picked up in 

514 
Chapter 7 ■ Security
public areas by outsiders. To lessen this problem, use RF-absorbent materials on external 
walls, essentially shielding the surroundings. 
 Radio Power Levels 
 On the chance that the signal is actually traveling too far, some APs include  power-level 
controls that allow you to reduce the amount of output provided. 
 You can find a great source for information on RF power values and anten-
nas on the Cisco site at  http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/
wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/23231-powervalues-23231.html 
 WPS 
 Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS) was a concept that was designed to make it easier for less 
knowledgeable users to add a new client to the WLAN without manually entering the secu-
rity information on the client. One method involves pushing a button on the AP at the same 
time a client is attempting to join the network so that the settings are sent to the client. 
Other methods involve placing the client close to the AP, and near-fi eld communication is 
used for the process. 
 Regardless of the details, as often happens when we try to make security simpler, we 
make it fail. It has been discovered that a hacker can identify the PIN used in a short period 
of time and with it the network’s WPA/WPA2 preshared key. For this reason, the Wi-Fi 
Alliance has recommended against using this feature. 
 Change Default Usernames and Passwords 
 Default accounts not only include those created with the installation of the operating 
systems but are also often associated with hardware. Wireless APs, routers, and similar 
devices often include accounts for interacting with, and administering, those devices. You 
should always change the passwords associated with those devices and, where possible, 
change the usernames. 
 If there are accounts that are not needed, disable them or delete them. Make certain 
you use strong password policies and protect the passwords with the same security you do 
for any users or administrators (in other words, don’t write the router’s password on an 
address label and stick it to the bottom of the router). 
 In Windows, the Guest account is automatically created in Windows with the intent that 
it is to be used when someone must access a system but lacks a user account on that system. 
Since it is so widely known to exist, I recommend that you not use this default account and 
instead create another one for the same purpose if you truly need one. The Guest account 
leaves a security risk at the workstation and should be disabled to prevent it from being 
accessed by those attempting to gain unauthorized access. 

3.7 Given a Scenario, Secure SOHOWireless and Wired Networks  
515
 Change  every username and password that you can so they vary from their 
default settings. 
 Enable MAC Filtering 
 Most APs and network switches offer the ability to turn on  MAC fi ltering , but it is off 
by default. In the default state, any wireless client that knows the values looked for can 
join the network, and any device connected to a switch port can send traffi c. When MAC 
fi ltering is used, the administrator compiles a list of the MAC addresses associated with 
the users’ computers and enters those. When a client attempts to connect and other values 
have been correctly entered, an additional check of the MAC address is done. If the address 
appears in the list, the client is allowed to join; otherwise, they are forbidden from doing 
so. On a number of wireless devices, the term  network lock is used in place of MAC fi lter-
ing, and the two are synonymous. 
 Adding port authentication to MAC filtering takes security for the network 
down to the switch port level and increases your security exponentially. 
 Assign Static IP Addresses 
 While DHCP can be a godsend, a SOHO network is small enough that you can get by 
without it issuing IP addresses to each host. The advantage to statically assigning the IP 
addresses is that you can make certain which host is associated with which IP address and 
then utilize fi ltering to limit network access to only those hosts. 
 While static IP addressing may not be scalable in a wired network with many devices, in 
a small network, using static IP addressing will make it impossible for someone to just plug 
into your network without knowing your IP address scheme. 
 Firewall Settings 
 All devices both wired and wireless should have personal fi rewalls enabled and confi gured 
to protect each system. In Windows, you can simply leverage the personal fi rewall that 
comes on all Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 and 8.1 computers. For operat-
ing systems that don’t come with personal fi rewall, third-party software should be imple-
mented for this purpose. These fi rewalls help to prevent other devices from connecting to 
each station without the approval of the users. 
 The presence of personal fi rewalls on all the devices does  not mean you don’t need a 
network fi rewall at the edge of the network and between sections of the network that may 
have varying security levels. You can fi nd more information on fi rewalls earlier in this 
chapter in the section “Digital Security.” 

516 
Chapter 7 ■ Security
 Port Forwarding/Mapping 
 Another option to harden the entrance to the network is to deploy port forwarding or 
mapping. Port forwarding is a function typically performed on the same device that may 
be performing network address translation (NAT). One port number is set aside on the 
gateway for the exclusive use of communicating with a service in the private network, 
located on a specifi c host. External hosts must know this port number and the address of 
the gateway to communicate with the network-internal service. The purpose of this is to 
hide the real IP address of the destination device or server to protect it from connections 
outside the LAN.  
 Disabling Ports 
 Disable all unneeded protocols/ports. If you don’t need them, remove them or prevent them 
from loading. Ports not in use present an open door for an attacker to enter. 
 Many of the newer SOHO router solutions (and some of the personal fire-
wall solutions on end-user workstations) close down the ICMP ports by 
default. Keep this in mind; it can drive you nuts when you are trying to see 
whether a new station, server, or router is up and running by using the 
ping command. This command depends on the use of ICMP. 
 Content Filtering/Parental Controls 
 Content fi ltering software examines all web connections, and in some cases emails, for 
objectionable content or sites that have been identifi ed as off-limits by the administrator. 
While this can be helpful in preventing the introduction of malware or in screening objec-
tionable content, you should be aware that these fi lters are making educated guesses about 
what to deny and allow. 
 A fi lter will invariably deny content that should be allowed and allow content that should 
be denied. Try to be as specifi c as possible when defi ning keywords that are used to identify 
sites and content and set the expectation among the users that the software is not perfect. 
 Parental controls operate on the same basic premise. 
 Update Firmware 
 In the past, updating fi rmware on devices such as APs, routers, and switches was consid-
ered to be desirable but optional. More and more security attacks are based on attacking 
the fi rmware, and for this reason fi rmware updates should be part of whatever automated 
update system you may be using (not to mention the additional functionality and bug elimi-
nation you may experience). It may be that you can get on a mailing list for each vendor 
so you can be notifi ed when fi rmware updates are available. In any case, some systematic 
method must be developed to ensure these updates are maintained.

Physical Security
Just as you would not park your car in a public garage and leave its doors wide open with 
the key in the ignition, you should educate users to not leave a workstation that they are 
logged into when they attend meetings, go to lunch, and so forth. They should log out of 
the workstation or lock it. “Lock when you leave” should be a mantra they become famil-
iar with. Locking the workstation should require a password (usually the same as their user 
password) to resume working at the workstation.
Moreover, don’t overlook the obvious need for physical security. Adding a cable to lock a 
laptop to a desk prevents someone from picking it up and walking away with a copy of your 
customer database. Laptop cases generally include a built-in security slot in which a cable lock 
can be added to prevent it from being carried away easily, like the one shown in Figure 7.12.
Figure 7.12    A cable in the security slot keeps the laptop from being carried away easily.
When it comes to desktop models, adding a lock to the back cover can prevent an 
intruder with physical access from grabbing the hard drive or damaging the internal com-
ponents. You should also physically secure network devices—routers, APs, and the like. 
Place them in locked cabinets, if possible. If they are not physically secured, the opportu-
nity exists for them to be stolen or manipulated in such a way to allow someone unauthor-
ized to connect to the network.
Exam Essentials
Know the names, purpose, and characteristics of wireless security.    Wireless networks 
can be encrypted through WEP and WPA technologies. Wireless controllers use special ID 
strings and must be configured in the network cards to allow communications. However, 
using ID string configurations doesn’t necessarily prevent wireless networks from being 
monitored, and there are vulnerabilities specific to wireless devices.
Understand the basics of antenna placement and radio power levels.    Antenna placement 
can be crucial in allowing clients to reach the AP. Place APs near the center of the area to 
be served and high enough to get around most obstacles. Power-level controls allow you to 
reduce the amount of output provided.

In this chapter, I will focus on the exam topics related to 
troubleshooting. I will follow the structure of the CompTIA 
A+ 220‐902 exam blueprint, objective 4, and explore the 
four subobjectives that you will need to master before taking the exam.
4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot 
PC Operating System Problems with 
Appropriate Tools
Because it’s software and there are so many places where things can go wrong, the operating 
system can be one of the most confusing components to troubleshoot. Sometimes it seems a 
miracle that operating systems even work at all considering the hundreds of files that work 
together to make the system function. In this section, common operating system issues and 
their solutions are covered. The topics addressed in objective 4.1 include the following:
■
■
Common symptoms

Tools
Common Symptoms
What follows in this section can seem like a daunting list of symptoms the operating sys-
tem can exhibit. With a proper plan of action and good backup (always have a backup!), 
you can approach any of these problems with confidence. In many cases today, technicians 
have ceased to spend significant amounts of time chasing operating system issues since the 
most important data is kept on servers and since computers can be reimaged so quickly 
that troubleshooting doesn’t warrant the effort. Nevertheless, you should know these basic 
symptoms and the approach to take when they present themselves.
Proprietary Crash Screens/BSOD
Once a regular occurrence when working with Windows, blue screens (also known as the 
Blue Screen of Death, or BSOD) have become less common. Occasionally, systems will 
lock up; you can usually examine the log files to discover what was happening when this 
occurred and take steps to correct it. Remember, when dealing with a blue screen, always 
ask yourself “What did I just install or change?” In many cases, the change is involved in 
the BSOD. Also keep in mind that (as the instructions on the blue screen will tell you) a 

524 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
simple reboot will often fix the problem. Retaining the contents of the BSOD can help trou-
bleshoot the issue. In most instances, you can find the BSOD error in Microsoft’s knowl-
edge base to help with troubleshooting.
The Apple pinwheel is displayed automatically by WindowServer when an application 
cannot handle all the events it receives. (WindowServer is the background process that runs 
the Mac OS X graphical user interface). To find out whether the CPU is a bottleneck on 
performance, use Activity Monitor (/Applications/Utilities) to monitor CPU usage. The 
pinwheel or beach ball may also appear if you don’t have enough RAM.
Software can also cause the pinwheel. Open Activity Monitor’s CPU tab and sort by the 
% CPU column in descending order; the apps at the top are the ones using the most CPU 
cycles. If an application is frozen, it will appear in red. If it is not a process with root listed 
as the user, quit it.
Failure to Boot
Booting problems can occur with corruption of the boot files or missing components. 
Common error messages include an invalid boot disk, inaccessible boot drive, missing 
NTLDR file, or missing BOOTMGR (some of which are discussed in more detail later in 
this section). Luckily, during the installation of the operating system, log files are created 
in the %SystemRoot% and %SystemRoot%\Debug folders (C:\WINNT for older systems and C:\
Windows for Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows 8). If you have a puzzling problem, 
look at these logs and see whether you can find error entries there. With Windows 7, for 
example, the following files are some of the log files created:
netsetup.log    This file differs from all the others in that it’s in the Debug folder and not just 
%SystemRoot%. Entries in it detail the workgroup and domain options given during installation.
setupact.log    Known as the action log, this file is a chronological list of what took 
place during the setup. There is a tremendous amount of information here; of key impor-
tance is whether any errors occurred. The last lines of the file can show which operation 
was transpiring when the installation failed or whether the installation ended with errors. 
Like all the log files created during setup, this file is in ASCII text format and can be viewed 
with any viewer (WordPad, Word, and so on).
setuperr.log    The error log, as this file is commonly called, is written to at the time 
errors are noted in other log files. For example, an entry in setuperr.log may show that 
an error occurred, and you can find additional information about it in setuperr.log. Not 
only are the errors here, but also the severity of each is given.
You can configure problems with system failure to write dump files (debugging infor-
mation) for later analysis when they occur by clicking Start ➢ Control Panel ➢ System 
and then clicking the Advanced System Settings option. The Advanced tab of the System 
Properties dialog box should open. Then click the Settings button in the Startup and 
Recovery section. Here, in addition to choosing the default operating system, you can con-
figure whether events should be written to the system log, whether an alert should be sent 
to the administrator, and what type of memory dump should be written.
Improper Shutdown
Although not nearly the danger it once was, when the system is improperly shut down, 
either from a loss of power or by being forced to shut down without all programs 

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot PC Operating System Problems 
525
closing, problems can result. For certain, anything that is still residing in memory and 
not saved to the disk will be lost (although Word may save you with its auto‐recovery 
feature).
In other cases, though, important files may be corrupted or lost. In fact, if some files 
are lost, the computer may not even boot after the shutdown. If the system does boot and 
you have any doubts about the integrity of important system files, execute the command 
sfc/scannow. This program (called the System File Checker) will check the file structure. 
Another good command to execute if you have any doubts is chkdsk/R. This command will 
check the disk for errors and repair them if possible.
Spontaneous Shutdown/Restart
Some restarts are a function of hardware. (See Chapter 1 for more information about 
restarts.) In other cases, it is software related. If the system is automatically restarting, 
there is the possibility that it has a virus or is unable to continue current operations (in 
other words, it has become unstable). To solve issues with viruses, Trojans, and the like, 
install virus detection software on every client (as well as on the server), keep the defini-
tions current, and run them often.
If the problem is with the system being unstable, examine the log files and try to isolate 
the problem. Reboot in safe mode (discussed in more detail in the “Tools” section) and cor-
rect any incompatibility issues. You can also deselect the Automatically Restart On Startup 
And Recovery option of the System applet (Advanced tab) in the Control Panel to prevent 
the system from rebooting.
Occasionally, systems reboot when they have been updated. This is a necessary process, 
and users are always given warning before the reboot occurs. If no one is present to choose to 
reboot later (it’s the middle of the night, for example), the reboot will take place. Users who 
leave files open overnight in an unsaved state are at risk of losing work because of this process.
Device Fails to Start/Be Detected
Usually when devices fail to start or are not detected by the system and you have eliminated 
a hardware issue, the problem involves drivers. Drivers are associated with devices, and you 
can access them by looking at the properties for the device. The following, for example, are 
the three most common tabs of an adaptor’s Properties dialog box in Device Manager (tabs 
that appear are always dependent on the type of device and its capabilities):
General    This tab displays the device type, manufacturer, and location. It also includes 
information regarding whether the device is currently working properly.
Driver    This tab displays information on the current driver and digital signer. Five com-
mand buttons allow you to see driver details, uninstall the driver, update the driver, or roll 
back the driver to the previous driver when a new driver causes an issue.
Resources    This tab shows the system resources in use (I/O, IRQ, and so on) and whether 
there are conflicts.
The most common driver‐related device issue is device failure when a new driver is 
installed. If this occurs, you can use the Roll Back Driver option in Device Manager or 
boot into the Last Known Good Configuration.

526 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
Missing DLL Message
One of the more useful error messages you can receive is one indicating a missing DLL file. 
It’s useful because it tells you exactly what’s missing. DLL files are shared by various com-
ponents. If they are missing or corrupted, you will receive an error message whenever you 
do something that requires the file. Make note of the name of the DLL and its location.
You can copy DLLs from another machine if the systems are at identical patch levels. 
Place them in the same location and the problem should be fixed. When you receive the 
error message, locate the missing DLL by searching for it. If it’s gone completely, search for 
it on another system and copy it. Then just paste it into the proper location (that should be 
the system32 folder on the drive where the operating system is installed).
Services Fail to Start
Sometimes when the system is started, you receive a message that tells you a service failed 
to start. When that occurs, use the event log to determine the service that failed. Then to 
interact with service, access the Administrative Tools section of Control Panel and choose 
Services. This starts up the Services console. You can right‐click any service and choose to 
start, stop, pause, resume, or restart it. You can also double‐click the service to access its 
properties and configure such things as the startup type, dependencies, and other variables.
If the service refuses to start, it could be that a service on which it depends will not start. 
To determine what services must be running for the problem service to start, select the 
Dependencies tab of the service’s Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 8.1.
F i g u r e   8 .1    Service dependencies

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot PC Operating System Problems 
527
In the figure you can see that the Remote Desktop service depends on both the RPC and 
Terminal Device Driver services to function. Try starting these services first. In some cases, 
you may need to trace the dependencies up several levels to get things going.
Compatibility Error
Some applications that function on an older operating system such as Windows 2000 or 
Windows XP experience problems when running on Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 
8. The problem is even more acute if the application was made to run on Windows NT or 
Windows 95/98.
When an application will not function for this reason, there are two solutions. It may 
even require using both measures to make the application function.
■
■
Set the application to operate in the mode for which it was created. In the Properties 
dialog box of each application is the Compatibility tab. There you can use a drop‐
down box to select Windows XP mode, Windows 95 mode, or whatever is required. 
Figure 8.2 shows the Compatibility tab.
■
■
Set the application to run as an administrator. Some older applications must run in 
the security context of an administrator to function, which is not generally allowed 
anymore in Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. You may have to select the 
Run This Program As An Administrator box as well. The box is near the bottom of the 
Compatibility tab, as shown in Figure 8.2.

Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
Slow System Performance
Slow system performance can come from many issues. For the purposes of this discussion, 
I will focus on performance that deteriorates after being acceptable as opposed to system 
performance that is poor from the outset (which could be a matter of insufficient resources 
such as RAM). Here is a list of possibilities:
■
■
The first thing to check is the presence of a virus. If the system seems to have an over-
abundance of disk activity, scan it for viruses using a virus program that resides exter-
nally on a CD/DVD or memory stick.
■
■
Defragment the hard drive. The more fragmented it is, the slower the disk access 
will be.
■
■
Check the space on the hard drive. When the partition or volume where the operating 
system is located becomes full, performance will suffer. This is why it is a good idea 
to store data and applications on a different partition from that holding the system 
files.
■
■
Ensure the latest updates are installed. In many cases, updates help to solve perfor-
mance problems, so make sure they are current.
■
■
Use Task Manager to determine whether a process is using too much memory or CPU 
or is simply locked up (not responding), and if necessary, end the process.
Boots to Safe Mode
In many cases, a system will not boot in regular mode but will do so in safe mode. Safe 
mode loads the operating system but none of the drivers, with the exception of those abso-
lutely essential to the system and those required for use of the keyboard, mouse, and the 
basic display (VGA mode).
If the system will start in safe mode but not otherwise, it is most likely a bad driver that 
is causing the system to hang during the bootup. One option to try for a quick fix is to 
perform a System Restore procedure to a point in time before the driver problem occurred. 
You can also use the Roll Back Driver feature to revert to the older but functional driver. 
The problem with this approach is that you have not identified the problem driver, so the 
issue may emerge again later.
If you go to Device Manager and check the status of all the devices, you should see a 
device that has a problem. Try updating the driver, which may be a better long‐term solu-
tion. Another option is to look in the system log in Event Viewer; the problem driver may 
be specified in a message there as well.
File Fails to Open
Files will sometimes not open when you click them. In some cases, it’s a problem of file 
association, which means the system doesn’t know which application to use to open the file. 
Right‐click the file and choose Open With. Then select the program to open the file. At that 

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot PC Operating System Problems 
529
point, you may realize that the program required to open the file is not present, and you 
may have to install it.
If this occurs with EXE files, the culprit is usually a virus. Remove the virus first. If the 
EXE files still fail to function, there are EXE file association fixes available that can reasso-
ciate the files with the proper program.
Missing NTLDR
The NTLDR file loads the operating system files for Windows XP and 2000. In Windows 
Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, BOOTMGR performs this operation. If it is not 
present, the system will not boot.
The good news is that this file can be copied from any other system to the operating 
system drive. In Windows XP, follow these steps:
1.	
Insert the Windows XP installation disc into the computer.
2.	
When prompted to press any key to boot from the CD, press any key.
3.	
Once in the Windows XP setup menu, press the R key to repair Windows.
4.	
Log into the problematic Windows installations (if there are more than one) by press-
ing the number of the installation in the list presented. The number will be 1 if it is the 
only installation.
5.	
Enter the administrator password.
6.	
Copy the ntldr and ntdetect.com files to the root directory of the primary hard disk. 
Where the CD‐ROM drive letter is E and your root directory is on the C drive, execute 
the following commands. Insert the proper drive letters for your CD and the root 
directory of your installation.
copy e:\i386\ntldr c:\
copy e:\i386\ntdetect.com c:\
7.	
Once both of these files have been successfully copied, remove the CD from the com-
puter and reboot.
Missing boot.ini
The boot.ini file in Windows XP and Windows 2000 holds information about which operating 
systems are installed on the computer. In Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, the 
boot configuration data (BCD) file holds this information. When the boot.ini file is missing, the 
system will not boot because the operating system files cannot be found.
Unfortunately, the boot.ini file is not a file you can copy from another system 
(unless that system is installed the same, which may be the case if the computers were 
imaged). For this reason, it is always a good idea to put the boot.ini file on an external 
drive or memory stick in case it becomes missing; then you can boot to the device, get 
the system running, and copy the boot.ini file to its proper location on the operating 
system drive.

Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
Missing Operating System
The “no operating system found” message can result from a number of issues. Among them 
are the following:
■
■
Nonsystem disk in the floppy drive
■
■
Incorrect boot device order in the BIOS
■
■
Corrupted or missing boot sector
■
■
Corrupted boot files
In short, the operating system is not actually missing; the system is missing the file that 
can either locate it or load it. Follow the steps in this section with respect to the ntldr and 
boot.ini files for Windows XP.
In Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, if using Startup Repair does not 
work, you may need to create a bootable disc to boot the device. The directions for this 
vary between the systems but can be found on the Microsoft site. Then you have two 
approaches. For Windows 8, one approach is to follow these steps:
1.	
Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.
2.	
On the Windows Setup page, select the language to install, the time and currency for-
mat, and the keyboard or input method; then click Next.
3.	
Click Repair Your Computer and select Troubleshoot.
4.	
Click Advanced Options, select Automatic Repair, and select the operating system.
The other approach is to try to rebuild the boot configuration data, booting from the 
Windows 8 installation media and following these instructions:
1.	
Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.
2.	
On the Windows Setup page, select the language to install, the time and currency for-
mat, and the keyboard or input method; then click Next.
3.	
Click Repair Your Computer and select Troubleshoot.
4.	
Click Advanced Options, click the command prompt, type the following commands, 
and press Enter after each command:
Bootrec /fixmbr
Bootrec /fixboot
Bootrec /rebuildbcd
5.	
Restart the computer. Check whether you’re able to boot now.
Missing Graphical Interface
The graphical user interface (GUI) is the method by which a person communicates with 
a computer. GUIs use a mouse, touchpad, or another mechanism (in addition to the 
keyboard) to interact with the computer to issue commands. A missing GUI or a GUI 

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot PC Operating System Problems 
531
that fails to load (see the next section) usually results from a bad driver or something 
that is preventing the operating system from loading to the point where the GUI can 
load. 
 When the GUI is missing, try booting into safe mode. If the GUI appears for safe mode, 
you know it is a driver problem and can proceed with determining the offending driver, as 
discussed in the section “Boots to Safe Mode.” 
 Missing GRUB/LILO 
 GRUB is the bootloader package on Linux and Unix systems. If it is not present, the sys-
tem may not boot. In some cases when you install Windows, it will overwrite GRUB. If 
this occurs or in any case where you need to reinstall or recover GRUB, follow these steps, 
which are based on Ubuntu: 
 1. 
 Mount the partition your Ubuntu installation is on. 
 2. 
 Bind the directories to which GRUB needs access to detect other operating systems. 
 3. 
 Using chroot, install, check, and update GRUB. 
 4. 
 Exit the chrooted system and unmount everything. 
 5. 
 Shut down and turn your computer back on, and you will be met with the default 
GRUB screen. 
 
 For more detailed assistance with this process, go to  http://howtoubuntu
.org/how-to-repair-restore-reinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd . 
 While most distributions of Unix and Linux now use GRUB, some older systems use a 
bootloader called LILO. For some of the same reasons as with GRUB, LILO may become 
corrupted or may be missing after a Windows installation. This can also be recovered by 
reinstalling it. To do so, follow these steps: 
 1. 
 Boot into Linux some other way, either using Loadlin or using a Linux boot floppy. 
 2. 
 At the Linux command prompt, just type  /sbin/lilo . 
 3. 
 Reboot and LILO will be back. 
 Kernel Panic 
 On Unix and Mac, a kernel panic is a lockup of the entire system. A panic may occur 
as a result of a hardware failure or a software bug in the operating system. It occurs 
during the boot process. These incidents should occur infrequently, and you can reboot 
to escape the problem. However, if you fi nd this is happening frequently, check the fol-
lowing items: 
 
■
 Perform a safe boot. 
 
■
 Update your software. 

532 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
■
■
Update your firmware.
■
■
Make sure your startup disk has at least 10 GB of free space.
■
■
Disconnect everything except the bare minimum (keyboard, pointing device, and dis-
play if those aren’t built in).
■
■
Check your RAM because defective RAM can cause kernel panics.
Graphical Interface Fails to Load
The approach to troubleshooting a GUI that won’t load is basically the same as for 
a missing GUI since a GUI that won’t load manifests itself as a GUI that is missing. 
Be aware that inappropriate or misinformed edits to the Registry can also delete files 
required for the GUI.
Sometimes restoring the Registry from a backup can solve the problem. Since the 
GUI will not be available, you must use the command line or the Recovery Console 
(discussed in the upcoming section “Recovery Console”). In Windows Vista, Windows 
7, and Windows 8, this is called the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). WinRE 
can be accessed in Windows Vista or Windows 7 by pressing and holding the F8 key 
early in the system boot process and then selecting the Repair Your Computer option 
from the boot menu that appears. In Windows 8, you access WinRE by following these 
steps:
1.	
Press WinKey+I and click the Power icon.
2.	
Hold down Shift and click Restart.
3.	
Click Troubleshooting.
4.	
Click Advanced Options to bring up the repair options.
Multiple Monitor Misalignment/Orientation
More and more users are discovering the value of using multiple monitors to increase pro-
ductivity. When multiple monitors are in use, it can become difficult to get all the monitors 
operating as well as each possibly can. Many times there are issues with the alignment and 
orientation.
Adjusting the alignment of the monitors refers to setting either the top or bottom edge 
of both displays at the same level in the Display properties. For example, in Figure 8.3, the 
two monitors have been aligned, so the top edges are on the same level. This will make it 
easier to move the cursor from one screen to the other by staying at the top of the screen 
when changing screens.
The display orientation refers to the how the content is spread across the monitor. 
Each screen can have its own orientation, and the four options are Landscape, Portrait, 
Landscape (Flipped), or Portrait (Flipped). To change this, select the desired orientation 
from the Orientation drop‐down box, as shown in Figure 8.4.

Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
Tools
A number of tools are available for troubleshooting operating system problems, some of 
which have been mentioned in passing in the earlier sections on common symptoms.
BIOS/UEFI
As you learned in Chapter 1, settings in both the BIOS and the newer UEFI can be used to 
troubleshoot hardware and boot problems. For more information, review the section “1.1 
Given a Scenario, Configure Settings and Use BIOS/UEFI Tools on a PC” in Chapter 1.
SFC
The System File Checker (SFC) utility was discussed in the earlier section “Improper 
Shutdown.” The purpose of this utility is to keep the operating system alive and well. SFC 
automatically verifies system files after a reboot to see whether they were changed to unpro-
tected copies.
Logs
All operating systems collect information about events that have occurred that are stored 
in log files. There are typically log files for different components, such as a security log, an 
application log, or a system log. These file can be used to troubleshoot operating system 
issues, and events related to this are usually in the system log.
If the enterprise is large, you may want to have all the devices send their logs to a central 
server, where they can be stored and analyzed. In Windows, these logs can be viewed, fil-
tered, and saved using a tool called Event Viewer. You’ll look more closely at that tool later 
in this chapter.
In Linux, the following are some of the major log files and their locations:
■
■
/var/log/messages: General and system related
■
■
/var/log/auth.log: Authentication logs
■
■
/var/log/kern.log: Kernel logs
■
■
/var/log/cron.log: Crond logs (cron job)
■
■
/var/log/maillog: Mail server logs
■
■
/var/log/qmail/: Qmail log directory (with more files inside this directory)
■
■
/var/log/httpd/: Apache access and error logs directory
■
■
/var/log/lighttpd/: Lighttpd access and error logs directory
■
■
/var/log/boot.log: System boot log
■
■
/var/log/mysqld.log: MySQL database server log file
■
■
/var/log/secure or /var/log/auth.log: Authentication log
■
■
/var/log/utmp or /var/log/wtmp: Login records file
■
■
/var/log/yum.log: yum command log file

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot PC Operating System Problems 
535
Recovery Console
The Recovery Console isn’t installed on a system by default. To install it, follow these steps:
1.	
Place the Windows disc in the system.
2.	
From a command prompt, change to the i386 directory of the CD.
3.	
Type winnt32 /cmdcons.
4.	
A prompt appears, alerting you to the fact that 7 MB of hard drive space is required 
and asking whether you want to continue. Click Yes.
Upon successful completion of the installation, the Recovery Console is added as a menu 
choice at the bottom of the startup menu. To access it, you must choose it from the list at 
startup. If more than one installation of Windows exists on the system, another boot menu 
will appear, asking which you want to boot into, and you must make a selection to continue.
To perform this task, you must give the administrator password. You’ll then arrive at a com-
mand prompt. You can give a number of commands from this prompt, two of which are worth 
special attention: exit restarts the computer, and help lists the commands you can give.
For Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8, you must use the Windows Recovery 
Environment rather than the Recovery Console. See the section “Graphical Interface Fails 
to Load” for steps to access this tool.
Repair Discs
The Windows Backup and Restore tool allows you to create a system repair disc in 
Windows 7. As the name implies, this is a disc you can use to repair a portion of the system 
in the event of a failure. To create a system repair disc, follow these steps:
1.	
Open Backup and Restore by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking 
System And Maintenance, and then clicking Backup And Restore.
2.	
In the left pane, click Create A System Repair Disc, and then follow the steps. If you’re 
prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or pro-
vide confirmation.
To use the system repair disc, follow these steps:
1.	
Insert the system repair disc into your CD or DVD drive.
2.	
Restart your computer using the computer’s power button.
3.	
If prompted, press any key to start the computer from the system repair disc. (You 
might need to change your computer’s BIOS settings to boot to the CD.)
4.	
Choose your language settings and then click Next.
5.	
Select a recovery option and then click Next.
Pre‐installation Environments
Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) is a minimal operating system with 
limited services, built on the Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 kernel. It is used 
to prepare a computer for Windows installation, to copy disk images from a network file 

536 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
server, and to initiate Windows Setup. It is also the environment in use when operating in 
the Windows Recovery Environment.
It can be used as a platform to repair issues with a system by booting to a disc with 
WinPE on it, somewhat like booting to a disc with DOS and system files on it. It includes 
much more functionality than a DOS boot disc but can be used in the same way to boot 
and access a drive with an operating system that will not boot.
MSCONFIG
The MSCONFIG utility helps you troubleshoot startup problems by allowing you to selec-
tively disable individual items that normally are executed at startup. There is no menu com-
mand for this utility, so in Windows 8, for example, you use Start ➢ Run, type msconfig, 
and press Enter. It works in most versions of Windows, although the interface window is 
slightly different among versions. Figure 8.5 shows an example in Windows Vista.
F i g u r e   8 . 5    MSCONFIG
DEFRAG
One of the biggest factors affecting hard drive performance over time is fragmentation. The 
more files are read, added to, and rewritten, the more fragmentation is likely to occur. The Disk 
Defragmenter utility (the defrag command) is the best tool for correcting fragmentation.
Disk Defragmenter reorganizes the file storage on a disk to reduce the number of files 
that are stored noncontiguously. This makes file retrieval faster because the read/write 
heads on the disk have to move less.
There are two versions of Disk Defragmenter: a command‐line version and a Windows version 
that runs from within Windows. To locate and use the Windows version, follow these steps:

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot PC Operating System Problems 
537
1.	
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Search (or if you’re using a mouse, point 
to the upper‐right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click 
Search), enter Defragment in the Search box, and then tap or click Defragment and 
optimize your drives.
2.	
Under Current Status, tap or click the drive you want to optimize, as shown in Figure 8.6.
3.	
To determine whether the drive needs to be optimized, tap or click Analyze. After Windows 
is finished, check the Current Status column to see whether you need to optimize the drive. If 
the drive is more than 10 percent fragmented, you should optimize the drive now.
4.	
Tap or click Optimize. Administrator permission is required.
F i g u r e   8 .6    Using Disk Defragmenter in Windows 8.1
If you are instead using the Windows 8.1 command‐line version (defrag.exe), the avail-
able switches include the following:
/a    Analyze only.
/c    Perform the operation on all drives.
/v    Verbose output.
REGSRV32
REGSRV32 (Microsoft Register Server) is a command‐line utility in Windows oper-
ating systems for registering and unregistering DLLs and ActiveX controls in the 
Registry.

538 
Chapter 8 ■ Software Troubleshooting
 Many DLL fi les must be registered with the system to run. If you replace a missing DLL, 
you may need to also need to register the fi le. An example of registering a DLL looks like this: 
 regsvr32 shmedia.dll 
 REGEDIT 
 Windows confi guration information is stored in a special confi guration database known 
as the  registry . This centralized database contains environmental settings for various 
Windows programs. 
 Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 have two applications 
that can be used to edit the registry: REGEDIT and REGEDT32 (note the spelling 
with no  i ). In Windows XP and Vista, REGEDT32 opens REGEDIT. They work simi-
larly, but each has slightly different options for navigation and browsing. In addition, 
REGEDT32 allows you to confi gure security‐related settings for Registry keys, such as 
assigning permissions. 
 
 Registry edits are immediate and generate no warning message like you 
might get when making a change in Control Panel. Proceed with care 
because a mistake could render the system useless. 
 Event Viewer 
 During startup, problems with devices that fail to be recognized properly, services that fail 
to start, and so on, are written to the system log and can be viewed with Event Viewer. 
This utility provides information about what’s been going on system‐wise to help you 
troubleshoot problems. Event Viewer shows warnings, error messages, and records of 
things happening successfully. You can access it through Computer Management, or you 
can access it directly from the Administrative Tools in Control Panel. 
 Safe Mode 
 To access safe mode, you must press F8 when the operating system menu is displayed dur-
ing the boot process. A menu of safe mode choices appears, and you can select the mode 
you want to boot into. This is the mode to boot into if you suspect driver problems and 
want to load with a minimal set while you diagnose the problem. 
 Command Prompt 
 You can fi nd a complete discussion of the command prompt in objective 1.3 in Chapter  5 . 
 Emergency Repair Disc 
 Emergency repair discs were discussed in the earlier section “Repair Discs.” 

4.1 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot PC Operating System Problems 
539
 Automated System Recovery 
 In Windows XP, the ERD has been replaced with Automated System Recovery (ASR), 
which is accessible through the Backup utility. It’s possible to automate the process of cre-
ating a system recovery set by choosing the ASR Wizard on the Tools menu of the Backup 
utility (Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Accessories ➢ System Tools ➢ Backup). This wizard walks 
you through the process of creating a disc that can be used to restore parts of the system in 
the event of a major system failure. 
 The default name of this fi le is  backup.bkf ; it requires a fl oppy disk. The backup set con-
tains all the fi les necessary for starting the system, whereas the fl oppy becomes a bootable 
pointer to that backup set and can access or decompress it. 
 
 A weakness of this tool is its reliance on a bootable floppy in a day when 
many new systems no longer include a 3.5‐inch drive. 
 Uninstall/Reinstall/Repair 
 In some cases, the easiest way to repair an issue is to completely reinstall the operating 
system. This is one the biggest reasons you should encourage users to store data on servers 
rather than the workstation. However, operating system vendors are beginning to offer 
some options that are less drastic than that. They have also made it easier to perform 
various recovery types with no media. 
 For example, in Windows 8 and 8.1, there are several options presented when you 
choose to repair the computer. They are Refresh, Reset, and Restore. The effects of using 
the three options are as follows: 
Refresh   This reinstalls Windows and keeps your personal fi les and settings. It also keeps 
the apps that came with your PC and the apps you installed from the Windows Store. 
Reset  This reinstalls Windows but deletes your fi les, settings, and apps—except for the 
apps that came with your PC. 
 Restore  This is a way to undo recent system changes you’ve made by returning the system 
confi guration to a previous point in time. It does not delete any fi les or applications, unless 
the application was installed after the restore point was taken. 
 To access these options, follow these steps: 
 1. 
 Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Settings, and then tap Change PC 
Settings. (If you’re using a mouse, point to the upper‐right corner of the screen, move 
the mouse pointer down, click Settings, and then click Change PC Settings.) 
 2. 
 Tap or click Update And Recovery and then tap or click Recovery. 
 3. 
 You will now see the three options shown in Figure  8.7 .

Common Symptoms
Crazy things start to happen when malware is introduced to a computer. This section dis-
cusses some of the strange behaviors of computers that are infected.
Pop‐Ups
Although relatively benign when compared with malware in general, pop‐ups are annoying 
to users. They also use system resources as they open and in some cases can introduce addi-
tional malware when they open.
Fortunately, most browsers now contain pop‐up blockers that can prevent unwanted 
pop‐ups. In some cases, users want pop‐ups to be allowed—in fact, some website functions 
fail when a pop‐up blocker is enabled. For that reason, users can use the Pop‐up Blocker 
Settings of Internet Explorer to allow pop‐ups for certain websites, as shown in Figure 8.8. 
Other browsers usually have a similar setting.

Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
Browser Redirection
A browser redirection is one of the most serious security problems. Browser hijacking soft-
ware is external code that changes your Internet Explorer settings. It may include changing 
your home page or adding or removing items from your favorites. Some sites will be added 
that point to dubious content. In most cases, the home page will revert to the unwanted 
destination even if you change it manually because the hijacker made Registry changes to 
your system. To prevent this from occurring, remember these tips:
■
■
Avoid suspect sites.
■
■
Use and update an antivirus program regularly.
■
■
Tighten your browser security settings.
Once you are a victim, you may have to apply antivirus software from an external 
source.
Security Alerts
Sometimes you can tell by security warnings that the site you are on is attempting to attack 
your computer. This is true if you have a personal firewall such as Windows Firewall. It can 
also occur when you have the phishing filter enabled in Internet Explorer. You will know 
when the system asks you whether you want to allow access to your machine from the site. 
Unless you initiated a download, don’t allow it.
Slow Performance
A reduction in performance is one of the classic signs of malware infection. When no other 
reason can be isolated for the slowing of a system, scanning for malware is always recom-
mended. All types of malware eat up significant system resources, starving the normal 
processes of the computer of the power they need.
Internet Connectivity Issues
Some malware will affect your Internet access. It may disallow you from accessing certain 
sites, or it may allow access to only a small number of sites. It has been reported that viral 
programs block access for certain programs and browsers while still allowing others to 
function. When access is denied, the following message is generated:
Unable to connect to HTTP Proxy. Your proxy may be misconfigured or
offline. -336
Moreover, this occurred even after the virus was supposedly cleaned from the system.
PC/OS Locks Up
It is quite common for the system to lock up when the malware is attacking. You may 
notice when this occurs that the hard drive is very busy, although nothing appears to be 

4.2 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common PC Security Issues 
543
going on. In some cases, you can use Task Manager to end the process that is locking 
everything up, and in other cases you simply must shut down the computer to break out of 
the lockup.
Application Crashes
Another possible symptom of a malware infection is the crashing of applications. While 
this will occur from time to time for other reasons, when it is occurring repeatedly, you 
should suspect malware. When the application that is crashing is your antivirus software, 
this is an even stronger indication of malware because disabling or damaging your antivirus 
protection is the first thing that some types of malware attempt to do.
OS Updates Failures
Malware may take certain measures to protect itself. One of these is to block you from 
accessing operating system update sites like Windows Update. You never notice this 
because these updates can be set to run automatically, so when they fail, it may not be 
obvious that they did.
Another action the malware can take along the same lines is to disable your antivirus 
software. For this reason, any time your antivirus program notifies you that it is not func-
tional or cannot update itself, you should consider this possibility and get it back up and 
running (if you can) as soon as possible.
Rogue Antivirus
If you receive messages (again usually at a suspect website) warning you that your system is 
infected, it will also usually offer to clean the system. At a minimum, they are trying to sell 
you anti‐malware software through the bogus warning.
Worse, though, is that executing the “cleaning” sometimes results in the introduction 
of malware to the system—which was the whole point of the message to begin with. In 
general, pay no attention to these messages and try to close them and exit the website that 
generated them as quickly as possible.
Spam
A sudden increase in spam may indicate that adware has been installed on the machine. 
This type of malware monitors your activities so that it can more accurately target spam 
email. This is not particularly dangerous, but you have to wonder—if that malware got on 
your system, what else might lurk on your computer?
Renamed System Files
Many viruses will rename system files and adopt the name of the system file. This can help 
the virus escape detection when scanning occurs since most virus definitions identify the 
virus by the name of the file that introduced the virus. This renaming of the system file can 
cause big problems when the file is required and the virus file is incapable of providing the 
required functionality.

544 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
Files Disappearing
Another symptom of a viral infection is the deletion of files in the system. Many viruses 
delete key files in your system to render it inoperable. This could be one of the ways it ren-
ders any existing antivirus programs inoperable. It also can be part of disabling Internet 
access either completely or selectively.
File Permission Changes
If the malware is a rootkit or Trojan horse, it can change permissions to key files. The per-
missions would then allow access to remote systems. This can help to enhance the function-
ality of backdoors, which allow the computer to be controlled remotely.
Hijacked Email
Viruses can also make changes to the email client that sends a copy of all emails to another 
system. Depending on the content of email, this can make the user open to identity theft 
and can also be used in corporate espionage. It is especially harmful if the account is an IT 
administrator passing key enterprise security details through email.
The following are examples of evidence of email highjacking:
■
■
Responses to email never sent by the user
■
■
Automated replies from unknown people
Access Denied
This can be a symptom of the file permission changes discussed in Chapter 7. It can also 
be a message you get when you try to access the Internet in general or try to access specific 
sites such as those used for security updates and antivirus definitions.
Invalid Certificate (Trusted Root CA)
When you are bombarded with certificate error messages at every website you visit, it’s 
another sign of malware. Some types of malware interface with the certificate authentica-
tion process.
Tools
Fortunately there are tools at your disposal to help you in the fight against malware of all 
types. This section discusses the major items in this toolbox.
Antivirus Software
The first line of defense against malware of all types is antivirus software kept up‐to‐date 
with the latest antivirus engine and definition files. Antivirus software is an application that 
is installed on a system to protect it and to scan for viruses as well as worms and Trojan 
horses. Most viruses have characteristics that are common to families of viruses. Antivirus 
software looks for these characteristics, or fingerprints, to identify and neutralize viruses 
before they impact you.

4.2 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common PC Security Issues 
545
More than 200,000 known viruses, worms, bombs, and other malware have been 
defined. New ones are added all the time. Your antivirus software manufacturer will usu-
ally work hard to keep the definition database files current. The definition database file 
contains all the known viruses and countermeasures for a particular antivirus software 
product. You probably won’t receive a virus that hasn’t been seen by one of these compa-
nies. If you keep the virus definition database files in your software up‐to‐date, you prob-
ably won’t be overly vulnerable to attacks.
Terminal utility
The terminal utility is the command prompt in any operating system we have discussed. 
Not only can this utility be used to do many things that could not be done using the GUI, 
it can be used to troubleshoot malware issues. In many cases you can locate malware files 
at the command prompt that cannot otherwise be located. You also can delete files that the 
antivirus can sometimes only quarantine.
Anti‐malware Software
Since all types of harmful software discussed in this section are classified as malware, 
anti‐malware software is any that identifies and protects your system from viruses, worms, 
Trojans, and spyware.
Recovery Console
The malware may not allow you to take steps such as deleting the programs while in the GUI. 
Oftentimes you can boot to the Recovery Console and delete the files you need to delete.
In many cases, you can identify the files in question by using Task Manager to view the 
processes that are running. However, identifying them and deleting them may be another 
matter. Using the Recovery Console, you may be able to do this once you know the names 
of the files or programs.
System Restore/Snapshot
The Recovery Console that existed in Windows 2000 and Windows XP has been removed 
from Vista and Windows 7. In its place is the System Recovery Options menu that appears 
on the installation disc. While renamed, it serves the same purpose of allowing you to trou-
bleshoot startup problems or restore your system.
To access this feature, restart your system using the installation disc. At the language 
settings, choose your language and click Next. In the following menu, choose Repair Your 
Computer. Choose which operating system you are having a problem with (if more than 
one is installed) and click Next. The System Recovery Options menu will open, and you 
can then choose any tool from the menu and run it. Table 8.1 describes the tools available 
on the System Recovery Options menu. The most useful ones for removing malware are the 
command prompt and Windows Complete PC Restore. When you use this tool to make a 
backup of the entire PC, you can then re‐create the entire computer without the virus.
The System Restore option allows you to take a snapshot of the system files and save 
that snapshot. Later, if the installation of an application or update causes a problem, you 
can return the computer system files to the state they were in prior to the installation.

Pre‐installation Environments
Pre‐installation environments such as Windows PE were discussed in the “Given a 
Scenario, Troubleshoot Operating System Problems with Appropriate Tools” section. Just 
as you can use Windows PE to access the hard drive when a system won’t boot, you can 
also use it to access and delete viral programs using the same identification and removal 
techniques discussed in that section.
Event Viewer
Many times a viral program is intelligent enough to prevent its activities from being recorded 
in Event Viewer, but it is still worth the effort to see whether there are events recorded that 
are related to its operation. You may be able to determine its name and what it’s doing. 
Information you glean here could be helpful in identifying and removing the malware.
Refresh/Restore
Earlier in this section you learned about a system restore. In Windows 8 and 8.1, there is another 
option called Refresh. This option allows you to reinstall the operating system without removing 
any of your data. It is a good option when the system has been installed for a long time and is run-
ning slowly. While it does not remove the data, it will remove all applications with the exception 
of those that came with the system and those you got from the Windows Store.
MSCONFIG/Safe Boot
MSCONFIG can be used to boot the computer into modes that can be helpful during 
troubleshooting. For example, booting the device with only basic services may allow 
you to determine that a particular service or application is causing the problem you 

4.2 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common PC Security Issues 
547
are experiencing. MSCONFIG was discussed in the section “1.4 Given a Scenario, Use 
Appropriate Microsoft Operating System Features and Tools” in Chapter 5.
Best Practices for Malware Removal
Over time best practices have been developed through trial and error that help minimize 
the chances of getting viruses and reduce the effort involved in getting rid of malware. 
Some of these practices are discussed in this section.
Identify Malware Symptoms
First identify the symptoms the malware is producing as clearly as you can. This can help 
identify the exact virus in some cases. In many scenarios, identifying the symptoms can 
help establish the severity of the infection, which is good to determine when IT resources 
are stretched thin and battles must be chosen.
Quarantine Infected System
The infected system should be quarantined—removed from the network to prevent a spread 
of the infection to other systems. This is why it is a good practice to keep data on servers so 
that when user systems need to be quarantined, a new machine can be quickly imaged for 
the user to reduce the impacts on productivity while the infected machine is cleaned.
Disable System Restore (in Windows)
System Restore is a useful tool in many cases, but when a virus infection occurs, it can be 
an ally of the virus. Virus scanners cannot clean infections from restore points, making 
reinfection possible. If a system restore is performed after running an antispyware utility, 
viral objects may reappear. Disable System Restore before attempting to clean a system. 
When you do this, you will delete all restore points in the system, including any that may 
have an infection.
Remediate Infected Systems
Once the infected system has been quarantined, you must take steps to clean it. This two‐
step process is discussed in this section.
Update Anti‐malware Software
Before scanning the system with antivirus software, update the software and the engine if 
necessary. Definition files can change daily, and the virus may be so new that it is not con-
tained in your current definitions file even if it is only a week old.
Scan and Removal Techniques (Safe Mode, Pre‐installation Environment)
Although you can run the scan and removal from the GUI, it is a best practice to do this either 
after booting to safe mode or from a pre‐installation environment like Windows PE. Viruses 
that evade detection in the GUI are not as easily able to do so in either of these environments.

548 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
Schedule Scans and Run Updates
The antivirus software can be scheduled to perform a scan of the system. You should 
set this up to occur when the system is not in use, like at night. The scanning pro-
cess will go faster then and will not affect users. Also, set the software to automati-
cally check for and install any updates to the definition files and to the engine when 
available.
Enable System Restore and Create Restore Point (in Windows)
Although it is recommended that you disable System Restore before cleaning an infec-
tion, it is a good idea to create a restore point after an infection is cleaned. This gives 
you a clean restore point going forward in case the system becomes infected again at 
some point.
Educate End User
In many cases, users are partly responsible for the virus infection. After an infection occurs 
is a great time to impress on users the principles of secure computing. They should be 
reminded that antivirus software and firewalls can go only so far in protecting them and 
that they should exercise safe browsing habits and refrain from opening any attachments in 
email from unknown sources, regardless of how tempting.
Exam Essentials
Identify the symptoms of malware infection.    Some of the symptoms are pop‐ups, browser 
redirection, security alerts, slow performance, Internet connectivity issues, lockups, 
Windows Update failures, spam, renamed and disappearing system files, file permission 
changes, hijacked email, and access denied messages.
List the tools available to prevent and address virus infections.    Among the tools used for 
prevention and removal are antivirus, anti‐malware, and antispyware software; Recovery 
Console; System Restore; pre‐installation environments; and Event Viewer.

4.3 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot 
Common Mobile OS and Application 
Issues with Appropriate Tools
Mobile devices have their own unique sets of issues that may not be encountered with desk-
top computers. In this section, I’ll discuss common issues and their solutions. The topics 
addressed in objective 4.3 include the following:
■
■
Common symptoms
■
■
Tools
Common Symptoms
Not all mobile device issues are unique to mobile devices. They suffer from many of the 
same issues as desktop machines. However, some problems are unique to mobile devices or 
at least more prone to occur with them, as you will learn in this section.
Dim Display
With respect to laptops, the backlight and inverter can cause dimming problems, but in 
most cases the screen has been dimmed inadvertently with the function keys. It is also pos-
sible that the switch on the laptop that tells the system the lid is closed may be held down 
by some obstruction. Check that as well.
On smartphones you should first check the brightness settings to ensure they have not 
been inadvertently changed. Many Android devices force you to choose between manual 
settings of brightness and auto‐brightness; you may have changed that to use manual 
settings. Apple’s iOS allows you to adjust brightness levels on an iPhone even when auto‐
brightness is turned on. To recalibrate the setting, turn auto‐brightness off in the Brightness 
& Wallpaper settings. Then go into an unlit room and drag the adjustment slider to make 
the screen as dim as possible.
Intermittent Wireless
Almost all mobile devices today include an internal wireless card. This is convenient, but 
it can be susceptible to interference (resulting in low signal strength) between the device 
and the access point or cell tower. Do what you can to reduce the number of items block-
ing the signal between the two devices, and you’ll increase the strength of the signal. It is 
also possible that the cable that connects the antenna to the laptop needs to be reseated. 
Smartphones can connect to a WLAN as well. These devices will suffer from blockage and  
interference issues the same as laptops.

550 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
No Wireless Connectivity
When there is no wireless connectivity, it is usually because of one of two things:
■
■
The wireless capability is disabled (enabling and disabling this function is usually done 
with a key combination or a function key) because this is easy to disable inadvertently. 
This can also be a hardware switch on the side, front, or back of the case.
■
■
The wireless antenna is bad or the cable needs to be reseated.
Try the following steps when troubleshooting no wireless connectivity:
1.	
Power cycle the AP or wireless router.
2.	
Power cycle the device.
3.	
On a laptop, check the hardware wireless button (if the laptop has one).
4.	
On a smartphone or tablet, check your wireless settings to ensure that Wi‐Fi is on. 
Also make sure that Airplane mode is off.
5.	
Disconnect and reconnect.
6.	
Verify that the wireless device is using the correct password.
No Bluetooth Connectivity
Bluetooth is also enabled and disabled with a key combination and can be disabled easily. 
The first thing to try is to reenable it. The second thing in a laptop to try is to reseat the 
antenna cable. If all else fails, try a new antenna. Like the WLAN NIC, this can also be a 
hardware switch on the side, front, or back of the case.
In smartphones and laptops, the problem also can occur after an upgrade or update of 
some sort. In these cases, it can be that the proper driver is missing from the upgrade or 
was somehow corrupted or overwritten during the upgrade process. Here are some addi-
tional things you might try on a smartphone:
1.	
Power cycle the device.
2.	
Remove the battery and put it back in.
3.	
Clear the Bluetooth cache. While each device is different, a common way to access this set-
ting and clear the cache on Android is to open the phone’s Settings, tap the More tab, tap 
Application Manager, select to view ALL, select Bluetooth Share, and tap Clear Cache.
4.	
Clear the Bluetooth data. While each device is different, a common way to access this 
setting and clear the data is to go to Settings, tap the More tab, tap Application  
Manager, select to view ALL, Bluetooth Share, and select Clear Data.
5.	
Reboot the device in safe mode.
6.	
Make sure the device to which you are pairing has no issues.
7.	
As a last resort, perform a hard reset (covered later in the section “Tools”).
Cannot Broadcast to External Monitor
It’s always possible that a hardware issue is causing an external monitor to not work when 
connected to a mobile device, but, again, in most cases the problem is an incomplete under-
standing of the key combination to use to send the output to the external monitor.

4.3 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common Mobile OS 
551
On some devices you need to use the Fn key in combination with the keys on the top 
row; on others you simply use the top‐row keys. Before spending too much time trouble-
shooting, consult the documentation and ensure you are using the correct procedure. In 
some models, this can also be controlled from the video control panel or from within 
PowerPoint or other presentation software.
Another issue with both smartphones and laptops is a mismatch in screen resolution 
between the source device and the destination. Finally, check the port used to connect the 
device and ensure that it is functional and enabled.
Touchscreen Nonresponsive
In some cases, a touchscreen is simply broken and must be replaced, or in some cases 
the device must be replaced. In other cases, the issue is much less serious. If the screen 
still has the protective cover that comes on it, remove it. It can interfere with the opera-
tion of the screen. Make sure the screen is clean by cleaning it with a soft microfiber 
cloth. Ensure the user hands are dry because wet hands will cause an issue. Check these 
items first.
Then, before assuming the worst, try the following to solve the issue with laptops:
1.	
Perform a full shutdown of the device.
2.	
If it is a device that uses Windows, perform a Windows update. For other systems, 
check for an update at the vendor website.
3.	
Ensure that the system is set to consider your screen a touchscreen (laptop). This is a 
setting in Windows. Search for tablet PC settings.
4.	
Some devices support a touchscreen diagnostic test. Perform the test.
5.	
If the problem occurs after returning from sleep mode, check to see whether the screen 
is set to be functional while in sleep mode in power settings.
With smartphones, consider the following as well:
1.	
Reset the device. If your device does not have this function, remove the battery, mem-
ory card, or SIM card; then reinstall them.
2.	
Delete any applications you recently installed. Some third‐party applications can cause 
your device to lock up or freeze.
3.	
Recalibrate the touchscreen. Look in the device’s Settings menu for a calibration 
option.
Apps Not Loading
When an app will not load on a mobile device, the first item to check is that the app is the 
right version for the device. Not all apps work on all devices. When an app has been work-
ing and now won’t open or load when you access it, try the following items:
■
■
Check to see whether there is an update for the app.
■
■
Force the app to quit. In Android, for example, in the multitask menu, swipe it away 
and then reopen it.

552 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
■
■
If the issue involves downloading the app, check to make sure you have enough space 
for the app.
■
■
If the app is resource intensive, ensure that your device has the resources to run the app.
Slow Performance
The first thing to suspect when performance slows is insufficient internal storage space. 
This begins to occur over time and will only get worse until the issue is solved by removing 
something to free up some space.
Another issue is apps that run all the time. Close these apps and clear the app cache. 
While you can do this manually, third‐party apps are available that can do this for you on a 
schedule. The following are some other items you may try:
■
■
If an update is available, update your firmware.
■
■
Reset the phone (back up the data first!).
Unable to Decrypt Email
While there are services that can encrypt your email messages for you, many users choose 
to do this themselves using third‐party tools. This allows more control but also requires 
an understanding of how it works and what the recipient needs to decrypt your email 
messages.
When a user receives an email that cannot be decrypted, check these items:
■
■
Ensure that the sender and the recipient are using the same encryption standard. If one 
user is using S/MIME and another PGP, there will be a problem.
■
■
Both users need to be in possession of the public key of the other user.
■
■
Both users will need to have imported their respective private keys to their devices.
Considering the level of understanding that most users have of the way encryption works 
and its requirements, it is not surprising that services that handle all the keys are gaining in 
popularity.
Extremely Short Battery Life
One of the biggest complaints users lodge against their mobile devices is short battery life. 
When a battery is nearing the end of its life cycle, it will begin to exhibit this behavior, so it 
could be you need a new battery. However, there are a number of other things you can do 
to mitigate the problem.
■
■
Change the location and brightness settings because these components really eat 
power.
■
■
Turn off Bluetooth and Wi‐Fi when not needed. These also take power.
■
■
Disable push notifications for nonessential apps.
■
■
Close apps not in use.
■
■
Prevent the device from overheating, which is bad for the battery.

4.3 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common Mobile OS 
553
Overheating
Mobile devices get hot from time to time. An inherent problem is a lack of ventilation. The 
following are some activities that will worsen this:
■
■
Excessive gaming
■
■
Continuous online browsing
■
■
Old battery
■
■
Using the device while charging the device
Some tactics that can help prevent overheating are as follows:
■
■
Disable any unwanted functions.
■
■
Turn it off when not in use.
■
■
Don’t leave the device in places like a hot car.
■
■
Clean the battery contacts.
Frozen System
Dealing with a frozen device takes a similar approach to dealing with a slow device. Try 
the following items:
■
■
Plug the phone into a charger and see whether it unlocks.
■
■
Delete any unused apps or photos.
■
■
Delete the data cache.
No Sound from Speakers
When a speaker on a mobile device is not functioning, in most cases it has simply been 
inadvertently turned off. After checking the settings described later in this section, you can 
assume that there is a hardware problem. In that case, with smartphones, it is typically 
advisable to send the device to the manufacturer, but with laptops, it is possible to replace 
the internal speakers.
To determine whether the settings are the issue, ensure that the speaker volume is up and 
the speaker is not disabled. On an Android, first test the loud speaker by following these 
steps:
1.	
Go to the Home screen and tap the Phone icon.
2.	
Type *#7353# into the dialer as though you are dialing a phone number. A list of 
options will appear.
3.	
Tap Speaker, and music should start to play. You can tap Speaker again to silence the 
music.
To test the internal speaker, follow the same steps, but in step 3, tap Melody.
Music should start to play from the earpiece on the phone and allow you to see whether 
the speaker that you hold up to your ear to talk with people is working properly as well.

554 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
On an iPhone, follow these steps:
1.	
Go to Settings ➢ Sounds and drag the Ringer and Alerts slider to turn the volume up.
2.	
If you can hear sound from the speaker, then the speaker works.
3.	
If the device has a Ring/Silent switch, make sure it’s set to ring. If you can see orange, 
it’s set to silent.
Inaccurate Touchscreen Response
In cases where the touchscreen is working but not responding correctly, the action you 
should take depends on the vendor. With Apple devices, try the following, and if there is no 
relief, contact Apple so the warranty is not voided:
1.	
If you have a case or screen protector on your device, try removing it.
2.	
Clean the screen with a soft, slightly damp, lint‐free cloth.
3.	
Unplug your device.
4.	
Restart your device. If you can’t restart, force your device to restart.
With Android devices, first restart the phone. If that doesn’t work, perform a factory 
reset using these steps:
1.	
Make a backup of personal data such as email and photos because the process will 
erase all your files.
2.	
Open the Applications tab and tap Settings.
3.	
Tap Privacy and then Factory Data Reset.
4.	
Tap Reset Phone.
On a laptop, this issue may be solved by recalibrating the screen. While systems vary, the 
steps using Windows 7 are as follows:
1.	
Click Start, Control Panel, and Hardware And Sound.
2.	
Under Tablet PC Settings, tap Calibrate The Screen For Pen Or Touch Input.
3.	
On the Display tab, under Display options, tap Calibrate and then Yes to allow the 
program to make changes.
4.	
Follow the onscreen instructions to calibrate your touchscreen.
System Lockout
When a user gets locked out of a device from typing too many incorrect passwords (or 
patterns) on Android phone, there are several things you can try before resetting the device 
(which will delete all the data). First try this:
1.	
Enter your email address in to the device.
2.	
In the password field, enter null.
3.	
If this works, you will then be prompted to enter a new pattern, and once again you 
have your phone back in action with all data intact.

4.3 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common Mobile OS 
555
If that fails, you will need to perform a factory reset, as described in the section 
“Inaccurate Touchscreen Response.”
On an iPhone, you can go to iForgot to unlock it with your existing password or reset 
your password. You can also click the Reset Password or Forgot Password button in the 
alert. Type your full email address when you’re asked to enter your Apple ID.
Tools
You can utilize a number of tools to solve these problems, many of them already referenced 
in the section covering the various issues. In this section, the options will be formally 
addressed.
Hard Reset
You can perform a hard reset to solve many but not all of the issues covered in the sec-
tion “Common Symptoms.” Each device will have a different way to perform this reset, 
but the key thing you need to know is that before you do this you should back up all 
data because it will be removed. This process returns the device to its factory defaults. 
On a laptop running Windows, this process is equivalent to resetting the operating 
system.
Soft Reset
A soft reset is a less drastic action you take with the mobile device. It is simply a matter of 
restarting the device. While the list of problems this action can solve is smaller than that 
for resetting, there were several problem listed in the section “Common Symptoms” that 
may react favorably to soft reset, and considering the consequences of using the hard reset, 
it is always advisable to try a soft reset first.
Close Running Applications
In some cases, mobile devices are running slowly simply because you are asking the 
device to do too many things at once. In this case, close some of the open applica-
tions on the device. In many cases, users may not even be aware that an app is run-
ning. Another issue that may respond to this approach is when the device is frozen. If 
the device is frozen because of a problem with an app, closing the app will break the 
lockup.
Reset to Factory Default
Resetting a mobile device to the factory defaults differs from a hard reset in one way. After 
a factor reset, you will be presented with the activation screen, and you will have to go 
through the activation process again. So, there is really nothing to be gained by using this 
process over a hard reset.

556 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
Adjust Configurations/Settings
As you found while reading the “Common Symptoms” section, in many cases all that needs 
to be done to a device is to adjust the settings. For specific setting changes that will solve 
specific issues, please refer to the section “Common Symptoms.”
Uninstall/Reinstall Apps
Some apps just don’t play well with a particular model or type of phone. In some cases, it is 
an issue with the application itself, and in others it is a compatibility issue you have discov-
ered. Moreover, the problem app may not just malfunction; it may cause the device to lock 
up. In these situations, you can try uninstalling it and reinstalling it, and the app may fix 
itself. If that doesn’t work, remove the app.
Force Stop
In some cases, when you stop an application on a mobile device, it does not stop com-
pletely. In other cases, it will not respond to attempting to stop it. If you go to the list of 
apps (Settings ➢ Applications ➢ Manage Applications ➢ Downloaded On ANDROID) on 
the device, the Force Stop setting is made available to you for each app that is running. 
Using this button provides you with an option to end a locked app.

Security Issues with Appropriate Tools
Mobile devices may use different operating systems than desktop systems, and their applica-
tions may be packaged a bit differently, but they still can suffer from security issues. It logically 
follows that they must be secured as well. In this final section of Chapter 8, I’ll talk about the

symptoms of security issues and describe some tools you can use in the struggle to protect 
these devices and their data. The following are the subobjectives covered in this section:

Common symptoms

■
Tools
Common Symptoms
Just as desktop systems do, mobile devices will exhibit certain symptoms when security 
issues manifest themselves. This section surveys some of the more common symptoms of a 
security issue with a device.
Signal Drop/Weak Signal
All mobile devices are going to experience some dropped calls and weak signals from time 
to time. However, a device that is fully charged and close to its cell tower or Wi‐Fi access 
point that suffers these symptoms on a regular basis is probably infected with malware. You 
should scan the device using a malware product designed specifically for mobile devices.
Power Drain
Another sign of a malware infection on a mobile device is rapid draining of the battery. 
This occurs because the malware is performing operations in the background. If the device 
is also suffering signal loss, this only increases this possibility. If the device is also rapidly 
eating all the data in your plan, it is almost certain the device has malware.
Slow Data Speeds
When malware is present and running in the background, it is using resources as well as 
running down your battery. That’s means when you are downloading or uploading data, 
the process is competing with the malware for resources. Therefore, slow data speeds may 
also be a sign of a malware infection.
Unintended Wi‐Fi Connection
Some models of mobile devices such as smartphones will automatically connect to any 
available open WLAN (an open WLAN is one that does not require authentication). In 
most cases, users will be aware of this because they may be presented with a browser screen 
requiring the user to accept terms of service. Not all networks do this, however, and if you 
have connected to a rogue access point managed by a malicious individual, you can be 
almost certain your connection will be so seamless you may not know you are connected.
The danger in this is that after the access point issues your device an IP address, you will find 
yourself residing in the same subnet as the malicious hacker, and the hacker can now launch a 
peer‐to‐peer attack on your device. To prevent this, set the mobile device to not automatically 
connect to any available wireless network. For example, on an iPhone, use these steps:
1.	
Launch the Settings app.
2.	
Tap Wi‐Fi.

558 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
3.	
Tap the blue arrow to the right of a network.
4.	
Switch the Auto‐Join tab to OFF.
Unintended Bluetooth Pairing
Unintended Bluetooth connections or pairings can also occur with mobile devices. This is 
also a security issue because several wireless attacks are made through a Bluetooth connec-
tion. Many users leave their Bluetooth settings in a state that makes connections to their 
peripheral devices easier to make. However, leaving them in a discoverable state makes it 
also easier for malicious individuals to create a Bluetooth pairing with your mobile device 
that makes wireless attacks through the Bluetooth connection possible.
In spite of the fact it adds a step to the process of pairing a new device to the mobile 
device, users should make their mobile devices undiscoverable as a default setting and 
enable this setting only when they need to create a new pairing with a trusted device. Many 
new devices unfortunately (for example, iPhone 6) don’t have a setting to turn off discov-
ery without disabling Bluetooth entirely. While the logic behind this is that the iPhone 
automatically prevents access to personal data through the Bluetooth connection, on any 
devices that make turning off discovery possible, it should be done.
Having said all this, if a device that is supposedly secured makes an unintended 
Bluetooth connection, this could be a clue that the device has been compromised through 
either malware or social engineering.
Leaked Personal Files/Data
Obviously, if personal files located on a mobile device suddenly are gone or suddenly are 
found to be leaked, it is also a clue that the device has been compromised through either 
malware or social engineering.
Data Transmission Overlimit
When certain types of malware begin to operate on a mobile device, they may transmit 
data from the device to the hacker, or vice versa. Since this uses your data plan without 
your knowledge, you may suddenly find yourself over your data limit. You may not find 
this out until you receive a data bill that exceeds your mortgage payment. In any cases such 
as this, the device should be immediately scanned for malware.
Unauthorized Account Access
Another sign that a mobile device has been compromised is when changes are made to your 
account that can be made only by the account holder, such as adding a feature or disabling 
a security function. In some cases, the carrier will notify you of changes of this nature, in 
case you weren’t the one to make the change.
Unauthorized Root Access
While mobile devices grant the owner control over all available settings on the device, they 
do not grant the owner total control over the device. Total control or root access allows the 

4.4 Given a Scenario, Troubleshoot Common Mobile OS 
559
user to customize the device far beyond what the user could normally do. This is why many 
advanced users “root” their device so that they can attain this level of access. Consequently, 
if changes begin to appear on the device that could be made by a user with only root per-
missions, it is a sign the device has been compromised.
Unauthorized Location Tracking
Location tracking allows the device to determine your location for the purpose of tailoring 
search results. Location tracking can be disabled on a mobile device. In most cases, dis-
abled location tracking is the default, and users will be asked by certain applications if they 
want to enable it. When a user has either never enabled this feature or has disabled this fea-
ture and it suddenly begins to track the location of the device, it is another indication that 
the device has been compromised.
Unauthorized Camera/Microphone Activation
Cameras and microphones can be either enabled or disabled on a mobile device. When a user 
either has never enabled these components or has disabled these components and the compo-
nents begin to function, it is another indication that the device has been compromised.
High Resource Utilization
In any case where the device appears to be utilizing CPU and memory at a rate that is not 
consistent with the activities of the user, it is a sign that malware is possibly at work on the 
device. Malware will utilize resources in the process of performing whatever functions it 
has been deigned to perform. When unexplained excessive resource usage is going on, it is 
another indication that the device has been compromised.
Tools
While the issues with mobile devices may seem innumerable, you do have tools to help you 
address them. In this section, I’ll talk about tools that can address the symptoms discussed 
in the section “Common Symptoms.”
Anti‐malware
As with any computing device, mobile devices should be protected with anti‐malware soft-
ware. All the major antivirus and anti‐malware vendors create versions of their product for 
smartphones and tablets. You should ensure that this is the case and that the devices are all 
updated with the latest malware and engine updates. This will be made simpler if the enter-
prise invests in a mobile device management solution that can scan the devices and ensure 
that all anti‐malware is up‐to‐date.
App Scanner
While apps are what bring functionality to a mobile device, some apps come with security 
flaws of which not only the user may be unaware but the developer of the app may be 

560 
Chapter 8  ■  Software Troubleshooting  
unaware. An app scanner is one that scans your apps for flaws and reports them. An example 
of an app scanner for Android is Appvigil, but there are scanners for Apple devices as well.
Factory Reset/Clean Install
Several of the issues discussed in the section “Common Symptoms” had as a possible solu-
tion performing a factory reset or a clean install. Both approaches are drastic in that they 
delete all the data and settings on the device but are sometimes unavoidable. You should 
understand the consequences before you use this approach.
Uninstall/Reinstall Apps
Just as with desktop and laptop systems, sometimes the only way to get an app to function 
correctly is to uninstall the app and reinstall it. When the app doesn’t respond to other 
solutions, this is a good approach to take.
Wi‐Fi Analyzer
Mobile devices operate almost exclusively as wireless devices. For this reason, network 
issues with mobile devices typically end up in many cases being wireless issues. A Wi‐Fi 
analyzer is a tool that can be used to scan and troubleshoot a WLAN. While these products 
can vary in the features they provide and (naturally) in cost, the following are among the 
functions that can be performed with these tools:
■
■
Determine current performance
■
■
Isolate and troubleshoot security issues
■
■
Identify rogue wireless devices
■
■
Determine sources of interference
Force Stop
A force stop can be used to terminate an application that is either locked up or simply won’t 
close. For more information, see “Force Stop” for objective 4.3 in this chapter.
Cell Tower Analyzer
While a wireless analyzer will tell you information such as the SSIDs of other WLANs in 
the area, the channel being used, and the signal strength, a cell tower analyzer gives you 
information such as the following:
■
■
Available towers from a location
■
■
Signal strengths
■
■
Tower to which you are currently connected
■
■
Tower owner information (Verizon, Sprint, and so on)
Backup/Restore
If you are ever faced with an issue for which the only solution is to reinstall the operating 
system or to reset the device to the factor defaults, all settings and data will be removed. 

Therefore, it makes good sense to back up the settings and data on the device in case you 
need to restore this information after a factory reset.
Some device vendors such as Google make this easy by offering to do it automatically for 
you on a schedule. In an enterprise, this is another function you may be able to automate 
using enterprise mobility management software (which is another reason to invest in this 
software). In this section, I’ll cover some solutions.
iTunes/iCloud/Apple Configurator
In the Apple ecosystem, several tools are available to hold your backed‐up data and set-
tings. iTunes can maintain all your music so that if you do a reset, the device will sync with 
iTunes and make your music available on the new or reset device.
iCloud provides its users with the means to store data such as documents, photos, and 
music on remote servers for download to iOS, Macintosh, or Windows devices. This is 
another option for storing your data and settings. An additional feature it provides is the 
ability to locate a lost phone. Currently Apple users get 5 GB of free storage and can pur-
chase additional storage.
The Apple Configurator is an app that can be used to mass‐configure iOS devices. It is an 
example of an enterprise mobility management solution that provides remote management to 
help set up and maintain standard configurations and software across a number of devices.
Google Sync
Google Sync allows you to synchronize mail, contacts, calendar, and more across multiple 
devices. It is available to anyone with a Google account and an Android or Chrome device.
One Drive
One Drive is a cloud‐based storage service by Microsoft that operates somewhat like 
iCloud. Users can store data in this cloud solution. This feature is also available as an app 
on Google Play and Apple iTunes.

 If you looked back over the history of the A+ certifi cation, you 
would be hard‐pressed to fi nd any domain or topics that have 
changed as much as this one. Much of what is here is common 
sense, but don’t dismiss the chapter based on that. Since these topics are worth 13 percent 
of the weighting, doing well on this portion of the exam can increase your chances of acing 
the 220‐902 exam. 
 5.1 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate 
Safety Procedures 
 This objective deals with potential hazards, both to you and to the computer system. It 
focuses on protecting humans from harm due to electricity and on protecting computer 
components from harm due to electrostatic discharge. The subobjectives included in this 
section are as follows: 
 
■
 Equipment grounding 
 
■
 Proper component handling and storage 
 
■
 Toxic waste handling 
 
■
 Personal safety 
 
■
 Compliance with local government regulations 
 Equipment Grounding 
 Electrostatic discharge is one of the most dangerous risks associated with working with com-
puters. Not only does ESD have the potential to damage components of the computer, but it can 
also injure you. Not understanding the proper way to avoid it could cause you great harm. 
 
 The ESD that we are speaking about here does not have the capability to 
kill you since it doesn’t have the amperage. What does represent a threat, 
though, is using a wrist strap of your own design that does not have the 
resistor protection built into it and then accidentally touching something 
with high voltage while wearing the wrist strap. Without the resistor in 
place, the high voltage would be grounded through you! 

568 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is the technical term for what happens whenever two 
objects of dissimilar charge come in contact—think of rubbing your feet on a carpet and 
then touching a light switch. The two objects exchange electrons in order to equalize the 
electrostatic charge between them. If the device receiving the charge happens to be an 
electronic component, there is a good chance it can be damaged.
The likelihood that a component will be damaged increases with the use of complementary 
metal‐oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chips because these chips contain a thin metal oxide layer 
that is hypersensitive to ESD. The previous generation’s transistor–transistor logic (TTL) chips 
are more robust than the CMOS chips because they don’t contain this metal‐oxide layer. Most 
of today’s integrated circuits (ICs) are CMOS chips, so ESD is more of a concern lately.
The lowest static voltage transfer that you can feel is around 3,000 volts (it doesn’t elec-
trocute you because there is extremely little current). A static transfer that you can see is 
at least 10,000 volts! Just by sitting in a chair, you can generate around 100 volts of static 
electricity. Walking around wearing synthetic materials can generate around 1,000 volts. 
You can easily generate around 20,000 volts simply by dragging your smooth‐soled shoes 
across a carpet in the winter. (Actually, it doesn’t have to be winter to run this danger; it 
can occur in any room with very low humidity. It’s just that heated rooms in wintertime 
generally have very low humidity.)
It would make sense that these thousands of volts would damage computer compo-
nents. However, a component can be damaged with as little as 80 volts. That means if 
your body has a small charge built up in it, you could damage a component without even 
realizing it.
Just as you can ground yourself by using a grounding strap, you can ground equipment. 
This is most often accomplished by using a mat or a connection directly to a ground.
Proper Component Handling and Storage
When handling computer components, such as motherboards, network cards, and such, 
it is easy to damage the delicate circuitry with the static electricity that builds up in your 
body in certain environments. In this section, we’ll talk about how you can protect these 
components and how you should store these components when not in use.
Antistatic Bags
When working with components and when storing them, it is a good idea to store them in 
antistatic bags. Although you can buy these bags, replacement parts usually come in anti-
static bags, and if you keep these bags, you can use them later. These bags also can serve as 
a safe place to lay a component temporarily when working on a device.
ESD Straps
There are measures you can implement to help contain the effects of ESD. The easiest one 
to implement is the antistatic wrist strap, also referred to as an ESD strap. You attach one 
end of the ESD strap to an earth ground (typically the ground pin on an extension cord) 
and wrap the other end around your wrist. This strap grounds your body and keeps it at a 
zero charge. Figure 9.1 shows the proper way to attach an antistatic strap.

ESD strap
Outlet
 If you do not have a grounded outlet available, you can achieve partial benefi t simply by 
attaching the strap to the metal frame of the PC case. Doing so keeps the charge equalized 
between your body and the case so that there is no electrostatic discharge when you touch 
components inside the case. 
 
 An ESD strap is a specially designed device to bleed electrical charges 
away  safely . It uses a 1 megaohm resistor to bleed the charge away slowly. 
A simple wire wrapped around your wrist will not work correctly and could 
electrocute you! 
 
 Do not wear the antistatic wrist strap when there is the potential to encounter 
a high‐voltage capacitor, such as when working on the inside of a monitor or 
power supply. The strap could channel that voltage through your body.  
 ESD Mats 
 It is possible to damage a device simply by laying it on a bench top. For this reason, you should 
have an  ESD mat (also known as an  antistatic mat ) in addition to an ESD strap. This mat drains 
excess charge away from any item coming in contact with it (see Figure  9.2 ). ESD mats are also 
sold as mouse/keyboard pads to prevent ESD charges from interfering with the operation of the 
computer.

570 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
You can also purchase ESD floor mats for technicians to stand on while performing 
computer maintenance. These include a grounding cord, usually 6 to 10 feet in length.
Vendors have methods of protecting components in transit from manufacture to instal-
lation. They press the pins of ICs into antistatic foam to keep all the pins at the same 
potential, and circuit boards are shipped in antistatic bags, discussed later. However, keep 
in mind that unlike antistatic mats, antistatic bags do not drain the charges away—they 
should never be used in place of antistatic mats.
Self‐grounding
Grounding is the electrical term for providing a path for an electrical charge to follow to 
return to earth. This term was mentioned earlier as it relates to ESD straps and mats, but it 
is the element of those that saves you from harm in the event of an electrical discharge—the 
charge passes to ground. The easiest way to ground yourself is to use a grounding strap.
Toxic Waste Handling
Many of the components that are in a computer should not be simply thrown in the trash 
because they contain toxic materials. In this section, you’ll learn about proper handling and 
disposal of these components and materials.
Batteries
Batteries can contain a number of compounds and materials that should not make their 
way into landfills. The following are some examples:
■
■
Rare earth metals
■
■
Lead
■
■
Cadmium
■
■
Lithium
■
■
Alkaline manganese
■
■
Mercury
You should make battery recycling a standard procedure and follow local regulations for 
battery disposal when the time comes to dispose of the batteries.
Toner
Toner cartridges are another item that should not be thrown away. They should be recycled. 
Moreover, in any case where toner has been spilled you should clean up with a special vacuum 
made for that purpose. If you use a regular vacuum, the metal toner will damage the vacuum.
CRT
While most CRT monitors have been disposed of already, you may find yourself with a 
number of them that you need to get rid of. These cannot be thrown in the trash. The con-
tents of the device are under pressure, and if something breaks the glass screen, there will 
glass and other materials sprayed out with a force that could injure someone.

5.1 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Safety Procedures 
571  
The monitor uses a lot of power as it directs electrons on the screen via a strong magnet. 
The electrons and magnet require a considerable amount of voltage to be able to do their 
task. Like power supplies, monitors have the ability to hold their charge a long time after 
the power has been disconnected.
You should never open a power supply or a monitor for the reasons discussed here. The 
risk of electrocution with these two devices is significant.
If you question the presence of electricity, or the voltage of it, use a voltmeter. Figure 9.3 
shows a simple voltmeter capable of working with both AC and DC currents.
F i g u r e   9. 3     A simple voltmeter
Many states have laws that govern the disposal of monitors since they are often clas-
sified as hazardous. CRT monitors contain high amounts of lead and other harmful 
materials such as arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, and zinc. 
To dispose of a monitor, contact a computer recycling firm and let them get rid of the 
monitor for you. CRT monitors must be disposed of according to the environmental 
regulations.
Personal Safety
There is nothing on a computer, a server, a router, and so on, that cannot be replaced or 
repaired. The same, however, is not true for you. It is imperative that you protect yourself 
from harm and follow safety procedures when working with computers.

572 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
Disconnect Power Before Repairing PC
You should never attempt to remove a case, open a case, or work on any element that is 
carrying electricity without first disconnecting it. If removing power on the device you are 
working on is more complicated than just unplugging it (requiring circuit breakers to be 
thrown, fuses to be removed, and so forth), then use a voltmeter to make sure the current is 
off at the device before proceeding.
Remove Jewelry
Gold and other metals are great conductors of electrical current. The last thing you want 
while working on a problem is for the gold chain around your neck to fall against a capaci-
tor. Take it off. While not all jewelry is metallic, all jewelry is a snagging hazard.
Lifting Techniques
An easy way to get hurt is by moving equipment in an unsafe or improper way. Here are 
some safe lifting techniques to always keep in mind:
■
■
Lift with your legs, not your back. When you have to pick something up, bend at the 
knees, not at the waist. You want to maintain the natural curve of the back and spine 
when lifting.
■
■
Be careful to not twist when lifting. Keep the weight on your centerline.
■
■
Keep objects as close to your body as possible and at waist level.
■
■
Where possible, push instead of pull.
The goal in lifting should be to reduce the strain on lower back muscles as much as pos-
sible since muscles in the lower back aren’t nearly as strong as those in the legs or other 
parts of the body. Some people use a back belt or brace to help maintain the proper posi-
tion while lifting.
Weight Limitations
Closely related to lifting and moving equipment is the topic of weight limitations. If you 
believe the load is too much for you to carry, don’t try to pick it up. Get help!
When possible, use a cart and always be aware of the environment. While you may be 
able to carry 80 pounds on a level surface without trouble, that number will lessen if there 
are stairs, uneven floors, or narrow doorways. Map out the path you are going to take 
before you begin lifting and moving items.
Electrical Fire Safety
Repairing a computer is not often the cause of an electrical fire. However, you should know 
how to extinguish such a fire properly. Three major classes of fire extinguishers are avail-
able, one for each type of flammable substance: A for wood and paper fires, B for flam-
mable liquids, and C for electrical fires. The most popular type of fire extinguisher today 
is the multipurpose, or ABC‐rated, extinguisher. It contains a dry chemical powder that 
smothers the fire and cools it at the same time. For electrical fires (which may be related to 

5.1 Given a Scenario, Use Appropriate Safety Procedures 
573  
a shorted‐out wire in a power supply), make sure the fire extinguisher will work for class C 
fires. If you don’t have an extinguisher that is specifically rated for electrical fires (type C), 
you can use an ABC‐rated extinguisher.
Cable Management
It can be time‐consuming to tie up cables, run them in channels, and snake them through 
walls, but it is time well spent when it keeps one person from harm. It is all too easy to get 
tangled in a cable or trip over one that is run across the floor. Exposed cables should be 
routed properly and covered using cable‐throughs and pass‐throughs to reduce the likeli-
hood of tripping as well as damage to the cables themselves.
Take the extra time to manage cables, and it will increase your safety as well as that of 
others who work in that environment.
Safety Goggles
In any environment where you may get dust or harmful materials in your eyes, you should 
wear safety goggles. For example, when working in a dusty shop area where a computer 
is located, this might be advisable. Another example might be when you are cleaning up 
printer toner.
There are also safety glasses that can be used when spending long hours staring at a 
computer screen that will reduce the eye strain that comes with this type of activity.
Air Filter Mask
While safety goggles will protect your eyes from dust and other harmful particulates, they 
will do nothing to protect your lungs. Air filter masks should always be available, and tech-
nicians should be encouraged to wear them in any situation where safety goggles are called 
for or in any scenario where you have reason to believe that the surrounding air may con-
tain harmful compounds.
Compliance with Local Government Regulations
It is your responsibility, as an administrator and a professional, to know (or learn) the 
regulations that exist for dealing with safety. You should know them from the local level 
to the federal level and be familiar with the reporting procedures for incidents you are 
faced with.
If employees are injured, for example, you may need to contact the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). On their website (www.osha.gov), you 
can find links to information on issues of compliance, laws and regulation, and 
enforcement.
When it comes to disposal, you can find a list of state laws here:
www.electronicsrecycling.org/public/ContentPage.aspx?pageid=14
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers basic information here:

Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
Exam Essentials
Understand ESD.    Electrostatic discharge occurs when two objects of unequal electrical 
potential meet. One object transfers some charge to the other one, just as water flows into 
an area that has a lower water level.
Understand the antistatic wrist strap.    The antistatic wrist strap is also referred to as an ESD 
strap. To use the ESD strap, you attach one end to an earth ground (typically the ground pin on 
an extension cord) and wrap the other end around your wrist. This strap grounds your body 
and keeps it at a zero charge, preventing discharges from damaging the components of a PC.
Know the fire extinguisher types.    Class C is the type of fire extinguisher needed for elec-
trical fires.
Know that you may need to report incidents.    When incidents happen, you must always doc-
ument them, and every attempt should be made to do so both fully and truthfully. Depending 
upon the type of incident, you may also need to report it to other authorities, such as OSHA.
5.2 Given a Scenario with Potential 
Environmental Impacts, Apply the 
Appropriate Controls
Environmental harms can come from many sources. Not only are temperature and humid-
ity elements that must be controlled, but administrators need to also carefully monitor 
power, air, and particulates that can harm humans and computers. Not understand-
ing environmental impact and controls can cause great harm. The following are the 
subobjectives covered in this section:
■
■
MSDS documentation for handling and disposal
■
■
Temperature, humidity-level awareness, and proper ventilation
■
■
Power surges, brownouts, blackouts
■
■
Protection from airborne particles
■
■
Dust and debris
■
■
Compliance to local government regulations
MSDS Documentation for Handling and Disposal
It is important that you know the potential safety hazards that exist when working with 
computer elements and how to address them. It is imperative that you understand such 
issues as material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and know how to reference them when 

5.2 Given a Scenario with Potential Environmental Impacts 
575
needed. Any type of chemical, equipment, or supply that has the potential to harm the 
environment or people has to have an MSDS associated with it. These are traditionally 
created by the manufacturer, and you can obtain them from the manufacturer or from the 
Environmental Protection Agency at www.epa.gov.
These sheets are not intended for consumer use but are aimed at emergency workers 
and employees who are exposed to the risks of the particular product. Among the informa-
tion they include are such things as boiling point, melting point, flash point, and potential 
health risks. They also cover storage and disposal recommendations and the procedures to 
follow in the case of a spill or leak.
Temperature, Humidity-Level Awareness, 
and Proper Ventilation
Three items closely related to an environmentally friendly computing environment are tem-
perature, humidity, and ventilation. We will cover the most important elements with all three.
Temperature    Heat and computers don’t mix well. Many computer systems require both 
temperature and humidity control for reliable service. The larger servers, communications 
equipment, and drive arrays generate considerable amounts of heat; this is especially true of 
mainframe and older minicomputers. An environmental system for this type of equipment 
is a significant expense beyond the actual computer system costs. Fortunately, newer sys-
tems operate in a wider temperature range. Most new systems are designed to operate in an 
office environment.
If the computer systems you’re responsible for require special environmental considerations, 
you’ll need to establish cooling and humidity control. Ideally, systems are located in the middle 
of the building, and they’re ducted separately from the rest of the heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning (HVAC) system. It’s a common practice for modern buildings to use a zone‐based 
air conditioning environment, which allows the environmental plant to be turned off when the 
building isn’t occupied. A computer room will typically require full‐time environmental control.
Humidity Level    Another preventive measure you can take is to maintain the relative 
humidity at around 50 percent. Be careful not to increase the humidity too far—to the 
point where moisture starts to condense on the equipment! It is a balancing act keeping 
humidity at the right level since low humidity causes ESD and high humidity causes mois-
ture condensation. Both extremes are bad but have completely different effects.
Also, use antistatic spray, which is available commercially, to reduce static buildup on 
clothing and carpets. In a pinch, a solution of diluted fabric softener sprayed on these items 
will do the same thing.
At the least, you can be mindful of the dangers of ESD and take steps to reduce its 
effects. Beyond that, you should educate yourself about those effects so you know when 
ESD is becoming a major problem.
Ventilation    Rounding out temperature and humidity is ventilation. It is important that 
air—clean air—circulate around computer equipment to keep it cool and functioning 

576 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
properly. Server rooms require much more attention to ventilation than office spaces but are 
the subject of other exams (Server+, for example) and not test fodder for A+.
What is test fodder is the topic of ventilation within the computer itself—an inadequate flow 
of internal air within a computer is a common cause of overheating. To prevent this, know that 
all slot covers should remain in place and be replaced if a card is removed from the system. 
Know as well that internal fans should be periodically cleaned to ensure proper air flow. A 
missing slot cover or malfunctioning fan can lead to that inadequate flow of internal air.
Power Surges, Brownouts, Blackouts
A number of power‐related threats can harm computers. Among them are the 
following:
Blackout    This is a complete failure of the power supplied.
Brownout    This is a drop in voltage lasting more than a few minutes.
Sag    This is a short‐term voltage drop.
Spike    The opposite of a sag, this is a short (typically under 1 second) increase in voltage 
that can do irreparable damage to equipment.
Surge    This is a long spike (sometimes lasting many seconds). Though a surge is typically a 
less intense increase in power, it can also damage equipment.
The two solutions to know for the power issues on the exam are battery backups and 
surge suppressors.
Battery Backup
A battery backup, or uninterruptible power supply (UPS), keeps the system up and running 
when the normal power is removed (because of blackout, brownout, and so on). Even in 
installations that use generators to keep the systems running, battery backups are usually 
still used so they can keep the machines running while the generators come up to speed.
Most UPS units come with software that can be used to configure the actions to take 
when the battery backup is active. The software, for example, can be configured to shut the 
connected devices down when the battery begins to get low.
Surge Suppressor
A surge suppressor keeps a spike from passing through it and onto the equipment that 
could be damaged. Tripping occurs when the breaker on a device such as a power supply, 
surge protector, or UPS turns off the device because it received a spike. If the device is a 
UPS, when the tripping happens, the components plugged in to the UPS should go to bat-
tery instead of pulling power through the line. Under most circumstances, the breaker is 
reset, and operations continue as normal. Figure 9.4 shows a surge‐protector power strip, 
with the trip button to reset at the top.

5.2 Given a Scenario with Potential Environmental Impacts

F i g u r e   9. 4    The reset button on the top of a surge‐protector power strip
Nuisance tripping is the phrase used if tripping occurs often and isn’t a result of a seri-
ous condition. If this continues, you should isolate the cause and correct it, even if it means 
replacing the device that continues to trip.
Surge suppressors (also known as surge protectors), either stand‐alone or built into the 
UPS, can help reduce the number of nuisance trips. If your UPS doesn’t have a surge protec-
tor, you should add one to the outlet before the UPS in order to keep the UPS from being 
damaged if it receives a strong surge. Figure 9.5 shows an example of a simple surge protec-
tor for a home computer.
F i g u r e   9. 5     A simple surge protector

578 
Chapter 9 ■ Operational Procedures
 All units are rated by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) for performance. One thing you 
should never do is plug a UPS or computer equipment into a ground fault circuit interrupter 
(GFCI) receptacle. These receptacles are intended for use in wet areas, and they trip very 
easily. 
 
 Don’t confuse a GFCI receptacle with an isolated ground receptacle. Iso-
lated ground receptacles are identifiable by orange outlets and should be 
used for computer equipment to avoid their picking up a surge passed to 
the ground by any other device. 
 Protection from Airborne Particles 
 Computers don’t do well with airborne particles. To protect them from such, you can use 
enclosures for your sensitive equipment and  air fi lters to condition the air. 
 Enclosures 
 Enclosures can be considered the fi rst line of defense against particulates. Enclosures 
are available that can fi lter the air, keep air out, and so on. Make certain that the enclo-
sure you turn to for a solution still offers the necessary ventilation needed to prevent 
overheating.  
 Air Filters 
 Most enclosures incorporate an air fi lter to clean the air before allowing it to enter. An 
analogy to think of is the air fi lter on a car, which keeps dirt, dust, bugs, and other things 
from the intake. When working with air fi lters, make certain they are kept clean and are 
changed per the manufacturer’s requirements. 
 Dust and Debris 
 One of the most harmful atmospheric hazards to a computer is dust. Dust, dirt, hair, 
and other airborne contaminants can get pulled into computers and build up inside. 
Because computer fans work by pulling air through the computer (usually sucking it 
in through the case and then pushing it out the power supply), it’s easy for these items 
to enter and then become stuck. Every item in the computer builds up heat, and these 
particles are no exception. As they build up, they hinder the fan’s ability to perform its 
function, and the components get hotter than they would otherwise. Figure  9.6 shows 
the inside of a system in use for only six months in an area with carpeting and other 
dusty surroundings. 

5.2 Given a Scenario with Potential Environmental Impacts 
579
 F I g u r E   9.6   Dust builds up inside the system 
 Compressed Air 
 You can remove dust and debris from inside computers with  compressed air blown in short 
bursts. The short bursts are useful in preventing the dust from fl ying too far out and enter-
ing another machine, as well as in preventing the can from releasing the air in liquid form. 
Compressed air cans should be held 2–3 inches from the system and always used upright 
so the content is released as a gas. If the can becomes cold to the touch, discontinue using it 
until it heats back to room temperature. 
 
 It’s possible to use an air compressor instead of compressed‐air cans when 
you need a lot of air. If you take this approach, make sure you keep the 
pounds per square inch (PSI) at or below 40, and include measures on the 
air compressor to remove moisture. 
 Vacuums 
 Dust can build up not just within the computer but also in crevices on the outside. 
Figure  9.7 shows USB ports on the back of a system that have become a haven for small 

580 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
dust particles. These ports need to be blown out with compressed air, or cleaned with an 
electronic vacuum, before being used, or degradation with the device connected to them 
could occur.
F i g u r e   9.7     Dust collects in unused ports as well
Compliance to Local Government Regulations
As careful as you try to be, there is always the possibility for accidents to occur. Accidents 
can be environment‐related (for example, a flash flood no one could predict suddenly over-
takes the server room and shorts out the wiring) or caused by humans (someone mixes the 
wrong cleaning chemicals together to try to make their own concoction). Regardless of the 
cause or circumstances, one thing is written in stone: you must fully and truthfully docu-
ment the problem.
That documentation must be seen by internal parties (managers, human resources, 
and so on), and it may also need to be seen by external parties. The latter depends on the 
type of industry you are in and the type of incident that occurred. For example, if a large 
amount of battery acid is spilled on the ground, you should contact the Environmental 
Protection Agency (see reporting procedures at www.epa.gov).
Exam Essentials
Know what an MSDS is.    An MSDS is a material safety data sheet containing instructions 
for handling an item. It can be acquired from the manufacturer or from the EPA.
Know that you may need to report incidents.    When incidents happen, you must always 
document them, and every attempt should be made to do so both fully and truthfully. 
Depending on the type of incident, you may also need to report it to other authorities, such 
as the EPA.
Know what components are not suitable for a landfill.    Batteries, CRTs, and circuit 
boards are all examples of items that should not be thrown away normally because of the 
elements used in them. Batteries contain metals such as lead and nickel, circuit boards con-
tain lead solder, and CRTs contain phosphors.

5.3 Summarize the Process of Addressing Prohibited Content/Activity 
581
Know the safety procedures to follow when working with computers.    Be careful when 
moving computers or working around any electrical components. Know that liquids and 
computers don’t mix, and keep the systems as clean and dust‐free as possible to ensure opti-
mal operation.
5.3 Summarize the Process of 
Addressing Prohibited Content/Activity 
and Explain Privacy, Licensing, and 
Policy Concepts
Working in the IT profession, it is entirely plausible that you will encounter a situation 
where you find proof of a user, or a number of users, engaging in activities that are prohib-
ited. Those activities can include any number of things, and the prohibition may range from 
a company policy (you cannot use social media during working hours) all the way up to a 
federal law (you cannot traffic in child pornography). You have an obligation to respond 
appropriately and accordingly.
Regardless of whether you agree with a prohibition, when you encounter instances 
wherein activities are in violation of it, you must respond in a professional and legal man-
ner. The following are the subobjectives covered in this section:
■
■
Incident response
■
■
Licensing/DRM/EULA
■
■
Personally identifiable information
■
■
Follow corporate end‐user policies and security best practices
Incident Response
The extent to which a security event causes harm to your network largely depends on 
the speed and quality of your response to the incident. By following a structured inci-
dent response policy, the chances of minimizing the damage and the likelihood that you 
will be able to bring parties to justice in the case of illegal activity are greatly enhanced. 
The following sections cover some important guidelines regarding the incident response 
process.
First Response
There are three crucial components to the first response: identifying the problem, reporting 
it through the proper channels, and preserving the data.

582 
Chapter 9 ■ Operational Procedures
 Identify 
 A part of identifying the problem involves identifying what policy or law prohibits such an 
action. Prohibited content generally falls within the following categories (this list should 
not be considered to represent everything prohibited because many companies have other 
policies): 
 
■
 Exploiting people (in any way, such as sexually, violently, and so on) 
 
■
 Promoting harassment of any person or group 
 
■
 Containing or promoting anything illegal or unauthorized 
 
■
 Promoting racism, hatred, bigotry, or physical harm 
 
■
 Containing adult content involving nudity or sexual acts 
 
■
 Violating privacy rights, copyrights, contract rights, or defamation rights 
 
■
 Viruses or malware of any sort 
 
■
 Impersonation 
 
■
 Soliciting information from anyone younger than 18 
 
■
 Involving pyramid schemes, junk mail, chain letters, spamming, or the like 
 Report Through Proper Channels 
 Once you have identifi ed prohibited content or activity, you must report it through the 
proper channels. If the violation is one only of company policy, then usually the company’s 
human resources department is the proper channel. If the violation is of a law, then often 
you must contact legal authorities—notifying the appropriate internal resources as well. 
If the violation is of a federal law and you tell only an internal resource (HR manager, for 
example), it does not absolve you of the responsibility if that person does not continue to 
report it up the appropriate chain. 
 
 Law enforcement personnel are governed by the rules of evidence, and 
their response to an incident will be largely out of your control. You need 
to carefully consider involving law enforcement before you begin. There is 
no such thing as dropping charges. Once they begin, law enforcement pro-
fessionals are required to pursue an investigation. 
 Data/Device Preservation 
You have as well an obligation to preserve the content found until it is turned over to the 
appropriate authority. Doing so may require commandeering anything from a fl ash drive up 
to a network server. Until someone in a position of authority relieves you of the responsibil-
ity, you must preserve the data or device in the state in which you discovered it. If you are 
ever unsure of how to proceed, you should immediately contact your supervisor. 
 Because knowing what to do when something is discovered is something that may not 
come naturally, it is a good idea to include the procedures you’ll generally follow in an 

5.3 Summarize the Process of Addressing Prohibited Content/Activity 
583
incident response plan (IRP) . The IRP outlines what steps are needed and who is respon-
sible for deciding how to handle a situation. 
 
 Your policies should clearly outline who needs to be informed in the 
company, what they need to be told, and how to respond to the situation. 
 Use of Documentation/Documentation Changes 
 During the entire process, you should document the steps you take to identify, detect, and 
report the problem. This information is valuable and will often be used should the problem 
escalate to a court of law. Many help‐desk software systems provide detailed methods you 
can use to record procedures and steps. 
 Chain of Custody (Tracking of Evidence/Documenting Process) 
 An important concept to keep in mind when working with incidents is the  chain of custody . 
 When you begin to collect evidence, you must keep track of that evidence at all times 
and show who has it, who has seen it, and where it has been. The evidence must always be 
within your custody, or you’re open to dispute about whether it has been tampered with. 
 Licensing/DRM/EULA 
 While many in the IT community would like to think that software, music fi les, and movie 
fi les should be free, that is not the case. Using any of these items without paying for them 
is  illegal . Operating systems, application software, and many third‐party utilities require a 
license to legally use the software. It also requires that you accept an end‐user license agree-
ment (EULA) whereby you agree to use the software as described in that agreement. 
 Music and movie fi les, on the other hand, are protected by digital rights management 
(DRM). This is a system that maintains control over these fi les and ensures that they are 
installed only on devices that belong to the person who purchased the fi le with the end goal 
being to prevent users from sharing and giving these away without paying for them. 
 Not all software required a license. In the next sections, we’ll talk about software that 
doesn’t require a license and also discuss the differences between personal and enterprise 
licenses. 
 Open Source vs. Commercial License 
 Open source software is software that is free and available to all. Commercial software, on 
the other hand, requires the purchase of a license to legally use the software. While there 
is the obvious monetary advantage to using open source software, the organization or user 
must typically have a deeper understanding of the software than may be required to use 
commercial software successfully. Another advantage of commercial software is the ongo-
ing support the vendor can provide in using the software, while a user of open source soft-
ware is pretty much on their own when issues arise. 

584 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
Personal License vs. Enterprise Licenses
While an individual software license entitles a single user to install and use a piece of com-
mercial software, an enterprise license purchase is based on a number of seats or devices on 
which the software can be legally installed. Also, while each individual license will come 
with installation media, the purchase of an enterprise license comes with a single version 
of the installation media, which can be installed on the number of devices specified in the 
license agreement.
Personally Identifiable Information
Personally identifiable information (PII) is any piece of information about a user that 
can be used alone or in combination with other pieces of information to identify an indi-
vidual user. While it is the responsibility of all organizations to protect PII that they may 
possess, it is especially important in certain regulated industries such as healthcare and 
finance.
The danger of leaking PII is that much of this information, such as address, Social 
Security number, and place of employment can be used to perform identity theft, a growing 
concern worldwide.
Follow Corporate End‐User Policies and Security  
Best Practices
Every organization should have a security policy that drives all security‐related activities 
and clearly spells out how sensitive data is handled and what specific operations the users 
are allowed to perform. The acceptable use policy is a document that each user should sign 
when hired that serves as a contract between the user and the company in detail. Moreover, 
this document, as well as the security guidelines that network technicians must follow, 
should be driven by well‐established best practices. The following are some of the guide-
lines that should be included:
■
■
Password policy
■
■
Acceptable use policy
■
■
Access control policy
■
■
Remote access policy
As an A+ technician, part of your job is to educate users about the importance of these 
security policies and to monitor the environments for any violations of the policies.
Exam Essentials
Report prohibited content and activities.    You have an obligation to report prohibited 
activities and content to the appropriate authorities when you uncover them. You must 
ascertain which authority is prohibiting the actions and notify them.

5.4 Demonstrate Proper Communication Techniques and Professionalism 
585  
Document and preserve the evidence.    It is imperative that the evidence be documented 
and preserved until turned over to the appropriate authority. In some cases, this can include 
commandeering a removable drive, a computer, or even a server. Failure to do so can leave 
you facing fines and other punishments.
5.4 Demonstrate Proper Communication 
Techniques and Professionalism
It’s possible that you chose computers as your vocation instead of public speaking because 
you want to interact with people on a one‐on‐one basis. As unlikely as that possibility may 
be, it still exists.
Some have marveled at the fact that CompTIA includes questions about customer ser-
vice on the A+ exam. A better wonder, however, is that there are those in the business 
who need to know these items and don’t. Possessing a great deal of technology skill does 
not immediately endow one with great people skills. A bit more on appropriate behavior 
as it relates to the IT field follows. The following are the subobjectives covered in this 
section:
■
■
Use proper language (avoid jargon, acronyms, and slang when applicable).
■
■
Maintain a positive attitude/project confidence.
■
■
Actively listen (taking notes) and avoid interrupting the customer.
■
■
Be culturally sensitive.
■
■
Be on time (if late, contact the customer).
■
■
Avoid distractions.
■
■
Deal with difficult customers or situations.
■
■
Set and meet expectations/timelines and communicate status with the customer.
■
■
Deal appropriately with customers’ confidential and private materials.
Use Proper Language: Avoid Jargon, Acronyms, 
Slang When Applicable
Avoid using jargon, abbreviations, slang, and acronyms. Every field has its own lan-
guage that can make those from outside the field feel lost. Put yourself in the position 
of someone not in the field, and explain what is going on using words they can  
relate to.
Be honest and fair with the customer, and try to establish a personal rapport. Tell them 
what the problem is, what you believe is the cause, and what can be done in the future to 
prevent it from recurring.

586 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
Alert your supervisor if there is a communication barrier with the customer (for exam-
ple, the customer is deaf or does not speak the same language as you do). This is particu-
larly important if the barrier will affect the problem resolution or the amount of time it will 
take.
If you’re providing phone support, do the following:
■
■
Always answer the telephone in a professional manner, announcing the name of the 
company and yourself.
■
■
Make a concentrated effort to ascertain the customer’s technical level, and communi-
cate at that level, not above or below it.
Maintain a Positive Attitude/Project Confidence
Maintain a positive attitude. Your approach to the problem, and the customer, can be mir-
rored back. Moreover, project confidence in dealing with the issue because that engenders 
more cooperation and patience from the customer, both of which have a direct impact on 
the success of your troubleshooting efforts.
Actively Listen (Taking Notes) and Avoid Interrupting the 
Customer
Good communication includes listening to what the user, manager, or developer is tell-
ing you and making certain that you understand completely what they are trying to say. 
Just because a user or customer doesn’t understand the terminology, syntax, or concepts 
that you do doesn’t mean they don’t have a real problem that needs addressing. You must, 
therefore, be skilled not only at listening but also at translating. Professional conduct 
encompasses politeness, guidance, punctuality, and accountability. Always treat the cus-
tomer with the same respect and empathy you would expect if the situation were reversed. 
Likewise, guide the customer through the problem and the explanation. Tell them what has 
caused the problem they’re currently experiencing and offer the best solution to prevent it 
from recurring.
Listen intently to what your customer is saying. Make it obvious to them that you’re 
listening and respecting what they’re telling you. If you have a problem understanding 
them, go to whatever lengths you need to in order to remedy the situation. Look for verbal 
and nonverbal cues that can help you isolate the problem. Avoid interrupting the customer 
because that telegraphs that what he has to say is not important enough to listen to.
Be Culturally Sensitive
It is important as well to be culturally sensitive—not everyone enjoys the same humor. 
Moreover, be mindful of the difference in the way business is conducted in different cul-
tures and be flexible in your approach based on this. When you sense that the customer pre-
fers a more formal relationship with you, try to reflect that in your approach.

5.4 Demonstrate Proper Communication Techniques and Professionalism 
587  
Use Appropriate Professional Titles, When Applicable
While many folks are not put off at all when you address them by their first name, in many 
cultures it is considered rude to do so, and you should also address the customer using the 
appropriate title when applicable. Not all cultures are as informal as what you may have 
become accustomed to. Again, sensitivity to the customer’s approach to you can be a valu-
able clue to how the customer would prefer to interact with you.
Be on Time (If Late, Contact the Customer)
Punctuality is important and should be part of your planning process before you ever 
arrive at the site. If you tell the customer you’ll be there at 10:30, you need to make every 
attempt to be there at that time. If you arrive late, you have given them false hope that 
the problem would be solved by a set time. That false hope can lead to anger when you 
arrive late and appear to not be taking their problem as seriously as they are. Punctuality 
continues to be important throughout the service call and doesn’t end with your arrival. If 
you need to leave to get parts, tell the customer when you’ll be back, and then be there at 
that time. If for some reason you can’t return at the expected time, alert the customer and 
inform them of your new return time.
In conjunction with time and punctuality, if a user asks how much longer the server will 
be down and you respond that it will up in five minutes only to have it remain down for five 
more hours, you’re creating resentment and possibly anger. When estimating downtime, 
always allow for more time than you think you’ll need, just in case other problems occur. If 
you greatly underestimate the time, always inform the affected parties and give them a new 
time estimate. Here’s an analogy that will put it in perspective: if you take your car to get 
the oil changed and the counter clerk tells you it will be “about 15 minutes,” the last thing 
you want is to be sitting there 4 hours later.
Avoid Distractions
It is important that you avoid distractions while working on a customer’s or user’s problem. 
Those distractions can come in the form of personal calls, talking to co‐workers, or per-
sonal interruptions.
If you arrive at the site to troubleshoot a problem and there are distractions there of the 
customer’s making (children present, TV on, and so on), you should politely ask the customer 
to remove the distractions if possible. If the area you will be working in is cluttered with per-
sonal items (mementos from the state fair, stuffed animals, and so on), ask the customer to 
relocate the items as needed or ask them if it is OK to do so before you relocate the items.
Personal Calls
Taking personal calls while working with a customer can make the customer feel as if their 
problem is being minimized. Spend time solving the problem and interacting with the cus-
tomer and then attend to the personal calls when you leave.

588 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
If you are anticipating an important call that cannot be avoided, let the customer know 
beforehand so they will understand that this interruption is coming.
Texting/Social Media Sites
Keep in mind that when you are supporting a customer, you are working on their time and 
not your own. You are also using their equipment, not your own. Consequently, avoid any 
use of the customer’s equipment or time for personal texts or visits to social media sites. 
It is allowable to use the time and the equipment for legitimate research or other activities 
that are directly related to solving the customer issues.
Talking to Co‐workers While Interacting with Customers
Just as taking personal calls can seem to minimize the importance of interacting with the cus-
tomer, so too can talking to co‐workers. The customer needs to be the focus of your attention 
until their problems have been addressed, and then you can attend to other matters.
If you must contact someone else while troubleshooting, always ask the customer’s 
permission.
Personal Interruptions
The broad category of personal interruptions includes anything that takes you away from 
focusing on the customer and is not job related. Spend your time dealing with the customer 
first and solving their problems before attending to personal issues.
Dealing with Difficult Customers or Situations
Handle complaints as professionally as possible. Accept responsibility for errors that may 
have occurred on your part, and never try to pass the blame. Remember, the goal is to keep 
them as a customer, not to win an argument.
Do Not Argue with Customers and/or Be Defensive
Avoid arguing with a customer because doing so serves no purpose; resolve their anger with 
as little conflict as possible. Moreover, don’t be defensive when the customer questions your 
approach and thought process. While they may clueless about troubleshooting, they deserve 
to understand why you are doing what you are doing.
Avoid Dismissing Customer’s Problems
Just as personal calls and interruptions can make it seem as if you are not taking the cus-
tomer seriously enough, so too can dismissing their problems as less important than they 
believe they are. It is important to put yourself in their shoes and see the issue from their 
perspective. What may seem trivial to you may be a vital issue for them.
Avoid Being Judgmental
It is important to not minimize their problem or appear as if you are being judgmental.

5.4 Demonstrate Proper Communication Techniques and Professionalism 
589  
Clarify Customer Statements (Ask Open‐Ended Questions to 
Narrow the Scope of the Problem, Restate the Issue, or Question 
to Verify Understanding)
The most important skill you can have is the ability to listen. You have to rely on the 
customer to tell you the problem and describe it accurately. They can’t do that if you’re 
second‐guessing them or jumping to conclusions before the whole story is told. Ask ques-
tions that are broad and open‐ended at first and then narrow them down to help isolate 
the problem. This is particularly necessary when you are trying to solve the problem 
remotely.
It’s your job to help guide the user’s description of the problem. Here are some examples:
■
■
Is the printer plugged in?
■
■
Is it online?
■
■
Are any lights flashing on it?
Restate the issue to the customer to make sure that you correctly understand what they 
are telling you (for example, “There is only one green light lit, correct?”). Ask questions as 
needed that verify your understanding of the problem. The questions you ask should help 
guide you toward isolating the problem and identifying possible solutions.
Do Not Disclose Experiences via Social Media Outlets
Although it might make you feel better about a particularly trying experience with a cus-
tomer to vent about it on social media, don’t do that. Not only is it remotely possible that 
the post may somehow find its way to the attention of the customer, it reflects poorly on 
you as someone who shares his business dealings with the world.
Set and Meet Expectations/Timeline and Communicate 
Status with the Customer
Customer satisfaction goes a long way toward generating repeat business. If you can meet 
the customer’s expectations, you’ll almost assuredly hear from them again when another 
problem arises. If you can exceed the customer’s expectations, you can almost guarantee 
that they will call you the next time a problem arises.
Customer satisfaction is important in all communication media—whether you’re onsite, 
providing phone support, or communicating through email or other correspondence.
Share the customer’s sense of urgency. What may seem like a small problem to you can 
appear to the customer as if the whole world is collapsing around them.
Offer Different Repair/Replacement Options If Applicable
If there are multiple solutions to the problem the customer is encountering, offer options to 
them. Those options often include repairing what they already have or replacing it. If the 
repair could lead to a recurrence of the situation but the replacement will not, then that 
should be explained to them clearly.

590 
Chapter 9 ■ Operational Procedures
 The ramifi cations of each choice should be clearly explained along with costs (estimates, 
if necessary) so they can make the decision they deem in their best interest. 
 If you are unable to resolve the issue, explain to the customer what to do and make sure 
to follow up properly to forward the issue to appropriate personnel. 
 Provide Proper Documentation on the Services Provided 
 Document the services you provided so there is no misunderstanding on the part of the cus-
tomer. Supply them with the documentation and keep a copy handy to refer to should any 
questions arise. Explain clearly the cause of the problem and how to avoid it in the future. 
 It is important that the documentation be complete so that if you do not refer to it for 
quite some time (years), you will still be able to understand and explain what was done. 
 Follow Up with Customer/User at a Later Date to Verify 
Satisfaction 
 When you fi nish a job, notify the user you’re done. Make every attempt to fi nd the user 
and inform them of the resolution. If it’s diffi cult to fi nd them, leave a note for them to fi nd 
when they return, explaining the resolution. You should also leave a means by which they 
can contact you, should they have a question about the resolution or a related problem. In 
most cases, the number you leave should be that of your business during working hours and 
your pager, where applicable, after hours. 
 If you do not hear back from the customer, follow up with them at a later date to verify 
that the problem is resolved and they are satisfi ed with the outcome. One of the best ways 
to keep customers is to let them know that you care about their success and satisfaction. 
 Deal Appropriately with Customers’ Confidential 
and Private Materials 
 The goal of  confi dentiality is to prevent or minimize unauthorized access to fi les and fold-
ers and disclosure of data and information. In many instances, laws and regulations require 
specifi c information confi dentiality. For example, Social Security records, payroll and 
employee records, medical records, and corporate information are high‐value assets. This 
information could create liability issues or embarrassment if it fell into the wrong hands. 
Over the last few years, there have been several cases in which bank account and credit 
card numbers were published on the Internet. The costs of these types of breaches of confi -
dentiality far exceed the actual losses from the misuse of this information. 
 
 Confidentiality entails ensuring that data expected to remain private is 
seen only by those who should see it. Confidentiality is implemented 
through authentication and access controls. 
 Just as confi dentiality issues are addressed early in the design phase of a project, you 
as a computer professional are expected to uphold a high level of confi dentiality. Should a

user approach you with a sensitive issue—telling you their password, asking for assistance 
obtaining access to medical forms, and so on—it’s your obligation as a part of your job to 
make certain that information passes no further.
Located on a Computer, Desktop, Printer, Etc.
Technicians may come into contact with confidential information in the course of perform-
ing their job duties. That information could come in the form of data stored on a computer, 
information on a desktop, data (in any form) on a printer, and many other locations. When 
the possibility exists, ask users to remove such confidential information or close the appli-
cation that displays it (saving their work before they close).
If the area where you will be working is cluttered with personal information (printed 
customer lists, and so on), ask the customer to relocate the items if possible. No confiden-
tial information should ever be disclosed to outside parties.
Exam Essentials
Use good communication skills.    Listen to the customer. Let them tell you what they 
understand the problem to be, and then interpret the problem and see whether you can get 
them to agree to what you’re hearing them say. Treat the customer, whether an end user or 
a colleague, with respect, and take their issues and problems seriously.
Deal appropriately with confidential data.    You—as a computer professional—are 
expected to uphold a high level of confidentiality. No confidential information should ever 
be disclosed to outside parties.
5.5 Given a Scenario, Explain  
the Troubleshooting Theory
Most of those employed in the IT field who will be seeking CompTIA’s A+ certification are 
regularly in positions where they need to know how to troubleshoot, repair, and maintain 
computer systems. The following subobjective is covered in this section:
■
■
Always consider corporate policies, procedures and impacts before implementing 
changes
Always Consider Corporate Policies, Procedures, and 
Impacts Before Implementing Changes
When implementing the steps in the troubleshooting theory discussed in this section 
always keep in mind that before you make any changes or take any actions, you should 

592 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
always ensure the changes are consistent with your corporate policies. You should also 
determine whether a particular change you are considering has an established procedure 
defined in the corporate guidelines. Finally, have a clear understanding of the potential 
impact of any change you make, and always ensure that a rollback plan has been estab-
lished in advance. Whenever you determine that a change has the potential to cause wide-
spread issues, try to make the change in a test environment or on a small, low‐impact 
section of the network.
Identify the Problem
Although it may sound obvious, you can’t troubleshoot a problem without knowing what 
the problem is. In some cases, the problem will be obvious. But in others, especially when 
relying on the description of the problem by the user, it will appear to be one thing on the 
surface when in actuality the issue the user is experiencing is a symptom of a different, pos-
sibly larger problem. In this section, processes that can help bring clarity to the situation 
are discussed, and a cautionary note about this step is covered as well.
Question the User and Identify User Changes to Computer and Perform 
Backups Before Making Changes
Identify the problem by questioning the user and identifying user changes to the computer. 
Before you do anything else, ask the user the following:
■
■
What the problem is
■
■
When the last time was that the problem didn’t exist
■
■
What has changed since
Be sure that you do a backup before you make any changes so that all your actions can 
be undone, if necessary.
When performing this step, be wary of accepting the user’s diagnosis of the problem 
at face value. For example, a user may start the conversation with the statement “The 
email server is down.” At this point, ask the question, “Is there anything else you cannot 
do besides open your email?” Ask them to try accessing a shared folder or the Internet. If 
either of those tasks fails, the problem is probably not the email server but basic network 
connectivity of their computer.
Establish a Theory of Probable Cause (Question the Obvious)
As you get answers to your initial questions, theories will begin to evolve as to the root of 
the problem. Analyze the problem, including potential causes, and make an initial determi-
nation of whether it’s a software or hardware problem. As you narrow down the problem, 
determine whether it’s hardware or software related so you can act accordingly.
Once you have developed a list of possible causes, develop a list of tests you can perform 
to test each to narrow the list by eliminating each theory one by one. Don’t forget to con-
sider the obvious and make no assumptions. Just because the cable has worked every day 
for the last five years doesn’t mean the person cleaning the office may not have caught the 
vacuum cleaner on the cable and damaged its connector last night.

5.5 Given a Scenario, Explain the Troubleshooting Theory  
593  
If Necessary, Conduct External or Internal Research Based on Symptoms
You are not expected to immediately know the solution to every issue the user may 
have. You are, however, expected to perform whatever research is required to solve 
the issue. That can include using the Internet, calling trusted fellow technicians, and 
contacting vendors for assistance. Later in this section you will learn that when a reso-
lution is found, you should always documents these lessons learned in a form that you 
can use later to solve the same or similar issues.
Test the Theory to Determine Cause
Test related components, including connections and hardware and software configurations. 
Also use Device Manager and consult vendor documentation. Whatever the problem may 
be, the odds are good that someone else has experienced it before. Use the tools at your dis-
posal—including manuals and websites—to try to zero in on the problem as expeditiously 
as possible.
Once Theory Is Confirmed, Determine Next Steps to Resolve Problem
If your theory is confirmed, then determine the next steps you need to take to resolve the 
problem. In cases where you have determined the device where the problem lies but you 
have no expertise in that area, escalate the problem to someone as needed. For example, if 
you have narrowed down the problem to the router and you don’t understand or manage 
the router, escalate the problem to the router administrator.
If Theory Is Not Confirmed, Reestablish New Theory or Escalate
If your theory is not confirmed, then come up with a new theory or bring in someone with 
more expertise (escalate the problem). If you make changes to test one theory, make sure 
you reverse those changes before you test another theory. Making multiple changes can 
cause new problems and make the process even more difficult.
Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem and Implement 
the Solution
Evaluate the results and develop an action plan of steps to fully resolve the problem. Keep 
in mind that it’s possible that more than one thing is causing the problem. If that is the 
case, you may need to solve one problem and then turn your attention to the next.
Once you have planned your work, work your plan. Methodically make the required 
changes while always having a back‐out plan if your changes cause a larger problem.
Verify Full System Functionality and If Applicable Implement 
Preventive Measures
When the problem is believed to be resolved, verify that the system is fully functional. If 
there are preventive measures that can be put in place to keep this situation from recurring, 
take those measures on this machine and all others where the problem may exist. Also keep 
in mind that times like this are great learning moments to teach users what role they may 

594 
Chapter 9  ■  Operational Procedures  
have played and what actions they may be able to take on their own in the future to prevent 
the problem, if that is appropriate.
Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes
Document your activities and outcomes. Experience is a wonderful teacher, but only if you 
can remember what you’ve done. Documenting your actions and outcomes will help you (or 
a fellow administrator) troubleshoot a similar problem when it crops up in the future.
In some cases, you may think you have solved a problem only to find it occurs again 
later because you only treated the symptom of a larger problem. When this type of thing 
occurs, documentation of what has occurred in the past can be helpful in seeing patterns 
that otherwise would remain hidden.
Exam Essentials
Know the six main steps in the troubleshooting process.    The six steps are as follows: 
identify the problem; establish a theory of probable cause; test the theory to determine the 
cause; establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution; verify 
full system functionality and if applicable implement preventive measures; and document 
findings, actions, and outcomes.
