Callback Interfaces
• Spring has two interfaces you can implement for 
call back events  
• InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet() 
• called after properties are set 
• DisposableBean.destroy() 
• Called during bean destruction in shutdown

Life Cycle Annotations
• Spring has two annotations you can use to hook 
into the bean life cycle 
• @PostConstruct annotated methods will be 
called after the bean has been constructed, but 
before its returned to the requesting object 
• @PreDestroy is called just before the bean is 
destroyed by the container

Bean Post Processors
• Gives you a means to tap into the Spring context life 
cycle and interact with beans as they are processed 
• Implement interface BeanPostProcessor 
• postProcessBeforeInitialization - Called before 
bean initialization method 
• postProcessAfterInitialization - Called after bean 
initialization

‘Aware’ Interfaces
• Spring has over 14 ‘Aware’ interfaces. 
• These are used to access the Spring Framework 
infrastructure 
• These are largely used within the framework 
• Rarely used by Spring developers

‘Aware’ Interfaces
Aware Interface
Description
ApplicationContextAware
Interface to be implemented by any object 
that wishes to be notiﬁed of the 
ApplicationContext that it runs in.
ApplicationEventPublisherAware
Set the ApplicationEventPublisherthat this 
object runs in.
BeanClassLoaderAware
Callback that supplies the bean class 
loader to a bean instance.
BeanFactoryAware
Callback that supplies the owning factory 
to a bean instance.
BeanNameAware
Set the name of the bean in the bean 
factory that created this bean.
BootstrapContextAware
Set the BootstrapContext that this object 
runs in.
Aware Interface
Description
LoadTimeWeaverAware
Set the LoadTimeWeaver of this object’s 
containing ApplicationContext.
MessageSourceAware
Set the MessageSource that this object runs in.
NotiﬁcationPublisherAware
Set the NotiﬁcationPublisher instance for the 
current managed resource instance.
PortletConﬁgAware
Set the PortletConﬁg this object runs in.
PortletContextAware
Set the PortletContext that this object runs in.
ResourceLoaderAware
Set the ResourceLoader that this object runs in.
ServletConﬁgAware
