About the Author
Mark L. Chambers has been an author, computer consultant, BBS sysop, pro-
grammer, and hardware technician for more than 25 years — pushing comput-
ers and their uses far beyond “normal” performance limits for decades now. His 
fi rst love affair with a computer peripheral blossomed in 1984 when he bought 
his lightning-fast 300 BPS modem for his Atari 400. Now he spends entirely too 
much time on the Internet and drinks far too much caffeine-laden soda.
With a degree in journalism and creative writing from Louisiana State University, 
Mark took the logical career choice: programming computers. However, after 
fi ve years as a COBOL programmer for a hospital system, he decided there must 
be a better way to earn a living, and he became the Documentation Manager for 
Datastorm Technologies, a well-known communications software developer. 
Somewhere in between writing software manuals, Mark began writing computer 
how-to books. His fi rst book, Running a Perfect BBS, was published in 1994 —and 
after a short fi fteen years of fun (disguised as hard work), Mark is one of the 
most productive and best-selling technology authors on the planet.
His favorite pastimes include collecting gargoyles, watching St. Louis 
Cardinals baseball, playing his three pinball machines and the latest com-
puter games, supercharging computers, and rendering 3D fl ights of fancy — 
and during all that, he listens to just about every type of music imaginable. 
Mark’s worldwide Internet radio station, MLC Radio (at www.mlcbooks.com), 
plays only CD-quality classics from 1970 to 1979, including everything from 
Rush to Billy Joel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Mark’s rapidly expanding list of books includes MacBook All-in-One For Dummies; 
MacBook For Dummies, 2nd Edition; Mac OS X Snow Leopard All-in-One For 
Dummies; Macs for Seniors For Dummies;  Build Your Own PC Do-It-Yourself For 
Dummies; Building a PC For Dummies, 5th Edition; Scanners For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition; CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition; PCs All-in-One Desk 
Reference For Dummies, 4th Edition; Mac OS X Tiger: Top 100 Simpliﬁ ed Tips 
& Tricks; Microsoft Ofﬁ ce v. X Power User’s Guide; BURN IT! Creating Your Own 
Great DVDs and CDs; The Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial Printer Handbook; The Hewlett-
Packard Ofﬁ cial Recordable CD Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial Digital 
Photography Handbook; Computer Gamer’s Bible; Recordable CD Bible; Teach 
Yourself the iMac Visually; Running a Perfect BBS; Ofﬁ cial Netscape Guide to Web 
Animation; and Windows 98 Troubleshooting and Optimizing Little Black Book.
His books have been translated into 15 different languages so far — his favor-
ites are German, Polish, Dutch, and French. Although he can’t read them, he 
enjoys the pictures a great deal.
Mark welcomes all comments about his books. You can reach him at

Dedication
This book is dedicated to my youngest daughter, Rose Chambers — she of the 
Cleo Beast and Major Tom — with all the love and happiness I can give her.
Author’s Acknowledgments
A guide to Apple’s iMac should be as elegantly designed and straightforward 
as the computer itself . . . and luckily, I had just the right mix of folks to make 
sure that it turned out that way!
First, my thanks are due to my technical editor, Dennis Cohen, who kept 
watch on the accuracy of my facts, comments, and step-by-step procedures 
concerning both the Apple iMac and Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
I’ve often said that Wiley’s Production team is the best in the business, and 
the layout and composition of this book is proof positive — my appreciation 
to everyone who lent a hand with the graphics, proofi ng, and cover work for 
iMac For Dummies, 6th Edition.
As with all my books, I’d like to thank my wife, Anne; and my children, Erin, 
Chelsea, and Rose; for their support and love — and for letting me follow 
my dream!
Lastly, I’d like to thank the two editorial professionals who made this book 
happen: my good friend Bob Woerner, the Wiley acquisitions editor who has 
guided my way through the jungle of technology yet again; and Nicole Haims, 
my hard-working project editor, who somehow fi t several chapters of new 
material into the same page count. It’s folks like the two of you who make this 
the greatest career on the planet — my heartfelt thanks to you both from a 
very grateful Mac owner!

Introduction
S
keptical about your new anodized aluminum iMac, with that super-
charged Intel dual-core or quad-core processor? Perhaps you’re think-
ing it’s too doggone thin, or you’re wondering where all the buttons are. 
Shouldn’t there be places to plug cables? And where the heck is the DVD 
drive you paid for? (Oh, there it is, on the side, at the top right.)
Ladies and gentlemen, I have great news for you: Not only did you make The 
Right Decision about which computer to buy — you shot a hole in one! The 
aluminum iMac has everything a computer power user could want: speed, the 
latest in hardware and standards, a top-of-the-line LED screen, and all the con-
nectors you need to add just about any device meant for today’s computers. 
I wrote this book especially for the proud Intel iMac owner who wants to 
make the most of this new stunning aluminum computer, so this book is a 
guide to both the iMac hardware and Snow Leopard, the latest version of 
Apple’s superb Mac OS X (operating system). I start by describing the basics 
that every iMac owner should know and then move on to chapters devoted 
to the software that comes with your iMac. Along the way, you come across 
a generous sprinkling of power user tips and tricks that save you time, effort, 
and money.
Like my half-dozen other For Dummies titles, I respect and use the same 
English language you do, avoiding jargon, ridiculous computer acronyms, 
and confusing techno-babble whenever possible. 
What’s Really (Not) Required
Here’s a reasonably complete list of what’s not required to use this book:
 
✓ I make no assumptions about your previous knowledge of computers 
and software. 
 
✓ Heck, you don’t even need the computer! If you’re evaluating whether 
the new iMac is right for you, this book is a great choice. 
 
✓ Upgrading from the monster that is a PC running the Windows operating 
system? I’ve got tips, tricks, and entire sections devoted to those hardy 
pioneers called Switchers! You can see all about the similarities and dif-
ferences between the iMac running Snow Leopard and the PC running 
Windows. I also show you how to make the switch as easy and quick as 
possible.

2
iMac For Dummies, 6th Edition 
 
✓ If your friends and family told you that you’re going to spend half your 
life savings on software — or that no “decent” software is available for 
Mac computers — just smile quietly to yourself! The iMac comes com-
plete with about a ton more software than any Windows box, and the 
iLife ’09 suite of applications is better than anything available on a PC! 
(Note, however, that the iWork ’09 applications provided with a new 
iMac are time-limited, so if you decide to use iWork ’09 you’ll have to 
buy a license code.) 
So what is required? Only your desire to become a power user (someone who 
produces the best work in the least amount of time, and has the most fun 
doing it)!
 
This book was written using the latest Intel dual-core iMac computer, so 
owners of older iMac computers might not be able to follow along with every-
thing I cover. If you upgraded an older Intel iMac with Mac OS X Snow Leopard 
and the iLife ’09 application suite, you should be able to use most of the book 
with no problem!
About This Book
Each chapter in this book is written as a reference on a specific hardware 
or software topic. You can begin reading anywhere you like because each 
chapter is self-contained. However, I recommend that you read the book from 
front to back because the order of this book makes a great deal of sense.
Conventions Used in This Book
Even with a minimum of techno-speak, this book needs to cover the special 
keys that you have to press or menu commands that you have to choose 
in order to make things work — hence this short list of conventions. (Note 
that you usually have to press the Return key before anything happens when 
entering a manual command.)
 
✓ Stuff you type. If I ask you to type (or enter) something, like in a text box 
or field, that text appears in bold, like this:
Type me.
 
 If I ask you to type a command within Mac OS X, that text appears like 
this:
Type me.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Menu commands. I list menu paths and commands using another 
format. For example, this instruction indicates that you should click the 
Edit menu and then choose the Copy menu item:
 
 Edit➪Copy
 
✓ Web addresses. No up-to-date book on a computer would be complete 
without a bag full of Web addresses for you to check out. When you see 
these in the text, they look like this: www.mlcbooks.com.
 
✓ For the technically curious. Tangential techy stuff is presented in side-
bars, and you don’t have to read them unless you want to know what 
makes things tick.
How This Book Is Organized
After careful thought (read that flipping a coin), I divided this book into 
seven major parts — plus an index, just because you deserve one! For your 
convenience, cross-references to additional coverage of many topics are also 
sprinkled liberally throughout the book.
Part I: Know Your iMac
This part introduces you to the important features of your iMac — like where 
all the cables connect (or don’t) — and helps you set up your system. I also 
introduce Mac OS X Snow Leopard, the Apple operating system that comes 
preinstalled on your aluminum iMac.
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X
Time to familiarize you with Snow Leopard — how to take care of mundane 
chores (like moving your stuff) as well as how to customize and personalize 
your system until it fits like the proverbial glove! Switchers from the PC world 
will be especially interested in mastering the ins and outs of Mac OS X.
Part III: Connecting and Communicating
Time to jump into the one application you’re likely to use every single day: 
your Safari Web browser! You can also read here about Apple’s MobileMe 
Internet subscriber service and how to connect your iMac for printing, scan-
ning, videoconferencing, and faxing. (I told you this thing was powerful, 
didn’t I?)

iMac For Dummies, 6th Edition 
Part IV: Living the iLife
Ah, readers, you can begin humming happily to yourself right this second! 
Yep, this part provides coverage of the latest iLife ’09 release, with the names 
that are the envy of the Windows crowd: iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb and 
GarageBand (along with iTunes, which is available for Windows). You see 
how to turn your iMac into the hub for all your digital media. Whether you 
listen to it, display it, compose it, offer it online or direct it, this part of the 
book explains it!
Part V: Getting Productive with 
iWork and Other Tools
Part V is dedicated to the iWork ’09 productivity suite. You’ll learn how to 
produce works of office art: spreadsheets, presentations and printed docu-
ments that deliver your message with aplomb. I also discuss how to share 
your iMac among a group of people or how to connect your iMac to a net-
work. (Wired or wireless, makes no difference to me!)
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: 
Troubleshooting, Upgrading, 
Maintaining
So you want to upgrade your iMac with more memory or new hardware? If 
you need to troubleshoot a problem with your hardware or software, my 
should-be-patented troubleshooting guide resides in this part. Finally, I 
describe what you can do to help keep your iMac running as fast and as 
trouble free as the day you took it out of the box!
Part VII: The Part of Tens
The two chapters that make up the famous “Part of Tens” section are served 
in classic Late Night style: Each chapter contains a quick reference of tips 
and advice on a specific iMac topic. Each list has ten concise tips, and one or 
two readers have told me that they make excellent tattoos. (Personally, I’m 
not that much of a Mac guru.)
 
If you’re dying to find out how to share data among wireless devices via 
Bluetooth technology and iSync — or how to broadcast your music around 
your house like Wolfman Jack — check out the handy Bluetooth and Wireless 
bonus chapter at the MLC Books Online Web Site (www.mlcbooks.com).

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
Like other technology authors, I firmly believe that important nuggets of 
wisdom should stand out on the page! With that in mind, this For Dummies 
book includes a number of margin icons for certain situations:
 
This is the most popular icon in the book, and you find these parked next to 
suggestions that I make to save you time and effort (and even cash!).
 
You don’t have to know this stuff, but the technologically curious love high-
tech details. (Of course, we’re great fun at parties, too.)
 
Always read the information for this icon first! I’m discussing something 
that could actually harm your hardware or throw a plumber’s helper into 
your software.
 
Consider these nuggets as highlighter stuff — not quite as universally 
accepted (or as important to the author) as a Mark’s Maxim but good remind-
ers nonetheless. I use these icons to reinforce what you should remember.
 
These nuggets are easily spotted; just look for the likeness of my rugged, 
iMac-lovin’ mug. These are My Favorite Recommendations. In fact, I’ll bet 
just about any iMac power user would tell you the same. Follow my Maxims 
to avoid the quicksand and pitfalls that I’ve encountered with all sorts of 
Macs for well over a decade!
Where to Go from Here
My recommendations on how to proceed? You know, I just happen to 
have three:
 
✓ If you’re thinking about buying a new iMac, the box is still unopened in 
your living room, or you’d like help setting things up, I would start with 
Part I.
 
✓ If your iMac is already running but you’d like guidance with running 
Mac OS X — Windows Switchers, take note — start with Part II.
 
✓ For all other concerns, use the index or jump straight to the chapter you 
need. (You can always return later, at your leisure.)

iMac For Dummies, 6th Edition 
A Final Word
I’d like to thank you for buying this book, and I hope that you find iMac For 
Dummies, 6th Edition, valuable! With this book in hand, I believe that you and 
your aluminum iMac supercomputer will bond together as I have with mine. 
(That sounds somewhat wrong, but it’s really not.)

Part I
Know Your iMac

In this part . . .
Y
our iMac odyssey begins with a description of the 
computer itself, as well as the details you need to 
know when unpacking and setting up your newest family 
member. You also find an introduction to Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard, the latest version of Apple’s super-popular oper-
ating system.

Chapter 1
Okay, This Machine Looks 
Really, Really Weird
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying the important parts of your iMac
▶ Locating the right home for your computer
▶ Plugging stuff in and getting hooked up
▶ Playing with your bundled software
▶ Buying additional stuff that you might need
Y
ou bought a brand-new iMac, and there it sits, in the box. Waiting. 
Waiting for you.
If you’re a little nervous about unpacking that shiny aluminum-and-glass rect-
angle, I completely understand. Face it: The latest iMac follows in the foot-
steps of many revolutionary iMac designs that have come before it. (In other 
words, it doesn’t look like a computer at all, and that can be a bit disconcert-
ing.) And if you’re switching from a Windows PC to the Apple universe, you 
might find yourself floating weightlessly in your office or your living room 
without a familiar bulky beige box to anchor yourself. Hence the reluctance 
you might be feeling.
However, dear reader, let me assure you that you’ve indeed made The Right 
Choice. I commend you! The aluminum Intel iMac is the fastest, leanest, and 
easiest-to-use self-contained all-in-one computer ever built. Practically every-
thing’s in one shining panel (except for your keyboard and mouse). You’ve 
got one of the best backlit LED screens on the planet, a super-fast processor, 
room for a ton of RAM (memory), and a regular laundry list of the latest tech-
nology. Best of all, you don’t have to be a techno-nerd to use all that power!
In this chapter, I introduce you to your new dream machine, giving you an 
overview of the more important locations within iMac City. I show you how 
to unpack your new computer, what wires go where, and where your iMac 
should set up housekeeping. I preview the awesome software that’s waiting 
within that powerful panel. Finally, I list the accessories that help keep both 
you and your new iMac computing smoothly.

10
Part I: Know Your iMac 
An Introduction to the Beast
The Intel iMac might look like a sculpture straight out of your local museum 
of modern art, but it still sports everything that it needs to function as a 
computer. In this section, I identify the important stuff that you need to live 
your life — you know, write a term paper in Pages, hear the music you down-
loaded, or manage the affairs of those lazy Sims.
Major parts of your major appliance
Every computer requires some of the same gizmos. Figure 1-1 helps you track 
them down. Of course, as you’d expect, a computer has a “body” of sorts in 
which all the innards and brains are stored (the screen, in this case), a dis-
play screen, a keyboard, a mouse/pointing device, and ports for powering 
and exchanging data with peripherals.
 
Figure 1-1:

matic form

That magnificent screen
What a view you’ve got! An aluminum iMac is graced with either a 21.5" or 27" 
LED display.
 
LED screens use far less electricity than their antique CRT ancestors, and they 
emit practically no radiation (less, in fact, than even the LCD screens Apple 
recently used).

11
 Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird
Both sizes of iMac screens offer a widescreen aspect ratio (the screen is con-
siderably wider than it is tall), which augurs well for those who enjoy watch-
ing DVD movies. (A favorite editor of mine loves it when I use the antique 
word augur, meaning to predict or foretell.) For example, the 27" screen boasts 
a whopping 2560 x 1440 resolution.
 
That reminds me: Throw away your printed dictionary! You won’t need it 
because Mac OS X Snow Leopard includes the fantastic Dictionary widget that 
uses the Internet to retrieve definitions from Dictionary.com. More on the wid-
gets in Chapter 5 . . . and yes, the Dictionary widget does contain augur.
The keyboard and mouse
Hey, here’s something novel for the Intel iMac — something external (outside 
the computer’s case). Gotta have a keyboard and mouse, right? And you 
gotta love the options with iMac: You’ll go nomadic . . . um, that is, wireless 
and free.
The iMac comes standard with a truly 21st century combo of an Apple wire-
less keyboard and Magic Mouse! This dynamic duo lets you sit back and relax 
with your keyboard in your lap, without being tied down by a cord. (Say it 
with me: “Death to cords, death to cords.”) Just stay within about 30 feet of 
your iMac screen, and sweet freedom is yours. You can also feel safe using 
these wireless peripherals because they offer secure 128-bit, over-the-air 
encryption, which helps keep sensitive information safe while you type and 
click away. One downside about the wireless keyboard, though: Unlike the 
previous wired keyboard, the wireless model doesn’t include any USB ports, 
and you will need a supply of batteries. (Go rechargeable!)
The keyboard is a particular favorite of mine because from here
 
✓ You can either control the sound volume (using the volume control 
buttons F11 and F12) or mute all that noise completely (using the Mute 
button F10).
 
✓ A handy-dandy Media Eject key lets you eject a CD or DVD.
 
The wireless Magic Mouse needs a flat surface, but that’s what TV trays are 
for, right?
The disc slot
You’ll notice a long groove on the right edge of your iMac. No, it’s not for 
your credit card. (If you order online often enough, you’ll memorize your 
card number.) This slot accepts standard-size CDs and DVDs into your opti-
cal drive (don’t try using mini-CD or DVD discs in your iMac — they can get 
stuck and Ruin Your Day). If the drive is empty, loading a disc is as simple as 
sliding it in an inch or so; the drive sucks in the disc automatically. (And we 
don’t need no stinkin’ floppy drive. Macs haven’t had floppy drives for years 
now, and the PC types are just beginning to follow.)

12
Part I: Know Your iMac 
 
“Luke, the printed label side of the disc should always be facing you when you 
load a disc. Always.”
Yes, your computer has a foot . . . just one
You and I — normal human beings — would say that the iMac is supported 
by a sturdy aluminum stand, but Apple calls it a foot. The foot lets you tilt 
the iMac panel up and down for the best viewing angle. Most importantly, 
though, the foot minimizes the computer’s desk space requirements (or its 
footprint). (Engineers . . . sheesh.) And yes, that foot is perfectly balanced and 
quite stable, so there’s no danger of your treasured iMac taking a dive.
If you decide to get really snazzy and mount your 27-inch iMac to the wall, 
you can remove the foot and install the VESA mounting adapter (available 
separately for about $30). You can use any VESA standard mounting bracket 
on your wall, too. You can be positioned within 30 yards or so of your wall-
mounted iMac with a wireless Apple keyboard and mouse.
Hey, Hewlett-Packard or Dell, can you mount one of those monolithic PCs to 
the wall? I think not.
Food for your ears
A machine this nice had better have great sound, and the iMac doesn’t disap-
point. You have a couple of options for iMac audio:
 
✓ The iMac sports built-in stereo speakers (and a microphone to boot)
 
✓ Built-in ports connect your iMac audio to either
 
• More powerful (and more expensive) external speaker systems
 
• A set of headphones
 
• A home stereo system
The power cable
Sorry, but you can’t get a wireless power system . . . yet. (Apple’s working 
hard on that one.) With the wireless keyboard and mouse setup, the power 
cable is actually the only required cable that you need to run your computer! 
Now that’s sassy.
The power button
Yep, you’ve got one of these, too. It’s on the back of the case.
Those holes are called ports
Our next stop on your tour of Planet iMac is Port Central — that row of holes 
on the back of your computer (see Figure 1-2). Each port connects a different 
type of cable or device, allowing you to easily add all sorts of extra function-
ality to your computer.

Figure 1-2:

Power button
Fan exhaust
Ports
Each of these stellar holes is identified by an icon to help you identify it. 
Here’s a list of what you’ll find as well as a quick rundown on what these 
ports do.
 
 
✓ FireWire: These ports are the standard in the Apple universe for con-
necting external hard drives and DVD recorders, but they do double 
duty as the connector of choice for most digital video (DV) camcord-
ers. (A peripheral is another silly techno-nerd term, meaning a separate 
device that you connect to your computer.) Note that the iMac offers a 
FireWire 800 port, which is twice as fast as the older FireWire 400 port — 
the ports are shaped differently, so you can’t plug a FireWire 400 device 
into a FireWire 800 port in error. (Converter cables are available that 
allow you to plug a FireWire 400 device into your FireWire 800 port.)
 
 
✓ USB: Short for Universal Serial Bus, the familiar USB port is the jack-of-
all-trades in today’s world of computer add-ons. Most external devices 
(such as portable hard drives, scanners, or digital cameras) that you 
want to connect to your iMac use a USB port. The iMac sports four USB 
2.0 ports on its back. USB 2.0 connections are much faster than the old 
USB 1.1 standard.
 
 For the specs on connecting your keyboard and mouse, see the upcom-
ing section, “Absolutely essential connections.”
 
 For more on FireWire and USB ports, get the lowdown in Chapter 23.
 
 
✓ Ethernet: The iMac includes a standard 10/100/1000 Ethernet port, so 
it’s ready to join your existing wired Ethernet network. (Alternatively, 
you can go wireless for your network connection; find more on that in 
the next section and in Chapter 21.)

14
Part I: Know Your iMac 
 
 Apple doesn’t include a built-in modem on the iMac, so if you need 
a dialup connection to the Internet, you need an external 56K v.92 
USB modem. (Apple sells a USB modem, which can send and receive 
faxes, too.)
 
 
✓ Mini DisplayPort: In case that splendid screen isn’t quite big enough, 
you can add an adapter to this port and send the video signal from your 
iMac to an LCD monitor or flatscreen TV with a DVI port. (Apple also 
offers different adapters that can connect your iMac to standard VGA 
monitors and projectors.)
Connections for external audio
Your Intel iMac comes equipped with two pretty powerful stereo speakers on 
the bottom of the case, but you’re certainly not limited to them. Apple pro-
vides a number of connectors to add a wide range of audiophile equipment to 
your system.
 
 
✓ Headphone/Optical Output: You can send the high-quality audio from 
your rectangular beast to a set of standard headphones or to an optical 
digital audio device, such as a high-end, home theater system.
 
 
✓ Line In: Last (but certainly not least) is the audio Line In jack, which 
allows you to pipe the signal from another audio device into your iMac. 
This one comes in particularly handy when you record MP3 files from 
your old vinyl albums or when you want to record loops within 
GarageBand, which you can read more about in Chapter 15. This jack 
supports both analog and digital input.
Important Hidden Stuff
When you bought your new digital pride and joy, you probably noticed a 
number of subtle differences between the low-end iMac and the uber-expen-
sive top-end model. I call these differences the Important Hidden Stuff (or IHS, 
if you’re addicted to acronyms), and they’re just as important as the parts 
and ports that you can see.
 
✓ Hard drive: The aluminum iMac uses serial ATA hard drives.
 
 As I type these words, the iMac product line offers three different hard 
drive sizes, depending on the processor speed and screen size you 
choose: 500GB, 1TB or an immense 2TB (yes, friends and neighbors, that 
TB means terabyte, or 1000GB). The bigger, the better.
 
✓ Optical drive: Okay, I’m cheating a little here. I mention the optical drive 
in an earlier section, but all you can see is the slot, so it qualifies as an 
IHS item. All new iMac models include a DVD-R SuperDrive (which can 
play and record both CDs and DVDs).

15
 Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird
 
✓ Wireless Ethernet: “Look, Ma, no wires!” As I mention earlier, your iMac 
can join an existing wireless Ethernet network with its built-in AirPort 
Extreme card. With wireless connectivity, you can share documents 
with another computer in another room, share a single high-speed 
Internet connection betwixt several computers, or enjoy wireless print-
ing. Truly sassy!
 
 Although Apple would want you to build your wireless wonderland with 
an Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station — go figure — you can actually 
use your iMac with any standard 802.11g or 802.11n wireless network. 
And yes, PCs and Macs can intermingle on the same wireless network 
without a hitch. (Scandalous, ain’t it?)
 
✓ Bluetooth: Let’s get the old “digital pirate” joke out of the way: “Arrgg, 
matey, I needs me a wireless parrot.” (Engineers again . . . sheesh.) 
Although strangely named, Bluetooth is actually another form of wire-
less connectivity. This time, however, the standard was designed for 
accessories like your keyboard and mouse, and devices like your per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA) and cellphone. Bluetooth is now built in to 
every aluminum iMac. 
 
✓ SD Card slot: This slot allows you to directly read photos and video 
from standard SD memory cards — photographers and video junkies, 
rejoice! 
 
✓ iSight camera: The iMac’s built-in video and still camera appears as a 
tiny lens and activity light at the top of your computer. 
 
✓ Video card: If your applications rely heavily on high-speed 3-D graphics, 
you’ll be pleased as punch to find that your iMac comes equipped with 
an NVIDIA GeForce 9400M, ATI Radeon HD 4670 or (for the more expen-
sive models) an ATI Radeon HD 4850 card. All three cards are well suited 
to 3-D modeling, video editing, and well, honestly, blasting the enemy 
into small smoking pieces with aplomb.
Choosing a Home for Your New Pet
If you pick the wrong spot to park your new iMac, I can guarantee that you’ll 
regret it later. Some domiciles and office cubicles obviously don’t offer a 
choice — you’ve got one desk at work, for example, and nobody’s going to 
hand over another one — but if you can select a home for your iMac, con-
sider the important placement points in this section.

16
Part I: Know Your iMac 
Picking the right location
You know the mantra: Location, location, location.
 
✓ There’s always the wall. Your iMac can disguise itself as a particularly 
interesting digital picture frame. With the right mounting adapter, you 
can hang your computer right on the wall and snub your desk alto-
gether.
 
 This wall-mounted solution has two big problems:
 
• Your VESA mounting plate must be installed safely and correctly 
(for example, using the studs within your walls).
 
 The iMac is slim and trim, but it’s no lightweight, and it doesn’t 
bounce well. You don’t want it to take a high dive!
 
• External peripherals aren’t happy campers — that includes any 
FireWire and USB devices, which must either camp out on the floor 
or on a nearby (and conspicuous) shelf. (Personally, I think the 
cables for external devices tend to spoil the appearance of a wall-
mounted computer.)
 
 Your iMac must be mounted at the proper height on the wall. It’s not 
good ergonomic practice to sit more than two feet away from your 
iMac’s screen, and the screen should be placed at (or slightly below) 
eye level.
My solution? Don’t plan on using any external devices. Instead, opt for a wire-
less network with a remote printer and remote backup storage space, like a 
Time Capsule unit on your network.
 
✓ Keep things cool. Your new iMac is nearly silent, but that super-fast 
Intel dual or quad-core processor generates quite a bit of heat. Fans 
inside the case draw the heat away. (Nothing like an overheated proces-
sor to spoil an evening of Civilization 4.)
 
 Follow these three rules to keep your cool. Make sure that
 
• The location you choose is far from heating vents.
 
• The location you choose is shielded from direct sunlight.
 
• Allow plenty of room below the machine (where the air enters the 
case) and above the machine (where heated air escapes from the 
slot at the top of the case).
 
 Hot air from a wall-mounted iMac can discolor the wall.

 Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird
Considering the convenience factor
Technology is nothing if you can’t make it convenient:
 
✓ Outlets, outlets, outlets! Your computer needs a minimum of at least 
one nearby outlet, and perhaps as many as three or four:
 
• A standard AC outlet (I’ll discuss surge protectors and uninterrupt-
ible power supplies at the end of this chapter)
 
• A telephone jack (if you use an external USB modem for connecting 
to the Internet or sending and receiving faxes)
 
• A nearby Ethernet jack (if you use the iMac’s built-in Ethernet port 
for connecting to a wired Ethernet network)
 
 If you prefer to send your data over the airwaves, consider wire-
less networking for your iMac. I discuss everything you need to 
know in Chapter 21.
 
✓ Don’t forget the lighting. Let me act as your Mom. (I know that’s a 
stretch, but bear with me.) She’d say, “You can’t possibly expect to work 
without decent lighting! You’ll go blind!” She’s right, you know. At a mini-
mum, you need a desk or floor lamp.
 
✓ Plan to expand. If your iMac hangs out on a desk, allow an additional 
foot of space on each side. That way, you have space for external 
peripherals, more powerful speakers, and that wired keyboard and 
mouse.
Unpacking and Connecting
You are going to love this section — it’s short and sweet because the installa-
tion of an aluminum iMac on your desktop is a piece of cake. (Sorry about the 
cliché overload, but this really is easy.)
Unpacking your iMac For Dummies
Follow these guidelines when unpacking your system:
 
✓ Check for damage. I’ve never had a box arrive from Apple with shipping 
damage, but I’ve heard horror stories from others (who claim that King 
Kong must have been working for That Shipping Company). Check all 
sides of your box before you open it.

18
Part I: Know Your iMac 
 
 Take a photograph of any significant damage (just in case).
 
✓ Search for all the parts. When you’re removing those chunks o’ 
Styrofoam, make certain that you check all sides of each foam block for 
parts that are snuggled therein or taped for shipment.
 
✓ Keep all those packing materials. Do not head for the trash can with 
that box and those packing materials. Keep your box intact and also 
keep all packing materials for at least a year until your standard Apple 
warranty runs out. If you have to ship it to an Apple service center, the 
box and the original packing is the only way for your iMac to fly.
 
 And now, a dramatic Mark’s Maxim about cardboard containers:
 
 Smart computer owners keep their boxes far longer than a year.
 
 For example, if you sell your iMac or move across the country, you’ll 
want that box. Trust me on this one.
 
✓ Store the invoice for safekeeping. Your invoice is a valuable piece of 
paper, indeed.
 
 Save your original invoice in a plastic bag, along with your computer’s 
manuals and original software, manuals, and other assorted hoo-hah. 
Keep the bag on your shelf or stored safely in your desk, and enjoy a 
little peace of mind.
 
✓ Read the iMac’s manual. “Hey, wait a minute, Mark — why do I have to 
read the manual from Apple along with this tome?” Good question, and 
here’s the answer: There might be new and updated instructions in the 
documentation from Apple that override what I tell you in this book. 
(For example, “Never cut the red wire. Cut the blue wire instead.” Or 
something to that effect.)
 
 Besides, Apple manuals are rarely thicker than a restaurant menu.
Connecting cables like a true nerd
The iMac makes all its connections really simple, but your computer depends 
on you to get the outside wires and thingamabobs where they go.
Absolutely essential connections
After your new iMac is resting comfortably in its assigned spot (I assume 
that’s a desktop), you need to make a minimum of one connection: the power 
cable. Plug the cable into the corresponding socket on the iMac first; then 
plug ’er in to that handy AC outlet.
 
 Your batteries will need to be installed in your wireless keyboard and 
mouse. After the batteries are in, you’re set to go.

19
 Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird
Adding the Internet to the mix
If you have Internet access or a local computer network, you need to make at 
least one of the following connections.
 
If you don’t already have any Internet service, you’ll probably want to start 
with local dialup Internet access (if you have an external USB modem for your 
iMac). If you decide to investigate your high-speed options immediately, your 
local cable and telephone companies can provide you with more information 
on DSL or cable Internet service.
Dialup Internet access
If you get on the Internet by dialing a standard phone number, you’ll need an 
external USB modem to connect your iMac. Follow these steps:
 
1. Plug your external USB modem into one of the USB ports on the back 
of your iMac.
 
2. Plug one of the telephone cable’s connectors into your modem’s line 
port.
 
3. Plug the other telephone cable connector into your telephone line’s 
wall jack.
Networks and high-speed Internet access
If you have high-speed Internet service or if you’re in an office or school with 
a local computer network, you can probably connect through the iMac’s 
built-in Ethernet port. You make two connections:
 
1. Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port on the iMac.
 
2. Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port from 
your network. It’s probably one of the following:
 
• An Ethernet wall jack
 
• An Ethernet hub or switch
 
• A cable or DSL Internet router (or sharing device)
 
Will you be joining a wireless network? If so, you find all the details you need 
in Chapter 21 to configure Snow Leopard for wireless networking.

Discovering All the Cool 
Things You Can Do
This section answers the most common of all novice computer questions: 
“What the heck will I do with this thing?” You find additional details and excit-
ing factoids about the software that you get for free, software you’ll want to 
buy, and stuff you can do on the Internet.
What software do I get?
Currently, all iMac computers ship with these major software applications 
installed and ready to use:
 
✓ The iLife suite: You know you want these applications! They turn your 
iMac into a digital hub for practically every kind of high-tech device on 
the planet, including DV camcorders, digital cameras, portable music 
players, PDAs, and even cellphones.
 
 Chapters 11–16 of this book focus on the five major applications that 
make up iLife: iMovie, iDVD, iTunes, iPhoto, iWeb and GarageBand.
 
✓ The iWork suite: A demo version of Apple’s powerful office productivity 
suite is included with your iMac. You can create documents, spread-
sheets, and presentations within Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. It’s 
much like that Other Office Suite (the one that costs a bundle) from 
those guys in Redmond.
 
 Figure 1-3 illustrates a flyer under construction in Pages.
 
✓ Front Row: This onscreen menu system makes it easy to watch movies, 
listen to your music, and display your favorite photos on that gorgeous 
iMac screen . . . all remotely, if you invest in an Apple Remote! I go into 
the details of Front Row in Chapter 10.
 
The installed software on your iMac might change as new programs become 
available.
Looking forward to fun on the Internet
What is a modern computer without the Internet? Apple gives you great tools 
to take full advantage of every road sign and offramp on the Information 
Superhighway, right out of the box:

21
 Chapter 1: Okay, This Machine Looks Really, Really Weird
 
✓ Web surfing: I use Snow Leopard’s Safari Web browser every single day. 
It’s faster and better designed than other browsers (although I might be 
biased). Safari includes tabbed browsing and has built-in RSS feeds.
 
 If tabbed browsing and RSS feeds sound like ancient Aztec to you, don’t 
worry. Chapter 8 is devoted entirely to Safari.
 
✓ Web searches: Your Dashboard widgets can search the entire Internet 
for stocks, movie listings, business locations, and dictionaries.
 
✓ Chat: iChat lets you use your iMac to chat with others around the world 
for free via the Internet — by keyboard, voice, or (with your built-in 
iSight Web camera) full-color video. This is awesome stuff straight out of 
Dick Tracy and Buck Rogers. If you’ve never seen a video chat, you’ll be 
surprised by just how good your friends and family look!
 
 Always wear a shirt when videoconferencing.
 
✓ E-mail: Soldier, Apple’s got you covered. The Mail application is a full-
featured e-mail system, complete with defenses against the torrent of 
junk mail awaiting you. (Imagine a hungry, digital, saber-toothed tiger 
with an appetite for spam.) Send pictures and attached files to everyone 
else on the planet, and look doggone good doing it.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Pages is a 
great tool 
for home 
and office.

Applications that rock
Dozens of small applications are built into Mac OS X. I mention them in later 
chapters, but here are three good examples to whet your appetite:
 
✓ iCal: Keep track of your schedule and upcoming events, and even share 
your calendar online with others in your company or your circle of 
friends. See how to keep your life in order in Figure 1-4.
 
✓ DVD Player: Put all that widescreen beauty to work and watch your 
favorite DVD movies with DVD Player! You have all the features of 
today’s most expensive standalone DVD players, too, including a spiffy 
onscreen control that looks like a remote.
 
✓ Address Book: Throw away that well-thumbed collection of fading 
addresses. Snow Leopard’s Address Book can store, search, and recall 
just about any piece of information on your friends, family, and acquain-
tances.
 
 You can use the data you store in your Address Book in other Apple 
applications that are included with Snow Leopard, such as Apple Mail 
and iChat.

Would you like to play a game?
“All productivity and no play. . . .” Hey, Steve Jobs likes a good challenging 
game as much as the next guy, so you can look forward to playing Chess on 
your iMac right out of the box — ah, but this isn’t the chessboard your Dad 
used! Play the game of kings against a tough (and configurable) opponent — 
your iMac — on a beautiful 3-D board. Heck, your iMac even narrates the 
game by speaking the moves!
Stuff You Oughta Buy Right Now
No man is an island, and no computer is either. I always recommend the 
same set of stuff for new PC and Mac owners. These extras help keep your 
new computer clean and healthy (and some make sure you’re happy as well):
 
✓ Surge suppressor or UPS (uninterruptible power supply): Even an all-
in-one computer like your iMac can fall prey to a power surge. I recom-
mend one of these:
 
• A basic surge suppressor with a fuse can help protect your iMac 
from an overload.
 
• A UPS costs a little more, but it does a better job of filtering your 
AC line voltage to prevent brownouts or line interference from
 
• A UPS provides a few minutes of battery power during a blackout 
so you can save your documents and safely shut down your iMac.
 
✓ Screen wipes: Invest in a box of premoistened screen wipes. Your 
iMac’s screen can pick up dirt, fingerprints, and other unmentionables 
faster than you think.
 
 Make sure your wipes are especially meant for flat-panel monitors or 
laptop computer screens.
 
✓ Blank CDs and DVDs: Depending on the type of media you’re 
recording — like computer data CDs, DVD movies, or audio CDs — you’ll 
want blank discs for
 
• CD-R (record once)
 
• CD-RW (record multiple times)
 
• DVD-R (record once)
 
• DVD-RW (record multiple times)

24
Part I: Know Your iMac 
 
✓ Cables: Depending on the external devices and wired network connec-
tivity you’ll be using, these are
 
• A standard Ethernet cable (for wired networks or high-speed 
Internet)
 
• FireWire or USB cables for devices you already have
 
 Most hardware manufacturers are nice enough to include a cable 
with their products, but there are exceptions, especially USB print-
ers. Shame on those cheapskates!
 
✓ A wrist rest for both your keyboard and mouse: You might have many 
reasons to buy a new iMac, but I know that a bad case of carpal tunnel 
syndrome is not one of them. Take care of your wrists by adding a key-
board and mouse rest (even for a wireless keyboard/mouse combo, even 
on a TV tray).

I
f you’ve already been through Chapter 1, you got as far as unpacking your 
iMac and connecting at least one cable to it. And unless you solely bought 
this computer as a work of modern art, it’s time to actually turn on your 
iMac and begin living The Good Life. (Plus, you still get to admire that Apple 
design whilst using iTunes.) After you get your new beauty powered on, I 
help you here with an initial checkup on your iMac’s health.
I also familiarize you with the initial chores that you need to complete — 
such as using Mac OS X Setup as well as moving the data and settings from 
your existing computer to your iMac — before you settle in with your favorite 
applications.
In this chapter, I assume that Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6) was 
preinstalled on your iMac or that you just completed an upgrade to Snow 
Leopard from an earlier version of Mac OS X. (If you’re upgrading, your iMac 
is already turned on — and you can skip the next section!)
Throwing the Big Leaf Switch
Your iMac’s power switch is located on the back of the computer, at the 
lower-left corner of the case (as you look at the screen). Press it now to turn 
on your iMac, and you hear the pleasant startup tone that’s been a hallmark 
of Apple computers for many years now. Don’t be alarmed if you don’t imme-
diately see anything onscreen, because it takes a few seconds for the initial 
Apple logo to appear.

26
Part I: Know Your iMac 
 
In my experience, a simple quick press of the power button on some iMacs 
sometimes just doesn’t do it. Instead, you actually have to hold down the 
button for a count of two or so before the computer turns on.
While the Apple logo appears, you see a twirling, circular high-tech progress 
indicator appear that looks like something from a Star Wars movie. That’s the 
sign that your iMac is loading Snow Leopard and checking your internal drive 
for problems. Sometimes the twirling circle can take a bit longer to disap-
pear. As long as it’s twirling, though, something good is happening.
Next, Snow Leopard displays the soon-to-be-quite-familiar Aqua Blue (yup, 
that’s its name) background while it loads file sharing, networking, and print-
ing components (and such).
At last, your patience of a whole 10–15 seconds is rewarded, and after a short 
(but neat) video, you see the Snow Leopard Setup Assistant appear.
Mark’s Favorite Signs of a Healthy iMac
Before you jump into the fun stuff, don’t forget an important step — a quick 
prelim check of the signs that your iMac survived shipment intact and happy. 
(Although the shipping box that Apple uses for the aluminum iMac series is 
one of the best I’ve ever encountered in 20-plus years of swapping computer 
hardware, your computer could still have met with foul play.)
If you can answer Yes to each of these questions, your iMac likely made the 
trip without serious damage:
 
1. Does the computer’s chassis appear undamaged?
 
 It’s pretty easy to spot damage to your iMac’s svelte metal and glass 
design. Look for scratches, puncture damage, and misalignment of 
the screen.
 
2. Does the LED screen work, and is it undamaged?
 
 I’m talking about obvious scratches or puncture damage to your 
screen. Additionally, you should also check whether any individual 
dots (or pixels) on your LED monitor are obviously malfunctioning. 
Bad pixels either appear black or in a different color than everything 
surrounding them.
 
 Techs call these irritating anarchists dead pixels. Unfortunately, many 
new LED screens include one or two. After all, a 21.5" iMac screen sports 
literally more than one million pixels.

27
 Chapter 2: Life! Give My iMac Life!
 
3. Can you feel a flow of air from the vent on top?
 
 Your iMac’s Intel processor generates quite a bit of heat, so the fan 
system never turns off completely. If you don’t feel warm air from the 
fan system after your iMac has been on for a minute or two, you might 
have a problem.
 
4. Do the keyboard and mouse work?
 
 Check your iMac’s Bluetooth connection by moving the mouse; the 
cursor should move on your screen. To check the keyboard, press the 
Caps Lock key and observe whether the green Caps Lock light turns on 
and off.
If you do notice a problem with your iMac (and you can still use your Safari 
browser and reach the Web), you can make the connection to an Apple sup-
port technician at www.apple.com. If your iMac is lying on its back with its 
foot in the air and you can’t get to the Internet, you can check your phone 
book for a local Apple service center, or call the AppleCare toll-free number 
at 1-800-275-2273. Chapter 22 also offers troubleshooting information.
Harriet, It’s Already Asking 
Me Questions!
After your iMac is running and you’ve given it the once-over for obvious ship-
ping damage, your next chore is to set up your iMac. Unlike other tasks in 
this book, I won’t cover the setup process step by step. Apple “tweaks” the 
questions that you see during setup on a regular basis, and the questions are 
really very easy to answer. Everything is explained onscreen, complete with 
onscreen Help if you need it.
However, I do want you to know what to expect as well as what information 
you need to have at hand. I also want you to know about support opportuni-
ties, such as the AppleCare Protection Plan and the Apple MobileMe Internet 
services. Hence this section. Consider it a study guide for whatever your 
iMac’s setup procedure has to throw at you.
Setting up Mac OS X Snow Leopard
After you start your iMac for the first time — or if you just upgraded from an 
earlier version of Mac OS X — your iMac will likely automatically launch the 
Snow Leopard set-up procedure. (Note that some custom install options, like 
the Archive and Install option, might not launch the Setup procedure.) The 
set-up process takes care of a number of different tasks:

28
Part I: Know Your iMac 
 
✓ Setup provides Snow Leopard with your personal information.
 
 As I mention in Chapter 1, your iMac ships with a bathtub full of applica-
tions, and many of those use your personal data (like your address and 
telephone number) to automatically fill out your documents.
 
 If that personal stored information starts you worrying about identity 
theft, I congratulate you. If you’re using your common sense, it should. 
However, Apple doesn’t disseminate this information anywhere else, and 
the applications that use your personal data won’t send it anywhere, 
either. And the Safari Web browser fills out forms on a Web page auto-
matically only if you give your permission.
 
✓ Setup configures your language and keyboard choices.
 
 Mac OS X Snow Leopard is a truly international operating system, so 
Setup offers you a chance to configure your iMac to use a specific lan-
guage and keyboard layout.
 
✓ Setup configures your e-mail accounts within Apple Mail.
 
 If you already have an e-mail account set up with your Internet service 
provider (ISP), keep that e-mail account information that the ISP pro-
vided handy to answer these questions. (The list should include the 
incoming POP3/IMAP and outgoing SMTP mail servers you’ll be using, 
your e-mail address, and your login name and password. Don’t worry 
about those crazy acronyms — your ISP will know exactly what you 
mean when you ask for this information.) Snow Leopard can even auto-
matically configure many Web-based e-mail accounts for you (including 
Google Mail, Yahoo! Mail, and AOL Mail) if you supply your account ID 
and password. Sweet.
 
✓ Setup allows you to open a trial subscription with Apple’s MobileMe 
service.
 
 A MobileMe subscription service provides you with online file storage, 
iSync capability across multiple computers, backups to your online stor-
age, Apple e-mail accounts (through both Web mail and the Apple Mail 
application), and your own acre of Web site on the Internet. I go into all 
these in detail in Chapter 9. For now, just sign up and take the opportu-
nity to feel smug about owning an Apple computer.
 
✓ Setup sends your registration information to Apple.
 
 As a proud owner of an iMac, take advantage of the year of hardware 
warranty support and the free 90 days of telephone support. You have 
to register to use ’em, but rest assured that all this info is confidential.
 
✓ Setup launches Migration Assistant.
 
 This assistant guides you through the process of migrating (an engineer’s 
term for moving) your existing user data from your old Mac or PC to your 
new iMac. Naturally, if your iMac is your first computer, you can skip this 
step with a song in your heart! (Read more on Migration Assistant in the 
section, “Importing Documents and Data from Your Old Mac.”)

29
 Chapter 2: Life! Give My iMac Life!
Registering your iMac
I’ll be honest here: I know that many of us, myself included, don’t register 
every piece of computer hardware we buy. However, your iMac is a differ-
ent kettle of fish altogether, and I strongly recommend that you register your 
purchase with Apple during the setup process. You spent a fair amount of 
moolah on your computer, and it’s an investment with a significant number 
of moving parts.
Even the hardiest of techno-wizards would agree with this important Mark’s 
Maxim:
 
If you don’t register your iMac, you can’t receive support.
And rest assured that Apple is not one of those companies that constantly 
pesters you with e-mail advertisements and near-spam. I’ve registered every 
Apple computer I’ve owned, and I’ve never felt pestered. (And I have an 
extremely low tolerance for pester.)
Importing Documents and 
Data from Your Old Mac
If you’re upgrading from an older Mac running Mac OS X to your new iMac, I 
have great news for you: Apple includes the Migration Assistant utility appli-
cation that can help you copy (whoops, I mean, migrate) all sorts of data 
from your old Mac to your new machine. The list of stuff that gets copied 
over includes
 
✓ User accounts: If you set up multiple user accounts (so that more than 
one person can share the computer), the utility ports them all to your 
new iMac.
 
✓ Network settings: Boy, howdy, this is a real treat for those with manual 
network settings provided by an ISP or network administrator! Migration 
Assistant can re-create the entire network environment of your old Mac 
on your new iMac.
 
✓ System Preferences settings: If you’re a fan of tweaking and customiz-
ing Mac OS X to fit you like a glove, then rejoice. The Assistant actually 
copies over all the changes that you’ve made within System Preferences 
on your old Mac! (Insert sound of angelic chorus of cherubim and sera-
phim: Hallelujah!)
 
✓ Documents: The files in your Documents folder(s) are copied to your 
new iMac.

30
Part I: Know Your iMac 
 
✓ Applications: Migration Assistant tries its best to copy over the third-
party applications that you’ve installed in your Applications folder on the 
older Mac. I say tries its best because you might have to reinstall some 
applications, anyway. Some developers create applications that spread 
out all sorts of files across your hard drive, and the Assistant just can’t 
keep track of those nomadic files. Too, some other applications make the 
trek just fine, but you might have to reenter their serial numbers.
 
Setup launches its Migration Assistant automatically if you indicate that you 
need to transfer stuff during the Setup process, but you can always launch 
Migration Assistant manually at any time. You’ll find it in the Utilities folder 
inside your Applications folder; just double-click the Migration Assistant icon.
To use Migration Assistant to copy your system from your older Mac, you 
need either:
 
✓ a FireWire cable (compatible with most Macs made within the last five 
years or so) to connect the computers. If you don’t already have one, 
you can pick up a standard FireWire cable at your local Maze o’ Wires 
electronics store or at your computer store. (This cable will probably 
come in handy in the future as well, so it’s not a one-use wonder.)
 
 The latest crop of iMacs includes only a FireWire 800 port! If you’re 
upgrading from an older Mac that has only FireWire 400 ports, you’ll 
need a FireWire 800 cable and a 400-to-800 adapter, which you can typi-
cally get at any large computer store (or through Amazon, or through 
eBay).
 
✓ a wired or wireless network connection between the computers. If 
you’ve already hooked up your new iMac to your wired or wireless 
Ethernet network while using the Setup Assistant, then eschew the 
FireWire cable and click Use Network instead!
Follow these steps to use Migration Assistant:
 
1. Click Continue on the opening screen.
 
 Migration Assistant prompts you for your account name and password 
that you create during the Setup procedure, as shown in Figure 2-1. Your 
account is an admin account, meaning that you have a higher security 
level that allows you to change things within Snow Leopard. (Much more 
detail on user accounts is covered in Chapter 20.)
 
2. Type your account name and password and then click OK.
 
 Characters in your password are displayed as bullet characters for 
security. After you’ve successfully entered your admin account name 
and password, this dialog disappears and you get to play in the real 
Migration Assistant dialog.

 You can also restore your iMac’s data from a Time Machine backup 
drive, using Migration Assistant.
 
4. To use a FireWire connection, click Use FireWire and connect a 
FireWire cable between the two computers — to use a network con-
nection to transfer the data, click Use Network.
 
5. Click Continue.
 
 If you’re using a network connection, you can gleefully skip steps 6 and 7.
 
6. Restart your older Mac while holding down the T key.
 
 This restarts your older computer in FireWire Target Disk mode, in which 
your older Mac essentially becomes a huge external FireWire hard drive. 
(Neat trick.)
 
 You must hold down the T key until you see the FireWire symbol (which 
looks like a stylized Y) appear on your older machine.
 
7. Click Continue.
 
8. Select the check boxes next to the user accounts that you want to 
transfer from your older machine (as shown in Figure 2-2) and then 
click Continue.
 
 The Assistant displays how much space is required to hold the selected 
accounts on your iMac’s hard drive.
 
9. Select the check boxes next to the applications and files that you want 
to copy (see how in Figure 2-3) and then click Continue.

Importing Documents and 
Data from Windows
If you’re a classic Windows-to-Mac Switcher, you made a wise choice, espe-
cially if you’re interested in the creative applications within the iLife ’09 suite! 
Although you can choose to start your Apple computing life anew, you prob-
ably want to migrate some of your existing documents and files from that 
tired PC to your bright, shiny, new iMac.
Unfortunately, no Windows Migration Assistant exists within Mac OS X. 
However, if you’re moving from a Windows PC to an iMac, you can copy your 
files manually from a CD or DVD, from a USB Flash drive, or over a network. 
(Note, however, that the iMac doesn’t come with a floppy drive. And trust 
me, you wouldn’t want to use one to move anything that matters, anyway.)
 
The Mac OS X Help system contains an entire subsection on specific tricks 
that you can use when switching from Windows to Mac, including how to con-
nect to a Windows network and how to directly connect the two computers.
Because Snow Leopard can’t run Windows programs directly (at least, not 
without extra software), moving applications like Paint Shop Pro won’t 
do you any good. In general, however, you can move documents, movies, 
photos, and music without a problem. Table 2-1 illustrates what can be 
moved between Windows and Mac OS X as well as the application that you 
use in Snow Leopard to open those files and documents.

If you don’t mind investing around $40, try using the Move2Mac software util-
ity, which does most of the work of Migration Assistant for those switching 
from a Windows PC. From Detto Technologies (www.detto.com/move-2-
mac-overview.php), Move2Mac comes complete with a special USB-to-
USB cable that connects your two computers for high-speed copying. With 
Move2Mac, you can choose what you want to transfer to your new iMac (use 
Table 2-1 as a guide), and the copying is done automatically for you. Plus, 
Move2Mac also transfers goodies like your home page and bookmarks from 
Internet Explorer, desktop backgrounds, and even your Address Book con-
tacts and account settings from Outlook Express. Move2Mac makes switching 
much easier, and I can highly recommend it.
Switching from a PC to . . . an Apple PC?
With the Snow Leopard Boot Camp feature, you 
can actually create a full Windows XP, Vista or 
Windows 7 system on your Intel iMac. Yup, 
Windows and Snow Leopard coexist peace-
fully on the same computer. However, you have 
to reboot your computer to use your iMac as a 
Windows system.
This brings a whole new meaning to the term 
Switcher because some iMac owners are 
moving their stuff from Windows (running 
on their old PC) to . . . well, Windows (run-
ning on their new iMac) rather than Snow 
Leopard. If you do decide to create a Windows 
system on your iMac by using Boot Camp, the 
files and folders on your existing PC can be 
copied directly by using a good, old-fashioned 
Windows wizard.

Chapter 3
Introducing the Apple 
of Your iMac
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing Mac OS X Snow Leopard
▶ Appreciating the Unix core underneath Snow Leopard
▶ Recognizing similarities between Windows and Snow Leopard
▶ Getting help while exploring Snow Leopard
I
n the other books that I’ve written about Mac OS X Snow Leopard, I use all 
sorts of somewhat understated phrases to describe my operating system 
of choice, such as elegantly reliable, purely powerful, and supremely user 
friendly.
But why is Snow Leopard such a standout? To be specific, why do creative 
professionals and computer techno-wizards across the globe hunger for the 
very same Mac OS X that runs your iMac? Why is Snow Leopard so far ahead 
of Windows 7 in features and performance? Good questions, all!
In this chapter, I answer those queries and satisfy your curiosity about your 
new big cat. I introduce the main elements of the Snow Leopard Desktop, and 
I show you the fearless Unix heart that beats underneath Snow Leopard’s 
sleek exterior. I also point out the most important similarities between Snow 
Leopard and Windows 7, and I outline the resources available if you need 
help with Mac OS X.
Oh, and I promise to use honest-to-goodness English in my explanations, with 
a minimum of engineer-speak and indecipherable acronyms. (Hey, you’ve got 
to boast about Snow Leopard in turn to your family and friends. Aunt Harriet 
might not be as technologically savvy as we are.)

36
Part I: Know Your iMac 
A Quick Tour of the Premises
Snow Leopard is a special type of software called an operating system. You 
know, OS, as in Mac OS X? That means that Snow Leopard essentially runs 
your iMac and also allows you to run all your other applications, such as 
iTunes or Photoshop. It’s the most important computer application — or 
software — that you run.
 
Think of a pyramid, with Snow Leopard as the foundation and other applica-
tions running on top of it.
You’re using the OS when you aren’t running a specific application, such as 
these actions:
 
✓ Copying files from a CD to your hard drive
 
✓ Choosing a different screensaver
Sometimes, Snow Leopard even peeks through an application while it’s run-
ning. For example, actions like these are also controlled by Snow Leopard:
 
✓ The Open and Save As dialogs that you see when working with files in 
Photoshop
 
✓ The Print dialog that appears when you print a document in Microsoft 
Word
In this section, I escort you personally around the most important hotspots 
in Snow Leopard, and you meet the most interesting onscreen thingamabobs 
that you use to control your iMac. (I told you I wasn’t going to talk like an 
engineer!)
The Snow Leopard Desktop
This particular desktop isn’t made of wood, and you can’t stick your gum 
underneath. However, your Snow Leopard Desktop does indeed work much 
like the surface of a traditional desk. You can store things there, organize 
things into folders, and take care of important tasks like running other appli-
cations. Heck, you’ve even got a clock and a trash can.
Gaze upon Figure 3-1 and follow along as you venture to your Desktop and 
beyond.

Finder menu
Dock
Meet me at the Dock
The Dock is the closest thing to the dashboard of a car that you’re likely to 
find on a Macintosh. It’s a pretty versatile combination — it’s one part orga-
nizer, one part application launcher, and one part system monitor. From 
here, you can launch applications, see what’s running, and display or hide 
the application windows.
Each icon in the Dock represents one of the following:
 
✓ An application that you can run (or that is running)
 
✓ An application window that’s minimized (shrunk)
 
✓ A Web page
 
✓ A document or folder on your system
 
✓ A network server or shared folder
 
✓ Your Trash

38
Part I: Know Your iMac 
I cover the Dock in more detail in Chapter 5.
 
The Dock is highly configurable:
 
✓ It can appear at different sides of the screen.
 
✓ It can disappear until you move your mouse pointer to the edge to call it 
forth.
 
✓ You can resize it larger or smaller.
Dig those crazy icons
By default, Snow Leopard always displays at least one icon on your Desktop: 
your iMac’s internal hard drive. To open the hard drive and view or use the 
contents, you double-click the icon. Other icons that might appear on your 
Desktop can include
 
✓ CDs and DVDs
 
✓ An iPod
 
✓ External hard drives or USB Flash drives
 
✓ Applications, folders, and documents
 
✓ Files you downloaded from the Internet
 
✓ Network servers you access
Chapter 4 provides the good stuff on icons and their uses within Snow 
Leopard.
There’s no food on this menu
The Finder menu isn’t found in a restaurant. You find it at the top of the 
Desktop, where you can use it to control your applications. Virtually every 
application that you run on your iMac has a menu.
 
To use a menu command, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the menu title (like File or Edit).
 
2. Choose the desired command from the list that appears.
 
Virtually every Macintosh application has some menu titles, such as File, 
Edit, and Window. You’re likely to find similar commands under these titles. 
However, only two menu titles are in every Mac OS X application that displays 
a menu bar:
 
✓ The Apple menu (which is identified with that jaunty Apple Corporation 
icon, Ú).

39
 Chapter 3: Introducing the Apple of Your iMac
 
✓ The application menu (which always bears the name of the active appli-
cation). For instance, the DVD Player menu title appears when you run 
the Snow Leopard DVD Player, and the Word menu group appears when 
you launch Microsoft Word.
I cover these two common titles in more detail in Chapters 4 and 5.
 
You can also display a contextual menu — regular human beings call it a right-
click menu or shortcut menu — by right-clicking your Snow Leopard Desktop, 
or on an application, folder, or file icon. I discuss right-click menus in detail in 
Chapter 4.
There’s always room for one more window
You’re probably already familiar with the ubiquitous window itself. Both 
Snow Leopard and the applications that you run use windows to display 
things like
 
✓ The documents that you create
 
✓ The contents of your hard drive
Snow Leopard gives you access to the applications, documents, and folders 
on your system through Finder windows.
Windows are surprisingly configurable. I cover them at length in Chapter 4.
What’s going on underneath?
How the core is designed makes more of a difference than all the visual bells 
and whistles, which tend to be similar between Windows and Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard (and Linux as well, for that matter). Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
 
Sure, Snow Leopard’s elegant exterior is a joy to use, but Mac OS X is a 
better OS than Windows because of the unique Unix muscle that lies 
underneath!
So what should you and I look for in an OS? Keep in mind that today’s com-
puter techno-wizard demands three requirements for a truly high-powered 
software wonderland — and Mac OS X Snow Leopard easily meets all three:
 
✓ Reliability: Your OS has to stay up and running reliably for as long as 
necessary — I’m talking months here — without lockups or error mes-
sages. If an application crashes, the rest of your work should remain 
safe, and you should be able to shut down the offending software.

40
Part I: Know Your iMac 
 
✓ Performance: If your computer has advanced hardware, your OS must 
be able to use those resources to speed things up big-time. The OS has 
to be highly configurable, and it has to be updated often to keep up with 
the latest in computer hardware.
 
 “Mark, what do you mean by advanced hardware?” Well, if you’re 
already knowledgeable about state-of-the-art hardware, examples 
include
 
• True 64-bit computing
 
• Multiple processors (like more than one Intel chip in your com-
puter)
 
• A huge amount of RAM (16GB on the iMac, or far more on today’s 
Power Mac computers)
 
• Multiple hard drives used as a RAID array
 
 If all that sounds like ancient Sumerian, gleefully ignore this technical 
drabble and keep reading.
 
✓ Ease of use: All the speed and reliability in the world won’t help an OS if 
it’s difficult to use.
 
 DOS was the PC OS of choice before the arrival of Windows. It was 
doomed because it wasn’t intuitive or easy to master, requiring a PC 
owner to remember all sorts of commands that looked like hieroglyph-
ics. (This is one of the reasons why the Macintosh was so incredibly 
popular in the days of DOS-based PCs. Macs had a mouse, and they were 
a snap to master and use.)
Isn’t Windows 7 the latest thing?
You’ve seen highly customized “pocket rocket” 
compact cars with the flashy paint jobs, huge 
noisy mufflers, and aerodynamic fiberglass 
stuff. You might think that these cars are real 
road racers, but what’s underneath is differ-
ent. The 4-cylinder engine that you don’t see is 
completely stock. These cars don’t perform any 
better than a mundane model straight from the 
factory.
The same holds true for Microsoft Windows 7 — 
another attempt by the folks at Redmond to put 
a modern face on an antique OS. Forget the 
flashy colors and the visual effects: Windows 
7 is simply more of the same (at least it’s newer 
than Windows Vista, which was beginning to 
creak). Sure, it’s more reliable and faster than 
older versions of Windows, but there’s not 
a boatload of revolutionary features in 7 — 
instead, Microsoft focused on making Windows 
7 simpler to use. (Unfortunately, if you’re run-
ning PC hardware, the only other practical 
choice for a computing novice is Linux, which is 
still regarded as too complex by major manufac-
turers like Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Therefore, 
with a PC, you’re usually stuck with Windows 
Vista or Windows 7 — or you’ve picked up a 
very expensive paperweight.)

41
 Chapter 3: Introducing the Apple of Your iMac
Similarities with that Windows behemoth
You might have heard of the Windows Switcher: a uniquely intelligent species 
that’s becoming more and more common these days. Switchers are former 
PC owners who have abandoned Windows and bought a Macintosh, thereby 
joining the Apple faithful running Mac OS X. (Apple loves to document this 
migration on its Web site.) Because today’s Macintosh computers are signifi-
cantly faster than their PC counterparts — and you get neat software, such 
as Snow Leopard and the iLife suite when you buy a new Mac — switching 
makes perfect sense.
Switchers aren’t moving to totally unfamiliar waters. Windows Vista, 
Windows 7, and Snow Leopard share a number of important concepts. 
Familiarizing yourself with Snow Leopard takes far less time than you 
might think.
It’s Apple to the rescue!
Unix is the established, super-reliable OS that 
powers most of the high-performance servers 
that make up the Internet. Unix has built-in sup-
port for virtually every hardware device ever 
wrought by the hand of Man (including all the 
cool stuff that came with your iMac), and Unix 
is well designed and highly efficient.
Unfortunately, standard Unix looks as hideous 
as DOS, complete with a confusing command 
line, so ease-of-use for normal human beings 
like you and me goes out the door. Enter the 
genius types at Apple, who understood several 
years ago that all Unix needed was a state-of-
the-art, novice-friendly interface! To wit: Mac 
OS X was developed with a Unix foundation 
(or core), so it shares the same reliability and 
performance as Unix. However, the software 
engineers at Apple (who know a thing or two 
about ease-of-use) made it good-looking and 
easy to use.
This is the secret to the worldwide fever over 
Mac OS X: It blends the best of Unix with the 
best of earlier Macintosh operating systems like 
Mac OS 9. Mac OS X is not only easy to use, but 
it also runs tight, concentric sassy rings around 
anything that Microsoft has to offer today.
That’s as far as I delve into the foundation of 
Snow Leopard in this volume — understand-
ably. If you’re interested in all the details about 
what makes Mac OS X tick, as well as its set-
tings and features, I can heartily recommend 
another of my books, the bestselling (and 
extremely heavy) Mac OS X Snow Leopard 
All-in-One For Dummies (Wiley). It comprehen-
sively covers everything Snow Leopard — over 
700 pages devoted entirely to Mac OS X and its 
companion applications!

42
Part I: Know Your iMac 
Here’s an overview of the basic similarities between the two operating 
systems:
 
✓ The Desktop: The Snow Leopard Desktop is a neat representation of a 
real physical desktop, and Windows uses the same idea:
 
• You can arrange files, folders, and applications on your Desktop to 
help keep things handy.
 
• Application windows appear on the Desktop.
 
✓ Drives, files, and folders: Data is stored in files on your hard drive(s), 
and those files can be organized in folders. Both Snow Leopard and 
Windows use the same file/folder concept.
 
✓ Specific locations: Both Windows and Snow Leopard provide every 
user with a set of folders to help keep various types of files organized. 
For example, the My Videos folder that you can use in Windows XP cor-
responds to the Movies folder that you find in your Home folder within 
Snow Leopard.
 
✓ Running programs: Both Snow Leopard and Windows run programs (or 
applications) in the same manner:
 
• Double-clicking an application icon launches that application.
 
• Double-clicking a document runs the corresponding application 
and then automatically loads the document.
 
✓ Window control: Yep, both operating systems use windows, and those 
windows can be resized, hidden (or minimized), and closed in similar 
fashions. (Are you starting to see the connections here?)
 
✓ Drag-and-drop: One of the basics behind a GUI (a ridiculous acronym 
that stands for graphical user interface) like Windows and Snow Leopard 
is the ability to drag documents and folders around to move, delete, 
copy, and open them. Drag-and-drop is one of the primary advantages 
of both of these operating systems because copying a file by dragging 
it from one window to another is intuitive and easy enough for a kid to 
accomplish.
 
✓ Editing: Along the same lines as drag-and-drop, both Snow Leopard and 
Windows offer similar cut-and-paste editing features. You’ve likely used 
Cut, Copy, and Paste for years, so this is familiar stuff.
Calling for Help
You can call on these resources if you need additional help while you’re dis-
covering how to tame the Snow Leopard.

43
 Chapter 3: Introducing the Apple of Your iMac
 
Some of the help resources are located on the Internet, so your Web browser 
will come in handy.
The Snow Leopard built-in Help system
Sometimes the help you need is as close as the Help title on the menu. You 
can get help for either
 
✓ A specific application: Just click Help. Then, click in the Search box 
and type a short phrase that sums up your query (such as startup keys). 
You’ll see a list of help topics appear on the menu. Just click a topic to 
display more information.
 
✓ Actions and functions (topics): Click a Finder window and then click 
Help on the menubar. Again, you’ll see the Search box, and you can 
enter a word or phrase to find within the Help system. To display the 
Help viewer window, click the Mac Help item under the Search box.
The Apple Web-based support center
Apple has online product support areas for every hardware and software 
product that it manufactures. Visit www.apple.com and click the Support 
tab at the top of the Web page.
 
The Search box works just like the Mac OS Help system, but the Knowledge 
Base that Apple provides online has a lot more answers.
Magazines
Many magazines (both in print and online) offer tips and tricks on using and 
maintaining Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
 
My personal online favorites are Macworld (www.macworld.com) and 
MacAddict (www.maclife.com).
Mac support Web sites
A number of private individuals and groups offer support forums on the Web, 
and you can often find help from other Mac owners on these sites within a 
few hours of posting a question.

44
Part I: Know Your iMac 
 
I’m very fond of the CNET forum MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com), Mac OS X 
Hints (http://forums.macosxhints.com), and MacTech (http://
forums.mactech.com).
Mac newsgroups on Usenet
If you’re familiar with Usenet newsgroups, you can find lots of help (typically 
dispensed with a healthy dose of opinion) in newsgroups like comp.sys.
mac.system. Simply post a message and then check back within a few hours 
to read the replies.
Local Mac user groups
I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention your local Mac user group. Often, a user 
group maintains its own Web site and discussion forum. If you can wait until 
the next meeting, you can even ask your question and receive a reply from a 
real-live human being . . . quite a thrill in today’s Web-riffic world!

A
h, the Finder — many admire its scenic beauty, but don’t ignore its unsur-
passed power nor its many moods. And send a postcard while you’re there.
Okay, so Snow Leopard’s Finder might not be quite as majestic as the mighty 
Mississippi River, but it’s the basic toolbox that you use every single day while 
piloting your iMac. The Finder includes the most common elements of Mac OS X: 
window controls, common menu commands, icon fun (everything from launch-
ing applications to copying files), network connections, keyboard shortcuts, and 
even emptying the Trash. In fact, one could say that if you master the Finder and 
find how to use it efficiently, you’re on your way to becoming a power user! (My 
editor calls this the Finder “window of opportunity.” She’s a hoot.)
That’s what this chapter is designed to do: This is your Finder tour guide, 
and we’re ready to roll.
Working within the Finder
This is a hands-on tour, with none of that, “On your right, you’ll see the his-
toric Go menu” for you! Time to get off the bus and start the tour with Figure 
4-1, in which I show you around the most important elements of the Finder. 
(In the upcoming section, “Performing Tricks with Finder Windows,” I give 
you a close-up view of window controls.)

Icons
Dock
The popular attractions include
 
✓ The Apple menu (Ú): This is a special menu because it appears both 
in the Finder and within every application menu that you run. It doesn’t 
matter whether you’re in iTunes or Photoshop or Word: If you can see a 
menu bar, the Apple menu is there. The Apple menu contains common 
commands to use no matter where you are in Snow Leopard, such as 
Restart, Shut Down, and System Preferences.
 
✓ The Finder menu bar: Whenever the Finder is ready to use (or, in Mac-
speak, whenever the Finder is the active application, rather than another 
application), the Finder menu bar appears at the top of your screen. You 
know the Finder is active and ready when the word Finder appears at the 
left of the menu bar.
 
 If you’re brand new to computers, a menu is simply a list of commands. 
For example, you click the File menu and then choose Save to save a 
document. When you click a menu, it extends down so that you can see 
the commands it includes. While the menu is extended, you can choose 
any enabled menu item (just click it) to perform that action. You can tell 
that an item is enabled if its name appears in black. Conversely, a menu 
command is disabled if it is grayed out — clicking it does nothing.

49
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
 
 When you see a menu path, like this example — File➪Save — it’s just a 
visual shortcut that tells you to click the File menu and then choose 
Save from the drop-down menu that appears.
 
✓ The Desktop: Your Desktop serves the same purpose as your physical 
desktop: You can store stuff here (files, alias icons, and so on), and it’s 
a solid, stable surface where you can work comfortably. Application 
windows appear on the Desktop, for example, as do other applications, 
such as your Stickies notes and your DVD player. Just double-click an 
application there to launch it.
 
 You can easily customize your Desktop. For example, you can use your 
own images to decorate the Desktop, organize it to store new folders 
and documents, arrange icons how you like, or put the Dock in another 
location. Don’t worry — I cover all this in other areas of the book — I 
just want you to know that you don’t have to settle for what Apple gives 
you as a default Desktop.
 
✓ All sorts of icons: This is a Macintosh computer, after all, replete with 
tons of make-your-life-easier tools. Check out the plethora of icons on 
your Desktop as well as icons within the Finder window itself. Each 
icon is a shortcut to a file, folder, network connection, or device in your 
system, including applications that you run and documents that you 
create. Refer to Figure 4-1 to see the icon for my iMac’s hard drive icon, 
labeled Wolfgang. (I’m a huge Mozart fan.) Sometimes you click an icon 
to watch it do its thing (like icons in the Dock, which I cover next), but 
usually you double-click an icon to make something happen.
 
✓ The Dock: The Dock is a launching pad for your favorite applications, 
documents, folders, network connections, and Web sites. You can also 
refer to it to see what applications are running. Click an icon there to 
open the item. For example, the postage stamp icon represents the 
Apple Mail application, and clicking the spiffy compass icon launches 
your Safari Web browser.
 
✓ The Finder window: Finally! The basic Finder window in Figure 4-1 
displays the contents of my Utilities folder. You use Finder windows to 
launch applications; perform disk chores, such as copying and moving 
files; and navigate your hard drive.
Mousing in a Mac World
Snow Leopard takes a visual approach to everything, and what you see in 
Figure 4-1 is designed for point-and-click convenience. You click an item, it 
opens, you do your thing, and life is good. If you’ve grazed on the other side 
of the fence — one of Those Who Were Once Windows Users — you’re prob-
ably accustomed to using a mouse with at least two buttons. This brings up 
the nagging question: “Hey, Mark! Where the heck are my mouse buttons?”

50
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
In a nutshell, the buttons on your iMac’s Magic Mouse are the entire top of 
the mouse! Although you won’t see any separate buttons for right or left 
click, your Magic Mouse can tell when you tap with one finger (single-click) 
or two fingers (right-click).
 
To configure everything Magic Mouse — including all your buttons and your 
double-click/tracking/scrolling speeds — visit the Keyboard & Mouse pane 
within System Preferences. You can also configure your wireless mouse from 
here as well. (More on the System Preferences window in the next section.)
Clicking the right mouse button performs the same default function in Snow 
Leopard that it does in Windows. Namely, when you click the right mouse 
button on most items — icons, documents, even your Desktop — you get a 
contextual menu of things. That is, you get more commands specific to that 
item. (Boy, howdy, I hate that word contextual, but that’s what engineers call 
it. I call it the right-click menu, and I promise to refer to it as such for the rest 
of the book.)
Figure 4-2 illustrates a typical convenient right-click menu within a Finder 
window.

click menu.
 
Other mouse actions include
 
✓ Double-clicking. Tap twice with one finger to double-click.
 
✓ Scrolling. To move in any direction within a document window, just 
swipe your finger across the top of the mouse in that direction.
 
✓ Browse. Swipe two fingers across the top of the mouse to move back-
wards and forwards through pages in many applications (like Web pages 
in Safari or photos in your iPhoto library).

✓ Zooming. Hold down the Control key and scroll with one finger to zoom

Launching and Quitting for 
the Lazy iMac Owner
Now it’s time for you to pair your newly found mouse acumen with Snow 
Leopard’s Finder window. Follow along this simple exercise. Move your 
mouse cursor over the iTunes icon in the Dock (this icon looks like an audio 
CD with green musical notes on it) and click once. Whoosh! Snow Leopard 
launches (or starts) the iTunes application, and you see a window much like 
the one in Figure 4-3.
 
If an application icon is already selected (which I discuss in the next section), 
you can simply press Ô+O to launch it. The same key shortcut works with 
documents, too.

Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Besides the Dock, you have several other ways to launch an application or 
open a document in Snow Leopard:
 
✓ From the Apple menu (Ú): A number of different applications can 
always be launched anywhere within Snow Leopard from the Apple 
menu:
 
• System Preferences: This is where you change all sorts of settings, 
such as your display background and how icons appear.
 
• Software Update: This uses the Internet to see whether update 
patches are available for your Apple software, as I discuss in 
Chapter 24.
 
• Mac OS X Software: This launches the Safari browser and displays 
software that you can download for your iMac.
 
✓ From the Desktop: If you have a document that you created or an appli-
cation icon on your Desktop, you can launch or open it here by double-
clicking that icon (tapping the mouse with one finger twice in rapid 
succession when the mouse cursor is on top of the icon).
 
 Double-clicking a device or network connection on your Desktop opens 
the contents in a Finder window. This trick works for CDs and DVDs that 
you’ve loaded as well as for external hard drives and USB Flash drives. 
Applications and documents launch from a CD, a DVD, or an external 
drive just like they launch from your internal drive (the one that’s 
named Macintosh HD), so you don’t have to copy stuff from the exter-
nal drive just to use it. (You can’t change the contents of most CDs and 
DVDs; they’re read-only, so you can’t write to them.)
 
✓ From the Recent Items selection: When you click the Apple menu and 
hover your mouse over the Recent Items menu item, the Finder displays 
all the applications and documents that you used over the past few com-
puting sessions. Click an item in this list to launch or open it.
 
✓ From the Login Items list: Login Items are applications that Snow 
Leopard launches automatically each time you log in to your user 
account.
 
 I cover Login Items in detail in Chapter 20.
 
✓ From the Finder window: You can also double-click an icon within the 
confines of a Finder window to open it (for documents), launch it (for 
applications), or display the contents (for a folder).
 
The Quick Look feature can display the contents of just about any document 
or file — without actually opening the corresponding application! Sweet. To 
use Quick Look from a Finder window, click a file to select it and then click the 
Quick Look button (which bears an eye icon) on the Finder window toolbar, or 
just press the spacebar.

53
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
After you finish using an application, you can quit that application to close 
its window and return to the Desktop. Here are a number of different ways to 
quit an application:
 
✓ Press Ô+Q. This keyboard shortcut quits virtually every Macintosh 
application on the planet. Just first make sure that the application that 
you want to quit is active!
 
✓ Choose the Quit command from the application’s menu. To display 
the Quit command, click the application’s name — its menu — from the 
menu bar. This menu is always to the immediate right of the Apple (Ú) 
menu. For example, Safari displays a Safari menu, and that same spot 
in the menu is taken up by iCal when iCal is the active application. In 
Figure 4-3, look for the iTunes menu, right next to Ú.
 
✓ Choose Quit from the Dock. You can Control-click (or right-click) an 
application’s icon on the Dock and then choose Quit from the right-click 
menu that appears.
 
 A running application displays a small black triangle under its icons on 
the Dock.
 
✓ Click the Close button on the application window (refer to Figure 4-3). 
Some applications quit entirely when you close their window, like the 
System Preferences window or the Apple DVD Player. Other applications 
might continue running without any window, like Safari or iTunes; to 
close these applications, you have to use another method in this list.
 
✓ Choose Force Quit from the Apple menu. This is a last-resort 
measure! Use this only if an application has frozen and you can’t use 
another method in this list to quit. Force-quitting an application doesn’t 
save any changes to any open documents within that application!
Juggling Folders and Icons
Finder windows aren’t just for launching applications and opening the files 
and documents that you create. You can also use the icons within a Finder 
window to select one or more specific items or to copy and move items from 
place to place within your system.
A field observer’s guide to icons
Not all icons are created equal. Earlier in this chapter, I introduce you to your 
iMac’s hard drive icon on the Desktop, but here is a little background on the 
other types of icons that you might encounter during your iMac travels:

54
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
✓ Hardware: These are your storage devices (such as your hard drive 
and DVD drive) as well as external peripherals (such as your iPod and 
printer).
 
✓ Applications: These icons represent the applications (or programs) that 
you can launch. Most applications have a custom icon that incorporates 
the company’s logo or the specific application logo, so they’re very easy 
to recognize, as you can see in Figure 4-4. Double-clicking an applica-
tion usually doesn’t load a document automatically; you typically get a 
new blank document, or an Open dialog from which you can choose the 
existing file you want to open.
 
Figure 4-4: 
A collection 
of some of 
my favorite 
application 
icons.
 
 
✓ Documents: Many of the files on your hard drive are documents that can 
be opened within the corresponding application, and the icon usually 
looks similar to the application’s icon. Double-clicking a document auto-
matically launches the required application (that is, as long as Mac OS X 
recognizes the file format).
 
✓ Files: Most of the file icons on your system are mundane things (such as 
preference and settings files, text files, log files, and miscellaneous data 
files), yet most are identified with at least some type of recognizable 
icon that lets you guess what purpose the file serves. You also come 
across generic file icons that look like a blank sheet of paper (used when 
Snow Leopard has no earthly idea what the file format is).

55
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
 
✓ Aliases: An alias acts as a link to another item elsewhere on your 
system. For example, to launch Adobe Acrobat, you can click an Adobe 
Acrobat alias icon that you can create on your Desktop rather than click-
ing the actual Acrobat application icon. The alias essentially acts the 
same way as the original icon, but it doesn’t take up the same space — 
only a few bytes for the icon itself, compared with the size of the actual 
application. Plus, you don’t have to go digging through folders galore to 
find the original application icon. (Windows Switchers know an alias as a 
shortcut, and the idea is the same although Macs had it first. Harrumph.) 
You can always identify an alias by the small curved arrow at the base 
of the icon, and the icon might also sport the tag alias at the end of its 
name.
 
 You have three ways to create an alias. Here’s one:
 
a. Select the item. The following section has details about selecting 
icons.
 
b. Choose File➪Make Alias, or press Ô+L.
 
 Figure 4-5 illustrates a number of aliases, arranged next to their 
linked files.
 
Figure 4-5: 
No, not the 
famous 
girl-spy 
TV show. 
These are 
alias icons 
in Snow 
Leopard.
 

56
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
 Here’s another way to create an alias:
 
a. Hold down Ô+Option.
 
b. Drag the original icon to the location where you want the alias.
  
 Note that this funky method doesn’t add the alias tag to the end 
of the alias icon name (unless you drag it to another location in the 
same directory)!
 
 Another option for creating an alias is to right-click the original 
icon and choose Make Alias.
So why bother to use an alias? Two good reasons:
 
✓ Launch an application or open a document from anywhere on your 
drive. For example, you can start Pages directly from the folder where 
you store the documents for your current Pages project. Speed, organi-
zation, and convenience . . . life is good.
 
✓ Send an alias to the Trash without affecting the original item. When 
that Pages project is finished, you can safely delete the alias without 
worrying about deleting the actual application icon.
 
If you move or rename the original file, Snow Leopard is actually smart enough 
to update the alias, too! However, if the original file is deleted (or if the original 
is moved to a different volume, such as an external hard drive), the alias no 
longer works. (Go figure.)
Selecting items
Often, the menu commands or keyboard commands that you perform in the 
Finder need to be performed on something: Perhaps you’re moving an item 
to the Trash, or getting more information on the item, or creating an alias for 
that item. In order to identify the target of your action to the Finder, you need 
to select one or more items on your Desktop or in a Finder window. In this 
section, I show you just how to do that.
Selecting one thing
Snow Leopard gives you a couple of options when selecting just one item for 
an upcoming action:
 
✓ Move your mouse pointer over the item and click. A dark border (or 
highlight) appears around the icon, indicating that it’s selected.
 
✓ If an icon is already highlighted on your Desktop or within a window, 
move the selection highlight to another icon in the same location by 
using the arrow keys. To shift the selection highlight alphabetically, 
press Tab (to move in order) or press Shift+Tab (to move in reverse 
order).

57
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
 
Selecting items in the Finder doesn’t actually do anything to them by itself. 
You have to perform an action on the selected items to make something 
happen.
Selecting a whole bunch of things
You can also select multiple items with aplomb by using one of these 
methods:
 
✓ Adjacent items
 
• Drag a box around them. If that sounds like ancient Sumerian, 
here’s the explanation: Click a spot above and to the left of the first 
item; then hold down your finger on the surface of the mouse and 
drag the mouse down and to the right. (This is dragging in Mac-
speak.) A box outline like the one in Figure 4-6 appears, indicating 
what you’re selecting. Any icons that touch or appear within the 
box outline are selected when you release the mouse button.
 
• Click the first item to select it and then hold down the Shift key while 
you click the last item. Snow Leopard selects both items and every-
thing between them.
 
✓ Nonadjacent items: Select these by holding down the Ô key while you 
click each item.
 
Figure 4-6: 
Drag a box 
around 
icons to 
select them.
 

58
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
Check out the status line at the bottom of a Finder window. It tells you how 
much space is available on the drive you’re working in as well as how many 
items are displayed in the current Finder window. When you select items, it 
shows you how many you highlighted.
Copying items
Want to copy items from one Finder window to another, or from one location 
(like a CD) to another (like your Desktop)? Très easy. Just use one of these 
methods:
 
✓ On the same drive
 
• To copy one item to another location: Hold down the Option key 
(you don’t have to select the icon first) and then click and drag the 
item from its current home to the new location.
 
 To put a copy of an item within a folder, just drop the item on top 
of the receiving folder. If you hold the item that you’re dragging 
over the destination folder for a second or two, Snow Leopard 
opens up a new window so you can see the contents of the target.
 
• To copy multiple items to another location: Select them all first (see 
the earlier section, “Selecting a whole bunch of things”), hold down 
the Option key and then drag and drop one of the selected items 
where you want it. All the items that you selected follow the item 
you drag. (Rather like lemmings. Nice touch, don’t you think?)
 
 To help indicate your target when you’re copying files, Snow Leopard 
highlights the location to show you where the items will end up. (This 
works whether the target location is a folder or a drive icon.) If the 
target location is a window, Snow Leopard adds a highlight to the 
window border.
 
✓ On a different drive
 
• To copy one or multiple items: Click and drag the icon (or the 
selected items if you have more than one) from the original 
window to a window you open on the target drive. (No need to 
hold down the Option key whilst moving.) You can also drag one 
item (or a selected group of items) and simply drop the items on 
top of the drive icon on your Desktop.
 
 The items are copied to the top level, or root, of the target drive.
If you try to move or copy something to a location that already has an item 
with the same name, Figure 4-7 illustrates the answer: You get a dialog that 
prompts you to decide whether to replace the file or to stop the copy/move 
procedure and leave the existing file alone. Good insurance, indeed.

59
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
 
Figure 4-7: 
Replace 
the existing 
file only if 
you’re sure.
 
Moving things from place to place
Moving things from one location to another location on the same drive is the 
easiest action you can take. Just drag the item (or selected items) to the new 
location. The item disappears from the original spot and reappears in the 
new spot.
Duplicating in a jiffy
If you need more than one copy of the same item within a folder, use the 
Snow Leopard Duplicate command. I use Duplicate often when I want to edit 
a document but ensure that the original document stays pristine, no matter 
what. I just create a duplicate and edit that file instead.
To use Duplicate, you can
 
✓ Click an item to select it and then choose File➪Duplicate.
 
✓ Right-click the item and choose Duplicate from the menu.
 
✓ Hold down the Option key and drag the original item to another spot 
in the same window. When you release the mouse button, the duplicate 
file appears like magic!

60
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
The duplicate item has the word copy appended to its name. A second copy 
is named copy2, a third is copy3, and so on.
 
Duplicating a folder also duplicates all the contents of that folder, so creat-
ing a duplicate folder can take some time to create if the original folder was 
stuffed full. The duplicate folder has copy appended to its name, but the con-
tents of the duplicate folder keep their original names.
Keys and Keyboard Shortcuts 
to Fame and Fortune
Your iMac keyboard might not be as glamorous as your mouse, but any 
Macintosh power user will tell you that using keyboard shortcuts is usually 
the fastest method of performing certain tasks in the Finder, such as saving 
or closing a file. I recommend committing these shortcuts to memory and 
putting them to work as soon as you begin using your iMac so that they 
become second nature to you as quickly as possible.
Special keys on the keyboard
The Apple standard keyboard has a number of special keys that you might not 
recognize — especially if you’ve made the smart move and decided to migrate 
from the chaos that is Windows to Mac OS X! Table 4-1 lists the keys that bear 
strange hieroglyphics on the Apple keyboard as well as whatÍ they do.

Using Finder and application 
keyboard shortcuts
The Finder is chock-full of keyboard shortcuts that you can use to take care 
of common tasks. Some of the handiest shortcuts are included in the online 
Cheat Sheet for this book, which you’ll find at 
http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/imac-for-dummies-
cheat-sheet.html
 
But wait, there’s more! Most of your applications also provide their own set 
of keyboard shortcuts. While you’re working with a new application, display 
the application’s Help file and print out a copy of the keyboard shortcuts as a 
handy cheat sheet.
 
If you’ve used a PC before, you’re certainly familiar with three-key shortcuts — 
the most infamous being Ctrl+Alt+Delete, the beloved shut-down shortcut 
nicknamed the Windows Three-Finger Salute. Three-key shortcuts work the 
same way in Snow Leopard (but you’ll be thrilled to know you won’t need to 
reboot your iMac using that notorious Windows shortcut)! If you’re new to 
computing, just hold down the first two keys simultaneously and then press 
the third key.
 
You’re not limited to just the keyboard shortcuts listed previously, either. 
Within System Preferences, visit the Keyboard pane and click on the Keyboard 
Shortcuts button to change an existing shortcut or add another.
Performing Tricks with Finder Windows
In this section of your introduction to Mac OS X, I describe basic windows 
management within Snow Leopard: how to move things around, how to close 
windows, and how to make ’em disappear and reappear like magic.
Scrolling in and resizing windows
Can you imagine what life would be like if you couldn’t see more than a single 
window’s worth of stuff? Shopping would be curtailed quite a bit — and so 
would the contents of the folders on your hard drives!

62
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
That’s why Snow Leopard adds scroll bars that you can click and drag to 
move through the contents of the window. You can either
 
✓ Click the scroll bar and drag it.
 
✓ Click anywhere in the empty area above or below the bar to scroll pages 
one at a time.
 
✓ Hold down the Option key and click anywhere in the empty area above 
or below the bar to scroll to that spot in the window.
 
Of course, you can also scroll by moving one finger on your Magic Mouse 
in the desired direction (both vertically and horizontally). To set the scroll 
wheel’s behavior, open System Preferences and click the Mouse pane.
Figure 4-8 illustrates both vertical and horizontal scroll bars in a typical 
Finder window.

 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
 
Often, pressing your Page Up and Page Down keys moves you through a docu-
ment one page at a time. Also, pressing your arrow keys moves your insertion 
cursor one line or one character in the four compass directions.
You can also resize most Finder and application windows by enlarging or 
reducing the window frame itself. Move your mouse pointer over the Resize 
handle in the lower-right corner of the window (which smartly bears a 
number of slashed lines to help it stand out) and then drag the handle in any 
direction until the window is the precise size you need.
Minimizing and restoring windows
Resizing a window is indeed helpful, but maybe you simply want to banish 
the doggone thing until you need it again. That’s a situation for the Minimize 
button, which also appears in Figure 4-8. A minimized window disappears 
from the Desktop but isn’t closed: It simply reappears in the Dock as a min-
iature icon. Minimizing a window is easy: Move your mouse pointer over the 
Minimize button at the top-left corner of the window — a minus sign appears 
in the button to tell you that you’re on target — and then click.
 
Hold down the Shift key whilst you minimize, and prepare to be amazed when 
the window shrinks in slow motion like Alice in Wonderland!
To restore the window to its full size again (and its original position on the 
Desktop), just click its window icon on the Dock.
Only one can be active at once
Yes, here’s a very special Mark’s Maxim in the 
Mac OS X universe.
 Only one application window can be active in 
Snow Leopard at any time.
You can always tell which window is active:
 ✓ The active window is on top of other 
windows.
 
 Tip: You can still use a window’s Close, 
Minimize, and Zoom buttons when it’s 
inactive.
 ✓ Any input you make by typing or by moving 
your mouse appears in the active window.
 ✓ Mac OS X dims inactive windows that you 
haven’t minimized.

64
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Moving and zooming windows
Perhaps you want to move a window to another location on the Desktop so 
you can see the contents of multiple windows at the same time. Click the 
window’s title bar (that’s the top frame of the window, which usually includes 
a document or application name) and drag the window anywhere you like. 
Then release the mouse button. (Don’t click the icon in the center of the title 
bar, though. You won’t move the window, just the icon itself.)
 
Many applications can automatically arrange multiple windows for you. 
Choose Window➪Arrange All menu item (if it appears).
To see all that a window can show you, use the Zoom feature to expand any 
Finder or application window to its maximum practical size. Note that a 
zoomed window can fill the entire screen, or (if that extra space isn’t appli-
cable for the application) the window might expand only to a larger part of 
the Desktop. To zoom a window, move your mouse pointer over the button 
(as shown in the earlier Figure 4-8) at the top-left corner of the window. When 
the plus sign appears in the Zoom button, click to claim the additional terri-
tory on your Desktop. (You can click the Zoom button again to automatically 
return the same window to its original dimensions.)
Closing windows
When you’re finished with an application or no longer need a window open, 
move your mouse pointer over the Close button at the top-left corner of the 
window. When the X appears in the button, click it. (And yes, I can get one 
more reference out of Figure 4-8, which I’m thinking of nominating as Figure 
of the Year.)
 
If you have more than one window open in the same application and you want 
to close ’em all in one swoop, hold down the Option key whilst you click the 
Close button in any of the windows.
 
If you haven’t saved a document and you try to close that application’s 
window, Snow Leopard gets downright surly and prompts you for confirma-
tion. “Hey, human, you don’t really want to do this, do you?” If you answer 
in the affirmative — “Why, yes, machine. Yes, indeed, I do want to throw this 
away and not save it.” — the application discards the document that you were 
working on. If you decide to keep your document (thereby saving your poste-
rior from harm), you can either save the document under the same filename 
or under a new name.

65
 Chapter 4: Opening and Closing and Clicking and Such
Toggling toolbars the Snow Leopard way
Time to define a window control that’s actually 
inside the window for a change. A toolbar is a 
strip of icons that appears under the window’s 
title bar. These icons typically perform the most 
common actions within an application; the 
effect is the same as if you use a menu or press 
a keyboard shortcut. Toolbars are very popu-
lar these days. You see ’em within everything 
from the Finder window to most application 
windows.
You can banish a window’s toolbar to make 
extra room for icons, documents, or whatever 
it happens to be holding. Just click the little loz-
enge-shaped button at the right corner of the 
window. (You guessed it — the Toolbar button 
is also shown in Figure 4-8.) Note: If you toggle 
the Finder toolbar off, you also lose the Finder 
window Sidebar.

W
hen you’re no longer a novice to Snow Leopard and the basics of the 
Finder, turn your attention to a number of more advanced topics ’n 
tricks to turn you into an iMac power user — which, after all, is the goal of 
every civilized consciousness on Planet Earth.
Consider this chapter a grab bag of Snow Leopard knowledge. Sure, I jump 
around a little, but these topics are indeed connected by a common thread: 
They’re all surefire problem-solvers and speeder-uppers. (I can’t believe the 
latter is really a word, but evidently it is. My editors told me so.)
Home, Sweet Home Folder
Each user account that you create within Snow Leopard is actually a self-
contained universe. For example, each user has a number of unique character-
istics and folders devoted just to that person, and Snow Leopard keeps track of 
everything that a user changes or creates. (In Chapter 20, I describe the innate 
loveliness of multiple users living in peace and harmony on your iMac.)
This unique universe includes a different system of folders for each user 
account on your system. The top-level folder uses the short name that Snow 
Leopard assigns when that user account is created. Naturally, the actual 
folder name is different for each person, so Mac techno-types typically refer 
to this folder as your Home folder.

68
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Each account’s Home folder contains a set of subfolders, including
 
✓ Movies
 
✓ Music
 
✓ Pictures
 
✓ Downloads (for files you download via Safari)
 
✓ Sites (for Web pages created by the user)
 
✓ Documents (created by the user)
Although you can store your stuff at the root (top level) of your hard drive, 
that gaggle of files, folders, and aliases can get very crowded and confusing 
very quickly. Here’s a Mark’s Maxim to live by:
 
Your Home folder is where you hang out and where you store your stuff. 
Use it to make your computing life much easier!
 
Create subfolders within your Documents folder to organize your files 
and folders even further. For example, I always create a subfolder in my 
Documents folder for every book that I write so that I can quickly and easily 
locate all the documents and files associated with that book project.
I discuss security within your Home folder and what gets stored where in 
Chapter 20. For now, Figure 5-1 shows how convenient your Home folder is 
to reach because it appears in the Finder window Sidebar. One click of your 
Home folder and all your stuff is in easy reach.
In addition to the Finder window Sidebar, you can also reach your Home 
folder in other convenient ways:
 
✓ From the Go menu: Choose Go➪Home to display your Home folder 
immediately from the Finder window. Alternatively, you can press 
Ô+Shift+H to accomplish the same thing.
 
✓ From within Open and Save dialogs: Snow Leopard’s standard File 
Open and File Save dialogs also include the same Home folder (and sub-
folder) icons as the Finder window Sidebar.
 
✓ Within any new Finder window you open: If you like, you can set every 
Finder window that you open to open automatically within your Home folder.
 
a. Choose Finder➪Preferences to display the dialog that you see in 
Figure 5-2.
 
b. Click the arrow button at the right side of the New Finder Windows 
Open pop-up menu.
 
 A menu pops up (hence, the name).

d. Click the Close button at the top-left corner of the dialog.
 
 You’re set to go. From now on, every Finder window you open dis-
plays your Home folder as the starting location!
 
Here’s another reason to use your Home folder to store your stuff: Snow 
Leopard expects your stuff to be there when you migrate your files from an 
older Mac to a new Mac.
Arranging Your Desktop
Most folks put all their documents, pictures, and videos on their Snow 
Leopard Desktop because the file icons are easy to locate! Your computing 
stuff is right in front of you . . . or is it?
Call me a finicky, stubborn fussbudget — go ahead, I don’t mind — but I 
prefer a clean Snow Leopard Desktop without all the iconic clutter. In fact, 
my Desktop usually has just three or four icons even though I use my iMac 
several hours every day. It’s an organizational thing; I work with literally hun-
dreds of applications, documents, and assorted knickknacks daily. Sooner or 
later, you’ll find that you’re using that many, too. When you keep your stuff 
crammed on your Desktop, you end up having to scan your screen for one 
particular file, an alias, or a particular type of icon, which ends up taking you 
more time to locate it on your Desktop than in your Documents folder!
Plus, you’ll likely find yourself looking at old icons that no longer mean 
anything to you or stuff that’s covered in cobwebs that you haven’t used in 
years. Stale icons . . . yuck.
I recommend that you arrange your Desktop so you see only a couple of 
icons for the files or documents that you use the most. Leave the rest of the 
Desktop for that cool image of your favorite actor or actress.
Besides keeping things clean, I can recommend a number of other favorite 
tweaks that you can make to your Desktop:
 
✓ Keep Desktop icons arranged as you like.
 
a. From the Finder menu, choose View➪Show View Options.
 
b. Select the Arrange By check box.
 
c. From the pop-up menu, choose the criteria that Snow Leopard uses to 
automatically arrange your Desktop icons, including the item name, 
the last modification date, or the size of the items.
 
 I personally like things organized by name.

71
 Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun
 
✓ Choose a favorite background.
 
a. Tap two fingers on the surface of your Magic Mouse over any open 
spot on your Desktop. (Or, if you use an older pointing thing with a 
right mouse button, click that instead.)
 
b. From the right-click menu that appears, choose Change Desktop 
Background.
 
 You see the Desktop & Screen Saver pane appear, as shown in 
Figure 5-3. Browse through the various folders of background 
images that Apple provides or use an image from your iPhoto 
library.
 
✓ Display all the peripherals and network connections on your system.
 
a. Choose Finder➪Preferences.
 
b. Make sure that all four of the top check boxes (Hard Disks; External 
Disks; CDs, DVDs, and iPods; and Connected Servers) are enabled.
 
 Any external networks, hard drives, or devices to which you’re 
connected show up on your Desktop. You can double-click the 
Desktop icon to view your external stuff.

Putting the Dock to the Test
If the Dock seems like a nifty contraption to you, you’re right again — it’s like 
one of those big control rooms that NASA uses. From the Dock — that icon 
toolbar at the bottom of Snow Leopard’s Desktop — you can launch an appli-
cation, monitor what’s running, and even use the pop-up menu commands 
to control the applications that you launch. (Hey, that NASA analogy is even 
better than I thought!)
 
By default, the Dock hangs out at the bottom of your screen, but you can 
move it to another edge, change the size of the icons, or even hide it until it’s 
necessary. (You can find more details on customizing the Dock using System 
Preferences in Chapter 6.)
When you launch an application — either by clicking an icon on the Dock 
or by double-clicking an icon in a Finder window or the Desktop — the icon 
begins to bounce hilariously on the Dock to indicate that the application 
is loading. (So much for my Mission Control analogy.) After an application 
is running, the application icon appears on the Dock with a shiny blue dot 
underneath. Thusly, you can easily see what’s running at any time just by 
glancing at the Dock.
 
You can hide most applications by pressing Ô+H. Although the application 
itself is still running, it might not appear on the Dock.
 
Some applications run in the background — that is, they don’t show up on 
the Dock. You generally don’t even know that these applications are working 
for you. However, if you need to see in detail what’s going on, you can always 
use the Activity Monitor utility to view everything that’s happening on your 
iMac. (For example, an Apple support technician might ask you to run Activity 
Monitor to help troubleshoot a problem.) To run the Activity Monitor
 
1. Open a Finder window.
 
2. Click the Applications folder in the Sidebar.
 
3. Double-click the Utilities folder to open it.
 
4. Double-click the Activity Monitor icon.
Adding Dock icons
Ah, but there’s more: The Dock can offer more than just a set of default icons! 
You can add your own MIS (or Most Important Stuff) to the Dock, making it 
the most convenient method of taking care of business without cluttering up 
your Desktop. You can add

73
 Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun
 
✓ Applications: Add any application to your Dock by dragging the applica-
tion icon into the area to the left of the separator line (the vertical dotted 
line on the Dock which appears between applications and folders or 
documents). The existing Dock icons move aside so that you can place 
the new neighbor in a choice location.
 
 Do not try to add an application anywhere to the right of the separator 
line. You can’t put applications there — and Snow Leopard might even 
think that you want the application dumped in the Trash!
 
✓ Folders: Here’s where you want to add things to the area to the right of 
the separator line. A folder or volume icon that you drag to the Dock is 
called a Stack in Snow Leopard, and you can display the contents with a 
single click. (The contents of the folder “fan out” into a half-circle or grid 
arrangement, depending on the number of items in the folder. In fact, if 
you have enough items in the Stack, scroll bars will appear.) To open or 
launch an item, just click it in the Stack display.
 
 Snow Leopard already includes two Stacks in the Dock by default: your 
Documents folder and your Downloads folder.
 
✓ Web URLs: Sure, you can add your favorite Web site from Safari! Drag it 
right from the Safari Address bar into the area to the right of the separa-
tor line. When you click the URL icon, Safari opens the page automatically.
Removing Dock icons
You can remove an icon from the Dock at any time (as long as the application 
isn’t running). In fact, I always recommend that every Snow Leopard user 
remove the default icons that never get used to make more room available 
for your favorite icons. The only two icons you can’t remove are the Finder 
and the Trash icons. To remove an icon from the Dock, just click and drag 
it off the Dock. You’re rewarded with a ridiculous puff of smoke straight out 
of a Warner Brothers cartoon! (One of the Mac OS X developers was in a fun 
mood, I guess.)
 
When you delete an icon from the Dock, all you delete is the Dock icon: The 
original application, folder, or volume is not deleted.
Using Dock icon menus
From the Dock menu, you can open documents, open the location in a Finder 
window, set an application as a Login Item, control the features in some 
applications, and other assorted fun, depending on the item.

74
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
To display the right-click Dock menu for an icon
 
1. Move your mouse over the icon.
 
2. Right-click.
 
 Note that you can also press the Control key and click the icon, or even 
hold down the left mouse button for a second or two.
 
I cover the Dock settings that you can change within System Preferences in 
Chapter 6. You can also change the same settings from the Apple menu if you 
hover your mouse over the Dock item, which displays a submenu with the 
settings.
What’s with the Trash?
Another sign of an iMac power user is a well-maintained Trash bin. It’s a 
breeze to empty the discarded items you no longer need, and you can even 
rescue something that you suddenly discover you still need!
The Snow Leopard Trash bin resides on the Dock, and it works just like the 
Trash has always worked in Mac OS X: Simply drag selected items to the 
Trash to delete them.
 
Note one very important exception: If you drag an external device or remov-
able media drive icon on your Desktop to the Trash (such as an iPod, iPhone, 
DVD, or an external hard drive), the Trash bin icon automagically turns into a 
giant Eject icon, and the removable device or media is ejected or shut down — 
not erased. Repeat, not erased. (That’s why the Trash icon changes to the 
Eject icon — to remind you that you’re not doing anything destructive.)
Here are other methods of chunking items you select to go to the wastebasket:
 
✓ Choose File➪Move to Trash.
 
✓ Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and choose Move to Trash 
from the list that appears.
 
✓ Press Ô+Delete.
 
✓ Right-click the item and choose Move to Trash from the right-click 
menu.
You can always tell when the Trash contains at least one item because the 
basket icon is full of crumpled paper! However, you don’t have to unfold a 
wad of paper to see what the Trash holds: Just click the Trash icon on the 

75
 Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun
Dock to display the contents of the Trash. To rescue something from the 
Trash, drag the item(s) from the Trash folder to the Desktop or to any other 
folder in a Finder window. (If you’re doing this for someone else who’s not 
familiar with Snow Leopard, remember to act like it was a lot of work, and 
you’ll earn big-time DRP, or Data Rescue Points.)
When you’re sure that you want to permanently delete the contents of the 
Trash, use one of these methods to empty the Trash:
 
✓ Choose Finder➪Empty Trash.
 
✓ Choose Finder➪Secure Empty Trash.
 
 If security is an issue around your iMac and you want to make sure that 
no one can recover the files you’ve sent to the Trash, using the Secure 
Empty Trash command takes a little time but helps to ensure that no 
third-party hard drive repair or recovery program could resuscitate the 
items you discard.
 
✓ Press Ô+Shift+Delete.
 
✓ Right-click the Trash icon on the Dock and then choose Empty Trash 
from the right-click menu.
Working Magic with Dashboard, Exposé, 
and Spaces
iMac power users tend to wax enthusiastic over the convenience features 
built into Snow Leopard. In fact, we show ’em off to our PC-saddled friends 
and family. Three of the features that I’ve demonstrated the most to others 
are Snow Leopard’s Dashboard display, the Spaces Desktop manager, and the 
amazing convenience of Exposé. In this section, I show ’em off to you as well. 
(Then you can become the Snow Leopard evangelist on your block.)
Using Dashboard
The idea behind Dashboard is deceptively simple yet about as revolutionary 
as it gets for a mainstream personal computer operating system. Dashboard 
is an alternate Desktop that you can display at any time by using the key-
board or your mouse; the Dashboard desktop holds widgets (small applica-
tions that each provides a single function). Examples of default widgets that 
come with Snow Leopard include a calculator, a world clock, weather dis-
play, and a dictionary/thesaurus.

76
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Oh, did I mention that you’re not limited to the widgets that come with Snow 
Leopard? Simply click the plus button at the bottom of the Dashboard dis-
play and drag new widgets to your Dashboard from the menu at the bottom 
of the screen. To remove a widget while you’re in this mode, click the X icon 
that appears next to each widget. When you’re done with your widgets — 
that sounds a bit strange, but I mean no offense — press the Dashboard key 
again to return to your Desktop.
 
Widgets can also be rearranged any way you like by dragging them to a new 
location.
Simple applications like these are no big whoop. After all, Mac OS X has 
always had a calculator and a clock. What’s revolutionary is how you access 
your widgets. You can display and use them anywhere in Snow Leopard, 
at any time, by simply pressing the Dashboard key. The default key is 
F4 although you can change the Dashboard key via the Exposé & Spaces 
pane within System Preferences (or even turn it into a key sequence, like 
Option+F4). You can also click the Dashboard icon on the Dock to summon 
your Dashboard widgets and then banish the Dashboard when you’re done.
A WebClip widget can include text, graphics, and links, which Dashboard 
updates every time you display your widgets. Think about that for a second: 
Dynamic displays, such as weather maps, cartoons, and even the Free Music 
Download image from the iTunes Store are all good sources of WebClip wid-
gets! (That last one is a real timesaver.)
Follow these steps to create a new WebClip Dashboard widget from your 
favorite Web site:
 
1. Run Safari and navigate to the site you want to view as a widget.
 
2. Click the Open This Page in Dashboard button on the Safari Toolbar, 
which bears a pair of scissors and a dotted box.
 
3. Select the portion of the page you want to include in your widget.
 
 Most Web pages use frames to organize and separate sections of a page, 
so this step allows you to choose the frame with the desired content.
 
4. Drag the handles at the edges of the selection border to resize your 
widget frame to the right size and then click Add.
 
 Bam! Snow Leopard displays your new WebClip widget within 
Dashboard.
When you click a link in a WebClip widget, Dashboard loads the full Web page 
in Safari, so you can even use WebClips for surfing chores with sites you visit 
often.

Switching between apps with Exposé
In Chapter 4, you can read about using the Ô+Tab keyboard shortcut to 
switch between your open applications. If you’ve moved to the iMac from a 
PC running Windows, you might think this simple shortcut is all there is to it. 
Ah, dear reader, you’re in Snow Leopard territory now!
Exposé is a rather racy-sounding feature, but (like Dashboard) it’s really all 
about convenience. If you typically run a large number of applications at the 
same time, Exposé can be a real timesaver, allowing you to quickly switch 
among a forest of different application windows (or display your Desktop 
instantly without those very same windows in the way). The feature works in 
three ways:
 
✓ Press the All Windows key (or key sequence) to display all your 
application windows on a single screen, as shown in the truly cool 
Figure 5-4. (By default, F3 is the All Windows key.)
 
Figure 5-4: 
With 
Exposé, 
you can 
instantly see 
every open 
application 
window.
 

78
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
 Then just click the window that you want to make active.
 
✓ Press the Application Windows key (or key sequence) to display all 
the windows that have been opened by the active application. (By 
default, Ctrl+F3 is the Application Windows key sequence.)
 
 This comes in handy with those mega-applications, such as Photoshop 
Elements or FileMaker Pro, in which you often have three or four win-
dows open at one time. Again, you can click the window that you want 
to make active.
 
✓ Press the Desktop key (or key sequence) to move all your application 
and Finder windows to the sides of your Desktop so you can access 
your Desktop icons. (The default Desktop key sequence is Ô+F3.)
 
 After you’re done with your Desktop and you want to restore your win-
dows to their original locations, press Ô+F3 again to put things back.
Switching between desktops with Spaces
Ah, but what if you want to switch to an entirely different set of applica-
tions? For example, suppose that you’re slaving away at your pixel-pushing 
job, designing a magazine cover with Pages. Your page design desktop also 
includes Photoshop and Aperture, which you switch between often using one 
of the techniques I just described. Suddenly, however, you realize you need 
to schedule a meeting with others in your office using iCal, and you also want 
to check your e-mail in Apple Mail. What to do?
Well, you could certainly launch those two applications on top of your graph-
ics applications, and then minimize or close them. With Snow Leopard’s 
Spaces feature, though, you can press the Control+← or Control+→ sequences 
to switch to a completely different “communications” desktop, with iCal and 
Apple Mail windows already open and in your favorite positions! Figure 5-5 
illustrates the Spaces screen, showing two available desktops.
After you’re done setting up your meeting and answering any important 
e-mail, simply press Control+← or Control+→ again to switch back to your 
“graphics” desktop, where all your work is exactly as you left it!
Now imagine that you’ve also created a custom “music” desktop for 
GarageBand and iTunes . . . or perhaps you joined iWeb, Safari, and iPhoto as 
a “Webmaster” desktop. See why everyone’s so excited?
Unlike Exposé, Spaces has to be enabled and configured before you can use 
it. You can create new desktops, customize your desktops, and even choose 
a different set of key sequences to activate Spaces from within System 
Preferences. For the complete story on configuring Spaces, see Chapter 6.

79
 Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun
 
Figure 5-5: 
With 
Spaces, 
you can 
instantly

between 
multiple 
desktops!
 
 
You can activate Exposé, Spaces, and Dashboard by using your mouse instead 
of the keyboard:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Exposé & Spaces icon to display the settings.
 
3. Click the desired Screen Corner pop-up menu to choose what function 
that screen corner will trigger.
 
4. Press Ô+Q to save your changes and then exit System Preferences.
 
 When you move your mouse pointer to that corner, the feature you’ve 
specified automatically kicks in.
Printing within Mac OS X
Snow Leopard makes document printing a breeze. Because virtually all Mac 
printers use a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, setting up printing couldn’t 
be easier. Just turn on your printer and connect the USB cable between the 
printer and your iMac; Snow Leopard does the rest.

80
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
Printer manufacturers supply you with installation software that might add 
cool extra software or fonts to your system. Even if Snow Leopard recognizes 
your USB printer immediately, I recommend that you still launch the manufac-
turer’s Mac OS X installation disc. For example, my new Epson printer came 
with new fonts and a CD/DVD label application, but I wouldn’t have ’em if I 
hadn’t installed the Epson software package.
After your printer is connected and installed, you can use the same pro-
cedure to print from within just about every Mac OS X application on the 
planet! To print with the default page layout settings — standard 81⁄2-x-11" 
paper, portrait mode, no scaling — follow these steps:
 
1. Within the active application, choose File➪Print or press the Ô+P 
shortcut.
 
 Mac OS X displays the Print sheet.
 
2. From this dialog, you can
 
• Print from a different printer connected to your iMac or print over a 
network connection to a shared printer on another computer.
 
 Click the Printer pop-up menu. In this pop-up menu, Snow Leopard 
displays all the printers that you can access.
 
• Check what the printed document will look like.
 
 Click Preview to open it within the very same Preview application I 
discuss earlier in this chapter.
 
 If you have to make changes to the document or you need to change 
the default print settings, click Cancel to return to your document. (You 
have to repeat Step 1 again to display the Print dialog again.)
 
If everything looks good at this point and you don’t need to change any 
settings (like multiple copies or to print only a portion of the document), 
click Print — you’re done! If not, click the Expand button next to the Printer 
pop-up menu. (It bears a downward-pointing arrow.) Now you can proceed 
with these steps:
 
1. (Optional) For more than one copy, click in the Copies field and type 
the number of copies that you need.
 
 Collation (separating copies) is also available, and it doesn’t cost a thing!
 
2. (Optional) To print a range of selected pages, select the From radio 
button and then enter the starting and ending pages.

81
 Chapter 5: A Plethora of Powerful Fun
 
 To print the entire document, leave the default Pages option set to All.
 
3. (Optional) If the application offers its own print settings, such as col-
lating and grayscale printing, make any necessary changes to those 
settings.
 
 To display these application-specific settings, click the pop-up menu 
in the Print dialog and choose the desired settings pane that you need 
to adjust. (You can blissfully ignore these settings and skip this step 
entirely if the defaults are fine.)
 
4. When you’re set to go, click Print.
 
You can also save an electronic version of a document in the popular Adobe 
Acrobat PDF format from the Print dialog — without spending money on 
Adobe Acrobat. (Slick.)
 
1. Click the PDF button to display the destination pop-up menu.
 
2. Click Save as PDF.
 
 Snow Leopard prompts you with a Save As dialog, where you can type 
a name for the PDF document and specify a location on your hard drive 
where the file should be saved.
Heck, if you like, you can even fax a PDF (with an external USB modem or 
multifunction printer) or send it as an e-mail attachment! Just choose these 
options from the destination list rather than Save as PDF.

R
emember the old TV series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea? You always 
knew you were on the bridge of the submarine Seaview because it had 
an entire wall made up of randomly blinking lights, crewmen darting about 
with clipboards, and all sorts of strange and exotic-looking controls on 
every available surface. You could fix just about anything by looking into the 
camera with grim determination and barking out an order. After all, you were 
On The Bridge. That’s why virtually all the dialog and action inside the sub 
took place on that one (expensive) set: It was the nerve center of the ship, 
and a truly happenin’ place to be.
I devote this entire chapter to the System Preferences window and all the set-
tings within it. After all, if you want to change how Snow Leopard works or 
customize the features within our favorite operating system, this one window 
is the nerve center of Mac OS X, and a truly happenin’ place to be. (Sorry, no 
built-in wall of randomly blinking lights — but there are exotic controls just 
about everywhere.)
A Not-So-Confusing Introduction
The System Preferences window (as shown in Figure 6-1) is a self-contained 
beast, and you can reach it in a number of ways:
 
✓ Click the Apple menu (Ú) and choose the System Preferences menu 
item.
 
✓ Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.

84
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
✓ Click most of the Finder menu status icons and then choose the Open 
Preferences menu item. (This trick works with the Bluetooth, AirPort, 
Display, Modem, and Clock icons.)

Group icons
When the System Preferences window is open, you can click any of the group 
icons to switch to that group’s pane; the entire window morphs to display 
the settings for the selected pane. For example, Figure 6-2 illustrates the 
Sound pane, which allows you to set a system alert sound, configure your 
iMac’s built-in microphone, and choose from several different output options.
 
Figure 6-2:

the Sound

85
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
Many panes also include a number of tabbed buttons at the top — in this 
case, Sound Effects, Output, and Input. You can click these tabs to switch to 
another panel within the same pane. Many panes within System Preferences 
have multiple panels. This design allows our friends at Apple to group a large 
number of related settings together in the same pane (without things getting 
too confusing).
To return to the top-level System Preferences panel from any pane, just click 
the Show All button (top left) or press Ô+L. You can also click the familiar 
Previous and Next buttons to move backward through the panes you’ve 
already visited and then move forward again, in sequence. (Yep, these but-
tons work just like the browser controls in Safari. Sometimes life is funny 
that way.)
Your changes to the settings in a pane are automatically saved when you 
click Show All or when you click the Close button on the System Preferences 
window. You can also press Ô+Q to exit the window and save all your 
changes automatically . . . a favorite shortcut of mine.
 
If you see an Apply button in a pane, you can click it to immediately apply 
any changes you make, without exiting the pane. This is perfect for some 
settings that you might want to try first before you accept them, like many 
of the controls on the Network pane. However, if you’re sure about what you 
changed and how those changes will affect your system, you don’t have to 
click Apply. Just exit the System Preferences window or click Show All as you 
normally would.
Searching for Settings
Hey, wouldn’t it be great if you could search through all the different panes 
in System Preferences — with all those countless radio buttons, check boxes, 
and slider controls — from one place? Even when you’re not quite sure 
exactly what it is you’re looking for?
Figure 6-3 illustrates exactly that kind of activity taking place. Just click in the 
System Preferences Spotlight Search box (upper right, with the magnifying 
glass icon) and type in just about anything. For example, if you know part of 
the name of a particular setting you need to change, type that. Snow Leopard 
highlights the System Preferences panes that might contain matching set-
tings. And if you’re a Switcher from the Windows world, you can even type in 
what you might have called the same setting in Windows!
The System Preferences window dims and the group icons that might contain 
what you’re looking for stay highlighted. Slick.
If you need to reset the Search box to try again, click the X icon that appears 
at the right side of the box to clear it.

Popular Preference Panes Explained
Time to get down to brass tacks. Open up the most-often-used panes in 
System Preferences to see what magic you can perform! I won’t discuss every 
pane because I cover many of them in other chapters. (In fact, you might 
never need to open some System Preferences panes at all, like the MobileMe 
pane.) However, this chapter covers just about all the settings that you’re 
likely to use on a regular basis.
The Displays pane
If you’re a heavy-duty game player or you work with applications like video 
editing and 3-D modeling, you probably find yourself switching the charac-
teristics of your monitor on a regular basis. To easily accomplish switching, 
visit the Displays pane (see Figure 6-4), which includes two panels:
 
✓ Display: Click a screen resolution to choose it from the Resolutions list 
on the left. Snow Leopard displays the number of colors (or color depth) 
allowed at that resolution, and you can pick a color depth from the 
Colors pop-up menu. (Typically, it’s a good idea to use the highest reso-
lution and the highest number of colors.) If you have an external moni-
tor connected to your iMac, click the Detect Displays button to scan for 
that monitor. Drag the Brightness slider to change the brightness level 
of your display.
 
 When you enable (mark) the Show Displays in Menu Bar check box, you 
can switch resolutions and color levels right from the Finder menu!

87
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
 
✓ Color: Your iMac can use a color profile file that controls the colors on 
your display. This setting comes in handy for graphic artists and illus-
trators who need color output from their printers that closely matches 
the colors displayed by the iMac. Click the Calibrate button to launch 
the Display Calibrator, which can create a custom ColorSync profile and 
calibrate the colors that you see on your monitor.

The Desktop & Screen Saver pane
Hey, who doesn’t want to choose their own background? And what about 
that nifty screen saver you just downloaded from the Apple Web site? You 
can change both your background and your screen saver by using these 
options on the Desktop & Screen Saver pane.
The settings on the Desktop panel (as shown in Figure 6-5) include
 
✓ Current Desktop picture: To change your Desktop background, click 
a thumbnail. You can also drag a picture from a Finder window or the 
desktop and drop it into the well (the fancy Apple word for the square 
box with the sunken look). Snow Leopard automatically updates your 
Desktop so you can see the results. To open another collection of 
images from Apple, click the desired collection folder in the list on 
the left of the panel. (I recommend the stunning images in the Nature 
folder.) If you want to open a different folder with your own images, click 
the Add button (which bears a plus sign) at the lower left of the panel 
and then navigate to that folder.

✓ Arrangement: You can automatically fit an image to your screen, tile 
your background image (repeat it across the Desktop), center it, and 
stretch it to fill the screen. Because the images from Apple are all sized 
correctly already, the Arrangement control appears only when you’re 
using your own pictures.
 
✓ Change Picture: If you like a bit of automatic variety on your Desktop, 
select the Change Picture check box. You can click the pop-up menu to 
set the delay period. The images in the current collection or folder are 
then displayed in the sequence in which they appear in the thumbnail list.
 
✓ Translucent Menu Bar: When enabled, this feature turns your Finder 
and application menu bars semi-opaque, allowing them to blend in 
somewhat with your Desktop background. If you’d rather have a solid-
color menu bar, deselect this check box.
 
✓ Random Order: Select this check box to throw caution utterly to the 
wind and display random screens from the current collection or folder!
The settings on the Screen Saver pane include
 
✓ Screen Savers: Click the screen saver that you want to display from 
the Screen Savers list. Snow Leopard displays an animated preview of 
the selected saver on the right. You can also click the Test button to 
try out the screen saver in full-screen mode. (Move your mouse a bit to 
end the test.)

89
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
 
 If the selected screen saver has any settings you can change, the 
Options button displays them.
 
✓ Start Screen Saver: Drag this slider to choose the period of inactivity 
that triggers the screen saver. Choose Never if you want to disable the 
screen saver entirely.
 
✓ Use Random Screen Saver: Another chance to rebel against conformity! 
Enable this check box, and Snow Leopard picks a different screen saver 
each time.
 
✓ Show With Clock: Enable this check box, and Snow Leopard adds a 
smart clock display to your screen saver (a great help for those of us 
who spend many minutes on the phone).
 
✓ Hot Corners: Click this button to display a drop-down sheet, and then 
click any of the four pop-up menus at the four corners of the screen 
to select that corner as an activating hot corner. (Moving your mouse 
pointer to a hot corner immediately activates the screen saver.) You can 
also specify a corner as a disabling hot corner — as long as the mouse 
pointer stays in that corner, the screen saver is disabled. Note that you 
can also set the Dashboard, Spaces, and Exposé activation corners from 
here. (Read on for the entire lowdown.)
 
 For additional security, check out the Security pane in System 
Preferences, where you’ll find the Require Password to Wake This 
Computer from Sleep or Screen Saver check box and enable the 
check box.
The Exposé & Spaces pane
The pane you see in Figure 6-6 illustrates the settings that control Snow 
Leopard’s Spaces, Dashboard, and Exposé features (features I discuss in 
more detail in Chapter 5). The settings on the Exposé tab include
 
✓ Active Screen Corners: The screen corners pop-up menus that I 
describe in the preceding section operate just like those in the Screen 
Savers panel. Click a corner’s list box to set it as
 
• An Exposé All Windows corner (displays all windows on your 
Desktop).
 
• An Exposé Application Windows corner (displays only the windows 
from the active application).
 
• An Exposé Desktop corner (moves all windows to the outside of 
the screen to uncover your Desktop).
 
• A Spaces corner (activates the Spaces Desktop selection feature).

90
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
 
• A Sleep Display corner (immediately turns off your display, putting 
your screen in Sleep mode).
 
• A Dashboard corner (displays your Dashboard widgets). Widgets 
are small applications that each perform a single task; they appear 
when you invoke the awesome power of Dashboard.
 
 These pop-up menus can also set the Screen Saver activate and disable 
hot corners.
 
✓ Keyboard and mouse shortcuts: Pretty straightforward stuff here. Click 
each pop-up menu to set the key sequences (and mouse button settings) 
for all three Exposé and Dashboard functions.
 
 If you hold down a modifier key (Shift, Control, Option, or Ô) while a 
shortcut pop-up menu is open, Snow Leopard adds that modifier key to 
the selections you can choose!
 
Figure 6-6: 
The Exposé 
& Spaces 
pane in 
System 
Preferences.
 
One of Snow Leopard’s hottest features is Spaces, which is the system you 
use to configure and control multiple “prefabricated” desktops that you can 
switch between at will! The settings on the Spaces tab include
 
✓ Enable Spaces: Enable this check box to use Spaces. (Go figure.)
 
✓ Show Spaces in Menu Bar: When this check box is enabled, Snow 
Leopard displays the Spaces desktop number you’re currently using 
in the Finder menu bar. You can click the number in the menu bar to 
switch to another Spaces desktop or to open the Spaces Preferences 
pane.

91
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
 
✓ Rows buttons: To add a row of Spaces desktops to the Spaces grid, 
click the Add button with the plus sign. (By default, Spaces starts with 
two desktops enabled, so new rows and columns are numbered begin-
ning with three.) To delete a row, click the Delete button (which bears a 
minus sign).
 
✓ Columns buttons: To add a column of Spaces desktops to the Spaces 
grid, click the Add (plus) button. Click the Delete (minus) button to 
remove a column from the grid.
 
 If you choose to remove a column or row, Snow Leopard alerts you that 
the bindings (the specific applications linked to the deleted columns or 
rows) will be reassigned.
 
✓ Add/Remove Application: Click the Add Application button (the button 
with the plus sign under the Application Assignments list) to add an 
application to one of your Spaces desktops. You can select which desk-
top should include an application by clicking the up/down arrows next 
to the Space column for that application’s entry — just click the desired 
desktop from the pop-up menu that appears. To remove an application, 
click it in the Application Bindings list to select it and then click the 
Remove Application button (which sports a minus sign).
 
 Spaces can even add an application to all your desktops — choose Every 
Space from the pop-up menu.
 
✓ Keyboard and mouse shortcuts: Click each pop-up menu to set the key 
sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Spaces functions.
 
 Like with Dashboard and Exposé keyboard and mouse shortcuts, you 
can press Shift, Control, Option, and Ô keys while the box is open to dis-
play modified choices.
 
✓ When Switching to an Application: When selected, this check box 
allows you to switch applications between Spaces desktops using the 
Ô+Tab shortcut. Snow Leopard will jump to the desktop that has an 
open window for the application you choose, even if that desktop is not 
currently active.
The Appearance pane
The talented Appearance pane (as shown in Figure 6-7) determines the look 
and operation of the controls that appear in application windows and Finder 
windows. It looks complex, but I cover each option here.

92
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
The settings include
 
✓ Appearance: Click this pop-up menu to specify the color Snow Leopard 
uses for buttons, menus, and windows.
 
✓ Highlight Color: Click this pop-up menu to choose the color that high-
lights selected text in fields, pop-up menus, and drop-down list boxes.
 
✓ Place Scroll Arrows: Select a radio button here to determine whether 
the arrows that control the scroll bar in a window appear together at 
the bottom of the scroll bar, or separately at the top and bottom of the 
scroll bar.
 
✓ Click in the Scroll Bar To: By default, Snow Leopard scrolls to the next 
or previous page when you click in an empty portion of the scroll bar. 
Select the Jump to Here radio button to scroll the document to the 
approximate position in relation to where you clicked. (Smooth scrolling 
slows down scrolling, which some people prefer.)
 
Figure 6-7: 
Appear-
ances might 
not be 
everything, 
but they’re 
easy to find 
here.
 
 
 You can minimize a Finder or application window by simply double-
clicking the window’s title bar. To enable this feature, mark the Minimize 
When Double Clicking a Window Title Bar check box.
 
✓ Number of Recent Items: By default, Snow Leopard displays ten recent 
applications, documents, and servers within Recent Items in the Apple 
menu. Need more? Just click the corresponding pop-up menu and spec-
ify up to 50 items.
 
✓ Use LCD Font Smoothing: By default, this check box is enabled, making 
the text on your iMac’s LED display appear more like the printed page.

93
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
 
✓ Turn Off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes: Below a certain point size, text 
smoothing doesn’t help fonts look any smoother onscreen. By default, 
any font displayed at 8 point or smaller isn’t smoothed, which is a good 
choice for an iMac with a flat-panel LED screen.
The Energy Saver pane
I’m an environmentalist — it’s surprising how many techno-types are colored 
green — so this pane (as shown in Figure 6-8) is pretty doggone important. 
When you use them correctly, you not only save electricity but also even 
invoke the Power of Snow Leopard to automatically start and shut down your 
iMac whenever you like!
To save electricity, drag the Computer Sleep slider to a delay period that trig-
gers sleep mode when you’re away from the keyboard for a significant period 
of time. (I prefer 30 minutes.) If your iMac must always remain alert and you 
want to disable sleep mode entirely, choose Never. You can set the delay 
period for blanking your monitor separately from the sleep setting with the 
Display Sleep slider.
To conserve the maximum juice and cut down on wear, enable the Put the 
Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible check box to power-down your hard 
drives when they’re not needed. (This might cause a delay of a second or two 
while loading or saving files because the drives must spin back up.)
 
You can set Snow Leopard to start or shut down your iMac at a scheduled 
time. Click the Schedule button and then select the desired schedule (the 
Start Up or Wake check box and the Shut Down/Sleep pop-up menu) to enable 
them. Set the trigger time by clicking the up and down arrows next to the time 
display for each schedule. Click OK to return to the Energy Saver pane.
Enable the Wake for Network Access check box to wake your iMac from sleep 
mode whenever your computer is accessed remotely across your network. If 
you prefer to send your iMac to sleep by pressing the Power button, enable 
the Allow Power Button to Put the Computer to Sleep check box. By default, 
your iMac’s display will dim to indicate that sleep mode is approaching, 
but you can disable the Automatically Reduce the Brightness of the Display 
check box to maintain full brightness until sleep mode actually kicks in. Snow 
Leopard can also restart your iMac automatically after a power failure — a 
good feature for those running Apache Web server, because your Web site 
will automatically come back online after power is restored.

The Dock pane
You can use the settings, as shown in Figure 6-9, to configure the Dock’s 
behavior until it fits your personality like a glove:
 
✓ Size: Pretty self-explanatory. Just drag the slider to change the scale of 
the Dock.
 
✓ Magnification: When you select this check box, each icon in your Dock 
swells like a puffer fish when you move your mouse cursor over it. 
(Just how much it magnifies is determined by the Magnification slider.) 
I really like this feature because I resize my Dock smaller, and I have a 
large number of Dock icons.
 
✓ Position on Screen: Select a radio button here to position the Dock on 
the left, bottom, or right edge of your iMac’s Desktop.
 
✓ Minimize Using: Snow Leopard includes two cool animations that you 
can choose from when shrinking a window to the Dock (and expanding 
it back to the Desktop). Click the Minimize Using pop-up menu to specify 
the genie-in-a-bottle effect or a scale-up-or-down-incrementally effect.
 
✓ Minimize windows into application icon: By default, Snow Leopard 
minimizes a window as a thumbnail on the right side of the Dock. Select 
this check box to minimize a window into the icon for the parent appli-
cation instead.
 
✓ Animate Opening Applications: Are you into aerobics? How about punk 
rock and slam dancing? Active souls who like animation likely get a kick 
out of the bouncing application icons in the Dock. They indicate that 
you’ve launched an application and that it’s loading. You can turn off 
this bouncing behavior by disabling this check box.

95
 Chapter 6: A Nerd’s Guide to System Preferences
 
✓ Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: Select this check box, and the 
Dock disappears until you need it. (Depending on the size of your Dock, 
the Desktop that you gain can be significant.) To display a hidden Dock, 
move your mouse pointer over the corresponding edge of the Desktop.
 
Figure 6-9:

your Dock 
by using 
these 
controls.
 
The Sharing pane
So you’re in a neighborly mood, and you want to share your toys with others 
on your local wired or wireless network. Perhaps you’d like to start your own 
Web site, or protect yourself against the Bad Guys on the Internet. All these 
fun diversions are available from the Sharing pane in System Preferences, as 
shown in Figure 6-10.
Click the Edit button to change the default network name assigned to your 
iMac during the installation process. Your current network name is listed in 
the Computer Name text field.
Each entry in the services list controls a specific type of sharing. To turn on 
any of these services, enable the On check box for that service. To turn off a 
service, click the corresponding On check box to disable it.
From a security standpoint, I highly recommend that you enable only 
those services that you actually use — each service you enable automati-
cally opens your Snow Leopard firewall for that service. A Mark’s Maxim to 
remember:
 
Poking too many holes in your firewall is not A Good Thing.
 
When you click one of the services in the list, the right side of the Sharing 
pane changes to display the settings you can specify for that particular ser-
vice. To display all the details on these options, click the Help button at the 
lower-right corner of the System Preferences dialog.

pane.
 
The Time Machine pane
Mac users are excited about the Time Machine automatic backup feature. 
You can easily configure how Time Machine handles your backups from the 
pane shown in Figure 6-11. Of course, you’ll need an external hard drive (or 
a Time Capsule wireless backup station) for the best backup security. Note 
that Time Machine won’t work with your CD or DVD rewriteable drive . . . it’s 
got to be a hard drive. 
To enable Time Machine, click the On switch and then click the Select Disk 
button to choose a disk to hold your Time Machine backup data. Time 
Machine backs up all the hard drives on your system; however, to save time 
and hard drive space, Time Machine allows you to exclude specific drives 
and folders from the backup process. Click the Options button; then click the 
Add button (with the plus sign) to select the drives or folders you want to 
exclude, and they appear in the Exclude list.
 
To remove an item you would like to exclude, select it in the list and click the 
Delete button (with the minus sign); note the Estimated Size figure increases, 
and Time Machine adds the item you deleted from the list to the next backup.
After you make your changes, you can elect to back up your Mac immediately 
by clicking the Time Machine icon in the Finder menu and choosing the Back 
Up Now item.

Chapter 7
Searching amidst iMac Chaos
In This Chapter
▶ Mastering basic Spotlight searching skills
▶ Selecting text and keywords for best results
▶ Displaying results in the Spotlight window
▶ Customizing Spotlight settings in System Preferences
W
hat would you say if I told you that you could search your entire 
system for virtually every piece of data connected with a person — 
and in only the short time it takes to type that person’s name? And I’m not 
just talking about files and folders that might include that person’s name. I 
mean every e-mail message and every iCal calendar or event that references 
that person — and even that person’s Address Book card to boot? Heck, 
how about if that search could dig up every occurrence of the person’s name 
inside PDF documents? What if it could even search folders shared on other 
Macs across your network?
You’d probably say, “That makes for good future tech — I’ll bet I can do that 
in five or ten years. It’ll take Apple at least that long to do it . . . and just in 
time for me to buy a new iMac! (Harrumph.)”
Don’t be so hasty: You can do all this, right now. The technology is the Mac 
OS X feature named Spotlight, built right into Snow Leopard. In this chapter, I 
show you how to use it like an iMac power guru.
Basic Searching 101
Figure 7-1 illustrates the Spotlight search field, which is always available 
from the Finder menu bar. Click the magnifying glass icon once (or press 
Ô+Spacebar), and the Spotlight search box appears.

100
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
To run a search, simply click in the Spotlight box and begin typing. You see 
matching items appear as soon as you type, and the search results are con-
tinually refined while you type the rest of your search criteria. As with the 
Search box in earlier Finder window toolbars, you don’t need to press Return 
to begin the search.
 
Figure 7-1: 
A lot of 
power is 
behind 
this single 
Spotlight 
search box.
 
The results of your Spotlight search are presented in the Spotlight menu, 
which is updated automatically in real time while you continue to type. The 
top 20 most-relevant items are grouped into categories right on the Spotlight 
menu. Categories include Messages, Definitions, Documents, Folders, Images, 
and Contacts. Spotlight takes a guess at the item that’s the most likely match 
(based on your Search Results list in System Preferences, which I cover later 
in the chapter) and presents it in the special Top Hit category that always 
appears first.
 
To open the Top Hit item like a true Snow Leopard power user, just press 
Return. (My brothers and sisters, it just doesn’t get any easier than that.)
Literally any text string is acceptable as a Spotlight search. However, here’s a 
short list of the common search criteria I use every day:
 
✓ Names and addresses: Because Spotlight has access to Snow Leopard’s 
Address Book, you can immediately display contact information using 
any portion of a name or address.
 
✓ E-mail message text: Need to open a specific e-mail message, but you’d 
rather not launch Mail and spend time digging through the message list? 
Enter the person’s e-mail address or any text string contained in the 
message you’re looking for.
 
✓ File and folder names: This is the classic search favorite. Spotlight 
searches your system for that one file or folder in the blink of an eye.
 
✓ Events & To Do items: Yep, Spotlight gives you access to your iCal cal-
endars and those all-important To Do lists you’ve created.
 
✓ System Preferences: Now things start to get really interesting! Try 
typing the word background in the Spotlight field. Some of the results 
will actually be System Preference panes! That’s right, every setting 

101
 Chapter 7: Searching amidst iMac Chaos
in System Preferences is referenced in Spotlight. (For example, the 
Software Update pane contains the word background while the desktop 
background setting is on the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System 
Preferences.)
 
✓ Web pages: Whoa. Stand back, Google. You can use Spotlight to search 
the Web pages you’ve recently displayed in Safari! (Note, however, that 
this feature doesn’t let you search through all the Internet as Google 
does . . . only the pages stored in your Safari Web cache and any HTML 
files you’ve saved to your iMac’s hard drive.)
 
✓ Metadata: That’s a pretty broad category, but it fits. For example, I like 
to locate Word documents on my system using the same metadata that’s 
stored in the file, such as the contents of the Comments field in a Word 
document. Other supported applications include Photoshop images, 
Excel spreadsheets, Keynote presentations, and other third-party appli-
cations that offer a Spotlight plug-in.
To reset the Spotlight search and try another text string, click the X icon that 
appears on the right side of the Spotlight box. (Of course, you can also back-
space to the beginning of the field, but that’s a little less elegant.)
After you find the item that you’re looking for, you can click it once to launch 
it (if the item is an application), open it in System Preferences (if it’s a setting 
or description on a Preferences pane), open it within the associated applica-
tion (if the item is a document or a data item) or display it within a Finder 
window (if the item is a folder).
 
Here’s another favorite timesaver: You can display all the files of a particular 
type on your system by using the file type as the keyword. For example, to 
provide a list of all images on your system, just use images as your keyword — 
the same goes for movies and audio, too. You can use common extensions like 
JPG and DOC to search for certain types of files as well.
In fact, you can display the same search results from the Snow Leopard 
Sidebar, which includes a Search For heading! You can display All Images, 
All Movies, and All Documents with a single click of your mouse button, from 
any Finder window.
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
Don’t get fooled into simply using Spotlight as another file-’n-folder-name 
search tool. Sure, it can do that, but Spotlight can also search inside PDF, 
Word, Pages and HTML files, finding matching text that doesn’t appear in the 
name of the file! To wit: A search for Snow Leopard on my system pulls up 
all sorts of items with Snow Leopard in their names, but also files with Snow 
Leopard in them, like a PowerPoint presentation including slides containing 
the text Snow Leopard, or an iCal event pointing to a conference call with my 

102
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
editor about upcoming Snow Leopard book projects. Notice that not one of 
these three examples actually has the words Snow Leopard occurring any-
where in the title or filename, yet Spotlight found them because they all con-
tain the text Snow Leopard therein.
Heck, suppose that all you remember about a file is that you received it in 
your mail last week or last month. To find it, you can actually type in time 
periods, such as yesterday, last week, or last month, to see every item that you 
saved or received within that period. (Boy, howdy, I love writing about truly 
good ideas.)
 
Again, the Sidebar also allows you to search for files by time period, using the 
links under the Search For heading.
Be careful, however, when you’re considering a search string. Don’t forget 
that (by default) Spotlight matches only those items that have all the words 
you enter in the Spotlight box. To return the highest number of possible 
matches, use the fewest number of words to identify the item; for example, 
use horse rather than horse image, and you’re certain to be rewarded with 
more hits. (On the other hand, if you’re looking specifically for a picture of a 
knight on horseback, a series of keywords, such as horse knight image, short-
ens your search considerably. It all depends on what you’re looking for and 
how widely you want to cast your Spotlight net.)
To allow greater flexibility in searches, Apple also includes those helpful 
Boolean friends that you may already be familiar with: AND, OR, and NOT. For 
example, you can perform Spotlight searches, such as
 
✓ Horse AND cow (which collects all references to both those barnyard ani-
mals into one search)
 
✓ Batman OR Robin (which returns all references to either Batman or 
Robin)
 
✓ Apple NOT PC (which displays all references to Apple that don’t include 
any information on dastardly PCs)
 
Because Spotlight functions are a core technology of Mac OS X Snow Leopard — 
in other words, all sorts of applications can make use of Spotlight throughout 
the operating system, including the Finder — the Finder window’s Search box 
now shares many of the capabilities of Spotlight. In fact, you can use the time 
period trick that I mention earlier (entering yesterday as a keyword) in the 
Finder window Search box.

103
 Chapter 7: Searching amidst iMac Chaos
 
Okay, parents, listen closely: Here’s a (somewhat sneaky) tip that might help 
you monitor your kid’s computer time as well as what your kids are typing/
reading in iChat:
 
1. Enable the iChat transcript feature.
 
a. From within iChat, choose iChat➪Preferences.
 
b. Click Messages.
 
c. Select the Save Chat Transcripts To check box and choose a destina-
tion folder in a location you can access.
 
2. Click OK to return to iChat.
 
 Now you can use Spotlight to search for questionable words, phrases, 
and names within those iChat transcripts.
Expanding Your Search Horizons
I can just hear the announcer’s voice now: “But wait, there’s more! If you click 
the Show All menu item at the beginning of your search results, we’ll expand 
your Spotlight menu into the Spotlight Results window!” (Fortunately, you 
don’t have to buy some ridiculous household doodad.)
 
Keyboard mavens will appreciate the Spotlight window shortcut key, and I 
show you where to specify this shortcut in the final section of this chapter.
Is Spotlight secure?
So how about all those files, folders, contacts, 
and events that you don’t want to appear in 
Spotlight? What if you’re sharing your iMac as 
a multiuser computer, or accessing other Macs 
remotely? Can others search for and access 
your personal information through Spotlight?
Definitely not! The results displayed by 
Spotlight are controlled by file and folder per-
missions as well as your account login, just 
as the applications that create and display 
your personal data are. For example, you can’t 
access other users’ calendars using iCal, and 
they can’t see your Mail messages. Only you 
have access to your data, and only after you’ve 
logged in with your username and password. 
Spotlight works the same way. If a user doesn’t 
normally have access to an item, the item 
simply doesn’t appear when that user performs 
a Spotlight search. (In other words, only you get 
to see your stuff.)
However, you can even hide certain folders 
and disks from your own Spotlight searches if 
necessary. Check out the final section of this 
chapter for details on setting private locations 
on your system.

104
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Figure 7-2 illustrates the Results window (which is actually a Finder window 
with extras). To further filter the search, click one of the buttons on the 
Spotlight Results window toolbar or create your own custom filter. Click the 
button with the plus sign to display the search criteria bar and then click 
the pop-up menus to choose from criteria, such as the type of file, the text 
content, or the location on your system (for example, your hard drive, your 
Home folder, or a network server). You can also filter your results listing by 
the date the items were created or last saved. To add or delete criteria, click 
the plus and minus buttons at the right side of the search criteria bar. To 
save a custom filter that you’ve created, click the Save button.
 
Figure 7-2: 
The 
spacious 
borders of 
the Spotlight 
Results 
window.
 
Images appear as thumbnail icons, so you can use that most sophisticated 
search tool — the human eye — to find the picture you’re looking for. (If you 
don’t see thumbnail images, click the Icon view button on the toolbar.) Don’t 
forget that you can increase or decrease the size of the icons by dragging the 
slider at the bottom right of the window.
 
To display the contents item in the list (without leaving the comfortable con-
fines of the Results window), click the icon to select it and click the Quick 
Look icon in the toolbar (or press the spacebar) for a better view.
Again, when you’re ready to open an item, just double-click it in the Results 
window.
As I mention earlier, Spotlight can look for matching items on other Macs on 
your network — but only if those remote Macs are configured correctly. To 
allow another Mac running Mac OS X Tiger, Leopard, or Snow Leopard to be 
visible to Spotlight on your system, enable File Sharing on the other Mac. 
(Oh, and remember that you need an admin-level account on that Mac — or 
access to a good friend who has an admin-level account on that Mac.)

105
 Chapter 7: Searching amidst iMac Chaos
Follow these steps to enable File Sharing on the other Mac:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing pane.
 
3. Select the On check box next to the File Sharing item in the service 
list to enable it.
 
4. Click the Close button on the System Preferences window.
Remember, you can search only items that you have rights and permissions 
to view on the remote Mac (such as the contents of the Public folders on that 
computer). I discuss more about these limitations earlier in this chapter, in 
the “Is Spotlight secure?” sidebar.
Customizing Spotlight to Your Taste
You might wonder whether such an awesome Mac OS X feature has its 
own pane within System Preferences — and you’d be right again. Figure 7-3 
shows off the Spotlight pane within System Preferences: Click the System 
Preferences icon (look for the gears) in the Dock and then click the Spotlight 
icon (under Personal) to display these settings.

106
Part II: Shaking Hands with Mac OS X 
Click the Search Results tab to
 
✓ Determine which categories appear in the Spotlight menu and Results 
window. For example, if you don’t use any presentation software on 
your iMac, you can clear the check box next to Presentations to disable 
this category (thereby making more room for other categories that you 
will use).
 
✓ Determine the order that categories appear in the Spotlight menu and 
Results window. Drag the categories to the order in which you want 
them to appear in the Spotlight menu and window. For example, I like 
the Documents and System Preferences categories to appear higher in 
the list because I use them most often.
 
✓ Specify the Spotlight menu and Spotlight Results window keyboard 
shortcuts. You can enable or disable either keyboard shortcut and 
choose the key combination from the pop-up menu.
Click the Privacy tab (as shown in Figure 7-4) to specify disks and folders that 
should never be listed as results in a Spotlight search. I know, I know, I said 
earlier that Spotlight respected your security, and it does. However, the disks 
and folders that you add on this list won’t appear even if you are the one 
performing the search. (This is a great idea for folders and removable hard 
drives that you use to store sensitive information, such as medical records.)

tain folders 
and disks

To add locations that you want to keep private, click the Add button (bearing 
a plus sign) and navigate to the desired location. Click the location to select 
it and then click Choose. (Alternatively, you can drag folders or disks directly 
from a Finder window and drop them into the pane.)

your Safari Web browser. You also get to know all about 
Apple’s MobileMe Internet subscription service, and how

I
 proudly surf the Web via a lean, mean — and very fast — browser appli-
cation. That’s Safari, of course, and it just keeps getting better with each 
new version of Mac OS X. Safari delivers the Web the right way, without the 
wait. (Heck, if you like, you can even enlist your friends using PCs on this 
expedition — there’s a version of Safari for Windows as well.)
If you need a guide to Safari, this is your chapter. Sure, you can start using it 
immediately, but wouldn’t you rather read a few pages in order to surf like a 
power user?
Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
Figure 8-1 illustrates the Safari window. You can launch Safari directly from 
the Dock or you can click the Safari icon within your Applications folder. 
Major sections of the Safari window include
 
✓ The toolbar: You’ll find the most often used commands on this tool-
bar — for tasks such as navigating, adding bookmarks, and searching 
Google. Plus, here you can type or paste the address for Web sites that 
you’d like to visit. The toolbar can be hidden to provide you with more 
real estate in your browser window for Web content. To toggle hidden 
mode on and off, press Ô+| (the vertical bar right above the backslash) 
or choose View➪Hide/Show Toolbar.

✓ The Bookmarks bar: Consider this a toolbar that allows you to jump 
directly to your favorite Web sites with a single click or two. I show you 
later, in the section “Adding and Using Bookmarks,” how to add and 
remove sites from your Bookmarks bar. For now, remember that you 
can toggle the display of the Bookmarks bar by choosing View➪Hide/
Show Bookmarks Bar or by pressing Ô+Shift+B.
 
✓ The Content window: Congratulations! At last, you’ve waded through 
all the pregame show and you’ve reached the area where Web pages are 
actually displayed. As can any other window, the Content window can 
be scrolled; when you minimize Safari to the Dock, you get a thumbnail 
(minimized) image of the Content window.
 
 The Content window often contains underlined text and graphical icons 
that transport you to other pages when you click them. These under-
lined words and icons are links, and they make it easy to move from one 
area of a site to another or to a completely different site.
 
✓ The status bar: The status bar displays information about what the 
cursor is currently resting upon, such as the address for a link or the 
name of an image; it also updates you on what’s happening while a page 
is loading. To hide or display the status bar, press Ô+/ (forward slash) 
or choose View➪Hide/Show Status Bar.

111
 Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!
Visiting Web Sites
Here’s the stuff that virtually everyone over the age of five knows how to 
do . . . but I get paid by the word, and some folks might not be aware of the 
myriad ways of visiting a site. You can load a Web page using any of the fol-
lowing methods:
 
✓ Type (or paste) a Web site address into the Address box on the toolbar 
and then press Return.
 
 If you’re typing in an address and Safari recognizes the site as one that 
you’ve visited in the past, it helps by completing the address for you. 
Press Return if you want to accept the suggested site. If this is a new 
site, just keep typing.
 
 The latest versions of Safari include a Smart Address field that displays 
a new pop-up menu of sites that match the text you’ve entered. Safari 
does this by using sites taken from your History file and your book-
marks. If the site you want to visit appears in the list, click it to jump 
there immediately.
 
✓ Click a Bookmarks entry within Safari.
 
✓ If the Home button appears on your toolbar, click it to return to the 
home page that you specify.
 
 More on this in the section “Setting Up Your Home Page,” later in this 
chapter.
 
✓ Click the Show Top Sites button on the toolbar.
 
 Safari displays a wall of preview thumbnail pages from your most fre-
quently visited sites, and you can jump to a site just by clicking on 
the preview. Click the Edit button on the Top Sites screen to delete a 
preview thumbnail — click the X — or you can “anchor” a thumbnail to 
keep it on the screen permanently by clicking the pin icon next to the 
desired thumbnail. You can also choose the size of the preview thumb-
nails in Edit mode.
 
 Because each thumbnail is updated with the most current content, the 
Top Sites wall makes a great time-saver — you can quickly make a visual 
check of all your favorite haunts from one screen!
 
✓ Click a page link in Apple Mail or another Internet-savvy application.
 
 Some Mac applications require you to hold down Ô while clicking to 
open a Web page. (Note that if the link is in plain text, you can often 
select the text, right-click and choose Open URL from the menu that 
appears.)
 
✓ Click a page link within another Web page.
 
✓ Use the Google box in the toolbar.

112
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
 Click in the Google box, type the contents that you want to find, and 
then press Return. Safari presents you with the search results page on 
Google for the text that you entered. (In case you’ve been living under 
the Internet equivalent of a rock for the last couple of years, Google.com 
is the preeminent search site on the Web — people use Google to find 
everything from used auto parts to ex-spouses.)
 
✓ Click a Safari page icon in the Dock or a Finder window.
 
 For example, Mac OS X already has an icon in the Dock that takes you 
to the Mac OS X page on the Apple Web site. Drag a site from your 
Bookmarks bar and drop it on the right side of the Dock. Clicking the 
icon that you add launches Safari and automatically loads that site.
 
 This trick works only on the side of the Dock to the right of the vertical 
line.
If you minimize Safari to the Dock, you’ll see a thumbnail of the page with the 
Safari logo superimposed on it. Click this thumbnail in the Dock to restore 
the page to its full glory.
Navigating the Web
A typical Web surfing session is a linear experience — you bop from one page 
to the next, absorbing the information that you want and discarding the rest. 
However, after you visit a few sites, you might find that you need to return to 
where you’ve been or head to the familiar ground of your home page. Safari 
offers these default navigational controls on the toolbar:
 
✓ Back: Click the Back button (the left-facing arrow) on the toolbar to 
return to the last page you visited. Additional clicks take you to previous 
pages, in reverse order. The Back button is disabled if you haven’t vis-
ited at least two sites.
 
✓ Forward: If you’ve clicked the Back button at least once, clicking the 
Forward button (the right-facing arrow) takes you to the next page (or 
through the pages) where you originally were, in forward order. The 
Forward button is disabled if you haven’t used the Back button.
 
✓ Home: Not all these buttons and controls must appear on your toolbar. 
To display or hide toolbar controls, choose View➪Customize Toolbar. 
The sheet that appears works just like the Customize Toolbar sheet 
within a Finder window: Drag the control you want from the sheet to 
your Safari toolbar or drag a control that you don’t want from the tool-
bar to the sheet. (For example, I like to add the Home button to the default 
toolbar — a click on the Home button immediately returns you to your 
home page.)

113
 Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!
 
✓ AutoFill: If you fill out a lot of forms online — when you’re shopping at 
Web sites, for example — you can click the AutoFill button (which looks 
like a little text box and a pen) to complete these forms for you. You can 
set what information is used for AutoFill by choosing Safari➪Preferences 
and clicking the AutoFill toolbar button.
 
 To be honest, I’m not a big fan of releasing any of my personal informa-
tion to any Web site, so I don’t use AutoFill often. If you do decide to use 
this feature, make sure that the connection is secure (look for the pad-
lock icon in the upper-right corner of the Safari window) and read the 
site’s Privacy Agreement page first to see how your identity data will 
be treated.
 
✓ Zoom: Shrinks or expands the size of text on the page, offering smaller, 
space-saving characters (for the shrinking crowd) or larger, easier-to-
read text (for the expanding crowd). Hence the button, which is labeled 
with a small and large letter A.
 
✓ Stop/Reload: Click Reload at the right side of the Address box (look for 
the circular arrow) to refresh (reload) the contents of the current page. 
Many pages change their content at regular intervals. Reload allows you 
to see what’s changed on these pages. (I use Reload every hour or so 
with CNN.com, for example.) While a page is loading, the Reload button 
turns into the Stop button — with a little X mark — and you can click it 
to stop the loading of the content from the current page. This is a real 
boon when a download takes foorrevverr. 
 
✓ Open in Dashboard: Click this button to create a Dashboard widget 
using the contents of the currently displayed Web page. Safari prompts 
you to choose which clickable section of the page to include within the 
widget’s borders (such as the local radar map on your favorite weather 
Web site). Click Add, and Dashboard loads automatically with your new 
widget. (More on widgets in Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Add Bookmark: Click this toolbar button (which carries a plus sign) to 
add a page to your Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu. (More on this in 
a tad.)
 
✓ Google Search: As I mention earlier, you can click in this box and type 
text that you want to find on the Web via the Google search engine; 
press Return to display the results. To repeat a recent search, click 
the down arrow in the Google Search box and select it from the 
pop-up menu.
 
✓ Print: Click this convenient button to print the contents of the Safari 
window. (Dig that crazy printer icon!)
 
✓ Report Bug: When you click the Bug button, you’ll see a sheet with the 
settings shown in Figure 8-2; take time to enter a short description of the 
problem. Click More Options to enable the Send Screen Shot of Current 
Page and the Send Source of Current Page check boxes, giving the Apple 
folks more to work with. Click the Submit button.

Setting Up Your Home Page
Choosing a home page is one of the easiest methods of speeding up your 
Web surfing, especially if you’re using a dial-up modem. However, a large per-
centage of the Mac owners whom I’ve talked with have never set their own 
home page; instead, they simply use the default home page provided by their 
browser! With Safari running, take a moment to follow these steps to declare 
your own freedom to choose your own home page:
 
1. If you want to use a specific Web page as your new home page, dis-
play it in Safari.
 
 I recommend selecting a page with few graphics or a fast-loading popu-
lar site.
 
2. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
 
3. Click the General button.
 
 You see the settings shown in Figure 8-3.

115
 Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!
 
Figure 8-3: 
Adding 
your own 
home page 
is an easy 
change you 
can make.
 
 
4. Click the Set to Current Page button.
 
5. Alternatively, click the New Windows Open With pop-up menu and 
choose Empty Page if you want Safari to open a new window with a 
blank page.
 
 This is the fastest choice of all for a home page.
 
 Choose Top Sites from the New Windows Open With pop-up menu to 
display the Top Sites screen I described earlier each time you open a 
new window.
 
6. Click the Close button to exit the Preferences dialog.
 
Visit your home page at any time by clicking the Home button on the toolbar.
Adding and Using Bookmarks
No doubt about it: Bookmarks make the Web a friendly place. As you collect 
bookmarks in Safari, you can immediately jump from one site to another with 
a single click of the Bookmarks menu or the buttons on the Bookmarks bar.

116
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
To add a bookmark, first navigate to the desired page and then do any of the 
following:
 
✓ Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
 
✓ Press the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.
 
 Safari displays a sheet where you can enter the name for the book-
mark and also select where it appears (on the Bookmarks bar or the 
Bookmarks menu).
 
✓ Drag the icon next to the Web address from the Address field to the 
Bookmarks bar.
 
You can also drag a link on the current page to the Bookmarks bar, but note 
that doing this adds a bookmark only for the page corresponding to the link — 
not the current page.
To jump to a bookmark
 
✓ Choose it from the Bookmarks menu.
 
 If the bookmark is contained in a folder, which I discuss later in this sec-
tion, move your pointer over the folder name to show its contents and 
then click the bookmark.
 
✓ Click the bookmark on the Bookmarks bar.
 
 If you’ve added a large number of items to the Bookmarks bar, click the 
More icon on the edge of the Bookmarks bar to display the rest of the 
buttons.
 
✓ Click the Show All Bookmarks button (which looks like a small, 
opened book) on the Bookmarks bar and then click the desired book-
mark.
 
 The Bookmarks window that you see in Figure 8-4 appears — complete 
with swank Cover Flow display — where you can review each collection 
of bookmarks at leisure. As you might expect, Safari’s Cover Flow works 
just as the Cover Flow view does in a Finder window.
 
 The more bookmarks you add, the more unwieldy the Bookmarks menu 
and the Bookmarks window become. To keep things organized, choose 
Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder and then type a name for the new 
folder. With folders, you can organize your bookmarks into collections, 
which appear in the column at the left of the Bookmarks window (or as 
separate submenus within the Bookmarks menu). You can drag book-
marks into the new folder to help reduce the clutter. To delete a book-
mark or a folder from the Bookmarks window, click it and then press 
Delete.

Downloading Files
A huge chunk of the fun that you’ll find on the Web is the ability to download 
images and other files. If you’ve visited a site that offers files for download-
ing, typically you just click the Download button or the download file link, 
and Safari takes care of the rest. You’ll see the Downloads status window, 
which keeps you updated as to the progress of the transfer. While the file 
is downloading, feel free to continue browsing or even download additional 
files; the status window helps you keep track of what’s going on and when 
everything will be finished transferring. To display the Download status 
window from the keyboard, press Ô+Option+L.
By default, Safari saves any downloaded files to the Downloads folder that 
appears in your Dock, which I like and use. To change the specified location 
where downloaded files are stored — for example, if you’d like to save them 
directly to the desktop — follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
 
2. Click the General tab and then click the Save Downloaded Files To 
pop-up menu.

118
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
3. Choose Other.
 
4. Navigate to the location where you want the files stored.
 
5. Click the Select button.
 
6. Click the Close button to exit Preferences.
To download a specific image that appears on a Web page, move your 
pointer over the image and right-click. Then choose Save Image As from the 
pop-up menu that appears. Safari prompts you for the location where you 
want to store the file.
You can choose to automatically open files that Safari considers safe — 
things like movies, text files, and PDF files that are very unlikely to store 
a virus or a damaging macro. By default, the Open “Safe” Files after 
Downloading check box is selected on the General pane. However, if you’re 
interested in preventing anything you download from running until you’ve 
manually checked it with your antivirus application, you can deselect the 
check box and breathe easy.
 
Luckily, Safari has matured to the point that it can seamlessly handle virtually 
any multimedia file type that it encounters. However, if you’ve downloaded 
a multimedia file and Safari doesn’t seem to be able to play or display it, try 
loading the file within QuickTime Player. QuickTime Player is the Swiss Army 
knife of multimedia players, and it can recognize a huge number of audio, 
video, and image formats.
Using Subscriptions and History
To keep track of where you’ve been, you can display the History list by click-
ing the History menu. To return to a page in the list, just choose it from the 
History menu. Note that Safari also arranges older history items by the date 
you visited the site, so you can easily jump back a couple of days to that page 
you forgot to bookmark!
In fact, Safari also searches the History list automatically, when it fills in an 
address that you’re typing — that’s the feature I mention in the earlier sec-
tion “Visiting Web Sites.”
To view your Top Sites thumbnail screen, press Ô+Shift+1 or choose Show 
Top Sites from the History menu.
If you’re worried about security and would rather not keep track of where 
you’ve been online, I show you how to clear the contents of the History file in 
the “Handling ancient history” section, later in this chapter.

119
 Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!
Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
Safari also offers tabbed browsing, which many folks use to display (and orga-
nize) multiple Web pages at the same time. For example, if you’re doing a bit 
of comparison shopping for a new piece of hardware between different online 
stores, tabs are ideal.
When you hold down the Ô key and click a link or bookmark using tabs, a 
tab representing the new page appears at the top of the Safari window. Just 
click the tab to switch to that page. (If you don’t hold down Ô, things revert 
to business as usual, and Safari replaces the contents of the window with the 
new page.) If you hold down both Shift and Ô while you click, Safari opens 
a new tab and automatically switches to the new tab. Figure 8-5 illustrates a 
number of pages that I’ve opened in Safari using tabs.
 
You can also open a new tab by clicking the plus sign that appears at the 
upper-right corner of the Safari window. Done with a page? You can remove a 
tabbed page by clicking the X button next to the tab’s title.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Hang on, 
Martha; 
we’ve 
struck tabs!
 

120
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
To fine-tune your tabbed browsing experience, choose Safari➪Preferences to 
display the Preferences dialog; then click Tabs. From here, you can turn off 
the confirmation window that normally appears when you close Safari with 
multiple tabs or windows open. You can also specify whether a new tab or 
window automatically becomes the active window within Safari.
Saving Web Pages
If you’ve encountered a page that you’d like to load later, you can save it to 
disk in its entirety. (Just the text, mind you, not the images.) Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Display the desired page.
 
2. Choose File➪Save As or press Ô+S.
 
3. In the Save As text field, type a name for the saved page.
 
4. From the Where pop-up menu, navigate to the location where you 
want to store the file on your system.
 
 To expand the sheet to allow navigation to any location on your system, 
click the button with the downward arrow.
 
5. Click the Format pop-up menu to choose the format for the saved 
page.
 
 Usually, you’ll want to choose a Web Archive, which saves the entire 
page and can be displayed just as you see it. However, if you want to 
save just the HTML source code, choose Page Source.
 
6. Click Save to begin the download process.
 
 After the Save file has been created, double-click it to load it in Safari.
 
A quick word about printing a page within Safari: Some combinations of back-
ground and text colors might conspire together to render your printed copy 
practically worthless. In a case like that, use your printer’s grayscale setting 
(if it has one) or deselect the Print Backgrounds check box in the Print dialog. 
Alternatively, you can simply click and drag to select the text on the page, 
press Ô+C to copy it, and then paste the text into Word or Pages, where you 
can print the page on a less offensive background (while still keeping the text 
formatting largely untouched). You can also save the contents of a page as 
plain text, as I just demonstrated.
 
If you’d rather mail the contents of a Web page to a friend — or just send the 
friend a link to the page, which is faster — choose either File➪Mail Contents 
of This Page or File➪Mail Link to This Page. (From the keyboard, press Ô+I 
to send the contents in an e-mail message or press Ô+Shift+I to send a link in 
e-mail.) Mail loads automatically, complete with a prepared e-mail message. 
Just address it to the recipients and then click Send!

121
 Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!
Protecting Your Privacy
No chapter on Safari would be complete without a discussion of security, 
against both outside intrusion from the Internet and prying eyes around your 
iMac. Hence this last section, which covers protecting your privacy.
 
Although diminutive, the padlock icon that appears at the top of the Safari 
window when you’re connected to a secure Web site means a great deal! A 
secure site encrypts the information that you send and receive, making it much 
harder for those of unscrupulous ideals to obtain things such as credit card 
numbers and personal information. You can click the padlock icon (next to 
the site name) to display the security certificate in use on that particular site.
Yes, there are such things as bad cookies
First, a definition of this ridiculous term: A cookie, a small file that a Web site 
automatically saves on your hard drive, contains information that the site 
will use on your future visits. For example, a site might save a cookie to pre-
serve your site preferences for the next time or — in the case of a site such 
as Amazon.com — to identify you automatically and help customize the offer-
ings that you see.
In and of themselves, cookies aren’t bad things. Unlike a virus, a cookie file 
isn’t going to replicate itself or wreak havoc on your system, and only the 
original site can read the cookie that it creates. However, many folks don’t 
appreciate acting as a gracious host for a slew of little snippets of personal 
information. (Not to mention that some cookies have highly suggestive 
names, which could lead to all sorts of conclusions. End of story.)
You can choose to accept all cookies — the default — or you can opt to dis-
able cookies altogether. You can also set Safari to accept cookies only from 
the sites you choose to visit. To change your Cookie Acceptance Plan (or 
CAP, for those who absolutely crave acronyms), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences.
 
2. Click the Security toolbar button.
 
 Safari displays the preference settings shown in Figure 8-6.
 
3. Choose how to accept cookies via these radio button choices:
 
 Never: Block cookies entirely.
 
 Always: Accept all cookies.
 
 Only from Sites You Navigate To: Personally, I use this option, 
which allows sites like Amazon.com to work correctly without 
allowing a barrage of illicit cookies.

122
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
4. To view the cookies currently on your system, click the Show Cookies 
button.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Specifying 
who’s wel-
come in my 
cookie jar.
 
 
 If a site’s cookies are blocked, you might have to take care of things 
manually, such as by providing a password on the site that used to be 
read automatically from the cookie.
 
5. Click the Close button to save your changes.
Cleaning your cache
Safari speeds up the loading of Web sites by storing often-used images and 
multimedia files in a temporary storage, or cache, folder. Naturally, the files 
in your cache folder can be displayed (hint), which could lead to assump-
tions (hint, hint) about the sites you’ve been visiting (hint, hint, hint). 
(Tactful, ain’t I?)
Luckily, Safari makes it easy to dump the contents of your cache file. Just 
choose Safari➪Empty Cache; then click Empty to confirm that you want to 
clean up your cache.

123
 Chapter 8: Let’s Go on Safari!
Handling ancient history
As you might imagine, your History file leaves a very clear set of footprints 
indicating where you’ve been on the Web. To delete the contents of the 
History menu, choose History➪Clear History (at the very bottom of the 
History menu).
Safari also allows you to specify an amount of time to retain entries in your 
History file. Open the Safari Preferences dialog, click the General tab, and 
then click the Remove History Items pop-up menu to specify the desired 
amount of time. Items can be rolled off daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or 
yearly.
Avoiding those @*!^%$ pop-up ads
I hate pop-up ads, and I’m sure you do, too. To block most of those pop-up 
windows with advertisements for everything from low-rate mortgages to 
“sure-thing” Internet casinos, click the Safari menu and verify that Block 
Pop-Up Windows is selected. (If it’s not selected, click the menu item to 
toggle the menu item on.)
 
If you need to temporarily deactivate pop-up blocking, press Ô+Shift+K to 
toggle it off. Then press Ô+Shift+K again to turn pop-up blocking back on after 
you’ve finished with the site.

Moving to MobileMe
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding online storage
▶ Opening a new MobileMe account
▶ Using your iDisk
R
eaders often ask me to name my favorite reasons why they should 
switch — that is, why should a Windows user who thinks all is well 
move to the Apple universe? Of course, I always mention the superior hard-
ware and how much better of a job Snow Leopard does as an operating 
system. Here’s my favorite selling point: “Apple simply does things right the 
first time, and everyone else plays catch-up.”
And then I pose this question: “What if you could reach a hard drive with 
your files over any Internet connection — anywhere in the world — and it 
just showed up on your Desktop automatically?” Usually, another person 
decides to find out more — about the Apple MobileMe online hosting service, 
that is. In fact, if you’ve used online storage — for example, through Google — 
you’ve already been introduced to cloud computing, where both data and 
applications are accessed through the Internet, wherever you are.
In this chapter, I save you the trouble of researching all the benefits of 
MobileMe. Heck, that’s one of the reasons why you bought this book, right?
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your iMac
To set up iDisk — the online data storage provided by MobileMe that I men-
tioned earlier — on your Mac OS X system, you need a MobileMe account. 
You did create one during the installation of the Big X, right? These trial 
accounts are active for 60 days. To subscribe, visit www.me.com and follow 
the prompts to join from there. (At the time of this writing, the subscription 
fee for an individual account is $99 per year from Apple. However, Amazon.

126
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
com sells MobileMe subscriptions for significantly less. You need a credit 
card to create a MobileMe account, but you can cancel your trial account at 
any time.)
Here’s a bit of good news: Other than the 60-day limit, there’s almost no differ-
ence between a MobileMe trial account and a full, $99 yearly subscription, so if 
you’re not sure you want to invest the dough, you can try out all the MobileMe 
features, exactly as though you were already paying for them. Sweet!
With an active MobileMe account, iDisk is available automatically. To see 
how much storage you’re using and to configure access to your Public folder, 
open System Preferences, click the MobileMe icon, and then click the iDisk 
button to display the settings that you see in Figure 9-1. (You can also click 
the Upgrade Storage button on this pane to subscribe to MobileMe, or if 
you’re already a MobileMe subscriber, add storage space.)
 
Figure 9-1: 
Your iDisk 
settings are 
available 
from System 
Preferences.
 
The iDisk Disk Space bar graph illustrates how much of your current iDisk 
territory you’re using.
You can specify the access privilege level for other MobileMe users from 
this pane as well. Select the Read Only radio button to prevent any other 
MobileMe user from copying files to your Public folder, or select the Read & 
Write radio button to allow others to save files there.
No matter which privilege level you choose, you can also set a password that 
other MobileMe users must type before they’re allowed access to your Public 
folder. This is the very definition of A Truly Good Idea. (More on the Public 
folder in the next section.)

127

If you’ve already set a password, you can change it by clicking the Set 
Password button and typing the new word in the Password box. Retype the

Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
In contrast to the physical hard drive in your iMac, your iDisk never needs 
formatting or defragmenting, and you never have to check it for errors. 
However, the structure of an iDisk is fixed, so you can’t just go crazy creating 
your own folders. In fact, you can’t create new folders at the root — the top 
level — of your iDisk at all. However, you can create new folders inside most 
of the root folders.
Pinning down your iDisk
So where exactly are your files kept when you 
use your iDisk? In earlier versions of Mac OS X, 
your acre of storage farmland always sat exclu-
sively on one of Apple’s iDisk file servers — per-
haps in Cupertino, perhaps elsewhere. These 
server computers are especially designed to 
store terabytes (TB) of information (1TB equals 
1,000GB), and they’re connected to the Internet 
via high-speed trunk lines. (And yes, they do 
have a firewall.) Your Internet copy of your iDisk 
is still stored on an Apple file server.
However, you can elect to keep a local copy 
of your iDisk storage area — usually called a 
mirror — on your iMac’s hard drive. Before 
you scratch your head wondering why you’re 
duplicating your iDisk files on your computer, 
here’s the reason: If you do decide to keep 
a local copy of your files, you can work on 
them even when you’re not connected to the 
Internet! Snow Leopard automatically synchro-
nizes any files that you’ve updated locally with 
your remote iDisk whenever you connect to the 
Internet. (If you use multiple Macs at different 
locations, think about being able to access the 
latest copies of your files from any of them, right 
from the Finder!)
This nifty mirror also greatly speeds up things 
when you’re browsing the contents of your 
iDisk or perhaps loading and saving an iDisk 
document; that’s because you’re working with 
your local copy, and Mac OS X updates any 
changes that you make to the corresponding 
remote file on the iDisk server. You can tell 
that things are updating when that funky little 
yin-yang, circular doodad — the thing next to 
your iDisk in the Finder window — is rotating 
in its animated fashion. (And yes, I have it on 
good authority: That’s what the Apple software 
developers call it, too.)
You’re not required to use a mirror, however. 
To disable the mirroring feature and return 
to the remote-only operation of old, click the 
iDisk Syncing Stop button on the iDisk pane in 
System Preferences to turn it off. Remember, 
though, that with the mirroring feature turned 
off, you must have an Internet connection to 
use iDisk, and things will move more slowly 
because you’re accessing everything across 
the Internet.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Now that you’re thoroughly rooterized, here are the folders that you find 
hanging out in your iDisk:
 
✓ Backup: This is a read-only folder that contains the backup files created 
with the MobileMe Backup application. You can copy the files in this 
folder to a removable drive on your system for an additional level of 
safekeeping.
 
✓ Documents: This folder holds any application documents that you want 
to store — things like spreadsheets and letters. By default, no one but 
you can access these items; you can tag items in the Documents folder 
as shared, allowing individuals or groups to download them using an 
access code sent by MobileMe in an e-mail message. Sharing files is a 
great way to transfer files too big to send as e-mail attachments.
 
✓ Groups: This folder holds files that you want to share with others in any 
MobileMe Groups you might have joined.
 
✓ Library: Another read-only folder. This spot contains the configuration 
data and custom settings that you’ve created for other MobileMe features.
 
✓ Movies: QuickTime movies go here — again, you can add the movies 
stored here to your Web pages.
 
✓ Music: This is the repository for all your iTunes music and playlists, 
and the contents can be added to your Web pages. (iTunes is the star 
of Chapter 11.) My playlists are stuffed full of Mozart, Scarlatti, and that 
Bach fellow.
 
✓ Pictures: This folder is the vault for your JPEG and GIF images, including 
those that you want to use with your Web pages.
 
✓ Public: This is the spot to place files that you specifically want to share 
with others, either directly through iDisk or with your Web pages. If 
you’ve allowed write access, others can copy files to your Public folder 
as well.
 
✓ Sites: The Web pages that you store here can be created with iWeb, 
which I cover in Chapter 16. In fact, you can even use your own Web 
page design application and copy the completed site files here.
 
✓ Software: Apple provides this read-only folder as a service to MobileMe 
members; it contains a selection of the latest freeware, shareware, and 
commercial demos for you to enjoy. To try something out, open the 
Software folder and copy whatever you like to your Mac OS X Desktop. 
Then you can install and run the application from the local copy of 
the files.
 
✓ Web: This folder holds your MobileMe Galleries created from within 
iPhoto, as well as other media used by iWeb.

 Chapter 9: Moving to MobileMe
Opening and Using iDisk
When you’re connected to the Internet, you can open your iDisk in one of the 
following ways:
 
✓ From the Finder menu, choose Go➪iDisk and then choose My iDisk 
from the submenu or use the Ô+Shift+I keyboard shortcut.
 
✓ Click the iDisk icon in the Finder Sidebar.
 
✓ Add an iDisk button to your Finder window toolbar by choosing 
View➪Customize Toolbar.
 
 After you add the button, you can click it to connect to your iDisk from 
anywhere in the Finder.
Your iDisk opens in a new Finder window. After you use one of these meth-
ods in a Mac OS X session, your iDisk icon appears on the Mac OS X Desktop; 
Figure 9-2 shows the iDisk contents in a Finder window. The iDisk volume 
icon remains until you shut down or restart your iMac. (Alternatively, you 
can dismiss the iDisk volume icon from your Desktop using the same method 
by which you eject an external drive: Click the iDisk icon and press Ô+E or 
click the Eject button next to the iDisk icon in the Finder window Sidebar.)
 
Figure 9-2: 
The con-
tents of your 
iDisk — 
pretty iNeat, 
I’m thinking.
 
 
If you’re using a remote PC with an Internet connection, you can log in to the 
MobileMe page at www.me.com and use your Web browser to access the con-
tents of your iDisk. (Hey, sometimes this is the only choice you have.)
However, you don’t actually need to open your iDisk in a Finder window to 
use it, because you can also load and save files directly to your iDisk from 
within any application. Simply choose your iDisk as you would any of the 
hard drives on your system when using the application’s Open, Save, or Save 
As commands.

130
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
You can also open an iDisk Public folder — either yours or the Public folder 
inside another person’s iDisk — as if it were an Internet file server. As I 
explain earlier in the chapter, if that person has set a password, you need 
to enter that password to gain access to all of his or her iDisk folders. From 
the Finder menu, choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s iDisk (or, to jump directly 
to their Public folder, choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s Public Folder). If 
you choose the former, Snow Leopard prompts you for the other person’s 
member name and password; if you pick the latter, you need only enter the 
other MobileMe member’s account name.
After you enter a valid iDisk member name (and password, if required), you 
see the MobileMe member’s Public folder.
 
You can also use the server address
http://idisk.me.com/username-Public?
to connect to an iDisk from computers running Windows and Linux. Check 
the Help for your operating system to determine how to connect to a 
WebDAV server (usually called a Web folder in the Windows world). When 
prompted for your access username and password, use your MobileMe 
account name and password. If you’re using Windows XP, Windows Vista, or 
Windows 7, Apple has provided an even easier way to manage your iDisk: 
Use MobileMe Control Panel for Windows, which you can download from 
www.me.com.

Hooking Up with Handy Helpers
In This Chapter
▶ Adding a printer or a scanner to your system
▶ Using Photo Booth and Front Row
▶ Watching cable or satellite TV on your iMac
T
his chapter is all about getting interesting things into — and out of — 
your iMac. Some are more common (almost mundane these days) and 
pretty easy to take care of, such as scanners and printers. Then I might sur-
prise you with something new to you, like your iMac’s built-in video camera.
I also show you how to turn your iMac into a photo booth. Heck, I’ll even 
describe how you can pull that fancy satellite or cable TV signal into your iMac.
It’s perfectly okay to tell everyone else that you’re watching the financial 
channel. But watching a little football never hurt anyone. . . .
Connecting Printers
All hail the USB port! It’s the primary connection point for all sorts of good-
ies. In this section, I concentrate on adding a local USB printer and the basics 
of adding a network printer to your system. (Find more on connecting a wire-
less Bluetooth printer in the Bonus Chapter at www.mlcbooks.com.)
USB printers
Connecting a USB printer to your iMac is duck soup. Don’t you want all things 
in life were this easy? You might very well be able to skip most of the steps 
in this section entirely, depending on whether your printer came with an 
installation disc. (Virtually all do, of course, but you might have bought yours 
used, say from eBay.)

132
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
Your printer needs to be fully supported within Mac OS X:
 
✓ If the software is designed for earlier versions of Mac OS X (say, v. 10.4 
or v. 10.5), it probably works with Snow Leopard.
 
✓ I always recommend visiting the manufacturer’s Web site to download 
the latest printer driver and support software before you install your 
printer. That way, you know that you’re up to date. (Don’t forget to 
check the Read Me file that accompanies your new software to make 
sure there are no new system requirements!)
 
Save and close open files and applications before installing your printer. You 
might have to restart your iMac to complete the installation.
The physical connections for your printer are pretty simple:
 
✓ Make sure that your printer’s USB cable is plugged in to both your iMac 
and the printer itself. (Naturally, you’ll use one of the iMac’s USB ports 
on the back of the computer.)
 
✓ After the USB connection is made, plug the printer in to an AC wall 
socket and turn it on.
 
Don’t forget to add the paper and check the ink cartridge(s)!
Additional printer installation steps depend on whether you have a manufac-
turer’s installation disc for your printer.
Sure, I’ve got the install disc
If your printer comes with its manufacturer’s installation disc, follow these 
steps when everything is connected and powered on:
 
1. Insert the installation disc in the iMac.
 
 The disc contents usually appear in a Finder window. If they don’t, dou-
ble-click the installation disc icon on the Desktop to open the window.
 
2. Double-click the installation application to start the ball rolling.
 
3. Follow the onscreen instructions.
 
 Files get copied to your hard drive.
 
 You might have to restart your iMac.
You’re ready to print!
 
Don’t forget to visit your printer manufacturer’s Web site to check whether 
any driver updates are available for your particular model.

133
 Chapter 10: Hooking Up with Handy Helpers
Whoops, I’ve got diddly-squat (Software-wise)
Didn’t get an installation CD? Try installing the printer without software, or 
download the software from the manufacturer’s Web site.
Installing without software
If you didn’t get an installation CD with your printer, you might be lucky 
enough that your printer’s driver was included in your installation of Mac OS 
X. First, press Ô+P within an application to display the Print dialog, where 
you can check see whether the printer you connected is already recognized.
If it’s not displayed, here’s how to check for that pesky driver after you con-
nect the printer and switch it on:
 
1. Open the System Preferences window.
 
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
 
3. Click the Add button (which sports a plus sign).
 
4. Check the Printer list in the Printer Setup Utility window to see 
whether your printer has already been added automatically within 
Snow Leopard.
 
 If your printer appears here, dance a celebratory jig. You can close 
System Preferences and choose that printer from the Print dialog in 
your applications. (You can even set it as the default from the System 
Preferences Print & Fax pane. Just click the Default Printer pop-up menu 
to select your new printer.)
Downloading software
If you don’t have installation software and your iMac doesn’t automatically 
match your USB printer with a driver, it’s time to check the Internet to locate 
a Snow Leopard-compatible driver for your printer.
Check the manufacturer’s Web site for your printer’s software. Look for
 
✓ Special software drivers that the printer might need
 
 Install any drivers you find before you run an installation application. 
Otherwise, the installation app might not be able to recognize or config-
ure the printer if the driver hasn’t been installed first.
 
✓ Installation application
 
 If the manufacturer offers an installation application for your printer, 
download the application and run it.

134
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
Network printers
Your wired or wireless Ethernet network provides a quick-and-easy way to 
share any printer that’s connected to your iMac. Follow these steps to share 
your printers across the network with others:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon.
 
3. Select the On check box next to the Printer Sharing service entry.
 
4. Click Close to exit System Preferences.
In most cases, a printer that you share automatically appears in the Print 
dialog on other computers connected to your network. Therefore, if you want 
to access a printer being shared by another Mac across your network, open 
the Print dialog within your application and click the Printer pop-up menu to 
select it.
If the remote printer isn’t listed automatically, you can dig a little further. 
To add a printer that another Mac on your network is sharing to your list of 
printers, follow these steps:
 
1. Click System Preferences on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
 
3. Click the Add button (which carries a plus sign).
 
4. Click the Default button on the toolbar.
 
 Snow Leopard displays all the available local shared printers. Click the 
desired printer and then click Add. (Depending on the built-in support 
within Snow Leopard for the printer you’re accessing or sharing, you 
may have to install the driver on your Mac or the other Macs on your 
network as well.) 
Connecting Scanners
USB and FireWire scanners practically install themselves. As long as the 
model is listed as Mac OS X-compatible and it supports the TWAIN device 
standard (just about all scanners do), things really are plug-and-play. (Not 
sure if a scanner is Mac OS X-compatible? Check the system requirements on 
the scanner’s box or on the manufacturer’s Web site.)

135
 Chapter 10: Hooking Up with Handy Helpers
If you have the scanner manufacturer’s installation disc, go ahead and use 
it. However, most scanners don’t require specialized drivers, so even that 
orphan model that you picked up from Uncle Milton last year should work 
(if it’s recognized by Mac OS X). It doesn’t hurt to check the manufacturer’s 
Web site to see whether any of the software has been updated since the disc 
was produced.
 
If Mac OS X doesn’t support your older scanner, a third-party application 
might be able to help. Get thee hence to Hamrick Software at www.hamrick.
com and download a copy of the latest version of VueScan. This great scan-
ning application supports over 750 scanner models, including a number that 
don’t work with Snow Leopard otherwise. At $40, it’s a world-class bargain, to 
boot.
Ready to go? Make sure that your scanner is powered on and connected to 
your iMac (and that you load a page or photograph to scan). If your scan-
ner’s installation disc provided you with a proprietary scanning application, 
I recommend that you use that application to test your scanner. In fact, it’s 
Mark’s Maxim time!
 
If your printer or scanner includes bundled applications, use them!
Sure, Mac OS X has the Print & Fax pane within System Preferences for print-
ers and the Image Capture application for scanners and digital cameras, 
but these are bare-bones tools compared with the print manager and image 
acquisition software that comes bundled with your hardware. I turn to Snow 
Leopard’s built-in hardware handling stuff only when I don’t have anything 
better.
Hey, I’m not saying that anything’s wrong with Image Capture, which is in 
your Applications folder, if you need to use it. However, don’t expect Image 
Capture to support any specialized features offered by your scanner (like 
one-button e-mail or Web publishing). You have to use the application espe-
cially designed for your manufacturer and model to take advantage of any 
extras that it offers — alternately, many image-editing applications (like 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements) might offer more scanning features than 
Image Capture.
Using Photo Booth and Front Row
Many Apple switchers and first-time owners quickly notice the tiny square 
lens and LED light at the top of the iMac’s svelte frame. What gives?
Mystery solved, good reader: That’s the lens of your iMac’s built-in iSight 
camera, which allows you to capture video or snap a quick fun series of 
photos via Snow Leopard’s Photo Booth application.

136
Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
But there’s more: If you invest in an Apple Remote (sold separately), you can 
control your iMac from the comfort of your lounge chair or breakfast nook 
via Snow Leopard’s Front Row software.
Capturing the moment with Photo Booth
What’s that you say? You’ve never used a computer video camera? Well then, 
good reader, you’ve come to the right place!
The iSight camera’s indicator light glows green whenever you’re taking a 
snapshot or recording video . . . which, when you think about it, is A Good 
Thing (especially if you prefer chatting at home in Leisure Mode).
 
If you need a quick picture of yourself for use on your Web page, or perhaps 
your iChat icon needs an update to show off your new haircut, use Photo 
Booth to capture images at 640 x 480 resolution and 32-bit color. Although 
today’s digital cameras can produce a much higher-quality photo, you can’t 
beat the built-in convenience of Photo Booth for that quick snapshot!
To snap an image in Photo Booth, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Photo Booth from the Dock or from the Applications folder.
 
 Check out that glowing LED!
 
2. (Optional) Click the Effects button to choose an effect you’d like to 
apply to your image.
 
 Photo Booth displays four screens of thumbnail preview images so that 
you can see how each effect changes the photo (see Figure 10-1). To 
move through the thumbnail screens, click the Previous and Next arrow 
buttons that appear around the Effects button.
 
 You can produce some of the simple effects you might be familiar with 
from Photoshop, such as a black-and-white image or a fancy, colored 
pencil filter . . . but it can also deliver some mind-blowing distortion 
effects, and even an Andy Warhol–style pop-art image!
 
 Of course, you can always launch your favorite image editor afterward 
to use a filter or effect on a photo — for example, the effects available in 
iPhoto — but Photo Booth can apply these effects automatically as soon 
as you take the picture.
 
3. (Optional) Click a thumbnail to select the desired effect.
 
 To return the display to normal, click the Normal thumbnail, which 
appears in the center. (Um, that would be Paul Lynde’s spot, for those of 
you old enough to remember Hollywood Squares.)
 
4. Click the Camera button.

The image appears in the film strip at the bottom of the window. Photo Booth 
keeps a copy of all the images you take in the film strip so that you can use 
them later. After you click a photo in the filmstrip, a series of buttons appear, 
inviting you take any one of a series of actions, including
 
✓ Sending the photo in an e-mail message
 
✓ Saving the photo directly to iPhoto
 
✓ Using the image as your Snow Leopard user account icon
 
✓ Using the image as your iChat Buddy icon
 
To delete an image from the Photo Booth filmstrip, click the offending photo 
and then click the X button that appears underneath.

Controlling your iMac remotely 
with Front Row
Okay, you’ve seen some neat stuff so far, but things get really cool about now! 
With Apple’s Front Row software, you can turn your iMac into a multimedia 
presentation center that can show off all your digital media to your adoring 
public (and friends and family to boot). In fact, if you buy an Apple Remote 
($19 from the Apple Store), you don’t even have to leave the comfort of the 
couch to start the show.
The Front Row application performs four different functions:
 
✓ Watching DVD movies with DVD Player: If you already loaded a DVD 
into your optical drive, you can watch it. (Sorry, your iMac doesn’t load 
the DVD for you. I guess some things have to remain manually driven for 
a few years yet.)
 
✓ Viewing photos and slideshows: Front Row calls upon iPhoto so that 
you can see your albums, film rolls, and slideshows.
 
✓ Displaying videos in QuickTime Player: You can choose any video you 
download from the iTunes Music Store or save (in a format recognized 
by QuickTime) to your Movies folder.
 
✓ Coaxing your favorite music, podcasts, and TV shows from your 
iTunes library: Find your media and playlists available from Front Row.
All this is accomplished by using the awesome, infrared Apple Remote. If 
your last computer — the beige box — didn’t have a remote control, don’t 
panic. The remote’s as simple to use as an iPod Shuffle!
 
To launch the application, press the Menu button on the remote. As long as 
your iMac is on, Front Row runs automatically. To put your iMac to sleep after 
a night of fun, press and hold the Select/Play/Pause button.
Table 10-1 includes the important functions of the Apple Remote in Front Row.

Part III: Connecting and Communicating 
 
Your Apple Remote isn’t designed to work with any other third-party applica-
tions at the time of this writing. For example, you can’t use it as a presentation 
aide in PowerPoint. However, some Apple applications do recognize the Apple 
Remote (like Keynote).
Turning Your iMac into 
a TV — And More
Your iMac’s beautiful LCD screen would seem to be the perfect artist’s 
canvas for watching cable or satellite TV broadcasts, but there’s no co-ax 
input on the back of your computer. Therefore, unless you invest in some 
additional hardware, you’re restricted to watching DVD movies.
Such an obvious need is going to be filled quickly, and a number of different 
hardware manufacturers have produced external devices that can merge 
your iMac and your TV signal. Most are USB or FireWire peripherals, and 
many have all the features of today’s TiVo and digital video recorders.
My favorite example is the EyeTV Hybrid Plus, from Elgato (www.elgato.
com), which uses a USB connection. Check out what this superstar includes 
for your investment of $150:
 
✓ Built-in NTSC (analog) and ATSC (digital TV) tuners, cable-ready with a 
coaxial connector
 
✓ The ability to pause, fast-forward, record, or even edit the video you 
stored on your iMac’s hard drive
 
✓ Capability to schedule recordings with an onscreen program guide
 
✓ Full-screen TV display or in a window anywhere on your Desktop
 
✓ No external power supply required
I really love the ability to fast-forward through commercials, and I can take 
anything that I record on my iMac and use it in iDVD and iMovie. The addi-
tion of TV under your control sorta finalizes the whole digital hub thing, now 
doesn’t it?

S
ometimes, words just aren’t enough. iTunes is that kind of perfection.
To envision how iTunes changes your iMac, you have to paint the picture 
with music — music that’s easy to play, easy to search, and easy to transfer 
from device to device. Whether it be classical, alternative, jazz, rock, hip-
hop, or folk, I can guarantee you that you won’t find a better application than 
iTunes to fill your life with your music. And podcasts. And video. And TV 
shows. And Internet radio. (See how hard it is to pin down this wonderful 
application? Along with your iMac, iTunes really does form the hub of your 
digital lifestyle.)
In this chapter, I lead you through all the features of my absolute favorite 
member of the iLife suite . . . and it’s going to be pretty doggone obvious how 
much I appreciate this one piece of software.
What Can I Play on iTunes?
Simply put, iTunes is a media player; it plays audio and video files. These files 
can be in any of many different formats. Some of the more common audio for-
mats that iTunes supports are

144
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
✓ MP3: The small size of MP3 files has made them popular for file trad-
ing on the Internet. A typical CD-quality, three-minute pop song in MP3 
format has a size of 3–5MB.
 
✓ AAC: AAC (short for Advanced Audio Coding) is an audio format that’s 
very similar to MP3; in fact, AAC files offer better recording quality at the 
same file sizes. However, this format originally supported a built-in copy 
protection scheme that prevented AAC music purchased from iTunes 
from being widely distributed on Macs. (Luckily, this copy protection is 
no longer applied to iTunes tracks, and you can still burn protected AAC 
tracks to an audio CD, just as you can MP3 tracks.) The tracks that you 
download from the iTunes Store are in AAC format.
 
 The iTunes Store’s iTunes Plus tracks are also in AAC format, but these 
tracks are not copy-protected, and they’re encoded at a higher-quality 
256 Kbps rate.
 
✓ Apple Lossless: Another format direct from Apple, Apple Lossless 
format provides the best compromise between file size and sound qual-
ity: These tracks are encoded without loss of quality. However, Apple 
Lossless tracks are somewhat larger than AAC, so it’s generally the 
favorite of the most discerning audiophile for his or her entire music 
library.
 
✓ AIFF: The standard Macintosh audio format produces sound of the abso-
lute highest quality. This high quality, however, also means that the files 
are pretty doggone huge. A typical pop song in AIFF format has a size of 
30–50MB (about 10MB per minute of audio).
 
✓ WAV: Not to be outdone, Microsoft created its own audio file format 
(WAV) that works much like AIFF. It can reproduce sound at higher qual-
ity than MP3, but the file sizes are very large, virtually identical in size to 
AIFF files.
 
✓ CD audio: iTunes can play audio CDs. Because you don’t usually store 
CD audio anywhere but on an audio CD, file size is no big whoop.
 
✓ Movies and video: You can buy and download full-length movies, TV 
shows, music videos, and movie trailers from the iTunes Store . . . and, 
with an Apple TV unit connected to your home theater system, you can 
watch those movies and videos from the comfort of your sofa on the 
other side of your house.
 
✓ Podcasts: These audio downloads are like radio programs for your 
iPod — but iTunes can play and organize them, too. Some podcasts also 
include video and photos to boot.
 
✓ Ringtones: iPhone owners, rejoice! iTunes automatically offers to create 
ringtones for your iPhone from the tracks you’ve bought on the iTunes 
Store. (You can also create ringtones with GarageBand, using songs 
you’ve added to your iTunes library.)

 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
 
✓ Audiobooks: No longer do you need cassettes or audio CDs to enjoy 
your spoken books — iTunes can play them for you, or you can send 
them to your iPod for listening on the go.
 
✓ Streaming Internet radio: You can listen to a continuous broadcast of 
songs from one of tens of thousands of Internet radio stations, with qual-
ity levels ranging from what you’d expect from FM radio to the full qual-
ity of an audio CD. You can’t save the music in iTunes, but it’s still great 
fun. (In fact, I run my own station . . . more on MLC Radio later in the 
chapter.)
Playing an Audio CD
To play an audio CD in iTunes, insert the CD in your iMac’s disc slot, start 
iTunes by clicking its icon in the Dock, and click the Play button. (Note that 
your Mac might be set to automatically launch iTunes when you insert an 
audio CD.) The iTunes interface resembles that of a traditional cassette or 
CD player. The main playback controls of the iTunes are Play, Previous Song, 
Next Song, and the volume slider, as shown in Figure 11-1.
 
Figure 11-1: 
The main

Part IV: Living the iLife 
Click the Play button to begin listening to a song. While a song is playing, the 
Play button toggles to a Pause button. Clicking that button again pauses the 
music. 
Click the Next Song button to advance to the next song on the CD. The 
Previous Song button works like the Next Song button but with a slight twist: 
If a song is currently playing and you click the Previous Song button, iTunes 
first returns to the beginning of the current song (just like a CD player). To 
advance to the previous song, double-click the Previous Song button. To 
change the volume of your music, click and drag the volume slider.
As with other Macintosh applications, you can control much of iTunes with 
the keyboard. Table 11-1 lists some of the more common iTunes keyboard 
shortcuts.

Playing Digital Audio and Video
In addition to playing audio CDs, iTunes can play the digital audio files that 
you download from the Internet or obtain from other sources in the WAV, 
AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and MP3 file formats. Enjoying a digital audio 
file is just slightly more complicated than playing a CD. After downloading 
or saving your audio files to your iMac, open the Finder and navigate to the 
stored files. Then simply drag the music files (or an entire folder of music) 
from the Finder into the Music entry in the iTunes Source list. The added files 
appear in the Music section of your iTunes Library. Think of the Library as a 
master list of your digital media. To view the Music Library, select the Music 
entry in the left-hand column of the iTunes player, as shown in Figure 11-2. 
Heck, you can also drag a song file from a Finder window and drop it on the 
iTunes icon in the Dock, which adds it to your Music Library as well.

147
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
 
If you drop the file on top of a playlist name in the Source list, iTunes adds it 
to that particular playlist as well as the main Library. (More about playlists in 
a bit.) If you drop a folder of songs on top of the Playlists header, iTunes cre-
ates a new playlist using the name of the folder and adds all the songs in the 
folder to the new playlist.
 
Figure 11-2: 
The Music 
Library 
keeps track 
of all your 
audio files.
 
To play a song, just double-click it in the Music list. Alternatively, you can use 
the playback controls (Play, Previous Song, and Next Song) that I discuss ear-
lier in this chapter (refer to Figure 11-1).
 
The Source list of iTunes can list up to five possible sources for music:
 
✓ Library: This section includes Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, 
Audiobooks, iPod Games, and Radio. (Think Internet radio, which I dis-
cuss further in the section “iTunes Radio.”)
 
✓ Devices: If an iPod is connected, it appears in the list. (And yes, Virginia, 
other models of MP3 players from other companies will also appear in 
the list if they support iTunes.) If you load an audio CD, it appears in the 
Devices heading . . . anything from the Bee Gees to Fall Out Boy.

148
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
✓ Store: I discuss the iTunes Store in the section “Buying Digital Media the 
Apple Way.”
 
✓ Shared: If another Mac or PC on your local network is running iTunes 
and is set to share part or all of its library, you can connect to the other 
computer for your music. (Shared music on another Mac appears as a 
separate named folder in the Source list.)
 
✓ Playlists: Think of playlists as folders you use to organize your music. 
(More on playlists later in this chapter.)
 
If you’ve invested in an Apple TV, it will appear in the list as well, allowing 
iTunes to share media with your Apple TV, which in turn sends it to your ED- 
or HD-TV.
Notice also that the Library lists information for each song that you add to it, 
such as 
 
✓ Song Name: The title of the song
 
✓ Time: The length of the song
 
✓ Artist: The artist who performs the song
 
✓ Album: The album on which the song appears
If some of the songs that you’re adding don’t display anything for the title, 
album, or artist information, don’t panic; most MP3 files have embedded data 
that iTunes can read. If a song doesn’t include any data, you can always add 
the information to these fields manually. I show you how later, in the section 
“Setting or changing the song information manually.”
 
Clicking any of the column headings in the Library causes iTunes to reorder 
the Library according to that category. For example, clicking the Song Name 
column heading alphabetizes your Library by song title. I click the Time head-
ing often to sort my Library according to the length of the songs. Oh, and you 
can drag column titles to reorder them any way you like (as long as the Name 
column remains at the far left of the named columns).
 
iTunes can display your Music Library in three ways: By default, the applica-
tion uses the list view you see in Figure 11-1, where each song is one entry. 
Click the second View button (at the top of the iTunes window) to group tracks 
together by album artwork in grid view. Click the third View button, and you’re 
browsing by album cover in cover flow view, complete with reflective surface!
Browsing the Library
After you add a few dozen songs to iTunes, viewing the Library can become a 
task. Although a master list is nice for some purposes, it becomes as cumber-
some as an elephant in a subway tunnel if the list is very long. To help out, 

149
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
iTunes can display your Library in another format, too: namely, browsing 
mode. To view the Library in browsing mode, click the View menu and click 
the Show Browser item, or press the Ô+B keyboard shortcut.
The Browse mode of iTunes displays your library in a compact fashion, orga-
nizing your tunes into four sections:
 
✓ Genre
 
✓ Artist
 
✓ Album
 
✓ Song Name
Selecting an artist from the Artist list causes iTunes to display that artist’s 
albums in the Album list. Select an album from the Album list, and iTunes 
displays that album’s songs in the bottom section of the Browse window. 
(Those Apple software designers . . . always thinking of you and me.)
Finding songs in your Music Library
After your collection of audio files grows large, you might have trouble locat-
ing that Swedish remix version of “I’m Your Boogie Man.” To help you out, 
iTunes has a built-in Search function. To find a song, type some text into the 
search field of the main iTunes window. While you type, iTunes tries to find a 
selection that matches your search text. The search is quite thorough, show-
ing any matching text from the artist, album, song title, and genre fields in the 
results. For example, if you type electronic into the field, iTunes might return 
results for the band named Electronic or other tunes that you classified as 
electronic in the Genre field. (The section “Know Your Songs,” later in this 
chapter, tells you how to classify your songs by genre, among other options.) 
Click the magnifying glass at the left side of the Search field to restrict the 
search by Artists, Albums, Composers, and Songs.
Removing old music from the Library
After you spend some time playing songs with iTunes, you might decide that 
you didn’t really want to add 40 different versions of “Louie Louie” to your 
Library. (Personally, I prefer either the original or the cast from the movie 
Animal House.) To remove a song from the Library, click the song to select it 
and then press the Delete key on your keyboard.

150
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
You can also remove a song from the Library by dragging it to the Trash in 
your Dock.
Watching video
Watching video in iTunes is similar to listening to music. To view your video 
collection, click one of these entries in the Source list:
 
✓ Movies
 
✓ TV Shows
If you select Movies or TV Shows, iTunes displays your videos as thumbnails 
or in cover flow view. Music videos appear as a smart playlist.
From your collection, you can
 
✓ Double-click a video thumbnail or an entry in the list.
 
✓ Drag a QuickTime video clip from the Finder window to the iTunes 
window. Video files that can be viewed using QuickTime typically have 
file extensions ending in .mov or .mp4.
iTunes plays video in the box below the Source list, within the iTunes 
window, in a separate window, or in full-screen mode, depending on the set-
tings you’ve chosen on the General pane in the iTunes Preferences window. 
In full-screen mode, move your pointer to display a control strip at the 
bottom of the screen. The control strip sports a slider bar that you can drag 
to move through the video, a volume control, Play/Pause, and Fast Forward/
Reverse buttons.
Will I trash my Count Basie?
Novice iTunes users, take note: iTunes watches 
your back when you trash tracks.
To illustrate: Suppose you delete a song from 
the Library that’s located only in the iTunes 
music folder (which you didn’t copy into iTunes 
from another location on your hard drive). That 
means you’re about to delete the song entirely, 
and there’ll be no copy remaining on your 
iMac at all. Rest assured, though, that iTunes 
prompts you to make sure that you really want 
to move the file to the Trash. (I get fearful e-mail 
messages all the time from readers who are 
loath to delete anything from iTunes because 
they’re afraid they’ll trash their digital music 
files completely.)
Remember: If you delete a song from the Library 
that also exists elsewhere on your hard drive 
(outside the reach of the iTunes music folder), 
it isn’t deleted from your hard drive. In fact, if 
you mistakenly remove a song that you meant 
to keep, just drag it back into iTunes from the 
Finder, or even from the Trash. ’Nuff said.

151
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady 
Apart: Organizing with Playlists
Your iTunes Music Library can contain thousands upon thousands of songs: 
If your Library grows anywhere near that large, finding all the songs in your 
lifelong collection of Paul Simon albums is not a fun task. Furthermore, with 
the Library, you’re stuck playing songs in the order that iTunes lists them.
To help you organize your music into groups, use the iTunes playlist feature. 
A playlist is a collection of some of your favorite songs from the Library. You 
can create as many playlists as you want, and each playlist can contain any 
number of songs. Whereas the Library lists all available songs, a playlist dis-
plays only the songs that you add to it. Further, any changes that you make 
to a playlist affect only that playlist, leaving the Library intact.
To create a playlist, you can do any of the following:
 
✓ Choose File➪New Playlist.
 
✓ Press Ô+N.
 
✓ Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. This creates a new playlist 
and automatically adds any tracks that are currently selected.
 
✓ Click a song to select it; then click the Genius button at the lower-
right corner of the window. (The Genius button bears a striking “atom” 
symbol.) iTunes builds a playlist of songs that are similar in some 
way (typically by matching the genre of the selection or the beats 
per minute, but also based on recommendations from other iTunes 
members). Your iMac needs an Internet connection to create a Genius 
playlist, and the larger your music library the longer it will take iTunes 
to build the playlist.
 
✓ Click the iTunes DJ entry in the Playlist section on the left side of the 
window. iTunes delivers a random selection of songs taken from your 
iTunes Music Library — perfect for your next spontaneous party! You 
can change the order of the songs in the iTunes DJ playlist (known as 
Party Shuffle in older versions of iTunes), add songs from your Library, 
or delete songs that don’t fit the scintillating ambience of your gather-
ing. Enjoy!
 
✓ Click the New Playlist button in the iTunes window (the plus sign 
button in the lower-left corner). You get a newly created empty playlist 
(the toe-tappin’ untitled playlist).

152
Part IV: Living the iLife 
All playlists appear in the Source list. To help organize your playlists, it’s a 
good idea to . . . well, name them. (Aren’t you glad now that you have this 
book?) For example, suppose that you want to plan a party for your polka-
loving friends. Instead of running to your computer after each song to change 
the music, you could create a polka-only playlist. Select and start the playlist 
at the beginning of the party, and you won’t have to worry about changing 
the music the whole night. (You can concentrate on the accordion.) To load a 
playlist, select it in the Source list; iTunes displays the songs for that playlist.
The same song can appear in any number of playlists because the songs in a 
playlist are simply pointers to songs in your Music Library — not the songs 
themselves. Add and remove them at will to or from any playlist, secure in 
the knowledge that the songs remain safe in the Library. Removing a playlist 
is simple: Select the playlist in the Source list and then press Delete.
 
Removing a playlist doesn’t actually delete any songs from your Library.
Some playlists are smarter than others
Click the File menu and you’ll see the New 
Smart Playlist menu command. The contents of 
a smart playlist are automatically created from 
a specific condition or set of conditions that you 
set via the Smart Playlist dialog: You can limit 
the track selection by mundane things, such as 
album, genre, or artist; or you can get funky and 
specify songs that were played last, or by the 
date you added tracks, or even by the sampling 
rate or total length of the song. For example, 
iTunes can create a playlist packed with songs 
that are shorter than three minutes, so you can 
fill your iPod Shuffle with more stuff! Ah, but 
wait, you’re not limited to a single criterion. If 
you want to add another criterion, click the plus 
sign at the right side of the dialog and you get 
another condition field to refine your selection 
even further.
You can choose the maximum songs to add to 
the smart playlist, or limit the size of the playlist 
by the minutes or hours of play or the number 
of megabytes or gigabytes the playlist will 
occupy. (Again, great for automatically gather-
ing as much from your KISS collection as will fit 
into a specific amount of space on a CD or your 
iPod.) Mark the Live Updating check box for the 
ultimate in convenience. iTunes automatically 
maintains the contents of the smart playlist to 
keep it current with your conditions at all times 
in the future. (If you remove tracks manually 
from a smart playlist, iTunes adds other tracks 
that match your conditions.)
Now think about what all these settings mean 
when combined . . . whoa. Here’s an example 
yanked directly from my own iTunes library. I 
created a smart playlist that selects only those 
songs in the Rock genre. It’s limited to 25 songs, 
selected by least often played, and live updat-
ing is turned on. The playlist is named Tracks 
I’ve Gotta Hear because it finds the 25 rock 
songs (from my collection of 1,654 songs) that 
I’ve heard least often! After I listen to a song 
from this smart playlist, iTunes automatically 
“freshens” it with another song, allowing me 
to catch up on the tracks I’ve been ignoring. 
Completely, unbelievably sweet — and another 
reason that iTunes is the best music player on 
Planet Earth!

153
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
Know Your Songs
Besides organizing your music into Elvis and non-Elvis playlists, iTunes gives 
you the option to track your music at the song level. Each song that you add 
to the Music Library has a complete set of information associated with it. 
iTunes displays this information in the Info dialog, including
 
✓ Name: The name of the song
 
✓ Artist: The name of the artist who performed the song
 
✓ Composer: The name of the astute individual who actually wrote 
the song
 
✓ Album Artist: The name of the artist responsible for a compilation or 
tribute album
 
✓ Album: The album where the song appears
 
✓ Grouping: A group type that you assign
 
✓ Year: The year the artist recorded the song
 
✓ BPM: The beats per minute (which indicates the song’s tempo)
 
✓ Track Number: The position of the song on the original album
 
✓ Disc Number: The original disc number in a multi-CD set
 
✓ Comments: A text field that can contain any comments on the song
 
✓ Genre: The classification of the song (such as rock, jazz, or pop)
You can display this information by clicking a song name and pressing Ô+I — 
the fields appear on the Info tab.
Setting the song information 
automatically
Each song that you add to the iTunes Music Library might have song informa-
tion included with it. If you add music from a commercial audio CD, iTunes 
connects to a server on the Internet and attempts to find the information for 
each song on the CD. If you download a song from the Internet, it often comes 
with some information embedded in the file already; the amount of included 
information depends on what the creator supplied. (And believe me, it’s often 
misspelled as well — think Leenard Skeenard.) If you don’t have an Internet 
connection, iTunes can’t access the information and displays generic titles 
instead.

154
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Setting or changing the song 
information manually
If iTunes can’t find your CD in the online database or someone gives you an 
MP3 with incomplete or inaccurate information, you can change the informa-
tion yourself — believe me, you want at least the artist and song name, as 
well as the genre! To view and change the information for a song, perform the 
following steps:
 
1. Select the song in either the Music Library list or a Playlist.
 
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info.
 
3. Edit the song’s information under the Info tab, as shown in Figure 11-3.
Keep in mind that the more work you put into setting the information of 
the songs in your Music Library, the easier it is to browse and use iTunes. 
Incomplete song information can make it more difficult to find your songs in 
a hurry. If you prefer, you don’t have to change all information about a song 
(it just makes life easier later if you do). Normally, you can get away with set-
ting only a song’s title, artist, and genre. The more information you put in, 
however, the faster you can locate songs and the easier they are to arrange. 
iTunes tries to help by automatically retrieving known song information, but 
sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work. (Sorry, but 
the Data Elves are out to lunch.)

“What about cover art, Mark?” Well, I’m overjoyed that you asked! iTunes 
can try to locate artwork automatically for the tracks you select. (Note that 
adding large images can significantly increase the size of the song file.) 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the desired songs from the track list.
 
2. Click Advanced➪Get Album Artwork.
 
You can set iTunes to automatically attempt the addition of album artwork 
every time you rip tracks from an audio CD, or when you add songs without 
artwork to your Music Library. Click iTunes and choose Preferences; then 
click the Store button and click the Automatically Download Missing Album 
Artwork check box to enable it.
 
Want to manually add album covers to your song info? Select one (or all) of 
the songs from a single album in the track list, display the Info dialog, and 
click the Artwork tab. Now launch Safari, visit Amazon.com, and do a search 
on the same album. Drag the cover image from the Web page right into the 
Info dialog, and drop it on top of the “sunken square” image well. When you 
click OK, the image appears in the Summary pane, and you can display it while 
your music is playing by pressing Ô+G, or by pressing the Show or Hide Song 
Artwork button at the lower left of the iTunes window! (Note that adding large 
images can significantly increase the size of the song file.)
 
By the way, if you buy tracks or an album from the iTunes Store, Apple always 
includes album covers automatically. Thanks, Steve!
Ripping Audio Files
You don’t have to rely on Internet downloads to get audio files: You can 
create your own MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV files from your 
audio CDs with iTunes. The process of converting audio files to different 
formats is called ripping. (Audiophiles with technical teeth also call this pro-
cess digital extraction, but they’re usually ignored at parties by the popular 
crowd.) Depending on what hardware or software you use, each has its own 
unique format preferences. For example, most iPod owners prefer MP3 or 
AAC files, but your audio CDs aren’t in that format. Being able to convert files 
from one format to another is like having a personal translator in the digital 
world. You don’t need to worry if you have the wrong format: You can simply 
convert it to the format that you need.
The most common type of ripping is to convert CD audio to AAC or MP3 
format. To rip MP3s from an audio CD, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Launch iTunes by clicking its icon in the Dock.
 
 Alternatively, you can locate it in your Applications folder.

156
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
2. Load an audio CD into your iMac.
 
 The CD title shows up in the iTunes Source list (under the Devices head-
ing), which is on the left side of the iTunes window. The CD track listing 
appears on the right side of the window.
 
 If iTunes asks you whether you want to import the contents of the CD 
into your Music Library, you can click Yes and skip the rest of the steps; 
however, if you’ve disabled this prompt, just continue with the remain-
ing two steps.
 
3. Click the CD entry under the Devices listing.
 
4. Click the Import Settings button.
 
5. Choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu.
 
6. Choose High Quality (160 Kbps) from the Setting pop-up menu and 
then click OK.
 
 This bit rate setting provides the best compromise between quality and 
file size (tracks you rip will be significantly smaller than “audiophile” bit 
rates such as 192 Kbps or higher).
 
7. Clear the check box of any song that you don’t want to import from 
the CD.
 
 All songs on the CD have a check box next to their title by default. 
Unmarked songs aren’t imported.
 
8. After you select the songs that you want added to the Library, click 
the Import CD button.
Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
Besides the standard volume controls that I mention earlier in this chapter, 
iTunes offers a full equalizer. An equalizer permits you to alter the volume of 
various frequencies in your music, allowing you to boost low sounds, lower 
high sounds, or anything in between. Now you can customize the way your 
music sounds and adjust it to your liking.
To open the Equalizer (as shown in Figure 11-4), do one of the following:
 
✓ Choose Window➪Equalizer.
 
✓ Press Ô+Option+2.

157
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
The Equalizer window has an impressive array of 11 sliders. Use the left-most 
slider (Preamp) to set the overall level of the Equalizer. The remaining slid-
ers represent various frequencies that the human ear can perceive. Setting 
a slider to a position in the middle of its travel causes that frequency to 
play back with no change. Move the slider above the midpoint to boost that 
frequency; conversely, move the slider below the midpoint to reduce the 
volume of that frequency.
Continue adjusting the equalizer sliders until your music sounds the way 
you like it. When you close the Equalizer window, iTunes remembers your 
settings until you change them again. In case you prefer to leave frequen-
cies to the experts, the iTunes Equalizer has several predefined settings to 
match most musical styles. Click the pop-up menu at the top of the Equalizer 
window to select a genre.
After you adjust the sound to your satisfaction, close the Equalizer window 
to return to the iTunes interface and relax with those funky custom notes 
from James Brown.

A New Kind of Radio Station
Besides playing back your favorite audio files, iTunes can also tune in 
Internet radio stations from around the globe. You can listen to any of a large 
number of preset stations, seek out lesser-known stations not recognized 
by iTunes, or even add your favorite stations to your playlists. This section 
shows you how to do it all.
iTunes Radio
Although it’s not a radio tuner in the strictest sense, iTunes Radio can locate 
virtual radio stations all over the world that send audio over the Internet — a 
process usually dubbed streaming amongst the “in” Internet crowd. iTunes 
can track down hundreds of Internet radio stations in a variety of styles with 
only a few clicks.
To begin listening to Internet radio with iTunes, click the Radio icon located 
beneath the Library icon in the Source list. The result is a list of more than 20 
types of radio stations, organized by genre.
When you expand a Radio category by clicking its triangle, iTunes queries a 
tuning server and locates the name and address of dozens of radio stations 
for that category. Whether you like Elvis or not-Elvis (those passing fads, 
like new wave, classical, or alternative), something’s here for everyone. The 
Radio also offers news, sports, and talk radio.
After iTunes fetches the names and descriptions of radio stations, double-
click one that you want to hear. iTunes immediately jumps into action, loads 
the station, and begins to play it.
Tuning in your own stations
Although iTunes offers you a large list of popular radio stations on the Web, 
it’s by no means comprehensive. Eventually, you might run across a radio 
station that you’d like to hear, but it’s not listed in iTunes. Luckily, iTunes 
permits you to listen to other stations, too. To listen to a radio station that 
iTunes doesn’t list, you need the station’s Web address.
In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Open Audio Stream (or press Ô+U). In the 
Open Stream dialog that appears (as shown in Figure 11-5), enter the URL of 
your desired radio station and then click OK. Within seconds, iTunes tunes in 
your station.

159
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
What’s with the numbers next 
to the station names?
When choosing an Internet radio station, keep 
your Internet connection speed in mind. If 
you’re using a broadband DSL or cable connec-
tion — or if you’re listening at work over your 
company’s high-speed network — you can 
listen to stations broadcasting at 128 Kbps (or 
even higher). The higher the bit rate, the better 
the music sounds. At 128 Kbps, for example, 
you’re listening to sound that’s almost as good 
as an audio CD.
However, if you’re listening over a dial-up 
modem connection, iTunes can’t keep up with 
audio streaming at higher bit rates, so you’re 
limited to stations broadcasting at 56 Kbps or 
lower.

Radio stations in your playlists
If you find yourself visiting an online radio station more than once, you’ll be 
glad to know that iTunes supports radio stations in its playlists. To add a 
radio station to a playlist from the Radio list, do the following:

160
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
1. Open the category that contains the station you want to add to your 
playlist.
 
2. Locate the station that you want to add to your playlist and drag it 
from the Radio list to the desired playlist on the left.
 
 If you haven’t created any playlists yet, see the section “Keeping Slim 
Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists” earlier in this 
chapter to find out how.
Adding a radio station that doesn’t appear in the Radio list is a bit trickier but 
possible nonetheless. Even though iTunes allows you to load a radio station 
URL manually by using the Open Stream command in the Advanced menu, it 
doesn’t give you an easy way to add it to the playlist. Follow these steps to 
add a specific radio station to a playlist:
 
1. Add any radio station from the Radio list to your desired playlist.
 
 Any station in the list will do, as you’ll immediately change both the sta-
tion’s URL and name to create your new station entry in the Playlist.
 
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info to bring up the information dialog 
for that station.
 
3. Click the Summary section and change the URL by clicking the Edit 
URL button.
 
4. Enter the desired URL and click OK.
 
5. Click the Info tab, type the new station name, and then click OK.
iSending iStuff to iPod
If you’re lucky enough (like me) to own an iPod, you’ll be happy to know that 
iTunes has features for your personal audio and video jukebox as well. iPods, 
Apple’s multimedia players, comprise an entire family of portable devices 
(ranging from $59 to about $399) that can hold anywhere from about 300 songs 
to literally thousands of songs, as well as podcasts, photos, and video. This 
great gadget and those like it have become known worldwide as the preferred 
portable digital media player. (Heck, even the iPhone can act as an iPod!)
You connect your iPod to any Macintosh or Windows PC with USB 2.0 ports 
with the included cable. After the iPod’s connected, you can synchronize 
the iPod with iTunes. By default, this process is automatic: The iPod and the 
iTunes software communicate with each other and figure out what items are 
in your iTunes Library (as compared with the iPod Library). If they discover 
songs, podcasts, and video in your iTunes Library that are missing from your 
iPod, the items automatically transfer to the iPod. Conversely, if the iPod con-
tains stuff that’s no longer in iTunes, the iPod automatically removes those 
files from its drive.

161
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
 
Go back and reread that last sentence above about the iPod automatically 
removing files from its drive. (I’ll wait here.) Apple added this feature in an 
effort to be attentive to copyright concerns. The reasoning is that if you con-
nect your iPod to your friend’s computer, you can’t transfer songs from the 
iPod to that computer. Of course, you could always look at it from the market-
ing perspective as a feature that makes sure your iMac and iPod are always in 
total sync. Whatever the case, pay close attention and read all warning dialogs 
when connecting to a computer other than your own, or you might wipe out 
your iPod’s library.
You can change your settings so that iTunes auto-syncs only selected playl-
ists. Or if you’re really nervous, you can manually sync your iPod with 
iTunes.
 
This chapter — even as long as it is — just can’t explain all the ins and outs 
of the iTunes/iPod relationship! For a complete look at both iTunes and the 
iPod, I can heartily recommend a fellow For Dummies book, iPod & iTunes For 
Dummies, 7th Edition, by Tony Bove (Wiley Publishing).
Sharing Media across a Network
Ready to share music, podcasts, and video — legally, mind you — with other 
folks on your local network? You can offer your digital media to other iTunes 
users across your home or office. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog.
 
2. Click Sharing.
 
3. Select the Share My Library on My Local Network check box.
“I have an itch to hear ‘Kung Fu Fighting’!”
This particular technology author has a prefer-
ence for a certain hot Net jam spot: MLC Radio, 
the Internet radio station I’ve been running for 
several years now. I call my station a ’70s Time 
Machine because it includes hundreds of clas-
sic hits from 1970–1979, inclusive. You hear 
everything from “Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo” 
by Rick Derringer to “Moonlight Feels Right” by 
Starbuck. (Hey, I’m summing up a decade here, 
so be prepared for both Rush and the Captain 
and Tennille, too.) The station broadcasts at 
128 Kbps (near audio CD quality), so you need a 
broadband connection to listen. For the radio’s 
Internet address or help connecting to MLC 
Radio, visit my Web site at www.mlcbooks.
com — and then follow the steps in the next 
section to add MLC Radio to your playlists!

162
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
4. Specify whether you want to share your entire library or only selected 
playlists and files.
 
 Sharing selected playlists is a good idea for those Meatmen and Sex 
Pistols fans who work at a cubicle farm in a big corporation.
 
5. If you want to restrict access to just a few people, select the Require 
Password check box; then type a password in the text box.
 
6. Click OK.
Your shared folder appears within the Source list for all iTunes users who 
enabled the Look for Shared Libraries check box on the same pane of their 
iTunes Preferences dialog. Note that the music you share with others can’t 
be imported or copied, so everything stays legal.
 
Want to change that frumpy default name for your shared media library to 
something more exotic, like “Dan’s Techno Beat Palace”? No problem — 
display the Preferences dialog again, but this time click the General button 
and click in the Library Name text box. Edit your network entertainment per-
sona to your heart’s content.
Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles
Besides being a great audio player, iTunes is adept at creating CDs, too. 
iTunes makes the process of recording songs to a CD as simple as a few 
clicks. Making the modern version of a compilation (or mix) tape is easier 
than getting a kid to eat ice cream. iTunes lets you burn CDs in one of three 
formats:
 
✓ Audio CD: This is the typical kind of commercial music CD that you buy 
at a store. Most typical music audio CDs store 700MB of data, which 
translates into about 80 minutes of music.
 
✓ Data CD or DVD: A standard CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is recorded with the 
audio files. This disc can’t be played in any standard audio CD player 
(even if it supports MP3 CDs, which I discuss next). Therefore, you can 
listen to these songs only by using iTunes (or another media player) on 
an iMac or a PC.
 
✓ MP3 CD: As does the ordinary computer CD-ROM that I describe, an 
MP3 CD holds MP3 files in data format. However, the files are arranged 
in such a way that they can be recognized by audio CD players that sup-
port the MP3 CD format (especially boom boxes, DVD players, personal 
CD players, and car stereos). Because MP3 files are so much smaller 
than the digital audio tracks found on traditional audio CDs, you can fit 
as many as 160 typical 4-minute songs on one disc. These discs can also 
be played on your iMac via iTunes.

163
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
 
Keep in mind that MP3 CDs aren’t the same as the standard audio CDs that 
you buy at the store, and you can’t play them in older audio CD players that 
don’t support the MP3 CD format. Rather, this is the kind of archival disc that 
you burn at home for your own collection.
To begin the process, build a playlist (or select an existing playlist that you 
want to record). If necessary, create a new Playlist and add to it whatever 
songs you would like to have on the CD. (See the earlier section, “Keeping 
Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists,” if you need a 
refresher.) With the songs in the correct order, select the playlist. Click the 
Burn Disc button at the bottom of the iTunes window to commence the disc 
burning process. Click the desired recording format (again, usually Audio 
CD) in the Burn Settings dialog that appears.
 
To save yourself from sonic shock, I always recommend that you enable the 
Sound Check check box before you burn. iTunes will adjust the volume on all 
the songs on your audio CD so that they’ll play at the same volume level.
Ready to go? Click OK, and iTunes lets you know when the recording is 
complete.
Feasting on iTunes Visuals
By now, you know that iTunes is a feast for the ears, but did you know that 
it can provide you with eye candy as well? With just a click or two, you can 
view mind-bending graphics that stretch, move, and pulse with your music, 
as shown in Figure 11-6.
Sending music elsewhere with AirTunes
If you’re using an AirPort Express portable wire-
less Base Station, you can ship your songs right 
to your Base Station from within iTunes, and 
from there to your home stereo or boom box! 
After your AirPort Express Base Station is 
plugged in and you connect your home stereo 
(or a boom box, or a pair of powered stereo 
speakers) to the stereo minijack on the Base 
Station, you see a Speakers pop-up list button 
appear at the bottom of the iTunes window. 
(If the Speakers button doesn’t appear, choose 
iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences 
dialog and click the Devices button on the 
toolbar. Make sure that the Look for Remote 
Speakers Connected with AirTunes check box 
is enabled.)
Click the Speakers button, and you can choose 
to broadcast the music you’re playing in iTunes 
across your wireless network. Ain’t technology 
truly grand?

164
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
Figure 11-6: 
iTunes 
can dis-
play some 
awesome 
patterns!
 
To begin viewing iTunes visuals, choose View➪Show Visualizer (or press 
Ô+T). Immediately, most of your iTunes interface disappears and begins 
displaying groovy lava lamp-style animations (like, sassy, man). To stop the 
visuals, choose View➪Hide Visualizer (or press Ô+T again). The usual sunny 
aluminum face of iTunes returns.
Backing up within iTunes
iTunes offers a built-in backup feature for your 
media library — I told you this was the best 
media player ever designed!
Choose File➪Library➪Back Up to Disc to 
start the process. You can choose to back up 
your entire iTunes library and all your playlists 
(which I recommend) or just the content you’ve 
purchased from the iTunes Store. Personally, 
if I lost everything in my collection except for 
what I’ve bought from the iTunes Store, I’d be 
just as crushed. Back it all up, and you won’t 
be sorry.
Click Back Up, and iTunes will prompt you for 
blank CDs or DVDs. If you need to restore from 
your completed backup, just launch iTunes and 
load the first backup disc into your drive.
How often is often enough when it comes 
to backing up your content? That depends 
completely on how often your media library 
changes. The idea is to back up often enough 
so that you always have a recent copy of your 
media files close by.

165
 Chapter 11: The Multimedia Joy of iTunes
You can also change the viewing size of the iTunes visuals in the View menu. 
From the View menu item, choose Full Screen (or press Ô+F). To escape from 
the Full Screen mode, move the mouse or press Esc.
 
You can still control iTunes with the keyboard while the visuals are zooming 
around your screen. See Table 11-1 earlier in this chapter for a rundown on 
common keyboard shortcuts.
The iTunes Visualizer has many hidden features. While viewing the 
Visualizer, press ? to see a list of hidden Visualizer settings.
But wait, more Easter eggs are to be found! Again, while viewing the 
Visualizer, press one of following keys:
 
✓ M: Changes the Visualizer pattern
 
✓ P: Changes the Visualizer color scheme
Press either of these keys repeatedly to cycle through the various patterns 
and color schemes lurking deep within the Visualizer. (Personally, I’m a 
random Visualizer guy . . . there are so many patterns and schemes, I just let 
my iMac do all the work.)
Additionally, you’ll find third-party Visualizer plug-ins available for download-
ing on Apple’s Web site and other Mac-related download sites — heck, some 
even display lyrics, karaoke-style! Choose a different Visualizer plug-in from 
the View➪Visualizer menu item. (Call me old-fashioned, but I like the default, 
iTunes Visualizer.)
Buying Digital Media the Apple Way
Before we wave goodbye to the happy residents of iTunes iSland, I won’t 
forget to mention the hottest spot on the Internet for buying music and video: 
the iTunes Store, which you can reach from the cozy confines of iTunes. 
(That is, as long as you have an Internet connection. If you don’t, it’s time 
to turn the page to a different chapter.) If you’re not in iTunes, go to www.
apple.com/itunes/store.
Click the iTunes Store item in the Source list, and after a few moments you’re 
presented with the latest offerings. Click a link in the store list to browse 
according to media type, or click the Power Search link to search by song 
title, artist, album, or composer. The Back/Forward buttons at the top of 
the iTunes Store window operate much the same as those in Safari, moving 
you backward or forward in sequence through pages you’ve already seen. 
Clicking the Home button (which, through no great coincidence, looks like a 
miniature house) takes you back to the Store’s main page.

166
Part IV: Living the iLife 
To display the details on a specific album, track, video, podcast, or audio-
book (whew), just click it. If you’re interested in buying just certain tracks 
(for that perfect road warrior mix), you get to listen to 30 seconds of any 
track — for free, no less, and at full sound quality. To add an item to your 
iTunes Store shopping cart, click the Add Song/Movie/Album/Video/Podcast/
Audiobook button (sheesh!). When you’re ready to buy, click the Shopping 
Cart item in the Source list and then click the Buy Now button. (At the time 
of this writing, tracks are usually 99 cents a pop, and an entire album is typi-
cally $9.99 . . . what a bargain! 
The iTunes Store creates an account for you based on your e-mail address, 
and it keeps secure track of your credit card information for future pur-
chases. After you use the iTunes Store once, you never have to log in or 
retype your credit card information again (as long as you’re logged in using 
your account).
The tracks and files that you download are saved to a separate playlist called 
Purchased. After the download is finished, you can play them, move them 
to other playlists, burn them to CD or DVD, share ’em over your network, or 
ship them to your iPod, just as you can any other item in your iTunes Library.
You can also put the Genius button to work for you, in league with the iTunes 
store. Click the Show Genius Sidebar button at the lower-right corner of the 
iTunes window — it looks like an arrow inside a square — and iTunes dis-
plays the Genius Sidebar, where iTunes recommends music that you can buy 
on the iTunes Store that’s similar to the albums in your Music Library. Click 
the button again to banish the sidebar.
Remember all those skeptics who claimed that buying digital audio and video 
could never work over the Internet because of piracy issues and high costs? 
Well, bunkie, hats off to Apple: Once again, our favorite technology leader 
has done something the right way!

Chapter 12
The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
In This Chapter
▶ Importing pictures from your hard drive or digital camera
▶ Organizing images with iPhoto
▶ Tweaking the appearance of photographs
▶ Sharing photos with your friends
V
irtually every iMac owner is likely to have a digital camera or a scan-
ner. Digital video (DV) camcorders have certainly grown more plentiful 
over the past three or four years, and the iPod is the hottest piece of music 
hardware on the planet at the time of this writing. The digital camera, how-
ever, has reached what those funny (strange) marketing people refer to as 
saturation, and iPhoto was written to address the needs of every person with 
a digital camera and an iMac!
With iPhoto, you organize, edit, and even publish your photographs. (It 
sports more features than a handful of Swiss Army knives.) After you shoot 
your photos with a digital camera, you can import them into iPhoto, edit 
them, and publish them. You’re not limited to photos that you take yourself, 
either; you can edit, publish, and organize all kinds of digital image files. You 
can even create a photo album and use the iPhoto interface to order a hand-
some hard-bound copy shipped to you.
To sum it all up, I’m willing to bet that iPhoto is either the first or the second 
iLife ’09 application that you fall in love with (running neck and neck with 
iTunes). In this chapter, I show you how you can work digital image magic 
with true Apple panache!
Delving into iPhoto
In Figure 12-1, you can see most of the major controls offered in iPhoto ’09. 
(Other controls automatically appear when you enter different modes; I 
cover them in upcoming sections of this chapter.)

Enter Full Screen button
Although these controls and sections of the window are covered in more 
detail in the following sections, here’s a quick rundown of what you’re 
looking at:
 
✓ Source list: This list of image locations determines which photos iPhoto 
displays.
 
• You can choose to display either your entire image library or just 
the last “roll” of digital images that you downloaded from your 
camera.
 
• You can create new albums of your own that appear in the source 
list; albums make it much easier to organize your photos.
 
• Photos can be grouped by Event (when they were taken), Faces 
(who appears in the photos), Places (where photos were taken) 
and Albums (the traditional method you may be familiar with from 
older versions of iPhoto).
 
• You can create books, calendars, cards, and slideshows.

169
 Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
 
✓ Viewer: This pane displays the images from the currently selected 
photo source.
 
 You can drag or click to select photos in the Viewer for further tricks, 
such as assigning keywords and image editing.
 
✓ Create button: Click this button to add a new blank album, smart album, 
MobileMe gallery, book, calendar, card, or slideshow to your source list.
 
✓ Get Info button: Click this button to display information on the cur-
rently selected photos.
 
✓ Enter Full Screen button: Click this button to switch to a full-screen 
display of your photos. In full-screen mode, the images in the selected 
album appear in a filmstrip across the top of the screen, and you can 
click one to view that image using your Mac’s entire screen real estate. 
You can also use the same controls that I discuss later in this chapter 
for editing and adjusting images; just move the cursor to the top edge of 
the full-screen display to show the menu or to the bottom edge to show 
the editing toolbar.
 
✓ Play Slideshow: Select an event, album, book or slideshow in the Source 
list (or multiple images you’ve selected in the Viewer) and click this 
button to start a full-screen slideshow using those images.
 
✓ Search box: Click the button next to the Search text box to locate 
photos by specific criteria, or just click in the box and start typing to 
search by description and title.
 
✓ Toolbar buttons: This group of buttons selects an operation you want 
to perform on the images you’ve selected in the Viewer. (Note that the 
toolbar buttons you see may depend on your screen resolution. If you 
resize the iPhoto window so that it is sufficiently small, some toolbar 
buttons will “collapse” into a Keepsakes button with a drop-down menu 
attached.)
 
✓ Thumbnail Resize slider: Drag this slider to the left to reduce the size of 
the thumbnails in the Viewer. This allows you to see more thumbnails at 
one time, which is a great boon for quick visual searches. Drag the slider 
to the right to expand the size of the thumbnails, which makes it easier 
to differentiate details between similar photos in the Viewer.
Working with Images in iPhoto
Even a superbly designed image display and editing application, such as 
iPhoto ’09, would look overwhelming if everything were jammed into one 
window. Thus, Apple’s developers provide different operation modes (such 
as editing and book creation) that you can use in the one iPhoto window. 
Each mode allows you to perform different tasks, and you can switch modes 
at just about any time by clicking the corresponding toolbar button.

170
Part IV: Living the iLife 
In this section, I discuss three of these modes — import, organize, and edit — 
and what you can do when you’re in them. Then I conclude the chapter with 
sections on publishing and sharing your images.
Import Images 101
In import mode, you’re ready to download images directly from your digital 
camera — as long as your specific camera model is supported in iPhoto. 
The Apple iPhoto support page at www.apple.com/macosx/upgrade/
cameras.html lists many of the cameras that are supported in iPhoto.
Follow these steps to import images:
 
1. Connect your digital camera to your iMac.
 
 Plug one end of a USB cable into your camera and the other end into 
your iMac’s USB port, and prepare your camera to download images.
 
2. Launch iPhoto.
 
 Your iMac will probably launch iPhoto automatically when your camera 
is detected, but you can always launch iPhoto manually by clicking its 
icon in the Dock (or double-clicking it in your Applications folder).
 
3. Type an event name for the imported photos, such as Birthday Party or 
Godzilla Ravages Tokyo (depending on your birthday parties, this could 
be the same event).
 
4. Type a description for the Event.
 
5. To allow iPhoto to automatically separate images into separate events 
based on the date they were taken, click to select the Autosplit Events 
after Importing check box.
 
6. Click the Import All button to import your photographs from the 
camera.
 
 The images are added to your Photo Library, where you can organize 
them as you want.
 
 To select specific images to import, hold down the Ô key and click each 
desired photo; then click Import Selected instead of Import All.
 
7. Specify whether the images you’re importing should be deleted from 
the camera afterward.
 
 If you don’t expect to download these images again to another com-
puter or another device, you can choose to delete the photos from your 
camera automatically. This saves you a step, frees space for new photos, 
and helps eliminate the guilt that can crop up when you nix your pix. 
(Sorry, I couldn’t resist.)

171
 Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
“What’s that about an Event, Mark?” After you download the contents of your 
digital camera, those contents count as a virtual Event in iPhoto — based 
on either the date that you imported them or the date they were taken. For 
example, you can always display the last images you imported by clicking 
Last Import. If you want to see photos from your son’s graduation, they 
appear as a separate Event. (Both of these organizational tools will appear 
in the source list.) Think about that . . . it’s pretty tough to arrange old-
fashioned film prints by the moment in time that they document, but iPhoto 
makes it easy for you to see just which photos are part of the same group! I 
explain more about Events in the next section.
Organize mode: Organizing and 
sorting your images
In the days of film prints, you could always stuff another shoebox with your 
latest photos or buy another sticky album to expand your library. Your 
digital camera, though, stores images as files instead, and many folks don’t 
print their digital photographs. Instead, you can keep your entire collection 
of digital photographs and scanned images well ordered and easily retrieved 
by using iPhoto’s organize mode. Then you can display them in a slideshow, 
e-mail them, print them, use them as Desktop backgrounds, or burn them to 
an archive disc.
Importing images from your hard drive
If you have a folder of images that you’ve 
collected already on your hard drive, a CD, a 
DVD, an external drive, or a USB Flash drive, 
adding them to your library is easy. Just drag 
the folder from a Finder window and drop it into 
the Albums header (within the source list in the 
iPhoto window). iPhoto automatically creates a 
new album using the folder name, and you can 
sit back while the images are imported into that 
new album. iPhoto recognizes images in sev-
eral formats: JPEG, GIF, RAW, PNG, PICT, PSD, 
PDF, and TIFF.
If you have individual images, you can drag 
them as well. Select the images in a Finder 
window and drag them into the desired album 
in the source list. To add them to the album cur-
rently displayed in the Viewer, drag the selected 
photos and drop them in the Viewer instead.
If you’d rather import images by using a stan-
dard Mac Open dialog, choose File➪Import to 
Library. Simplicity strikes again!

172
Part IV: Living the iLife 
A new kind of photo album
The most familiar method of organizing images in iPhoto is the album. Each 
album can represent any designation you like, be it a year, a vacation, your 
daughter, or your daughter’s ex-boyfriends. Follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new album.
 
 You can either choose File➪New Album or click the plus (+) button at 
the bottom of the source list. Click the Album button at the top of the 
sheet to display the settings you see in Figure 12-2.
 
2. Type the name for your new photo album.
 
 If you want to create an empty album (without automatically includ-
ing any images that might be selected), make sure you click the Use 
Selected Items in New Album check box to deselect it.
 
3. Click OK.
 
Figure 12-2: 
Add a new 
album in 
iPhoto.
 

173
 Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
iPhoto also offers a special type of album called a Smart Album, which you 
can create from the File menu. (For even faster action, hold down the Option 
key while you click the Add button.) A Smart Album contains only photos 
that match certain criteria that you choose, using the keywords and rating 
that you assign your images. Other criteria text in the photo filenames, dates 
the images were added to iPhoto, and any comments you might have added. 
Now here’s the really nifty angle: iPhoto automatically builds and maintains 
Smart Albums for you, adding new photos that match the criteria (and delet-
ing those that you remove from your Photo Library)! Smart Albums carry a 
gear icon in the source list.
You can display information about the currently selected item in the informa-
tion pane under the source list. Just click the Show Information button at the 
bottom of the iPhoto window, which sports the familiar “i-in-a-circle” logo. 
You can also type a short note or description in the Description box that 
appears in the Information pane. For more in-depth information, select the 
desired item and then press Ô+I.
 
You can also change information on an image by selecting it in the Viewer and 
clicking the Show Information button. Click any of the headings in the pane 
(Title, Date, Time, and so on) to display a text edit box, and you can simply 
click in either box to type a new name or alter the photo’s date stamp.
You can drag images from the Viewer into any album you choose. For exam-
ple, you can copy an image to another album by dragging it from the Viewer 
to the desired album in the Source list.
To remove a photo that has fallen out of favor, follow these steps:
 
1. In the source list, select the desired album.
 
2. In the Viewer, select the photo (click it) that you want to remove.
 
3. Press Delete.
 
When you remove a photo from an album, you don’t remove the photo from 
your collection (which is represented by the Photos entry under the Library 
heading in the source list). That’s because an album is just a group of links to 
the images in your collection. If you want to completely remove an offending 
photo from iPhoto, click the Photos entry under the Library heading to dis-
play your entire collection of images and delete the picture there. The photo 
disappears from all albums with which it is associated.
To remove an entire album from the source list, just click it in the source list 
to select it — in the Viewer, you can see the images that it contains — and 
then press Delete. (Alternatively, right-click or Control-click the offending 
album and choose Delete Album.)

174
Part IV: Living the iLife 
To rename an album, click the entry under the Albums heading in the Source 
list to select it and then click again to display a text box. Type the new album 
name and press Return.
 
Change your mind? iPhoto comes complete with a handy-dandy Undo feature. 
Just press Ô+Z, and it’s as though your last action never happened. (A great 
trick for those moments when you realize you just deleted your only image of 
your first car from your Library.)
Arranging stuff by Events
As I mention earlier, an Event is a group of images that you shot or down-
loaded at the same time — iPhoto figures that those images belong together 
(which is usually a pretty safe assumption). Figure 12-3 illustrates some of 
the Events I’ve created in my iPhoto collection.
 
As can an album, an Event can be renamed — you just use a different proce-
dure. Click the Events entry under the Library heading in the Source list to 
display your Events in the Viewer; then click the existing Event name in the 
caption underneath the thumbnail. A text box appears in which you can type a 
new name; click Return to update the Event.
Try moving your cursor over an Event thumbnail in the Viewer and you’ll see 
that iPhoto displays the date range when the images were taken, as well as 
the total number of images in the Event. Ah, but things get really cool when 
you move your cursor back and forth over an Event with many images: The 
thumbnail animates and displays all the images in the Event, without your 
using old-fashioned scroll bars or silly arrows! (Why can’t I think of this stuff? 
This is the future, dear readers.)
 
Notice that “i-in-a-circle” that appears when you hover your cursor over an 
Event thumbnail? Click it to display the location where the shot was taken, 
using the Places feature I describe in a page or two.
To display the contents of an Event in the Viewer, just double-click the Event 
thumbnail. To return to the Events thumbnails, click the All Events button at 
the top of the Viewer.
 
Decided to merge those Prom Event pictures with your daughter’s Graduation 
Event? No problem! You could drag one Event thumbnail on top of another, 
but that’s the easy way. Alternatively, click the Events entry under the Library 
heading in the Source list to display your Events and then hold down Ô while 
you click the Events that you want to merge. Click the Merge button in the 
toolbar at the bottom of the window, or click Events➪Merge Events. (Forgot 
about that menu bar, didn’t you?) Click Merge in the confirmation dialog that 
appears.

your Photo library into your new Event.
Working with Faces and Places
iPhoto ’09 includes two new organizational tools called Faces and Places. 
These two categories now appear in the Library section of the Source list.
First, let’s tackle Faces. This feature is a sophisticated recognition system 
that automatically recognizes human faces within the photos that you add 
to your Library. (I don’t know whether it works well with pets — but you can 
try, anyway.) Naturally, you have to identify faces first before iPhoto can rec-
ognize them, which it does through a process called tagging.
To tag a face, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Source list, click the Photos item to display your image library.
 
2. In the Viewer, click the photo with a person you want to tag.
 
 The photo is selected, as indicated by the yellow border.

176
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
3. Click the Name button in the iPhoto toolbar at the bottom of the 
window.
 
 iPhoto displays the tagging pane you see in Figure 12-4. Note that iPhoto 
has indicated each person’s face in the photo with a label.
 
4. If the face is unrecognized (labeled as unnamed), click the label to 
open a text box and type the person’s name.
 
 If iPhoto recognizes the face correctly and the name matches the 
person, click the check mark to confirm the tag. If the face is incorrectly 
identified, click the X and you can enter a new name.
 
 If the name appears on an Address Book contact card, you can click the 
matching entry that appears to confirm the identity. Wowzers!
 
 If iPhoto doesn’t recognize a face at all in the photo (which can happen 
if the person’s face is turned at an angle to the camera, or is in a darker 
area of the photo), click the Add Missing Face button, and iPhoto places 
a box in the center of the image. Drag the box over the person’s face. If 
necessary, you can resize the box using the four handles at the corners 
of the box. Now you can click the label and type the person’s name.

177
 Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
 
5. Press Return to save the face.
 
 Notice the expansion button that appears next to the person’s name? 
Click it, and iPhoto displays other photos that likely contain this per-
son’s face, allowing you to tag them there as well.
 
6. Click Done after you’ve identified all the faces in the photo.
After you’ve tagged an image, it appears in your Faces collection, which you 
can view by clicking the Faces entry in the Source list. You can click a por-
trait in your Faces collection to see all the images that contain that person. 
As you might expect, the more tags you add for a specific person, the better 
iPhoto gets at recognizing that person!
Places makes it easy to track the location where photos were taken, but 
it requires a digital camera that includes GPS tracking information in the 
image metadata. (This is a relatively new feature for digital cameras, so older 
models aren’t likely to support GPS tracking.) Places also requires an Internet 
connection, because it uses Google Maps.
Click the Places entry in the Source list to display a global map, with push-
pins indicating where your photos were taken. You can switch the Places 
map between terrain and satellite modes, or choose a hybrid display. If 
you’re familiar with Google Maps, these settings are old friends of yours.
Alternatively, click the List View button to display a character-based 
browser, where you can click on country, state, and city names.
No matter which view mode you choose, clicking a pushpin or location dis-
plays the images taken in that area.
Organizing with keywords
“Okay, Mark, albums, Events, Faces, and Places are great ideas, but there 
has to be a way to search my collection by category!” Never fear, good iMac 
owner. You can also assign descriptive keywords to images to help you orga-
nize your collection and locate certain pictures fast. iPhoto comes with a 
number of standard keywords, and you can create your own as well.
To illustrate, suppose you’d like to identify your images according to 
special events in your family. Birthday photos should have their own key-
word, and anniversaries deserve another. By assigning keywords, you can 
search for Elsie’s sixth birthday or your silver wedding anniversary (no 
matter what Event or album they’re in), and all related photos with those 
keywords appear like magic! (Well, almost like magic. You need to choose 
View➪Keywords, which toggles the Keyword display on and off in the 
Viewer.)

178
Part IV: Living the iLife 
iPhoto includes a number of keywords that are already available:
 
✓ Favorite
 
✓ Family
 
✓ Kids
 
✓ Vacation
 
✓ Birthday
 
✓ Movie
 
✓ Checkmark
 
What’s the Checkmark all about, you ask? It’s a special case: Adding this key-
word displays a tiny check mark icon in the bottom-right corner of the image. 
The checkmark keyword comes in handy for temporarily identifying specific 
images because you can search for just your checkmarked photos.
To assign keywords to images (or remove keywords that have already been 
assigned), select one or more photos in the Viewer. Choose Window➪Show 
Keywords or press Ô+K to display the Keywords window, as shown in 
Figure 12-5.
Click the keyword buttons that you want to attach to the selected images 
to mark them. Or click the highlighted keyword buttons that you want to 
remove from the selected images to disable them.
You’re gonna need your own keywords
I’ll bet you take photos of things other than just 
kids and vacations — and that’s why iPhoto 
allows you to create your own keywords. 
Display the iPhoto Keywords window by press-
ing Ô+K, clicking the Edit Keywords button, and 
then clicking Add (the button with the plus sign). 
iPhoto adds a new unnamed keyword to the list 
as an edit box, ready for you to type its name.
You can rename an existing keyword from this 
same window, too. Click a keyword to select it 
and then click Rename. Remember, however, 
that renaming a keyword affects all the images 
that were tagged with that keyword. That might 
be confusing when, for example, photos origi-
nally tagged as Family suddenly appear with the 
keyword Foodstuffs. To remove an existing key-
word from the list, click the keyword to select it 
and then click the Delete button, which bears 
a minus sign.

179
 Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto

Digging through your library with keywords
Behold the power of keywords! To sift through your entire collection of 
images by using keywords, click the magnifying glass button next to the 
Search box at the bottom of the iPhoto window and then choose Keyword 
from the pop-up menu. iPhoto displays a pop-up Keywords panel, and you 
can click one or more keyword buttons to display just the photos that carry 
those keywords.
 
The images that remain in the Viewer after a search must have all the key-
words that you specified. If an image is identified, for example, by only three 
of four keywords you chose, it isn’t a match and it doesn’t appear in the 
Viewer. (You can create a Smart Album with specific keywords to get around 
this limitation.)
 
To search for a photo by words in its description, just click in the Search box 
and start typing. You can also click that same magnifying glass by the Search 
box to search through your images by date and rating as well. 
Speaking of ratings . . .

180
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Playing favorites by assigning ratings
Be your own critic! iPhoto allows you to assign any photo a rating of any-
where from zero to five stars. I use this system to help me keep track of the 
images that I feel are the best in my library. Select one (or more) image and 
then assign a rating using one of the following methods:
 
✓ Choose Photos➪My Rating and then choose the desired rating from the 
pop-up submenu.
 
✓ Use the Ô+0 through Ô+5 shortcuts.
Sorting your images just so
The View menu provides an easy way to arrange your images in the Viewer 
by a number of different criteria. Choose View➪Sort Photos and then click 
the desired sort criteria from the pop-up submenu. You can arrange the dis-
play by date, keyword, title, or rating. If you select an album in the source 
list, you can also choose to arrange photos manually, which means that you 
can drag and drop thumbnails in the Viewer to place them in the precise 
order you want them.
 
Naturally, iPhoto allows you to print selected images, but you can also send 
photos directly to iWeb for use on your MobileMe Web site. Click Share➪Send 
to iWeb and then choose either Photo Page or Blog from the submenu. iPhoto 
automatically sends the selected images or album to iWeb and launches the 
application! You can also use iPhoto’s Web Gallery feature to get your photos 
on the Web. (More on the Web Gallery at the end of this chapter.)
Edit mode: Removing and fixing 
stuff the right way
Not every digital image is perfect — just look at my collection if you need 
proof. For those shots that need a pixel massage, iPhoto includes a number 
of editing tools that you can use to correct common problems.
The first step in any editing job is to select the image you want to fix in the 
Viewer. Then click the Edit button on the iPhoto toolbar to switch to the Edit 
mode controls, as shown in Figure 12-6. Now you’re ready to fix problems, 
using the tools that I discuss in the rest of this section. (If you’re editing a 
photo that’s part of an Event, album, Faces, or Places, note the spiffy scroll-
ing photo strip at the top, which allows you to switch to another image to 
edit from the same grouping.)
When you’re done with Edit mode, click the . . . (wait for it) . . . Done button!

181
 Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto

problems!
 
Rotating tipped-over shots
If an image is in the wrong orientation and needs to be turned to display cor-
rectly, click the Rotate button to turn it once in a counterclockwise direction. 
Hold down the Option key while you click the Rotate button to rotate in a 
clockwise direction.
Crop ’til you drop
Does that photo have an intruder hovering around the edges of the subject? 
You can remove some of the border by cropping an image, just as folks once 
did with film prints and a pair of scissors. (We’ve come a long way.) With 
iPhoto, you can remove unwanted portions of an image; it’s a great way to get 
Uncle Milton’s stray head (complete with toupee) out of an otherwise perfect 
holiday snapshot.
Follow these steps to crop an image:
 
1. Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar.
 
2. Select the portion of the image that you want to keep.

182
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 In the Viewer, click and drag the handles on the rectangle to outline the 
part of the image that you want. Remember, whatever’s outside this 
rectangle disappears after the crop is completed.
 
 When you drag a corner or edge of the outline, a semi-opaque grid 
(familiar to amateur and professional photographers as the nine squares 
from the Rule of Three) appears to help you visualize what you’re claim-
ing. (Check it out in Figure 12-7.)
 
3. (Optional) Choose a preset aspect ratio.
 
 If you want to force your cropped selection to a specific aspect ratio — 
such as 4 x 3 or 16 x 9 for an iDVD project — click the Constrain check 
box and select that ratio from the Constrain pop-up menu.
 
4. Click the Apply button.
 
 Oh, and don’t forget that you can use iPhoto’s Undo feature if you mess 
up and need to try again. Just press Ô+Z.
 
iPhoto features multiple Undo levels, so you can press Ô+Z several times to 
travel back through your last several changes.

 Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
Straightening what’s crooked
Was your camera slightly tilted when you took the perfect shot? Never fear! 
Click the Straighten button and then drag the slider to tilt the image in the 
desired direction. Click the Close button to return to Edit mode.
Enhancing images to add pizzazz
If a photo looks washed out, click the Enhance button to increase (or 
decrease) the color saturation and improve the contrast. Enhance is auto-
matic, so you don’t have to set anything. 
Removing rampant red-eye
Unfortunately, today’s digital cameras can still produce the same “zombies 
with red eyeballs” as traditional film cameras. Red-eye is caused by a cam-
era’s flash reflecting off the retinas of a subject’s eyes, and it can occur with 
both humans and animals. (I’m told pets get green-eye, but iPhoto can handle 
them, too!)
iPhoto can remove that red- and green-eye and turn frightening zombies 
back into your family and friends! Click the Red-Eye button and then select 
a demonized eyeball by clicking in the center of it. (If the new eyeball is too 
small or too large, drag the Size slider to adjust the dimensions.) To complete 
the process, click the X in the button that appears in the image.
Retouching like the stars
The iPhoto Retouch feature is perfect for removing minor flecks or lines in an 
image (especially those you’ve scanned from prints). Click Retouch and you’ll 
notice that the cursor turns into a crosshair; just drag the cursor across the 
imperfection. 
Switching to black-and-white or sepia
Ever wonder whether a particular photo in your library would look better 
as a black-and-white (or grayscale) print? Or perhaps an old-fashioned sepia 
tone in shades of copper and brown? Just click the Effects button to display 
the Effects window, which offers eight different effects you can apply to the 
photo.
Adjusting photo properties manually
Click Adjust to perform manual adjustments to brightness and contrast (the 
light levels in your image), as well as the sharpness, shadow, and highlight 
levels. To adjust a value, make sure that nothing’s selected in the image and 
then drag the corresponding slider until the image looks the way you want. 
Click the Close button to return to Edit mode.

184
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
While you’re editing, you can use the Next and Previous buttons at the lower-
right corner of the iPhoto window to move to the next image in the current 
group (or back to the previous image).
Producing Your Own Coffee-Table 
Masterpiece
Book mode unleashes what I think is probably the coolest feature of iPhoto: 
the chance to design and print a high-quality bound photo book! After you 
complete an album — all the images have been edited just the way you want, 
and the album contains all the photos you want to include in your book — 
iPhoto can send your images as data over the Internet to a company that 
prints and binds your finished book for you. (No, they don’t publish For 
Dummies titles, but then again, I don’t get high-resolution color plates in most 
of my books, either.)
At the time of this writing, you can order many different sizes and bindings, 
including an 8.5-by-11-inch soft-cover book with 20 double-sided pages for 
about $20 and a hardbound 8.5-by-11-inch keepsake album with 10 double-
sided pages for about $30 (shipping included for both). Extra pages can be 
added for about $0.70 and $1.00 a pop, respectively.
iPhoto ’09 can also produce and automatically order calendars and greeting 
cards, using a process similar to the one I describe in this section for produc-
ing a book. Who needs that stationery store in the mall anymore?
 
If you’re going to create a photo book, make sure that the images have the 
highest quality and highest resolution. The higher the resolution, the better 
the photos look in the finished book. I personally always try to use images of 
over 1,000 pixels in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions.
To create a photo book, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the desired album in the source list to select it.
 
2. Click the Keepsakes toolbar button and click Book from the pop-up 
menu.
 
 Depending on your screen resolution, iPhoto may have room to display 
the Book button by itself — no big deal, because things work the same.
 
3. Select the size of the book and a theme.
 
 Your choices determine the number of pages and layout scheme, as well 
as the background graphics for each page.

185
 Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
 
4. Click Choose.
 
 You’ll see the controls shown in Figure 12-8.
 
 In Book mode, the Viewer changes in subtle ways. It displays the current 
page at the bottom of the display and adds a scrolling row of thumbnail 
images above it. This row of images represents the remaining images 
from the selected album that you can add to your book. You can drag 
any image thumbnail into one of the photo placeholders to add it to the 
page. You can also click the Page button at the left of the thumbnail strip — 
it looks like a page with a turned-down corner — to display thumbnails 
of each page in your book. (To return to the album image strip, click the 
Photos button under the Page button.)
 
5. Rearrange the page order to suit you by dragging the thumbnail of 
any page from one location to another in the strip.
 
6. In the Book toolbar below the page view, you can adjust a variety of 
settings for the final book, including the book’s theme, background, 
page numbers, and text fonts.
 
 At this point, you can also add captions and short descriptions to the 
pages of your photo album. Click any one of the text boxes in the page 
display and begin typing to add text to that page.

7. When you’re ready to publish your book, click the Buy Book button.
 
8. In a series of dialogs that appears, iPhoto guides you through the final 
steps to order a bound book.
 
 Note that you’re asked for credit card information, so have that plastic 
ready.
 
I wouldn’t attempt to order a book using a dial-up modem connection. The 
images are likely far too large to be sent successfully. If possible, use a broad-
band or network connection to the Internet while you’re ordering. If your only 
connection to the Internet is through a dial-up modem, I recommend saving 
your book in PDF format and having it printed at a copy shop or printing ser-
vice instead. (Choose File➪Print and then click the Save as PDF button.)
I really need a slideshow
You can use iPhoto to create slideshows! Click 
the album or Event you want to display and click 
the Add button; then choose Slideshow from the 
toolbar and click Create. Notice that iPhoto adds 
a Slideshow item in the source list. The same 
scrolling thumbnail strip appears at the top of 
the Viewer — this time displaying the images 
in the album or Event. Click and drag the thumb-
nails so that they appear in the desired order.
To choose background music for your slide-
show, click the Music button in the Slideshow 
toolbar to display Apple’s theme music, as 
well as the tracks from your iTunes library. To 
choose a standard theme, click the Source 
pop-up menu and choose Theme Music; then 
select that perfect song and click Apply. To 
choose an iTunes song or playlist, click the 
Source pop-up menu and choose either the 
Music item (for your entire library) or a playlist. 
You can also create a custom playlist by select-
ing the Custom Playlist for Slideshow check 
box. Then, drag the individual songs you want 
to the song list at the bottom of the sheet. (You 
can drag them to rearrange their order in the 
list as well.) Click Apply to accept your song list.
To configure your slideshow, click the Settings 
button in the Slideshow toolbar and click the 
All Slides tab. In the dialog that appears, you 
can specify the amount of time that each slide 
remains on the screen, as well as an optional 
title and rating displays. You can choose the 
transition that occurs between photos, too, or 
specify a random transition each time. iMac 
owners appreciate the Aspect Ratio pop-up 
menu, which allows you to choose a 16:9 wide-
screen display for your slideshow.
Click the This Slide tab to modify the settings for 
a specific slide (useful for keeping a slide on-
screen for a longer period of time or for setting 
a different transition than the default transition 
you choose from the Slideshow toolbar). I can 
recommend the Automatic Ken Burns effect — 
yep, the same one in iMovie — which lends 
an animated movement to the selected image. 
You can also set the selected photo to display 
in black and white, sepia, or antique coloring.
To display a preview of a single slide and its 
transitions, click the desired slide and then 
click Preview; this is a handy way of determin-
ing whether your delay and transition settings 
are really what you want for a particular slide. 
When you’re ready to play your slideshow, click 
the Play button, and iPhoto switches to full-
screen mode. You can share your completed 
slideshow by clicking Share in the iPhoto menu, 
where you can send the slideshow to iDVD (for 
later burning onto a DVD) or send it through 
e-mail.

 Chapter 12: The Masterpiece That Is iPhoto
You’ll Love MobileMe Gallery!
iPhoto ’09 includes a feature called MobileMe Gallery that does for images 
what podcasting does for audio: You can share your photos with friends, 
family, business clients, and anyone else with an Internet connection! (Your 
adoring public doesn’t even require a Mac; it can use That Other Kind of 
Computer.) iPhoto automatically uploads the selected images and leads you 
through the process of creating a new Web page to proudly display your 
photos. However, you must be a MobileMe subscriber to use the MobileMe 
Gallery feature. If you haven’t heard the news on Apple’s MobileMe service 
yet, see Chapter 9 for the details.
To create a MobileMe Gallery, you designate one or more photos in the 
Viewer (or even select entire albums or Events in the Source list) and then 
click the Add button. Click the MobileMe toolbar button in the sheet that 
appears to display the Web Gallery settings.
Type a name for your new Web Gallery. You can elect to show the title of 
each photo, allow your visitors to download your images or upload their 
own, and even allow photos to be uploaded by other computer owners using 
an e-mail or a Web browser!
 
By default, any visitor to your MobileMe Web site can see your gallery. But 
what if you prefer a little security for those images? In that case, click the 
Album Viewable By pop-up menu, where you can limit your viewing audience 
(you can even require that your visitors enter a login name and password 
before they can receive your photos).
Click Publish, and you’ll see that iPhoto indicates that your images are being 
uploaded with a cool twirling progress icon to the right of the album in the 
source list. When the process is complete, iPhoto indicates that the photos 
appear in a MobileMe Gallery with a new heading in the Source list. You’re on 
the air!
Now for the other side of the coin: By selecting your MobileMe Gallery in the 
Source list and clicking Tell a Friend in the iPhoto toolbar, iPhoto automati-
cally prepares an e-mail message in Apple Mail that announces your new 
Gallery! Just add the recipient names and click Send. This spiffy message 
includes instructions for
 
✓ Folks using iPhoto ’09 on a Mac: As you can imagine, this is the easi-
est receive option to configure. After these folks are subscribed, they 
get an automatically updated album of the same name that appears in 
their source list, and they can use those images in their own iPhoto proj-
ects! From within iPhoto, your visitors can subscribe to your MobileMe 
Gallery by clicking File➪Subscribe to Photo Feed and entering the sub-
scription URL.

188
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
✓ Folks using Windows or an older version of iPhoto: These subscribers 
can use any Web browser with RSS support (such as the Safari browser 
that comes with Snow Leopard and is available from Apple for Windows) 
or any RSS reader. (In effect, your MobileMe Gallery becomes an RSS 
feed for those without iPhoto ’09.)
 
By default, any changes you make to the contents of your MobileMe Gallery 
are updated automatically on your MobileMe account, and, in turn, are 
updated automatically to everyone who receives your images. You can turn 
this feature off, however, if you have a large number of images and you update 
often (which can result in your sister’s computer downloading a lot of data). 
To display the Check for New Photos setting for MobileMe Gallery, click 
iPhoto➪Preferences and click the Web button on the Preferences window 
toolbar. (You can also change the title for your Gallery and monitor your iDisk 
usage from this pane.)
Mailing Photos to Aunt Mildred
iPhoto can help you send your images through e-mail by automating the pro-
cess. The application can prepare your image and embed it automatically in a 
new message.
To send an image through e-mail, select it and then click the Email button 
in the toolbar. The dialog, as shown in Figure 12-9, appears, allowing you to 
choose the size of the images and whether you want to include their titles, 
descriptions, and Places location information as well.
 
Keep in mind that most ISP (Internet service provider) e-mail servers don’t 
accept an e-mail message that’s more than 3MB or 4MB, so watch that Size 
display. If you’re trying to send a number of images and the size goes over 
2MB, you might have to click the Size pop-up menu and choose a smaller size 
(reducing the image resolution) to get them all embedded in a single message.
When you’re satisfied with the total file size and you’re ready to create your 
message, click the Compose button. iPhoto automatically launches Apple 
Mail (or whatever e-mail application you specify) and creates a new message 
containing the images, ready for you to click Send!

Is that Facebook and Flickr I spy?
Indeed it is! iPhoto ’09 introduces a direct con-
nection to both your Facebook social network-
ing account (at www.facebook.com) and 
your Flickr online gallery account (at www.
flickr.com), allowing you to simply select 
one or more photos and send them auto-
matically to either service! These two buttons 
appear on the toolbar when you’re organizing 
your photos.
The first time you select photos in the Viewer 
(or an album or Event in the Source list) and 
click either button, iPhoto prompts you for per-
mission to set up your connection. (Of course, 
this will require you to enter your Facebook and 
Flickr account information — hence the confir-
mation request.) Click Set Up and provide the 
data that each site requires.
After you’ve set up your accounts, simply select 
your photos, albums, or Events and click the 
toolbar button for the desired service. Apple, 
you absolutely rock!

Making Film History with iMovie
In This Chapter 
▶ Taking stock of the iMovie window
▶ Importing and adding media content
▶ Using transitions in your movie
▶ Putting text titles to work
▶ Sharing your movie with others
R
emember those home movies that you used to make in high school? 
They were entertaining and fun to create, and your friends were 
impressed. In fact, some kids are so downright inspired that you’re not sur-
prised when you discover at your high school reunion that they turned out to 
be graphic artists, or got involved in video or TV production.
iMovie, part of the iLife ’09 suite, makes moviemaking as easy as those home-
made movies. Apple simplified all the technical stuff, such as importing video 
and adding audio, leaving you free to concentrate on your creative ideas. In 
fact, you won’t find techy terms such as codecs or keyframes in this chapter 
at all. I guarantee that you’ll understand what’s going on at all times. (How 
often do you get a promise like that with video-editing software?)
With iMovie, your digital video (DV) camcorder, and the other parts of the 
iLife suite, you can soon produce and share professional-looking movies, with 
some of the same creative transitions and titles used by Those Hollywood 
Types every single day. All on your iMac, all by yourself.
If you turn out to be a world-famous Hollywood Type Director in a decade or 
so, don’t forget the little people along the way!
Shaking Hands with the iMovie Window
If you’ve ever tried a professional-level video-editing application, you proba-
bly felt as though you were suddenly dropped in the cockpit of a jumbo jet. In 
iMovie, though, all the controls you need are easy to use and logically placed.

192
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
Video-editing software takes up quite a bit of desktop space. In fact, you can’t 
run iMovie at resolutions of less than 1024 x 768, and even the minimum is far 
too constrained for most iMovie users.
To launch iMovie, click the iMovie icon in the Dock. (It looks like a star from 
the Hollywood Walk of Fame.) You can also click the Application folder in any 
Finder window sidebar and then double-click the iMovie icon.
To follow the examples I show you here, follow these strenuous steps and 
create a new movie project:
 
1. Click the File menu and choose New Project (or press Ô+N).
 
 iMovie displays the sheet you see in Figure 13-1.
 
2. Type a name for your project.
 
3. Select the aspect ratio (or screen dimensions) for your movie.
 
 You can select a widescreen display (16:9), a standard display (4:3), or 
a display especially suited for an iPhone (3:2). If compatibility with the 
familiar SDTV format is important, I always recommend that you choose 
standard (4:3) ratio; choosing 16:9 for an SDTV set will result in those 
familiar black “letterbox” bars at the top and bottom of the screen. On 
the flip side, choosing 4:3 results in pillarboxing (black bars on the left 
and right) when shown on an HD set.

4. Click a thumbnail to select a theme to apply to your finished movie.
 
 If you choose a theme, iMovie automatically adds the transitions and 
titles that correspond to that theme. (Normally, this is what you want to 
do. However, if you want to add transitions and titles manually, click the 
Automatically Add Transitions and Titles check box to deselect it.)
 
 If you decide not to use a theme (by selecting the None thumbnail), 
iMovie can still add an automatic effect between clips. Click the 
Automatically Add check box and click the pop-up menu to choose the 
desired effect.
 
5. Click Create.
 
 You’re on your way! Check out Figure 13-2: This is the whole enchilada, 
in one window.
The controls and displays that you’ll use most often follow:
 
✓ Monitor: Think of this as being just like your TV or computer monitor. 
Your video clips, still images, and finished movie play here. You’ll also 
crop and rotate your video within the monitor.
 
✓ Browser toolbar: This row of buttons allows you to switch between 
your media clips (video clips, photos, and audio) and the various tools 
that you use to make your film. The selected items fill the right side of 
the browser pane below the monitor.
 
✓ Event pane: All the video clips that you use to create your movie are 
stored in the Event pane. I show you what each of the panes in the iMovie 
workspace looks like when you tackle different tasks in this chapter.
 
✓ Project pane: iMovie displays the elements that you’ve added to your 
movie project in this pane.
 
✓ Playhead: The red vertical line that you see in the Event and Project 
panes is the playhead, which indicates the current editing point while 
you’re creating your movie. When you’re playing your movie, the play-
head moves to follow your progress through the movie.
 
✓ Editing toolbar: This strip of buttons allows you to control editing func-
tions such as cropping, audio, and video adjustments, voiceovers, and 
selecting items.
 
✓ Camera Import window: Click this switch to import DV clips from your 
DV camcorder or iSight camera.
Those are the major highlights of the iMovie window. A director’s chair and 
megaphone are optional, of course, but they do add to the mood.

A Bird’s-Eye View of Moviemaking
I don’t want to box in your creative skills here — after all, you can attack 
the moviemaking process from a number of angles. (Pun, unfortunately, 
intended.) However, I’ve found that my movies turn out the best when I 
follow a linear process, so before I dive into specifics, allow me to provide 
you with an overview of moviemaking with iMovie.
Here’s my take on the process, reduced to seven steps:
 
1. Import your video clips either directly from your DV camcorder, 
iSight camera, or your hard drive.
 
2. Drag your new selection of clips from the Event pane to the Project 
pane and arrange them in the desired order.
 
3. Import or record audio clips (from iTunes, GarageBand, or external 
sources, such as audio CDs or audio files that you’ve recorded your-
self) and add them to your movie.

195
 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
 
4. Import your photos (directly from iPhoto or from your hard drive) and 
place them where needed in your movie.
 
5. Add professional niceties, such as voiceovers, transitions, effects, and 
text to the project.
 
6. Preview your film and edit it further if necessary.
 
7. Share your finished film with others through the Web, e-mail, or a 
DVD that you create and burn with iDVD.
 
As you might imagine, this chapter simply can’t hold a full description of 
every setting and every procedure within iMovie ’09 — but luckily, my good 
friend Dennis Cohen has done exactly that in his new book iMovie ’09 & iDVD 
’09 For Dummies (Wiley Publishing). Dennis will take you from basics to all the 
in-depth features of these two iLife applications!
Importing the Building Blocks
Sure, you need video clips to create a movie of your own, but don’t panic if 
you have but a short supply. You can certainly turn to the other iLife applica-
tions for additional raw material. (See, I told you that integration thing would 
come in handy.)
Along with video clips you import from your DV camcorder, built-in iSight 
camera, and hard drive, you can also call on iPhoto for still images (think 
credits) and iTunes for background audio and effects. In this section, I show 
you how.
Pulling in video clips
Your iMac is equipped already with the two extras that come in handy for 
video editing — namely, a large hard drive and a FireWire port. Because most 
mini-DV camcorders today use a FireWire connection to transfer clips, you’re 
all set. (And even if your snazzy new DV camcorder uses a USB 2.0 connec-
tion, you’re still in the zone, although you will need to modify the steps I pro-
vide in this section for your particular device.) Oh, and since your iMac has 
an iSight camera on board, you’re a self-contained movie studio!
Here’s the drill if your clips are on your FireWire-equipped mini-DV camcorder:
 
1. Plug the proper cable into your iMac.
 
2. Set the DV camcorder to VTR (or VCR) mode.
 
 Some camcorders call this Play mode.
 
3. Click the Camera Import button (labeled in Figure 13-2).

196
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 iMovie opens a new window.
 
4. Click the Camera pop-up menu (at the bottom of the Import window) 
and select your DV camcorder or iSight camera.
 
 Playback controls appear under the Camera Import window, mirroring 
the controls on your FireWire DV camcorder. This allows you to control 
the unit from iMovie. Keen!
 
 To capture video from your iSight camera, click the Video Size pop-up 
menu to choose the dimensions of the clip; then click Capture. On the 
sheet that appears, choose the location where the video will be saved, 
and choose whether to add this video to an existing event or create a 
new event. Click Capture to start recording, and click Stop when your 
video is complete. (You can skip the rest of the steps in this section, 
which deal only with DV camcorders.)
 
5. Click the Import button.
 
6. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose the drive that should store 
your clips.
 
 You can choose to add the new clips to an existing Event or create a new 
Event. Heck, if the event spanned more than one day, you can create a 
new Event for each day. (How do they think up these things?)
 
7. Click OK and admire your handiwork.
 
 iMovie begins transferring the footage to your iMac and automatically 
adds the imported clips to your Event Library.
 
If your clips are already on your hard drive, rest assured that iMovie can 
import them, including those in high-definition video (HDV) format. iMovie also 
recognizes a number of other video formats, as shown in Table 13-1.

 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
To import a movie file, follow this bouncing ball:
 
1. Choose File➪Import and choose Movies from the submenu.
 
2. If you’re importing 1080i video clips, choose the quality setting.
 
 The Large setting will save you a significant amount of hard drive space, 
but the Full setting preserves the original resolution and detail. (If you’re 
not importing 1080i video, use the default Large setting and click OK. 
The Full setting demands all the CPU and RAM resources your iMac can 
offer, so don’t expect to do much multitasking while importing.)
 
3. Click the drive that should store your clips in the sidebar and then 
navigate to the desired location.
 
4. Specify whether you want to add the imported video to an existing 
Event or create a new Event.
 
 If you choose to add the video to an existing Event, click the pop-up 
menu and select an Event.
 
5. Specify whether you want to copy the video (leaving the original 
movie intact) or have the movie deleted after a successful import.
 
6. Click Import.
 
 Alternatively, you can also drag a video clip from a Finder window and 
drop it in the Project pane.
Making use of still images
Still images come in handy as impressive-looking titles or as ending credits 
to your movie. (Make sure you list a gaffer and a best boy to be truly profes-
sional.) However, you can use still images also to introduce scenes or to sep-
arate clips according to your whim. For example, I use stills when delineating 
the days of a vacation within a movie or different Christmas celebrations 
over time.
Here are two methods of adding stills to your movie:
 
✓ Adding images from iPhoto: Click the Photo Browser button in the 
Browser toolbar (or press Ô+2) and you’ll experience the thrill that is 
your iPhoto Library, right from iMovie (as shown in Figure 13-3). You 
can elect to display your entire iPhoto Library or more selective picks 
such as specific albums or Events. When you find the image you want to 
add, just drag it to the right spot in the Project pane.
 
✓ Importing images from your hard drive: If you’re a member of the 
International Drag-and-Drop Society, you can drag TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PICT, 
PNG, and PSD images directly from a Finder window and drop them into 
the Project pane as well.

198
Part IV: Living the iLife

child’s play.
 
Importing and adding audio 
from all sorts of places
You can pull in everything from Wagner to Weezer as both background music 
and sound effects for your movie. In this section, I focus on how to get those 
notes into iMovie and then how to add them to your movie by dragging them 
to the Project pane.
You can add audio from a number of sources:
 
✓ Adding songs from iTunes: Click the Show Music and Sound Effects 
button in the Browser toolbar (or press Ô+1) to display the contents of 
your iTunes Library. Click the desired playlist in the scrolling list box, 
such as the Dinah Washington playlist I selected in Figure 13-4. (If you’ve 
exported any original music you’ve composed in GarageBand to your 
iTunes Library, you can use those songs in your own movie!) You can 
add a track to your movie by dragging the song entry from the Music 
and Sound Effects list to the desired spot in the Project pane.

199
 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
 
Figure 13-4: 
Calling on 
my iTunes 
Library to

iMovie.
 
 
✓ Adding sound effects: Yep, if you need the sound of a horse gallop-
ing for your Rocky Mountain vacation clips, click either iMovie Sound 
Effects or iLife Sound Effects in the scrolling list box. iMovie includes a 
number of top-shelf audio effects that you can use in the second audio 
track on the timeline viewer. This way, you can add sound effects even 
when you’ve already added a background song. Again, to add a sound 
effect, drag it to the perfect spot in the Project pane.
 
 If you have several gigabytes of music in your iTunes Library, it might 
be more of a challenge to locate “Me and Bobby McGee” by Janis Joplin, 
especially if she’s included in a compilation. Let your iMac do the dig-
ging for you! Click in the Search box below the track list and begin typing 
a song name. iMovie narrows down the song titles displayed to those 
that match the characters you type. To reset the search box and display 
all your songs in the Library or selected playlist, click the X icon that 
appears to the right of the box.
 
✓ Ripping songs from an audio CD: Load an audio CD and then choose 
Audio CD from the scrolling list box. iMovie displays the tracks from the 
CD, and you can add them at the current playhead position the same 
way as iTunes songs.
 
✓ Recording directly from a microphone: Yep, if you’re thinking 
voiceover narration, you’ve hit the nail on the head. Check out the side-
bar, “Narration the easy way,” for the scoop.

200
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
You can fine-tune both the audio within a video clip or the audio clips that you 
add to your project. With the desired clip selected, click the Inspector button 
in the Editing toolbar (it bears a proud letter i) and click the Audio tab. The 
Audio Adjustments window that appears includes an array of audio controls 
that allow you to change the volume of the selected clip, or to give that audio 
priority over other audio playing simultaneously (such as a sound effect that 
needs to be clearly heard over background music and the video clip). If your 
clips dramatically vary in volume, click the Normalize Clip Volume button and 
then select each clip that you want to set to the same volume; click Normalize 
Clip Volume again for each clip. You can also set an automatic or manual 
Fade-in/Fade-out for the audio. When you’re done tweaking, click Done. (Oh, 
and don’t forget that you can always return the clip to its original volume; just 
open this window again and click Revert to Original.)
Narration the easy way
Ready to create that award-winning nature 
documentary? You can add voiceover narra-
tion to your iMovie project that would make 
Jacques Cousteau proud. In fact, you can 
record your voice while you watch your movie 
playing, allowing perfect synchronization with 
the action! To add narration, follow these steps:
 1. Click the Voiceover button in the Editing 
toolbar — it sports a microphone icon — 
to open the Voiceover window.
 2. Click the Record From pop-up menu and 
select the input device.
 
 iMacs sport a decent internal microphone, 
but you can always add a USB or digital 
TOSlink microphone to your system.
 3. Drag the input volume slider to a comfort-
able level.
 
 You can monitor the volume level of your 
voice with the left and right input meters — 
try to keep the meters at 50 percent or so 
for the proper volume level.
 4. To block out ambient noise levels, drag 
the Noise Reduction slider to the right if 
necessary.
 
 If you’d like iMovie to enhance your voice 
electronically for a more professional 
sound, click the Voice Enhancement check 
box to select it. If you need to hear the 
audio from your movie project while you 
speak, click the Play Project Audio While 
Recording check box to select it — note, 
however, that you’ll need to listen to the 
audio while using a set of headphones 
(plugged in to your Mac’s headphone jack) 
to avoid feedback problems.
 5. Click in the desired spot within a clip in the 
Project pane where the narration should 
begin.
 6. Begin speaking when prompted by iMovie.
 7. Watch the video while you narrate so that 
you can coordinate your narration track 
with the action.
 8. Click anywhere in the iMovie window to 
stop recording (or wait until the clip ends).
 
 iMovie adds an icon to the Project pane 
underneath the video with the voiceover.
 9. Click the Close button in the Voiceover 
window.

 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
Building the Cinematic Basics
Time to dive in and add the building blocks to create your movie. Along with 
video clips, audio tracks, and still images, you can add Hollywood-quality 
transitions, optical effects, and animated text titles. In this section, I demon-
strate how to elevate your collection of video clips into a real-life furshlug-
giner movie.
Adding clips to your movie
You can add clips to your movie by using the Project pane and the Event 
pane. The Dynamic Duo works like this:
 
✓ Project pane: This displays the media you’ve added to your project so 
far, allowing you to rearrange the clips, titles, transitions and still images 
in your movie.
 
✓ Event pane: This displays your video clips arranged by Event (the date 
they were shot or the date they were imported), acting as the source 
repository for all your clips. Movies pulled into iMovie, imported into 
iPhoto, or added manually from the Finder appear here.
To add a clip to your movie, follow these steps:
 
1. Move your cursor across clips in the Event pane to watch a preview of 
the video.
 
2. When you’ve decided what to add to your project, you can either add 
the entire clip or a selection.
 
• To select an entire clip, right-click the clip’s thumbnail and choose 
Select Entire Clip from the menu that appears.
 
• To select a portion of a clip, drag your cursor across the thumb-
nail. A yellow frame appears around your selection. To change 
the length of the selected video, drag the handles that appear on 
either side. If you make a mistake while selecting video, just click 
any empty space within the Event pane to remove the selection 
frame and try again.
 
3. Drag the selection from the Event pane to the spot where it belongs in 
the Project pane.
 
 Alternatively, you can press the E key or click the Add to Project button 
(the first button in the Editing toolbar).
 
Preview your work — and do it often.

202
Part IV: Living the iLife 
iMovie offers two Play Full screen buttons: one under the Event Library 
and one under the Project Library. Select the project or Event you want to 
play and then click the corresponding button (or press Ô+G). You can also 
choose View➪Play Full Screen to watch the selection. Press the spacebar to 
pause, and press Esc to return to iMovie. You can also move your cursor to 
display a filmstrip that you can click to skip forward or backward in the proj-
ect or Event.
To play a selection from the beginning, press \ (the slash that leans to the 
left). (If you’ve ever watched directors at work on today’s movie sets, you 
may have noticed that they’re constantly watching a monitor to see what 
things will look like for the audience. You have the same option in iMovie!)
 
While you’re watching video in the Event pane, you may decide that a certain 
clip has a favorite scene or that another clip has material you don’t want, 
such as Uncle Ed’s shadow puppets. (Shudder.) iMovie ’09 features Favorite 
and Rejected frames, allowing you to view and use your best camera work 
(and ignore the worst stuff). To mark video, select a range of frames or an 
entire clip and then click the Mark as Favorite button in the Editing toolbar. 
Click the Reject button to hide the selected video or frames from view. (You 
can always unmark a Favorite or Rejected scene using the Unmark button in 
the Editing toolbar.)
Removing clips from your movie
Don’t like a clip? Bah. To banish a clip from your movie, follow these steps
 
1. Click the offending clip in the Project pane to select it.
 
2. Press Delete.
 
 Alternatively, you can right-click the clip (or a selection you’ve made by 
dragging) and choose either Delete Entire Clip or Delete Selection from 
the menu that appears.
If you remove the wrong clip, don’t panic. Instead, use iMovie’s Undo feature 
(press Ô+Z) to restore it.
Reordering clips in your movie
If Day One of your vacation appears after Day Two, you can easily reorder 
your clips and stills by dragging them to the proper space in the Project 
pane. When you take your finger off the mouse, iMovie automatically moves 
the rest of your movie aside with a minimum of fuss and bother.

203
 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
Editing clips in iMovie
If a clip has extra seconds of footage at the beginning or end, you don’t want 
that superfluous stuff in your masterpiece. Our favorite video editor gives 
you the following functions:
 
✓ Crop: Removes unwanted material from a video clip or still image
 
✓ Rotate: Rotates a clip or image on its center axis
 
✓ Trim: Trims frames from a video clip
Before you can edit, however, you have to select a section of a clip:
 
1. Click a clip or image in either the Project pane (where changes you 
make are specific to this project) or the Event pane (where edits you 
make are reflected in any project using that footage).
 
 iMovie displays the clip or image in the monitor.
 
2. To select the entire clip or image, simply click it.
 
3. Drag your cursor across the thumbnail to select the section of the 
media you want to edit. (Note that some editing functions, such as 
Crop and Rotate, will automatically apply to the entire clip.)
 
 The selected region is surrounded by a yellow frame. You’re ready to 
edit that selected part of the clip.
 
Note the handles that appear at the beginning or ending of the selection. You 
can make fine changes to the selected section by dragging them.
 
✓ To crop: Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar to display the frame 
in the Monitor pane and then click Crop at the top of the Monitor pane. 
Drag the edges of the frame and the handles to select the section you 
want to keep. To preview your selection, click the Play button at the top 
of the monitor. When you’re ready, click Done, and everything but the 
selected region is removed.
 
✓ To rotate: Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar and then click one of 
the two rotation buttons (which carry a curved arrow icon). Each click 
rotates the media 90 degrees in that direction. Click Done when the clip 
or image is properly oriented.
 
✓ To trim: Choose Edit➪Trim to Selection. iMovie removes the frames 
from around the selected video.

204
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
Edits that you make to one clip or still image can actually be copied to multi-
ple items! Select the edited clip and click Edit➪Copy from the iMovie menu. 
Now you can select one or more clips and choose Edit➪Paste Adjustments to 
apply Video, Audio, or Crop edits. (To apply all three types of edits, just 
choose All.)
Transitions for the masses
Many iMovie owners approach transitions as visual bookends: They merely 
act as placeholders that appear between video clips. Nothing could be far-
ther from the truth, because judicious use of transitions can make or break a 
scene. For example, which would you prefer after a wedding ceremony — an 
abrupt, jarring cut to the reception or a gradual fadeout to the reception?
 
Today’s audiences are sensitive to transitions between scenes. Try not to 
overuse the same transition. Also weigh the visual impact of a transition 
carefully.
iMovie includes a surprising array of transitions, including old favorites (such as 
Fade In and Dissolve) and some nifty stuff you might not be familiar with (such 
as Cube and Page Curl). To display your transition collection (Figure 13-5), click 
the Show Transitions button on the Browser toolbar (or press Ô+4).
To see what a particular transition looks like, move your cursor over the 
thumbnail to display the transition in miniature.
Adding a transition couldn’t be easier: Drag the transition from the list in the 
Transitions Browser pane and drop it between clips or between a clip and a still 
image in the Project pane. In iMovie ’09, transitions are applied in real time.
Even Gone with the Wind had titles
The last stop on our iMovie Hollywood Features Tour is the Titles Browser, 
shown in Figure 13-6. You’ll find it by clicking the Title button on the Browser 
toolbar (which bears a big capital T), or by pressing Ô+3. You can add a title 
with a still image, but iMovie also includes everything you need to add basic 
animated text to your movie.

Most of the controls you can adjust are the same for each animation style. 
You can change the font, the size of the text, and the color of the text. To add 
a title manually, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an animation thumbnail from the Title Browser pane and drag 
it to the desired spot in the Project pane.
 
2. Click a background thumbnail to select a background for your title.
 
3. Click the Show Fonts button in the monitor window to make any 
changes to the fonts or text attributes.
 
4. Click in a text box to type your own line of text.
 
5. Click the Play button to preview your title.
 
 iMovie displays a preview of the effect in the monitor with the settings 
that you choose.
 
6. Click Done.
 
 The title appears in the Project pane.
Sharing Your Finished 
Classic with Others
Your movie is complete, you’ve saved it to your hard drive, and now you’re 
wondering where to go from here. Click Share on the application menu bar, 
and you’ll see that iMovie can unleash your movie upon your unsuspecting 
family and friends (and even the entire world) in a number of ways:
 
✓ iTunes: Send your movie to your iTunes Library as a movie.
 
✓ Media Browser: Make your iMovie project available within other iLife 
’09 applications, in five different sizes suited to different display devices. 
Note that the Media Browser is also available for other Apple applica-
tions, like Final Cut Studio, and to third-party applications like Toast 
Titanium.
 
✓ YouTube: Yep, you read right, you can send your iMovie directly to the 
YouTube Web site! Can it get more convenient than that? (I think not.)
 
✓ MobileMe Gallery: Share your movie with the world at large by post-
ing it within a Gallery on your MobileMe Web site. (I provide more 
MobileMe details to chew on in Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Export Movie: Create a copy of your movie on your hard drive in one of 
five different sizes.

207
 Chapter 13: Making Film History with iMovie
 
✓ Export using QuickTime: Create a QuickTime movie with your project 
using the QuickTime encoding engine (allowing greater control over the 
export process and the attributes of the finished movie file).
 
 If you use this option, any computer with an installed copy of QuickTime 
can display your movies, and you can use QuickTime movies in Keynote 
presentations as well.
 
✓ Export to Final Cut XML: If you’d like to transfer your iMovie ’09 project 
to Final Cut Pro, use this option to create a compatible XML file.
When you choose a sharing option, iMovie displays the video quality for the 
option and makes automatic changes to the movie attributes. (For example, 
choosing Tiny reduces the finished movie as far as possible in file size, and 
the audio is reduced to mono instead of stereo.)
 
If you’re worried about permanently reducing the quality of your project 
by sharing it in a smaller size, fear not! When you choose a sharing option 
to export your movie, your original project remains on your hard drive, 
unchanged, so you can share a better-quality version at any time in the future!

▶ Tweaking and adjusting your DVD Menu
▶ Previewing your (nearly) finished DVD
▶ Doing things automatically with OneStep DVD and Magic iDVD
▶ Burning a DVD for your friends and family
H
ow does the old adage go? Oh, yes, it’s like this:
Any DVD movie must be a pain to create. You’ll need a ton of money for 
software, too. And you’ll have to take hours of training that will cause 
your brain to explode.
Funny thing is, DVD authoring — designing and creating a DVD movie — 
really was like that for many years. Only video professionals could afford the 
software and tackle the training needed to master all the intricacies of DVD 
Menu design.
Take one guess as to the company that changed all that. (No, it wasn’t Coca-
Cola.) Apple’s introduction of iDVD was (quite literally) a revolution in DVD 
authoring. Suddenly you, your kids, and Aunt Harriet could all design and 
burn DVD movies and picture slideshows. Dear reader, this iDVD thing is huge.
Plus, you’ll quickly find out that iDVD is tightly connected to all the other 
slices of your digital hub. In plain English, you can pull content from iTunes, 
iPhoto, and iMovie as easily as a politician makes promises. And that, friends 
and neighbors, is the quintessential definition of cool.
In this chapter, I show you how your iMac can take on Hollywood as well as 
how you can produce a DVD movie with content that’s as good as any you’d 
rent at the video store!

Hey, Where’s the Complex Window?
Figure 14-1 shows iDVD in all its glory. You have to supply your own digital 
video clips, background audio, and digital photographs, of course.

Take a moment to appreciate iDVD — no secondary windows to fiddle with 
or silly palettes strung out everywhere. (Can you tell that I’ve had my fill of 
old-style DVD authoring applications?) Allow me to list the highlights of the 
iDVD window:
 
✓ Menu display: This section takes up the largest part of the iDVD 
window, with good reason. You create your project here. In this case, 
Menu refers to your DVD Menu, not the menu at the top of your iMac’s 
display.

211
 Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory
 
✓ Media pane: You add video, still images, and audio to your project from 
here, as well as tweak and fine-tune things. The Media pane actually 
comprises three separate panes. To choose a new pane, click one of 
these buttons at the bottom of the screen:
 
• Themes: You apply themes (such as Travel Cards, Wedding 
White, and Baby Mobile) to your DVD Menu to give it a certain 
look and feel.
 
• Buttons: These options apply to the item currently selected, such 
as drop shadows on your text titles or the appearance of your 
Menu buttons.
 
• Media: From here, you can add media items, such as video clips 
and photos, to your Menu.
 
✓ Add button: From this pop-up menu (which sports a dapper plus sign), 
you can choose one of three types of buttons to add to a project. The 
choices are
 
• Add Submenu: Choose this item to add a new submenu button to 
your DVD Menu. The person using your DVD Menu can click a button 
to display a new submenu that can include additional movies or 
slideshows. (If that sounds like ancient Greek, hang on. All becomes 
clearer later in the chapter, in the section “Adding movies.”)
 
 A Menu can hold only a maximum of 12 buttons (depending on the 
theme you choose), so submenus let you pack more content on 
your DVD. (Older versions of the application allowed only six but-
tons, so don’t feel too cheated.) Anyway, each submenu you create 
can hold another 12 buttons.
 
• Add Movie: Yep, this is the most popular button in the whole 
shooting match. Click this menu item to add a new movie clip to 
your Menu.
 
• Add Slideshow: If you want to add a slideshow to your DVD — say, 
using photos from your hard drive or pictures from your iPhoto 
library — click this menu item.
 
✓ Inspector button: Click this button to display the Inspector window for 
the current Menu or a highlighted object. From this window, you can 
change the look of an individual submenu button or an entire Menu.
 
✓ DVD Map: Click the Map button to display the organizational chart for 
your DVD Menu. Each button and submenu that you add to your top-
level DVD Menu is displayed here, and you can jump directly to a par-
ticular item by double-clicking it. Use this road map to help design the 
layout of your DVD Menu system or to get to a particular item quickly. 
To return to the Menu display, click the Map button again.
 
✓ Motion: Click this button to start or stop the animation cycle used with 
the current iDVD theme. The animation repeats (just as it will on your 
finished DVD) until you click the Motion button again.

212
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
 Need a visual indicator of the length of your Menu’s animation cycle? 
Click View➪Show Motion Playhead to display the animation playhead, 
which moves below the Menu display to indicate where you are in the 
animation cycle. As you can with other playheads in the iLife suite, you 
can click and drag the diamond-shaped playhead button to move any-
where in the animation cycle.
 
✓ Edit Drop Zones: This button allows you to edit the look and contents 
of a drop zone on your Menu. (Don’t worry, I explain more about drop 
zones in the sidebar titled, “Taking advantage of drop zones,” later in 
this chapter.)
 
✓ Preview: To see how your DVD Menu project looks when burned to a 
DVD, click Preview. You get a truly nifty on-screen remote control that 
you can use to navigate your DVD Menu, just as if you were watching 
your DVD on a standard DVD player. To exit Preview mode, click the 
Stop button on the remote control. 
 
✓ Burn: Oh, yeah, you know what this one is for — recording your com-
pleted DVD movie to a blank disc.
That’s the lot! Time to get down to the step-by-step business of making 
movies.
Starting a New DVD Project
When you launch iDVD for the first time (or if you close all iDVD windows), 
you get the sporty dialog box shown in Figure 14-2. Take a moment to dis-
cover more about these four choices.

 Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory
Creating a new project
If you choose Create a New Project, iDVD prompts you to type a name for 
your new DVD project and to set a location where the project files should 
be saved. By default, the very reasonable choice is your Documents folder. 
You also get to choose whether your project will display in a Standard (full-
screen) aspect ratio of 4:3 or a Widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. If you’ve 
been watching DVD movies for some time, you probably recognize these 
two terms.
 
You’ll probably crave Widescreen format if you have a widescreen TV — go 
figure — but both formats will display on both types of televisions, complete 
with those black bars we all know and love at the top and bottom (or left and 
right sides) of the screen.
Click Create, and the iDVD window appears in all its glory.
Opening an existing project
If you’ve used iDVD and had a DVD project open the last time you quit the 
application, iDVD automatically loads the DVD project you were working on. 
However, you can open any DVD you’ve created by clicking Open an Existing 
Project. (To choose a different existing project from the iDVD window, press 
Ô+O or choose File➪Open Recent.)
Automating the whole darn process
If you’re a fan of click-it-and-forget-it (or you’re in a hurry), you can throw 
caution to the wind and allow iDVD to create your latest epic for you! iDVD 
offers two automated methods of creating a DVD movie disc. 
Using OneStep DVD
With OneStep, iDVD does almost all the work automatically, by using the 
media clips and photos that you specify. To allow iDVD to help you create a 
movie, click the OneStep DVD button on the top-level menu (refer to Figure 
14-2). If you’ve already opened a project, choose File➪OneStep DVD from the 
application’s menu bar (to import clips directly from your FireWire mini-DV 
camera) or OneStep DVD from Movie (to select a clip to import from your 
hard drive). OneStep DVD does not work with camcorders that use a USB 
connection to your iMac. I tell you more about the OneStep DVD feature later, 
in the section “A Word about Automation.”

214
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Using Magic iDVD
Magic iDVD is the newcomer on the block, and it falls neatly between total 
automation (with OneStep DVD) and total manual control. Click the Magic 
iDVD button on the top-level menu (refer to Figure 14-2). If you’ve already 
opened a project, you can choose File➪Magic iDVD from the menu bar to 
choose a theme, drop specific movies and specific photos into filmstrips, 
and choose an audio track.
In contrast to OneStep DVD, you get to preview the finished product. If it’s to 
your liking, you can choose to either burn the disc directly or create a full-
blown iDVD project with the results. Sweet.
You find out more about the new Magic iDVD feature later, in the section “A 
Word about Automation.”
Creating a DVD from Scratch
Doing things the old-fashioned, creative, and manual way (following the 
examples in this section) involves four basic steps:
 
1. Design the DVD Menu.
 
 Choose a theme and any necessary buttons or links.
 
2. Add media.
 
 You can drag movie files from iMovie, still images from iPhoto, and 
music from iTunes.
 
3. Tweak.
 
 Adjust and fine-tune your DVD Menu settings.
 
4. Finish things up.
 
 Preview and burn your DVD or save it to your hard drive.
Choosing just the right theme
The first step to take when manually designing a new DVD Menu system is 
to add a theme. In the iDVD world, a theme is a preset package that helps 
determine the appearance and visual appeal of your DVD Menu, including a 
background image, Menu animation, an audio track, and a group of settings 
for text fonts and button styles.

215
 Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory
iDVD helps those of us who are graphically challenged by including a wide 
range of professionally designed themes for all sorts of occasions, rang-
ing from old standbys such as weddings, birthdays, and vacations to more 
generic themes with the accent on action, friendship, and technology. To 
view the included themes, click the Themes button in the lower-right corner 
of the iDVD window (see Figure 14-3).
To choose a theme for your project — or to see what a theme looks like on 
your Menu — click any thumbnail and watch iDVD update the Menu display.
Taking advantage of drop zones
Most of Apple’s animated themes include spe-
cial bordered areas marked as drop zones. 
These locations have nothing to do with skydiv-
ing; rather, a drop zone is a placeholder in the 
Menu that can hold a single video clip or photo-
graph. When you drag a video clip or an image 
to a drop zone, that clip or picture is added to 
the animation in Apple’s theme! Think about 
that for a moment; I know I did. You can actually 
personalize a Hollywood-quality animated DVD 
Menu with your own photos and video!
Most of the themes included with iDVD include 
at least one drop zone, and some are practi-
cally jam-packed with drop zones. For example, 
the amazing Forever theme has a whopping six 
drop zones! If you think a Menu looks just fine 
without anything in a drop zone, however, you 
don’t have to put anything there. The words 
Drop Zone disappear when you preview or burn 
your DVD. (Empty frames do tend to look a bit 
silly in some themes, though.)
To add a video clip or image to a drop zone, 
simply drag the clip or photo from a Finder 
window and drop it on the desired drop zone. 
You can also drag clips or photos from other 
sources, including the Movies and Photos panes 
in iDVD’s Media pane, the iMovie window, or 
the iPhoto window (Apple is anything but strict 
on these matters).Remember, drop zones don’t 
act as links or buttons to other content; the stuff 
you add to a Menu’s drop zones appears only 
as part of the theme’s animation cycle. You can 
even drag an iPhoto event or album to a drop 
zone, and it will continuously cycle through the 
images. Wowzers!
To see all the drop zones at one time (without 
cycling through the animation), click the Edit 
Drop Zones button at the bottom center of the 
iDVD window; when you do, you see a thumb-
nail display of each zone. You can drag items 
to these thumbnails or jump right to one in the 
animation by clicking the thumbnail. To delete 
the contents of a drop zone, click the thumbnail 
in the editor and press Delete.
If you’re adding something to a dynamic drop 
zone (which disappears and reappears during 
the menu animation cycle), click the Motion 
button to activate the animation and then click 
it again to stop the animation cycle. Now click 
and drag the scrubber bar until the desired drop 
zone is in view. To delete the contents of a drop 
zone, Control-click (or right-click) the drop zone 
and choose Clear.

pane.
 
 
If you decide while creating your DVD Menu that you need a different theme, 
you can change themes at any time. iDVD won’t lose a single button or video 
clip that you add to your DVD Menu. You’ll be amazed at how the look and 
sound of your DVD Menu completely change with just the click of a theme 
thumbnail.
Adding movies
Drop zones and themes are cool, but most folks want to add video to their 
DVDs. To accomplish this, iDVD uses buttons as links to your video clips. In 
fact, some iDVD Movie buttons display a preview of the video they’ll display! 
To play the video on a DVD player, select the Movie button with the remote 
control, just as you do for a commercial DVD.
To add a Movie button, drag a QuickTime movie file from the Finder and drop 
it onto your DVD Menu display. (Only MPEG-4 QuickTime movies and DV 
streams are supported — MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 movie clips may be rejected 
or automatically converted, or they may even be added without audio.) 
Alternatively, click the Add button and choose Add Movie from the pop-up 
menu.

217
 Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory
 
iDVD and iMovie are soul mates, so you can also display the iDVD Media pane 
and then click Movies from the pop-up menu. Now you can drag clips from 
your Movies folder.
No matter the source of the clip, when you drop it onto your DVD Menu, 
iDVD adds a Movie button, as you can see in Figure 14-4. Note that some but-
tons appear as text links rather than actual buttons. The appearance of a 
Movie button in your DVD Menu is determined by the theme you choose.
 
A Movie button doesn’t have to stay where iDVD places it! By default, iDVD 
aligns buttons and text objects using an invisible grid, but if you don’t want 
such order imposed on your creativity, just drag the object where you’d like it 
to be to turn on Free Positioning. (You can also right-click the object and 
select the Free Positioning item from the menu that appears.) iDVD provides 
cool new automatic guides that help you align objects when you’re using Free 
Positioning! You’ll see them as yellow lines that appear when objects are 
aligned along a vertical or horizontal plane.
You can have up to 12 buttons on your iDVD Menu (the theme you choose 
determines the maximum number of buttons you can add). To add more con-
tent than 12 buttons allow, add a submenu by clicking the Add button and 
choosing Add Submenu from the pop-up menu. Now you can click the submenu 
button to jump to that screen and drag up to another 12 movie files into it.

Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
Keep your target audience in mind while you create your DVD. Standard TV 
sets have a different aspect ratio (height to width) and resolution (number of 
scan lines on the screen) than a digital video clip, and a standard TV isn’t as 
precise in focusing that image on the tube. If you selected the Standard aspect 
ratio when you created the project, you can make sure that your DVD content 
looks great on a standard TV screen by following these steps:
 
1. Click View on the old-fashioned iDVD menu (the one at the top of the 
screen).
 
2. Choose the Show TV Safe Area command.
 
 You can also press the convenient Ô+T shortcut. iDVD adds a smaller 
rectangle within the iDVD window to mark the screen dimensions of a 
standard TV.
If you take care that your Menu buttons and (most of) your background 
image fit within this smaller rectangle, you’re assured that folks with a stan-
dard television can enjoy your work. To turn off the TV Safe Area rectangle, 
press Ô+T again.
If your entire family is blessed with a fleet of HD TVs (or you chose the 
Widescreen aspect ratio for this project), leave the Show TV Safe Area option 
off. Today’s widescreen displays can handle just about any orientation.
A word on image dimensions
For best playback results on a standard TV, 
make sure that your background image has the 
same dimensions as standard digital video — 
640 x 480 pixels. If the dimensions of your 
image don’t match the dimensions of digital 
video, iDVD will stretch or shrink the image to 
fit, which is likely to have undesirable effects. 
When your image is stretched and skewed to fit 
the DVD Menu, Aunt Harriet might end up look-
ing like Shrek.
You can use QuickTime player or iPhoto to 
change the dimensions of your background 
image for import into iDVD. For example, you 
can use the iPhoto crop feature to alter the 
overall shape of the image and then resize it 
within iPhoto. Use the Size setting when you 
export the image from iPhoto and then save the 
file in the Pictures folder located in your Home 
folder so that you can find it easily later. (For 
more on working in iPhoto, see Chapter 12.)
If you enjoy a cutting-edge widescreen (16:9) 
or HD (high-definition) TV display, you won’t 
have the standard TV dimension restriction 
of 640 x 480 pixels. And because iDVD sup-
ports HD video and 16:9 video with a number 
of widescreen themes, be prepared to kiss the 
phrases pan-and-scan and full-screen goodbye 
and forget about the Show TV Safe Area fea-
ture. If your completed DVD projects are purely 
for your own enjoyment, that’s a great idea. 
However, don’t forget that if you distribute your 
discs to others with old-fashioned TVs dating 
back to the archaic ’80s and ’90s, they might not 
be pleased with what they see!

 Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory
Great, now my audience 
demands a slideshow
Many Mac owners don’t realize that you don’t have to use iDVD just for video 
clips. In fact, you can use the Slideshow buttons to add a group of digital 
photos to your DVD Menu . The Slideshow buttons allow the viewer to play 
back a series of digital photographs — set to music if you like. iDVD handles 
everything for you, so there’s no tricky timing to figure out or weird scripts 
to write. Just click the Add button at the bottom of the iDVD window and 
choose Add Slideshow. iDVD places a Slideshow button on your DVD Menu.
After the Slideshow button is on tap, add the content — in this case, by 
choosing the images that iDVD adds to your DVD Menu. Follow these steps to 
select your slideshow images:
 
1. Double-click the Slideshow Menu button — the one you just added to 
the Menu — to open the Slideshow display (see Figure 14-5).
 
2. Click the Media button (bottom right of the screen).
 
Figure 14-5:

Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
3. Click the Photos tab (top right of the screen) to display your iPhoto 
library and photo albums.
 
4. Drag your favorite image thumbnails from the Photos list and drop 
them into the My Slideshow window.
 
 You can also drag images straight from a Finder window or the iPhoto 
window itself. (Those Apple folks are sooooo predictable.)
 
5. Drag around the photos in the My Slideshow window to set their order 
of appearance in your slideshow.
 
 Note that you can click on the Slide Duration pop-up menu to change the 
length of time that images are displayed.
 
6. To add audio to these pictures, drag your favorite audio file from the 
Finder and drop it in the Audio well in the My Slideshow window.
 
 The Audio well is the box bearing the speaker icon, next to the volume 
control below the My Slideshow window.
 
 Alternatively, click the Audio tab to select an audio track from your 
iTunes library, iTunes playlists, or GarageBand creations.
 
7. Click the Return button to return to your DVD Menu.
 
If you’re using a Menu with animated buttons that display an image (rather 
than text buttons), you can choose which image you want to appear on the 
Slideshow button. Click the Slideshow button that you added and see the 
slider that appears above the Slideshow button. Drag this slider to scroll 
through the images you added. When you find the image that you want to use 
for the Slideshow button in the DVD Menu, click the Slideshow button again to 
save your changes.
Now for the music . . .
Most of the Apple-supplied themes already have their own background 
music, so you might not even need to add music to your DVD Menu. 
However, if you want to change the existing background music (or if your 
DVD Menu currently doesn’t have any music), adding your own audio to the 
current Menu is child’s play!
 
1. Click the Media button.
 
2. Click the Audio tab to reveal the musical Shangri-La, as shown in 
Figure 14-6.

221
 Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory
 
3. Drag an audio file from the iTunes playlist or GarageBand folder dis-
play and drop it on the Menu background.
 
 iDVD accepts every sound format that you can use for importing and 
encoding in iTunes: AIFF, MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, and WAV audio files.
 
4. Click the Motion button (labeled in Figure 14-1) to watch your DVD 
Menu animation cycle set to the new background audio.
 
5. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation and return to seri-
ous work.
 
Figure 14-6: 
You do a

Giving Your DVD the Personal Touch
You can easily make changes to the default settings provided with the 
theme you chose. iDVD offers all sorts of controls that allow you to change 
the appearance and behavior of buttons, text, and the presentation of your 
content. In this section, I show you how to cast out iDVD’s (perfectly good) 
defaults and then tweak things to perfection.

222
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Using Uncle Morty for your 
DVD Menu background
Hey, Uncle Morty might not be a supermodel, but he has birthdays and 
anniversaries, and iDVD is more than happy to accommodate you in docu-
menting those milestones! Follow these steps to change the background of 
your DVD Menu:
 
1. Click the Inspector button.
 
2. Get an image using one of the following methods:
 
• Drag an image from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
 
• Drag the image directly into the Menu display.
 
• To use an image from your iPhoto library, click the Media button 
and click the Photos tab, and then drag the desired image into the 
Menu display.
 
 iDVD updates the DVD Menu to reflect your new background choice.
Adding your own titles
The one tweak you’ll probably have to perform in every iDVD project is 
changing titles. Unfortunately, the default labels provided by iDVD are pretty 
lame, and they appear in two important places:
 
✓ Menu title: Your large main title usually appears at the top of the DVD 
Menu.
 
✓ Button captions: Each Submenu, Movie, and Slideshow button that you 
add to your Menu has its own title.
To change the text in your Menu title or the titles below your buttons, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select the text by clicking it.
 
2. Click it again to edit it.
 
 A rectangle with a cursor appears to indicate that you can now edit 
the text.
 
3. Type the new text and press Return to save the change.

Changing buttons like a highly 
paid professional
Customizing Movie buttons? You can do it with aplomb! Follow these steps:
 
1. Click Buttons.
 
2. Click any Movie button from the DVD Menu to select it.
 
 A slider appears above the button, which you can drag to set the thumb-
nail picture for that button in your DVD Menu. (Naturally, this is only for 
animated buttons, not text buttons.)
 
 Enable the Movie check box to animate the button.
 
3. To create a Movie button with a still image, drag a picture from a 
Finder window or the Media pane and drop it on top of the button.
 
4. To adjust the properties for the button, click the Inspector button.
Table 14-1 describes the button properties — note that some properties 
won’t appear for text buttons.

Giving motion to your creation 
Earlier in this chapter, you find out how to use a different image for your 
background (in the section titled, “Using Uncle Morty for your DVD Menu 
background”), but what about using an animated background? You can use 

224
Part IV: Living the iLife 
any QuickTime movie from your iMovie library (including those you’ve taken 
with your iMac’s iSight camera) to animate your DVD Menu background! 
Didn’t I tell you that this iDVD thing was huge?
 
Keep in mind that your background movie should be a short clip; 20–30 sec-
onds is optimal. A clip with a fade-in at the beginning and a fade-out at the end 
is the best choice because iDVD loops your background clip continuously, and 
your animated background flows seamlessly behind your Menu.
 
I’m not talking drop zones here. (See the sidebar “Taking advantage of drop 
zones,” earlier in this chapter, for an explanation of drop zones.) You can add 
a movie to a drop zone, of course, but by using a movie clip as a background, 
you’re replacing the entire animation sequence rather than just a single area 
of the background. Drop zones also don’t provide audio, whereas a clip back-
ground does include the clip audio.
Follow these steps to add a new animated background:
 
1. Click your old friend, the Inspector button.
 
 Make sure that no individual objects are highlighted so that the 
Inspector window displays the Menu properties instead.
 
2. Drag a movie from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
 
 You can click the Movies tab in the Media pane to instantly display your 
iMovie collection.
 
3. Click the Motion button in the iDVD window to try out your new 
background.
 
4. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation cycle.
Previewing Your Masterpiece
Figure 14-7 captures the elusive Preview remote control — truly an awesome 
sight. When you click Preview, the Media pane disappears, and your DVD 
Menu appears exactly as it will on the finished DVD.
Ah, but appearances aren’t everything: You can also use your DVD Menu! 
Click the buttons on the remote control to simulate the remote on your DVD 
player or think outside the box and click a Menu button directly with your 
mouse pointer. iDVD presents the video clip, runs the slideshow, or jumps to 
a submenu, just as it will with the completed disc.
This is a great time to test-drive a project before you burn it to disc. To 
make sure you don’t waste a blank DVD, make certain that everything you 
expect to happen actually happens. Nothing worse than discovering that

Aunt Edna’s slideshow from her Hong Kong trip actually displays your fam-
ily’s summer trip to the zoo (whoops). If you made a mistake or something 
needs tweaking, click the Preview button again, and you’re back to the iDVD 
window proper, where you can edit or fine-tune your project.

iDVD allows you to save your project as a standard Mac OS X disc image 
rather than as a simple project file (or a physical DVD) — you can use 
Apple’s Disk Utility to open and mount the disc image as if it were a burned 
disc. If you move the disc image to another Mac with a SuperDrive, you can 
use Disk Utility to burn it to disc using that machine. To save an iDVD project 
as a disc image, choose File➪Save as Disc Image (or press Ô+Shift+R). To 
save your project as a standard VIDEO_TS folder (suitable for burning with 
another video-editing or DVD recording application), choose File➪Save as 
VIDEO_TS Folder.
 
Interested in tweaking settings across your entire project? Perhaps you’d like 
to reduce the time it takes to create and edit your DVD or switch video modes 
from NTSC to PAL for a DVD that’s to be sent overseas. If you’d like to view or 
change the overall settings for your entire DVD, click Project➪Project Info to 
display the Project Info dialog. Heck, you can even switch aspect ratios or 
change the project name. Thanks, Apple!

Part IV: Living the iLife 
A Word about Automation
At the beginning of the chapter, I mention the easy way to produce an iDVD 
disc or project, using either OneStep DVD (for complete automation) or Magic 
iDVD (for partial automation). In this section, I provide you with the details.
One-click paradise with OneStep DVD
If you’re in a hurry to create a DVD from clips on your DV camcorder and 
you don’t mind losing your creative input, OneStep DVD is just the ticket. 
In short, iDVD allows you to plug in your FireWire-equipped mini-DV cam-
corder, answer a question or two, and then sit back while the application 
does all the work. iDVD imports the DV clips, creates a basic Menu design, 
and burns the disc automatically! (Again, note that OneStep DVD doesn’t 
support USB camcorders.)
Using OneStep DVD will appeal to any iMac owner. Why not produce a DVD 
right after a wedding or birthday that you can give as a gift? Photographers 
who cover those same special events might consider selling a DVD made 
with OneStep DVD. If you happen to capture something incredibly unique — 
such as a UFO landing or an honest politician — you can use OneStep DVD to 
create an instant backup of the clips on your DV camcorder. You could even 
keep your friends and family up-to-date with the progress of your vacation by 
sending them a daily DVD of your exploits! (You gotta admit, even Grandma 
would consider that eminently sassy!)
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:
 
1. Click the OneStep DVD button on the iDVD top-level menu (refer to 
Figure 14-2).
 
 Alternatively, choose File➪OneStep DVD. 
 
 iDVD displays the dialog shown in Figure 14-8.

 If you want to use OneStep DVD with an existing movie on your iMac’s 
hard drive, choose File➪OneStep DVD from Movie instead. iDVD 
prompts you for the video file to use.
 
2. Following the prompts, connect the FireWire cable from your DV cam-
corder; then turn on the camcorder and set it to VCR mode.
 
3. Click OK.
 
4. Load a blank DVD.
Exercising control with Magic iDVD
Got a little extra time? For those who prefer to make just a few choices and 
let iDVD do the rest, the new Magic iDVD feature just plain rocks! However, 
you can’t import clips directly from your mini-DV camcorder as you can with 
OneStep DVD; instead, you select one of the following:
 
✓ An iDVD theme
 
✓ Video clips you’ve already created with iMovie or dragged from the 
Finder (perfect for use with a USB 2.0 DV camcorder)
 
✓ Photos from your iPhoto library or dragged from the Finder
 
✓ Audio from your iTunes playlist or dragged from the Finder
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:
 
1. Click the Magic iDVD button on the iDVD top-level dialog (refer to 
Figure 14-2).
 
 iDVD displays the window you see in Figure 14-9.
 
2. Click in the DVD Title box and type a name for your disc (or project).
 
3. Click to select a theme from the Theme strip.
 
4. Click the Movies tab and drag the desired clips into the Drop Movies 
Here strip.
 
5. To add a slideshow, click the Photos tab and drag the desired photos 
into the Drop Photos Here strip.
 
6. To add audio for your slideshow, click the Audio tab and drag 
the desired song into the Drop Photos Here strip (a speaker icon 
appears in the first cell of the strip to indicate that you’ve added a 
soundtrack).
 
7. Click Preview to see a preview of the finished project, complete with 
remote control. To exit Preview mode, click Exit.

Recording a Finished Project 
to a Shiny Disc
When you’re ready to record your next Oscar-winning documentary on family 
behaviors during vacation, just follow these simple words:
 
1. Click the Burn button at the bottom of the iDVD window.
 
 I have to admit, the Burn button that appears has to be my favorite 
single control in all my 20+ years of computing! It looks powerful, it looks 
sexy . . . it wants to burn. (Sorry about that.)

229
 Chapter 14: iDVD — Your DVD Movie Factory
 
2. After iDVD asks you to insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive, load 
a single or dual-layer blank DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, or DVD+RW 
(depending on the media your Mac can handle).
 
 Your SuperDrive might be able to burn and read a DVD+R, DVD-RW, or 
DVD+RW, but what about your DVD player? Keep in mind that only DVD-Rs 
are likely to work in older DVD players. The latest generation of DVD play-
ers is likely DVD+R compatible as well, but I’ve seen only a handful of DVD 
players that can handle rewriteable media at the time of this writing. 
Therefore, remember the destination for the discs you burn and choose 
your media accordingly.
 
 After a short pause, iDVD begins burning the DVD. The application keeps 
you updated with a progress bar.
When the disc is finished, you’re ready to load it into your favorite local DVD 
player or back into your iMac and enjoy your work using Apple’s DVD Player.
Either way, it’s all good!

D
o you dream of making music? I’ve always wanted to join a band, but 
I never devoted the time nor learned to play the guitar. You know the 
drill: Those rock stars struggled for years to gain the upper hand over an 
instrument, practicing for untold hours, memorizing chords, and. . . . Wait a 
second. I almost forgot. You don’t need to do any of that now!
Apple’s GarageBand ’09 lets a musical wanna-be (like yours truly) make 
music with an iMac — complete with a driving bass line, funky horns, and 
perfect drums that never miss a beat. In fact, the thousands of prerecorded 
loops on tap in this awesome application allow you to design your music to 
match that melody running through your head, from techno to jazz to alter-
native rock.
Oh, and did I mention that you can also use GarageBand ’09 to produce pod-
casts? That’s right! You can record your voice and easily create your own 
show, and then share it with others from your iWeb site! Heck, add photos 
if you like. You’ll be the talk of your family and friends and maybe even your 
Mac user group.

232
Part IV: Living the iLife 
This chapter explains everything you need to know to create your first song. 
I also show you how to import your hit record into iTunes so you can listen 
to it on your iPod with a big silly grin on your face (like I do) or add it to your 
next iMovie or iDVD project.
Don’t be too smug when you think of all that practicing and hard work you 
missed out on. What a shame!
Shaking Hands with Your Band
As you can see in Figure 15-1, the GarageBand window isn’t complex at all, 
and that’s good design. In this section, I list the most important controls so 
that you know your Play button from your Loop Browser button.

 Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand
Your music-making machine includes
 
✓ Track list: In GarageBand, a track is a discrete instrument that you set 
up to play one part of your song. For example, a track in a classical 
piece for string quartet would have four tracks — one each for violin, 
viola, cello, and bass. The track list contains all the tracks in your song 
arranged so that you can easily see and modify them, like the rows in 
a spreadsheet. A track begins in the list, stretching out to the right all 
the way to the end of the song. As you can see in the upper left of Figure 
15-1, I already have one track defined — a Grand Piano.
 
 If you’re creating a podcast, a Podcast artwork track can also appear. 
Video podcasts can include a movie track as well.
 
✓ Timeline: This scrolling area holds the loops (see the following bullet) 
that you add or record, allowing you to move and edit them easily. 
When a song plays, the Timeline scrolls to give you a visual look at your 
music. (Bear with me; you’ll understand that cryptic statement in a page 
or two.)
 
✓ Loop: This is a prerecorded clip of an instrument being played in a spe-
cific style and tempo. Loops are the building blocks of your song. You 
can drag loops from the Loop Browser to a track and literally build a 
bass line or a guitar solo. (It’s a little like adding video clips in iMovie to 
build a film.)
 
✓ Playhead: This vertical line is a moving indicator that shows you the 
current position in your song while it scrolls by in the Timeline. You can 
drag the playhead to a new location at any time. The playhead also acts 
like the insertion cursor in a word processing application: If you insert a 
section of a song or a loop from the Clipboard, it appears at the current 
location of the playhead. (More on copying and inserting loops later, so 
don’t panic.)
 
✓ Create a New Track button: Click this button to add a new track to your 
song.
 
✓ Track Info button: If you need to display the instrument used in a track, 
click the track to select it and then click this button. You can also con-
trol settings, such as Echo and Reverb, from the Edit pane of the Track 
Info display.
 
✓ View/Hide Loop Browser button: Click the button with the striking eye 
icon to display the Loop Browser at the bottom of the window; click 
it again to close it. You can see more of your tracks at a time without 
scrolling by closing the Loop Browser.
 
✓ View/Hide Media Browser button: Click this button (which bears icons 
of a filmstrip, slide, and musical note) to display the media browser 
at the right side of the window; click it again to close it. By closing the 

234
Part IV: Living the iLife 
media browser, you’ll see more of your tracks. If you’re already familiar 
with iDVD, iWeb, or iMovie, you recognize this pane in the GarageBand 
window; it allows you to add media (in this case, digital song files, still 
images or video clips) to your GarageBand project for use in a podcast 
or as iPhone ringtones.
 
✓ Return to Beginning button: Clicking this button immediately moves 
the playhead back to the beginning of the Timeline.
 
✓ Move Back/Forward One Measure buttons: To move quickly through 
your song by jumping to the previous or next measure, click the corre-
sponding button.
 
✓ Play button: Hey, old friend! At last, a control that you’ve probably used 
countless times before — and it works just like the same control on your 
audio CD player. Click Play, and GarageBand begins playing your entire 
song. Notice that the Play button turns blue. To pause the music, click 
Play again; the button loses that sexy blue sheen and the playhead stops 
immediately. 
 
✓ Time/Tempo display: This cool-looking LCD display shows you the cur-
rent playhead position in seconds.
 
 You can click the icon at the left of the display to choose other modes, 
such as 
 
• Measures (to display the current measure and mark the beat) 
 
• Chord (to display note and chord names) 
 
• Project (to show or change the key, tempo, and signature for 
the song).
 
✓ Volume slider: Here’s another familiar face. Just drag the slider to raise 
or lower the volume.
Of course, more controls are scattered around the GarageBand window, but 
these are the main controls used to compose a song . . . which is the next 
stop!
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
In this section, I cover the basics of composition in GarageBand, working 
from the very beginning. Follow along with this running example:
 
1. Close all existing GarageBand windows.
 
 GarageBand displays the top-level New Project dialog.

235
 Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand
 
2. Click New Project on the list at the left.
 
3. Click the Piano icon and click Choose.
 
 GarageBand displays the New Project dialog, as shown in Figure 15-2.
 
 By choosing the Piano, my new GarageBand project will have one track 
already in place — a grand piano. If you choose Electric Guitar or Voice, 
you’ll have a project automatically created with an electric guitar track 
or male and female voice tracks. To create a completely empty project, 
choose Loops.
 
Figure 15-2: 
Start 
creating 
your new 
song here.
 
 
4. Type a name for your new song and then drag the Tempo slider to 
select the beats per minute (bpm).
 
 A GarageBand song can have only one tempo (or speed) throughout, 
expressed as beats per minute.
 
5. If you want to adjust the settings for your song, you can select the
 
• Time signature (the Time box)
 
• Key (the Key box)
 
 If you’re new to music theory (the rules and syntax by which music is 
created and written), just use the defaults. Most of the toe-tappin’ tunes 
that you and I are familiar with fit right in with these settings.

236
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
6. Click the Create button.
 
 You see the window shown in Figure 15-1. (The Blues Jazz Piano 01 loop 
in Figure 15-1 — which I show you how to add in the next section — is 
an example of a typical loop.)
Adding tracks
Although I’m not a musician, I am a music lover, and I know that many clas-
sical composers approached a new work in the same way you approach a 
new song in GarageBand: by envisioning the instruments that they wanted 
to hear. (I imagine Mozart and Beethoven would’ve been thrilled to use 
GarageBand, but I think they did a decent job with pen and paper, too.)
In fact, GarageBand ’09 introduces a Songwriting project (also available from 
the top-level New Project dialog). When you choose the Songwriting project, 
GarageBand presents you with a full set of four instrument tracks, plus a real 
instrument track for your voice. (More on software versus real instrument 
tracks in a page or two.) You’re instantly ready to start adding loops and 
recording your own voice!
 
If you’ve followed along to this point, you’ve noticed two problems with your 
GarageBand window:
 
✓ There’s no keyboard. You can record the contents of a software instru-
ment track by “playing” the keyboard, clicking the keys with your 
mouse. (As you might imagine, this isn’t the best solution.) If you’re a 
musician, the best method of recording your own notes is with a MIDI 
instrument, which I discuss later in the chapter. For now, you can dis-
play the keyboard window by pressing Ô+K. If the keyboard window is 
on the screen and you don’t need it, banish the window by clicking the 
Close button.
 
 Even if you’re not interested in the “point-and-click” keyboard, 
GarageBand offers a musical typing keyboard, where you press the keys 
on your keyboard to simulate the keys on a musical keyboard. (Hey, if 
you don’t have a MIDI instrument, at least it’s better than nothing.) To 
display the musical typing keyboard window, press Shift+Ô+K.
 
✓ The example song has only one track. If you want to write the next 
classical masterpiece for Grand Piano, that’s fine. Otherwise, on the 
GarageBand menu bar, choose Track➪Delete Track to start with a clean 
slate. (I know, I could have started with a Loops project, but this way 
you get to see how to delete a track.)

237
 Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand
 
These are the five kinds of tracks you can use in GarageBand ’09:
 
✓ Software instrument tracks: These tracks aren’t audio recordings. 
Rather, they’re mathematically precise algorithms that your Mac renders 
(or builds) to fit your needs. If you have a MIDI instrument connected to 
your Mac, you can create your own software instrument tracks. (More 
on MIDI instruments later in this chapter.)
 
 In this chapter, I focus on software instrument tracks, which are the 
easiest for a nonmusician to use.
 
✓ Real instrument tracks: A real instrument track is an actual audio 
recording, such as your voice or a physical instrument without a MIDI 
connection. (Think microphone.)
 
✓ Electric Guitar tracks: GarageBand includes a real instrument track 
especially made for an electric guitar, which allows you to use one 
of five different amplifiers and a number of stompboxes (those effect 
pedals that guitarists are always poking with their foot to change the 
sound of their instruments).
 
✓ Podcast artwork track: You get only one of these; it holds photos that 
will appear on a video iPod (or a window on your iWeb site) when your 
podcast is playing.
 
✓ Movie tracks: The video sound track appears if you’re scoring (adding 
music) to an iMovie movie. Along with the video sound track, you get a 
cool companion video track that shows the clips in your movie. (More 
on this in the “Look, I’m John Williams!” sidebar, later in this chapter.)
Time to add a software instrument track of your very own. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Create a New Track button (which carries a plus sign), 
labeled in Figure 15-1.
 
 GarageBand displays the New Track dialog.
 
2. Click the Software Instrument radio button and then click Create.
 
 See all those great instruments in the Track Info pane on the right?
 
3. Choose the general instrument category by clicking it.
 
 I chose Drum Kits.
 
4. From the right column, choose your specific style of weapon, such as 
Rock Kit for an arena sound.
 
 Figure 15-3 illustrates the new track that appears in your list when you 
follow these steps.

If you’re creating a podcast and you want to add a series of still images that 
will appear on a video iPod’s screen (or on your iWeb page), follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the View Media Browser button (labeled in Figure 15-1).
 
2. Click the Photos button.
 
 GarageBand displays all the photos in your iPhoto library and Events.
 
3. Drag an image from your iPhoto library in the media browser to the 
Track list.
 
 The Podcast track appears at the top of the Track list, and you can add 
and move images in the list at any time, just like the loops that you add 
to your instrument tracks. (More on adding and rearranging the con-
tents of a track later in this section.)
Choosing loops
When you have a new, empty track, you can add loops to build your song. 
You do that by adding loops to your track from the Loop Browser — Apple 
provides you with thousands of loops to choose from — and photos from 

239
 Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand
your media browser. Click the Loop Browser button (which bears the all-
seeing eye) to display your collection, as shown in Figure 15-4.
 
If your Loop Browser looks different from what you see in Figure 15-4, that’s 
because of the view mode you’re using, just like the different view modes 
available for a Finder window. The three-icon button in the upper-left corner 
of the Loop Browser toggles the browser display between column, musical 
button, and podcast sounds view. Click the middle of the three buttons to 
switch to button mode.

Search box
Looking for just the right loop
The track in this running example uses a Rock drum kit, but you haven’t 
added a loop yet. (Refer to Figure 15-3.) Follow these steps to search through 
your loop library for just the right rhythm:
 
1. Click the button that corresponds to the instrument you’re using.
 
 I chose the Kits button in the Loop Browser. Click it, and a list of dif-
ferent beats appears in the pane at the bottom of the Loop Browser 
window. (Check out Figure 15-4 for a sneak peek.)

240
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
2. Click one of the loops with a green musical-note icon.
 
 Go ahead; this is where things get fun! GarageBand begins playing the 
loop nonstop, allowing you to get a feel for how that particular loop 
sounds.
 
 The examples I chose for this chapter are software instruments, which 
are identified by a green musical-note icon (If you’ve got a band at home, 
have at it with live instruments).
 
3. Click another entry in the list, and the application switches immedi-
ately to that loop.
 
 Now you’re beginning to understand why GarageBand is so cool for both 
musicians and the note-impaired. It’s like having your own band, with 
members who never get tired and play whatever you want while you’re 
composing. (Mozart would’ve loved this.)
 
 If you want to search for a particular instrument, click in the Search box 
(labeled in Figure 15-4) and type the text you want to match. 
GarageBand returns the search results in the list.
 
4. Scroll down the list and continue to sample the different loops until 
you find one that fits like a glove.
 
 For this reporter, it’s Southern Rock Drums 01.
 
5. Drag the entry to your Rock Kit track and drop it at the very begin-
ning of the Timeline (as indicated by the playhead).
 
 Your window will look like Figure 15-5.
 
If you want that same beat throughout the song, you don’t need to add any 
more loops to that track. (More on extending that beat in the next section.) 
However, if you want the drum’s beat to change later in the song, you add a 
second loop after the first one in the same track. For now, leave this track 
as is.
 
Whoops! Did you do something that you regret? Don’t forget that you can 
undo most actions in GarageBand by pressing the old standby Ô+Z immedi-
ately afterward.
Second verse, same as the first
When you compose, you can add tracks for each instrument that you want in 
your song:
 
✓ Each track can have more than one loop.
 
✓ Loops don’t have to start at the beginning; you can drop a loop any-
where in the Timeline.

241
 Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand
For example, in Figure 15-6, you can see that my drum kit kicks in first, but 
my bass line doesn’t begin until some time later (for a funkier opening).
 
Figure 15-5: 
A track 
with a loop 
added.
 
Look, I’m John Williams!
You, too, can be a famous composer of 
soundtracks . . . well, perhaps not quite as 
famous as Mr. Williams, but even he had to start 
somewhere. To add a GarageBand score to an 
iMovie, click the Track menu in Garage Band 
and then click Show Movie Track to display the 
Movie track. Choose a movie to score from the 
familiar confines of the Media Browser, and 
drag it to the Movie Track.
At this point, you add and modify instrument 
tracks and loops just as you would any other 
GarageBand project. The existing sound for 
the iMovie project appears in the Movie Sound 
track. A Video Preview pane appears on top 
of the Track Info pane on the right side of the 
GarageBand window. When you click the Play 
button, the video is shown as well so that you 
can check your work and tweak settings (as 
described later in the chapter).
After you’ve finished composing, you can click 
Share on the menu bar and choose to export 
your work to iDVD, as a QuickTime movie 
directly to your hard drive, or to iTunes as a 
movie. Note that you can’t return to iMovie with 
your project, so scoring should be a final step in 
the production of your movie.

242
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
You put loops on separate tracks so that they can play simultaneously on dif-
ferent instruments. If all your loops in a song are added on the same track, you 
hear only one loop at any one time, and all the loops use the same software 
instrument. By creating multiple tracks, you give yourself the elbow room to 
bring in the entire band at the same time. It’s über-convenient to compose 
your song when you can see each instrument’s loops and where they fall in 
the song.
 
Click the Reset button in the Loop Browser to choose another instrument or 
genre category.

Resizing, repeating, and moving loops
If you haven’t already tried listening to your entire song, try it now. You 
can click Play at any time without wreaking havoc on your carefully created 
tracks. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?
But wait: I bet the song stopped after about five seconds, right? (You can 
watch the passing seconds using either the Time/Tempo display or the 
second rule that appears at the very top of the Timeline.) I’m sure that you 
want your song to last more than five seconds! After the playhead moves 

243
 Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand
past the end of the last loop, your song is over. Click Play again to pause the 
playback; then click the Return to Beginning button (labeled in Figure 15-1) to 
move the playhead back to the beginning of the song.
The music stops so soon because your loops are only so long. Most are five 
seconds in length, and others are even shorter. To keep the groove going, 
you have to do one of three things:
 
✓ Resize the loop. Hover your cursor over either the left or right edge of 
most loops, and an interesting thing happens: Your cursor changes to a 
vertical line with an arrow pointing away from the loop. That’s your cue 
to click and drag — and as you drag, most loops expand to fill the space 
you’re making, repeating the beats in perfect time. By resizing a loop, 
you can literally drag the loop’s edge as long as you like.
 
✓ Repeat the loop. Depending on the loop that you chose, you might find 
that resizing it doesn’t repeat the measure. Instead, the new part of the 
loop is simply dead air. In fact, the length of many loops is limited to 
anywhere from one to five seconds. However, if you move your cursor 
over the side of a loop that you want to extend, it turns into a verti-
cal line with a circular arrow, which tells you that you can click and 
repeat the loop. GarageBand actually adds multiple copies of the same 
loop automatically, for as far as you drag the loop. In Figure 15-7, I’ve 
repeated the bass loop that you see in Figure 15-6.
 
✓ Add a new loop. You can switch to a different loop to change the flow 
of the music. Naturally, the instrument stays the same, but there’s no 
reason you can’t use a horn-riff loop in your violin track (as long as it 
sounds good played by a violin)! To GarageBand, a software instrument 
track is compatible with any software instrument loop that you add from 
the Loop Browser as long as that loop is marked with our old friend the 
green musical note.
 
You can also use the familiar cut (Ô+X), copy (Ô+C), and paste (Ô+V) editing 
keys to cut, copy, and paste loops from place to place — both on the Timeline 
and from track to track. And you can click a loop and drag it anywhere.
 
Each track can be adjusted so that you can listen to the interplay between two 
or more tracks or hear how your song sounds without a specific track:
 
✓ Click the tiny speaker button under the track name in the list, and the 
button turns blue to indicate that the track is muted. To turn off the 
mute, click the speaker icon again.
 
✓ You can change the volume or balance of each individual track by using 
the mixer that appears next to the track name. This comes in handy if 
you want an instrument to sound louder or confine that instrument to 
the left or right speaker.

244
Part IV: Living the iLife 
A track doesn’t have to be filled for every second with one loop or another. 
Most of my songs have a number of repeating loops with empty space 
between them as different instruments perform solo.
 
Figure 15-7: 
By repeat-
ing the bass 
loop, you 
can keep 
the thump 
flowing.
 
Using the Arrange track
GarageBand includes another method you can use to monkey with your 
music: The Arrange track can be used to define specific sections of a song, 
allowing you to reorganize things by selecting, moving, and copying entire 
sections. For example, you’re probably familiar with the chorus (or refrain) 
of a song and how often it appears during the course of the tune. With the 
Arrange track, you can reposition the entire chorus within your song, car-
rying all the loops and settings within the chorus along with it! If you need 
another chorus, just copy that arrangement.
To use the Arrange track, display it by clicking Track➪Show Arrange Track. 
The Arrange track then appears as a thin strip at the top of the track list. 
Click the Add Region button in the Arrange track (which carries a plus sign) 
and you’ll see a new, untitled region appear (as shown in Figure 15-8). You 
can drag the right side of the Arrangement region to resize it, or drag it to 
move it anywhere in the song.

245
 Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand
 
Who wants an arrangement full of regions named “untitled”? To rename an 
Arrangement region, click the word untitled to select it (the Arrange track 
turns blue), and then click the title again to display a text box. Type a new 
name for the region and press Return.
Now, here’s where Arrangement regions get cool:
 
✓ To move an entire Arrangement region, click the region’s title in the 
Arrange track and then drag it anywhere you like in the song.
 
✓ To copy an Arrangement region, hold down the Option key and drag the 
desired region’s title to the spot where you want the copy to appear.
 
✓ To delete an Arrangement region, select it and press Ô+Option+Delete.
 
✓ To replace the contents of an Arrangement region with those of another 
Arrangement region, hold down the Ô key and drag the desired region’s 
title on top of the offending region’s title.
 
✓ To switch two Arrangement regions in your song — swapping the con-
tents completely — drag one of the Arrangement region titles on top of 
the other and lift your finger from the mouse.

Tweaking the settings for a track
You don’t think that John Mayer or U2 just “play and walk away,” do you? No, 
they spend hours after the recording session is over, tweaking their music in 
the studio and on the mixing board until every note sounds just as it should. 
You can adjust the settings for a track, too. The tweaks that you can perform 
include adding effects (pull a Hendrix and add echo and reverb to your elec-
tric guitar track) and kicking in an equalizer (for fine-tuning the sound of your 
background horns).
To make adjustments to a track, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the desired track in the track list to select it.
 
2. Click the Track Info button (labeled in Figure 15-1).
 
3. Click the Edit tab to show the settings shown in Figure 15-9.
 
4. Click the button next to each effect you want to enable. (The button 
glows green when enabled.)
 
 Each of the effects has a modifier setting. For example, you can adjust 
the amount of echo to add by dragging its slider.

 Chapter 15: Recording Your Hits with GarageBand
 
 GarageBand offers a Visual Equalizer window that you can use to create 
a custom equalizer setting for each track. You can display the Visual EQ 
window by clicking the animated button next to the Visual EQ control on 
the Edit pane. To change the Bass, Low Mid, High Mid, or Treble setting 
for a track, click and drag the equalizer waveform in the desired direc-
tion. And yep, you can do this while your song is playing, so you can use 
both your eyes and ears to define the perfect settings!
 
5. To save the instrument as a new custom instrument click the Save 
Instrument button.
 
 Now you can use the instrument the next time you add a track.
 
6. Click the Track Info button again to return to GarageBand.
Join in and jam . . . or talk!
As I mention elsewhere in this chapter, 
GarageBand is even more fun if you happen to 
play an instrument! (And yes, I’m envious, no 
matter how much I enjoy the techno and jazz 
music that I create. After all, take away my 
iMac, and I’m back to playing the kazoo . . . at 
least until I absorb all the Learn to Play lessons 
for the guitar.)
Most musicians use MIDI instruments to play 
music on the computer. That pleasant-sounding 
acronym stands for Musical Instrument Digital 
Interface. A wide variety of MIDI instruments 
is available these days, from traditional MIDI 
keyboards to more exotic fun, such as MIDI 
saxophones. For example, Apple sells a 49-key 
MIDI keyboard from M-Audio for around $100; it 
connects to your iMac using a USB connection.
Most MIDI instruments on the market today use 
a USB connection. If you have an older instru-
ment with traditional MIDI ports — they’re 
round, so you’ll never confuse them with USB 
connectors — you need a USB-to-MIDI con-
verter. You can find this type of converter on 
the Apple Web site for around $50. (If you’re 
recording your voice for a podcast, things are 
easier because you can use your iMac’s built-in 
microphone; however, most podcasting profes-
sionals opt for an external microphone, which 
offers better fidelity and doesn’t force you to sit 
directly in front of your screen to record.)
After your instrument is connected, you can 
record tracks using any software instrument. 
Create a new software instrument track as I 
demonstrate in this chapter, select it, and then 
play a few notes. Suddenly you’re playing the 
instrument you chose! (If nothing happens, 
check the MIDI status light — which appears 
in the time display — to see whether it blinks 
with each note you play. If not, check the instal-
lation of your MIDI connection and make sure 
you’ve loaded any required drivers, as well as 
your MIDI settings within QuickTime and the 
input settings in the System Preferences Sound 
pane.)
Drag the playhead to a beat or two before 
the spot in the Timeline where you want your 
recording to start. This gives you time to match 
the beat. Then click the big red Record button 
and start jamming or speaking! When you’re 
finished, click the Play button to stop recording.

Part IV: Living the iLife 
Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
Save your work often in GarageBand, just as you do in the other iLife

Automatic Composition with Magic 
GarageBand
In a hurry? Too rushed to snag loops and tweak effects? Never fear, 
GarageBand ’09 can even compose a song automatically! The Magic 
GarageBand feature provides a wide range of nine different genres of music 
to choose from — everything from blues to reggae to funk and rock.
To create a song automatically, follow these steps:
 
1. Close all GarageBand windows.
 
 If you’re currently working on a song, GarageBand will prompt you to 
save it before closing the window.
 
2. Click the Magic GarageBand button in the New Project dialog.
 
3. Click the desired genre button and click Choose.
 
 Hover your cursor over a genre button to get a preview of the song for 
that genre.
 
4. To hear the entire song with the default instruments, click Entire Song 
and press the Play button.
 
 Alternatively, to hear a short sample of the song, click Snippet and press 
the Play button.
 
 As shown in Figure 15-10, you see each instrument on stage. To choose 
a different musical style for an instrument (or a variation of the instru-
ment), click it and then select the desired sound from the menu below 
the stage.
 
 Click My Instrument (the empty space in the middle of the stage) to add 
your own voice or instrumental using a microphone or MIDI instrument.
 
5. When the song fits like a glove, click Create Project to open the song 
as a project in GarageBand.
Now you can edit and tweak the song to your heart’s delight as you can any 
other GarageBand project, adding other software or real instrument tracks as 
necessary.

Sharing Your Songs and Podcasts
After you finish your song, you can play it whenever you like through 
GarageBand. But then again, that isn’t really what you want, is it? You want to 
share your music with others with an audio CD or download it to your iPod 
so that you can enjoy it yourself while walking through the mall!
iTunes to the rescue! As with the other iLife applications that I cover in this 
book, GarageBand can share the music you make through the digital hub that 
is your Mac.
Creating MP3 and AAC files and ringtones
You can create an MP3 or AAC file (or even an iPhone ringtone) from your 
song or podcast project in just a few simple steps:
 
1. Open the song that you want to share.
 
2. Choose Share➪Send Song to iTunes.
 
 GarageBand displays the settings you see in Figure 15-11.
 
 To create a ringtone and send it to iTunes, choose Share➪Send 
Ringtones to iTunes.

Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
3. Click in each of the four text boxes to type the playlist, artist name, 
composer name, and album name for the tracks you create.
 
 You can leave the defaults as they are, if you prefer. Each track that you 
export is named after the song’s name in GarageBand.
 
4. Click the Compress Using pop-up menu and choose the encoder 
GarageBand should use to compress your song file.
 
 The default is AAC, but you can also choose MP3 encoding for wider 
device compatibility.
 
5. Click the Audio Settings pop-up menu to select the proper audio qual-
ity for the finished file.
 
 The higher the quality, the larger the file. GarageBand displays the 
approximate file size and finished file information in the description box.
 
6. Click Share.
After a second or two of hard work, your Mac opens the iTunes window and 
highlights the new (or existing) playlist that contains your new song.

Sending a podcast to iWeb or iTunes
If you’ve prepared a new podcast episode in GarageBand, you can send it 
automatically to iWeb or iTunes by following these steps:
 
1. Open the podcast that you want to export to iWeb.
 
 Make sure that the Podcast track is displayed. If necessary, click Track➪
Show Podcast Track to display it.
 
2. Choose Share➪Send Podcast to iWeb (or Share➪Send Podcast to 
iTunes).
 
3. Click the Compress Using pop-up menu and choose the encoder that 
GarageBand should use to compress your podcast file.
 
 Your choices are AAC and MP3 format.
 
4. Click the Audio Settings pop-up menu to select the proper audio qual-
ity for the finished file.
 
5. Click Share.
Hey, GarageBand, teach me how to play!
Until the arrival of GarageBand ’09, you were 
limited to creating music — and if you were a 
nonmusician like yours truly, GarageBand had 
no practical use as a tool for teaching yourself 
how to actually play an instrument.
Ah, but Apple’s introduction of Learn to Play 
actually turns GarageBand into your private 
video tutor for basic piano and guitar! From 
the New Project dialog, click the Learn to Play 
heading to display your lessons. Right out of the 
box, you have an Introduction to both instru-
ments, but you can download eight more free 
lessons for each instrument from the Lesson 
Store — and they cover more advanced topics 
such as fingering and chords. Tim, your on-
screen instructor, can even record what you 
play.
If you find the free Learn to Play lessons valu-
able, you can move up to the Artist lessons, 
which are actually taught by famous musi-
cians (including favorites of mine such as John 
Fogerty and Sting, who actually teaches you 
how to play “Roxanne”)! Each Artist lesson is 
$4.99 — well worth the price.

Creating a Web Site with iWeb
In This Chapter
▶ Introducing the iWeb window
▶ Planning your site
▶ Adding a new site and pages
▶ Editing pages
▶ Setting site and page attributes with the Inspector
▶ Publishing sites to the Internet
I
 keep telling everyone who’ll listen: The Web is simple. Or at least it 
should be.
Kids in preschool these days know how to use a browser. Millions of people 
contribute to Facebook pages, help to create the dynamic reference wonder 
that is Wikipedia, and correspond effortlessly through Web-based e-mail. Yet 
there’s one untamed wilderness that many iMac owners haven’t explored — 
or even set foot in! That’s the jungle of HTML, the language used to create 
Web pages. Today’s advanced Web page design is complex, and it’s not par-
ticularly fun, either. Have you thrown up your hands and declared, “I guess 
I’ll never get my own Web site on the Internet?”
Forget your Web site envy, fellow Mac enthusiast! With iWeb, Apple has pro-
vided a guide through that untamed wilderness . . . and suddenly it’s as easy 
and fun to create a Web site as it is to make a movie or write a song with your 
iMac. In this chapter, you discover how to design a site, import your own 
photos, and add all sorts of different pages.
Soon, you’ll proudly hold your head up high and declare to the world, “I am a 
Webmaster!”

254
Part IV: Living the iLife 
Looking around the iWeb Window
All iWeb’s major features and controls fit into a single window, naturally, 
just as it does in iPhoto and iMovie. (I agree with the Apple software design-
ers: Multiple windows equals confusing.) Figure 16-1 illustrates the iWeb 
window, complete with a Web site in progress. The stuff to keep your eye 
on includes
 
✓ Toolbar: Located at the bottom of the window, the iWeb toolbar keeps 
all major controls one or two clicks away.
 
 The iWeb toolbar contains different buttons, depending on the chore 
you’re handling at the moment. Figure 16-1 shows the set of toolbar but-
tons that you see when you’re editing a page.
 
✓ Layout: You need elbow room to build a Web page, so the Layout sec-
tion of the iWeb interface dominates the window. You create and edit 
your pages in the Layout display and then use it to preview and test-
drive your finished site.
 
✓ Site Organizer: The strip to the left of the layout display is the Site 
Organizer, which allows you to organize your Web sites, add new pages 
to a site, and select an existing page for editing.
 
Figure 16-1: 
The iWeb 
window 
holds every-
thing you 
need to put 
your mark

255
 Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site with iWeb
Before we get down to business, it’s overview time. You essentially follow 
three phases to put your new site on the Web:
 
1. Decide which pages you need.
 
2. Create a new site and build those pages.
 
3. Publish your site to your MobileMe account (or to a Web server using 
FTP).
I go over each of these phases in order. (They taught me that in college . . . 
along with the history of the Aztecs and the wonders of FIFO accounting.)
Planning Your Pages
Every properly designed Web site has a purpose: to inform, to entertain, or to 
sell stuff. For example, if your site is a personal or informational site, it may 
contain downloads or contact information. The pages you add to your site 
should all reflect that common purpose.
iWeb focuses on creating personal sites for entertainment. It can produce the 
following types of pages for your site:
 
✓ Welcome: This is the default first page that iWeb adds to a site you 
create. The Welcome page familiarizes your visitor with the idea behind 
your site, and perhaps offers a snippet of the latest developments on the 
site in a “What’s New” paragraph.
 
✓ About Me: This page provides a biography of you or another person, 
listing things like your age, favorite songs, and favorite foods. (After all, 
that’s important stuff.) Links are provided to your photo album pages 
and other Web sites you want to share.
 
✓ Photos: Oh, this is good stuff here — iWeb makes it easy to add one of 
those cool online photo galleries for your snapshots, complete with a 
Web slideshow! You can add Events and albums from iPhoto, too.
 
✓ My Albums: You can organize all your Photos and Movie pages on a 
single My Albums page. Visitors click a thumbnail to jump to the cor-
responding Photos page or Movies page — it’s a visual index done the 
right way.
 
✓ Movie: Got a QuickTime movie you’ve created with iMovie to share with 
others? This is the page that presents it to your adoring fans.

256
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
✓ Blog: Adding a Blog (or personal Web journal) page is a somewhat dif-
ferent beast: iWeb keeps track of each addition you make in an entry list 
so that you can quickly add or delete entries without requiring tons of 
scrolling, cutting, and pasting. A Blog page also includes an archive so 
that deleted entries aren’t lost forever.
 
✓ Podcast: Consider a podcast as an audio (or audio/visual) blog — it’s 
designed to be downloaded to a visitor’s iPod or computer for later 
enjoyment. As does the Blog page, a Podcast page has an entry list and 
an archive list attached to it.
 
✓ Blank: Yep, an old-fashioned blank page, ready for you to fill with what-
ever you like.
Before you even launch iWeb, jot down on a piece of paper (or put in a 
Sticky) these important points:
 
✓ What message do I want to communicate to visitors?
 
✓ What tone will I use — funny, informal, or businesslike?
 
✓ What stuff do I want to offer: photos, movies, or podcasts?
Now you have the starting point for your site and you know what you want to 
include . . . so let’s get down with the Web!
Adding a New Site
When you open iWeb for the first time, the application creates a new site for 
you, and you can rename and modify this default site to your heart’s content. 
In fact, for many of us, one site is all we ever create — but iWeb can easily 
handle multiple Web sites, keeping them separate in the Site Organizer.
If there’s at least one existing site in your Site Organizer, iWeb automatically 
displays the last site you were working on. Therefore, if you want to create 
an entirely new site, you have to perform a little manual labor. Here are a 
number of different ways to add a site:
 
✓ Choose File➪New Site.
 
✓ Press Ô+Shift+N.
 
✓ Control-click (or right-click) in the Site Organizer and click New Site.
iWeb leaps into action and displays the template sheet you see in Figure 16-2. 
Scroll through the template themes in the list at the left of the sheet until 
you find one that matches the tone you decided on in the previous section. 

257
 Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site with iWeb
(Informal, formal, or silly, iWeb has templates that match every mood!) Click 
a template on the left, and the application automatically updates the page 
type thumbnails on the right.
 
Figure 16-2: 
Choosing a 
template for 
a new site.
 
When you choose a template, iWeb automatically provides your pages with a 
common background, color scheme, and fonts so that your finished Web site 
has a common theme throughout.
After you find the right look and feel, click the desired template in the 
scrolling list at the left, click the Welcome page thumbnail, and then click 
the Choose button. iWeb creates a new site heading in the Site Organizer, 
complete with the default Welcome page. Figure 16-1, shown previously, 
illustrates the Welcome page from a new site I created with the Main Event 
template.
Adding a New Page
Time to add the pages you plan for your site! For example, I’ve decided to 
add Photo and About Me pages to the new site I’ve created. In the following 
section, I discuss how to edit these pages to personalize them . . . but for 
now, I just want you to add the pages.

258
Part IV: Living the iLife 
If you have multiple sites in your Site Organizer list, click the top-level head-
ing for the desired site to select it. You can add pages by
 
✓ Clicking the Add Page button on the toolbar at the bottom of the iWeb 
window
 
✓ Choosing File➪New Page
 
✓ Pressing Ô+N
 
✓ Control-clicking or right-clicking the site header in the Site Organizer 
and clicking New Page
 
Want to start with an existing page as a basis for a new page? Right-click that 
page entry in the Site Organizer and choose Duplicate. iWeb creates a new 
page with exactly the same contents and adds it to the site.
Pages are listed under the main site heading in outline format, making it easy 
to expand or collapse a site by clicking the familiar rotating triangle icon next 
to the site heading. (Apple calls these disclosure triangles. Wowzers!)
Deleting a page — or a whole site, for that matter — is easy in iWeb. Right-
click the offending page or site heading in the Site Organizer and choose 
Delete Page/Delete Site. Note that iWeb doesn’t prompt you for confirmation 
here, so these aren’t commands to toy with.
Editing a Page
If you have your site framework complete, you can actually put your site on 
the Internet as-is! Of course, the photos would all be of good-looking strang-
ers, and most of the text would read like Pig Latin nonsense. (Come to think 
of it, I’ve been on some real sites that aren’t much better. Go figure.)
I think we both agree, however, that you want to personalize your pages with 
your own information. To begin editing a page, click it in the Site Organizer.
Modifying text
First, update the text with your own information by following these steps:
 
1. Click the text you want to replace.
 
 As do most desktop publishing applications, iWeb uses boxes to enclose 
text. When you click the text, the box appears, with handles that you 
can drag to resize the box.

259
 Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site with iWeb
 
2. Begin typing your text.
 
 iWeb replaces the existing template text with the text you type, using 
the text formatting taken from the template. Don’t forget that you can 
paste text from the Clipboard by pressing Ô+V. To match the text style 
of the template, though, press Option+Shift+Ô+V.
 
 Mistakes are passé in iWeb. To undo your last action, you can always 
press the familiar Ô+Z keyboard shortcut or choose Edit➪Undo.
 
3. Highlight and format your new text as necessary.
 
 To make changes easier, click the Inspector button in the iWeb toolbar. 
The window you see in Figure 16-3 appears, allowing you to change text 
color, alignment, and spacing with aplomb. (You find more about the 
Inspector later.) You can click the Colors or Fonts buttons on the iWeb 
toolbar to display a Color Picker or Font Panel for the selected text.
 
4. Click outside the text box after you’re satisfied with the text.
Because you’re likely modifying everything on the template pages from the 
title to the last box on the page, repeat Steps 1–4 for each section of text you 
want to change.
 
Figure 16-3: 
Using the 
Inspector 
palette to 
format text.
 
Replacing images
If your page includes photographs that you want to change, follow these 
steps:

260
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
1. Click the image you want to replace.
 
 As it does with a block of text, iWeb displays a box around the image, 
complete with resizing handles.
 
2. Drag an image to the image box from a Finder window.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Show Media button in the toolbar, which 
displays the Media Browser you see in Figure 16-4. From this window, 
you can click the Photos tab to choose an image from your iPhoto 
library.
 
 You can hide the Media Browser to make more room for your page 
layout. Just click the Hide Media button in the toolbar.
 
3. Adjust your new image if necessary.
 
 Click the Adjust button, and iWeb displays a cool, semi-opaque dialog 
that allows you to tweak image settings, such as tint, brightness, and 
sharpness (see Figure 16-5). Click Enhance to allow iWeb to choose the 
settings it considers best for the image or click Reset Image to restore 
the photo to its original appearance. When you’re satisfied with the 
image, click the Close button on the dialog to return to the image box.
 
4. Click outside the image box (usually the page background) after 
you’re satisfied with the photo.
Again, lather/rinse/repeat for each image you want to change on your page.

Adding new elements
iWeb also makes it easy to add new items to a page. The list of extras 
includes
 
✓ Audio: You can add a song (complete with volume control, Play/Pause 
button, and progress slider) to your page! Either drag an audio file 
from a Finder window to your page, or click the Audio tab in the Media 
Browser to select a song from your iTunes or GarageBand collections. 
You can drag any image to the player that appears. (How about a photo 
of your daughter instead of album art?)
 
✓ Photos: To add a new image box to your page, drag a photo from a 
Finder window to the iWeb layout section. Or, click the Photos tab in the 
Media Browser to choose an image from your iPhoto library, or throw 
caution to the wind and drag an entire Event or an album to your new 
page! iWeb takes care of all the details.
 
✓ Movies: Yep, you guessed it: You can drag a movie clip from a Finder 
window to your page, or click the Movies tab in the Media Browser to 
choose a movie from iMovie or your Movies folder.
 
✓ Text: Choose Insert➪Text or click the Text button in the toolbar.
 
✓ Shapes: Click the Shape button in the toolbar to display the pop-up 
menu and then click the desired shape. (Don’t forget to resize it as you 
desire with the box handles.)

262
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
✓ Widgets: Click this tab in the Media Browser to insert a widget (a Web 
applet) to your page. For example, HTML Snippet allows you to type 
HTML code directly into place on the page, or paste HTML code that 
you’ve copied from another Web site. You can also insert interactive 
Google Adsense advertisements or a Google Map. To populate the page 
with a MobileMe Gallery, choose the MobileMe Gallery widget and select 
a Gallery you’ve created using the iPhoto MobileMe Gallery feature. (For 
the complete scoop on iPhoto, cruise over to Chapter 12.) Other widgets 
include a countdown timer and YouTube videos.
 
 You can move a widget anywhere on a page by dragging it, and it can be 
resized just as a text box can. 
 
✓ Links: If you’re editing text and you want to insert a Web link, choose 
Insert➪Hyperlink and choose from the menu that appears. You can 
choose to link to another Web page or insert a link that automatically 
sends an e-mail message to the mail address you provide. You can also 
offer a file for downloading.
 
 iWeb can automatically detect e-mail and Web addresses that you type 
in a text box, so you don’t have to use the Links menu. To enable this 
feature, choose iWeb➪Preferences and click the Automatically Detect 
Email and Web Addresses check box to select it.
 
✓ Button: Your Web page can include buttons that allow your visitors to 
e-mail you or display the number of hits (visits) your page has received. 
Choose Insert➪Button and click an option to add or remove a specific 
button. (If the menu option is selected, the button appears on your 
page.) Blog and Podcast pages can also offer RSS feeds (for automated 
retrieval of new entries within a Web browser), subscriptions to your 
podcasts, and slideshows.
 
With these tools, you can use the Blank page template to create your own new 
pages. Personally, I prefer to use the professionally designed templates 
offered by Apple as starting points, removing whatever I don’t need and 
adding new content.
Most Web designers would strongly recommend that you use a common 
theme for all the pages within a site (to lend continuity). Of course, you can 
also stick your tongue out at those very same Web designers and select a 
different theme for every page! To select a different theme for a page, open 
the page in iWeb and click the Theme button in the toolbar; then click the 
desired thumbnail from the pop-up menu. Nothing’s lost but the old look of 
the page, so feel free to experiment to your heart’s content.
 
Ready to offer a slideshow on your Web site? Add a Photo page to your site 
and notice that the Start Slideshow button is already in place at the top of the 
page. Simply add the photos to the page using the Media Browser or by drag-
ging them from a Finder window. When your visitors click the Start Slideshow 

263
 Chapter 16: Creating a Web Site with iWeb
button, all the photos on the page are displayed in a pop-up window. (Other 
Mac and PC owners using Safari can enjoy the show, but older versions of 
Internet Explorer and Firefox can’t handle it.)
Tweaking with the Inspector
Earlier, you used the Inspector to change text formatting attributes — but this 
star performer can do much more than just that! To modify page characteris-
tics, click the page in the Site Organizer, display the Inspector, and click the 
Page Inspector button, which carries a document icon. These settings allow 
you to change the name of a page; you can also elect to include or exclude this 
page from the site menu, or to drop the site menu from this page.
If your site contains a Blog or Podcast page, you can click the RSS button to 
provide an automated RSS (RDF Site Summary) feed to your visitors. (For 
more information on RSS and how it works in Safari, see Chapter 8.)
Publishing Your Web Site
After you finish with a new site — or you’re satisfied with the edits you make 
to existing pages — it’s time to get your masterpiece on the Web! Even the 
best Web site design is worth next to nil if it isn’t available on the Internet, 
and in this last section, I demonstrate how to publish your Web site to your 
MobileMe account or to a separate server maintained by a third party (per-
haps your ISP, your company, or Dave down the street).
You specify where your iWeb site will be published from the Site Publishing 
Settings screen. 
 
To make global changes to a site, click the site name in the Site Organizer. 
iWeb switches to the Site Publishing Settings screen (Figure 16-6), where you 
can change the name of the site, your contact e-mail, where the site is pub-
lished, and password protection for MobileMe sites.
Click the site name in the Site Organizer to display the Publish To pop-up 
menu (Figure 16-6). iWeb offers the following publishing options:
 
✓ Publish to MobileMe: Your site is hosted by Apple as part of your 
MobileMe subscription. The application takes care of everything, 
uploading any changed pages or media.

264
Part IV: Living the iLife 
 
✓ Publish to FTP Server: This publishing option provides you with a com-
pletely different collection of settings on the Site Publishing Settings 
screen. You’ll need to furnish iWeb with your Web server’s FTP settings 
(which should be furnished to you by the host) and your site’s address 
(or URL).
 
✓ Publish to a Local Folder: The final publishing option creates a folder 
on your hard drive that contains all the files to display your Web site. 
This is the option to choose if you’re not a MobileMe subscriber and you 
don’t use a third-party hosting service. You can add these files directly 
to your home or business Web server. Once again, you must supply the 
site URL as it will appear on the Internet after you copy or upload the 
site files to the server.
After you’ve set the type of publishing the site will use, it’s time to take care 
of business! Click the site to select it in the Site Organizer and then click the 
Publish Site button on the toolbar. The application takes care of everything 
else, automatically uploading all pages and media (if you choose MobileMe 
or FTP publishing) or saving them on your hard drive (if you chose the Local 
Folder option).
 
In a hurry? You can elect to publish just the changes necessary to update your 
site: Instead of clicking the Publish Site button on the toolbar, click the File 
menu and choose Publish Site Changes.

W
hat’s the difference between word processing and desktop publish-
ing? In a nutshell, it’s in how you design your document. Most folks 
use a word processor like an old-fashioned typewriter. (Yawn.)
A desktop publishing application allows far more creativity in choosing where 
to place text, how to align graphics, and how to edit formats. In this chapter, I 
show you how to set your inner designer free from the tedious constraints of 
word processing! Whether you need a simple letter, a stunning brochure, or a 
multipage newsletter, Pages ’09 can handle the job with ease — and you’ll be 
surprised at how simple it is to use.
Creating a New Pages Document
To create a new Pages document from scratch, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click your hard drive icon and click the Applications entry in 
the Finder window sidebar. Double-click the iWork folder to open it.
 
2. Double-click the Pages icon.
 
 Pages displays the Template Chooser window that you see in Figure 17-1.

3. Click the type of document you want to create in the list to the left. 
The thumbnails on the right are updated with templates that match 
your choice.
 
4. Click the template that most closely matches your needs.
 
5. Click Choose to create a new document using the template you 
selected.
Open an Existing Pages Document
Of course, you can always open a Pages document from a Finder window — 
just double-click the document icon. However, you can also open a Pages 
document from within the program. Follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the Pages icon to run the program.
 
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
 The Open dialog operates much the same as a Finder window in icon, 
list, or column view mode.

269
 Chapter 17: Desktop Publishing with Pages
 
3. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the left of the dialog and 
then click folders and subfolders until you’ve located the Pages docu-
ment. (You can also click in the Search box at the top of the Open 
dialog and type in a portion of the document name or its contents.)
 
4. Double-click the filename to load it.
 
If you want to open a Pages document that you’ve edited in the recent past, 
things get even easier! Just click File➪Open Recent, and you can open the doc-
ument with a single click from the submenu that appears.
Saving Your Work
To save a Pages document after you finish it (or to take a break while design-
ing), follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ô+S.
 
 If you’re saving a document that hasn’t yet been saved, the familiar Save 
As sheet appears.
 
2. Type a filename for your new document.
 
3. Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to save the 
document.
 
 Alternatively, click the button sporting the down arrow to expand the 
Save As sheet. This allows you to navigate to a different location, or to 
create a new folder to store this Pages project.
 
4. Click Save.
Touring the Pages Window
Before we dive into any real work, let me show you around the Pages 
window! You’ll find the following major components and controls, as 
shown in Figure 17-2:
 
✓ Pages list: This thumbnail list displays all the pages you’ve created 
within your document. (For a single-page document, of course, the 
Page list will contain only a single thumbnail.) You can switch instantly 
between different pages in your document by clicking the desired 
thumbnail in the list.
 
✓ Layout pane: This section takes up most of the Pages window — it’s 
where you design and edit each page in your document.

270
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
✓ Toolbar: Yep, Pages has its own toolbar. The toolbar keeps all the most 
common application controls within easy, one-click reach.
 
✓ Styles Drawer: This window extension allows you to quickly switch the 
appearance of selected paragraphs, characters, and lists. You can hide 
and display the Styles Drawer from the View menu or from the View 
drop-down menu on the toolbar.
 
✓ Format Bar: This button strip runs under the Pages toolbar. Use it to 
format selected text, paragraphs, and lists on the fly.

Entering and Editing Text
If you’ve used a modern word processing program, you’ll feel right at home 
typing within Pages. To enter text, simply begin typing. To edit existing text 
in your Pages document, select and highlight the text. You can delete text by 
pressing Delete.

271
 Chapter 17: Desktop Publishing with Pages
Using Text and Graphics Boxes
Within Pages, text and graphics appear in boxes, which can be resized by 
clicking and dragging on one of the handles that appear around the edges of 
the box. (Hover your cursor over one of the square handles and you’ll see 
that it changes to a double-sided arrow, indicating that Pages is ready to 
resize the box.)
You can also move a box, including all the stuff it contains, to another loca-
tion within the Layout pane. Click in the center of the box and drag the box 
to the desired spot. Note that Pages displays blue alignment lines to help you 
align the box with other elements around it (or with regular divisions of the 
page, such as the vertical center of a poster or flyer). Figure 17-3 illustrates 
a box containing text that I’m moving; note the vertical alignment line that 
automatically appears.
 
To select text or graphics within a box, you must first click the box to select it 
and then click again on the line of text or the graphic that you want to change.

The Three Amigos: Cut, Copy, and Paste
“Hang on, Mark, you’ve covered moving stuff, but what if you want to copy 
a block of text or a photo to a second location? Or how about cutting some-
thing from a document open in another application?” Good questions, dear 
reader! That’s when you can call on the power of the cut, copy, and paste 
features within Pages. The next few sections explain how you do these 
actions.
Cutting stuff
Cutting selected text or graphics removes it from your Pages document 
and places that material within your Clipboard. (Think of the Clipboard as 
a holding area for snippets of text and graphics that you want to manipu-
late.) To cut text or graphics, select some material and Choose Edit➪Cut 
or press Ô+X.
Copying text and images
When you copy text or graphics, the original selection remains untouched, 
but a copy of the selection is placed in the Clipboard. Select some text or 
graphics and Choose Edit➪Copy or Press Ô+C.
 
To copy selected items by dragging, hold down the Option key while you drag 
the items to their destination.
 
If you cut or copy a new selection into the Clipboard, it erases what was there. 
In other words, the Clipboard holds only the latest material you cut or copied.
Pasting from the Clipboard
Are you wondering what you can do with all that stuff that’s accumulating 
in your Clipboard? Pasting the contents of the Clipboard places the material 
at the current location of the insertion cursor. You must paste the contents 
before you cut or copy again to avoid losing what’s in the Clipboard.
To paste the Clipboard contents, click the insertion cursor at the location 
you want and Choose Edit➪Paste or Press Ô+V.

273
 Chapter 17: Desktop Publishing with Pages
Formatting Text the Easy Way
If you feel that some (or all) of the text in your Pages document needs a face-
lift, you can format that text any way you like. Formatting lets you change the 
color, font family, character size, and attributes as necessary.
After the text is selected, you can apply basic formatting in two ways:
 
✓ Use the Format bar. The Format bar appears directly underneath the 
Pages toolbar, as shown in Figure 17-2. Click to select a font control to 
display a pop-up menu and then click your choice. For example, click 
the Font Family button and you can change the font family from Arial to 
a more daring font. You can also select characteristics such as the font’s 
background color (perfect for highlighting key information) or choose 
italicizing or bolding. The Format Bar also provides buttons for text 
alignment (Align Left, Center, Align Right, and Justify).
 
✓ Use the Format menu. Most controls on the Format Bar are also avail-
able from the Format menu. Click Format and hover the mouse cursor 
over the Font menu item, and you can then apply bolding, italicizing, 
and underlining to the selected text. You can also make the text bigger 
or smaller. To change the alignment from the Format menu, click Format 
and hover the mouse cursor over the Text menu item.
Adding a Spiffy Table
In the world of word processing, a table is a grid that holds text or graphics 
for easy comparison. You can create a custom table layout within Pages with 
a few simple mouse clicks.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the insertion cursor at the location where you want the table to 
appear.
 
2. Click the Table button on the Pages toolbar.
 
 Pages inserts a simple table and displays the Table Inspector. (Both are 
visible in Figure 17-4.)
 
 By default, Pages creates a table with three rows and three columns, 
with an extra row for headings at the top. You can change this layout 
from the Table Inspector — just click in the Body Rows or Body 
Columns box and type a number.

274
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
3. Click within a cell in the table to enter text. The table cell automati-
cally resizes and “wraps” the text you enter to fit. 
 
 You can paste material from the Clipboard into a table. See the earlier 
section “Pasting from the Clipboard” for details on pasting.
 
4. To change the borders on a cell, click the cell to select it and then 
click one of the Cell Border buttons to change the border.
 
 Select a range of multiple cells in a table by holding down Shift as you click. 
Hold down Ô and click to select multiple cells that aren’t contiguous.
 
5. To add a background color (or even fill cells with an image for a back-
ground), click the Cell Background pop-up menu and choose a type of 
background.
 
Figure 17-4:

to tweak 
a table in

document.
 
Adding Alluring Photos
You can choose from two methods of adding a picture within your Pages 
document: as a floating object, meaning that you can place the image in a par-
ticular spot and it doesn’t move, even if you make changes to the text; and as 
an inline object, which flows with the surrounding text as you make layout 
changes.

275
 Chapter 17: Desktop Publishing with Pages
 
✓ Add a floating object. Drag an image file from a Finder window and 
place it at the spot you want within your document. Alternatively, you 
can click the Media button on the toolbar and click Photos, navigate 
to the location where the file is saved, and drag the image thumbnail 
to the spot you want in the document. Figure 17-5 illustrates the Media 
Browser in action.
 
 Note that a floating object (such as a shape or image) can be sent to the 
background, where text will not wrap around it. To bring a background 
object back as a regular floating object, click the object to select it and 
click Arrange➪Bring Background Objects to Front. (More about back-
ground objects later in this chapter.)
 
 To resize an image object, click the image to select it and then drag one 
of the selection handles that appear along the border of the image. 
(They look like tiny squares.) The side-selection handles drag only that 
edge of the frame. The corner-selection handles resize both adjoining 
edges of the selection frame. Hold down the Shift key so that the vertical 
and horizontal proportions remain fixed.
 
Figure 17-5:

that the

276
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
✓ Add an inline object. Hold down the Ô key as you drag an image file 
from a Finder window and place it where you want within your docu-
ment. You can also click the Media toolbar button and click Photos to 
display the Media Browser. Navigate to the location where the file is 
saved, hold down the Ô key, and drag the image thumbnail to the spot 
where you want it in the document.
Adding a Background Shape
To add a shape (such as a rectangle or circle) as a background for your text, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the insertion cursor in the location you want. 
 
2. Click the Shapes button on the Pages toolbar and choose a shape.
 
 The shape appears in your document.
 
3. Click the center of the shape and drag it to a new spot.
 
 Shapes can be resized or moved in the same manner as image boxes.
 
4. Before you can type over a shape, remember to select it and choose 
Arrange➪Send Object to Background. 
Are You Sure about That Spelling?
Pages can check spelling as you type (the default setting) or check it after 
you complete your document. If you find automatic spell-checking distract-
ing, you should definitely pick the latter method.
To check spelling as you type, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Edit and hover the cursor over the Spelling menu item.
 
2. Click Check Spelling As You Type in the submenu that appears.
 
 If a possible misspelling is found, Pages underlines the word with a red, 
dashed line. 
 
3. Right-click the word to choose a possible correct spelling from the list, 
or you can ignore the word if it’s spelled correctly.
 
To turn off automatic spell checking, click the Check Spelling As You Type 
menu item again to deselect it.

277
 Chapter 17: Desktop Publishing with Pages
To check spelling manually, follow these steps:
 
1. Click within the document to place the text insertion cursor where the 
spell check should begin. 
 
2. Click Edit and hover the mouse cursor over the Spelling menu item; 
then choose Check Spelling from the submenu that appears. 
 
3. Right-click any possible misspellings and choose the correct spelling, 
or choose Ignore if the word is spelled correctly.
Printing Your Pages Documents
Ready to start the presses? You can print your Pages document on real 
paper, of course, but don’t forget that you can also save a tree by creating an 
electronic, PDF-format document instead of a printout — the you’ll find the 
PDF button within the standard Snow Leopard Print dialog.
To print your Pages document on old-fashioned paper, follow these steps:
 
1. Within Pages, click File and choose Print.
 
 Pages displays the Print sheet.
 
2. Click in the Copies field and enter the number of copies you need.
 
3. Select the pages to print.
 
• To print the entire document, select All.
 
• To print a range of selected pages, select the From radio button 
and enter the starting and ending pages.
 
4. Click the Print button to send the document to your printer.
Sharing That Poster with Others
Besides printing — which is, after all, so passé — you can choose to share 
your Pages document electronically in a number of ways:
 
✓ Sharing on iWork.com. Apple provides a Web site, iwork.com, where 
you can invite others to view and comment on your Pages document. 
Click the iWork.com button on the Pages toolbar to get started, and the 
site will walk you through the rest of the process.

278
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
 You’ll need an Internet connection to use iWork.com (naturally), as 
well as an Apple ID and a working Apple Mail account. If you didn’t 
create an Apple ID when setting up your iMac or installing Snow 
Leopard, you can save the day by clicking the Create New Account 
button on the iWork.com site.
 
✓ Sharing through e-mail. Click Share➪Send via Mail, and you can choose 
to add your Pages document to a Mail message in three different for-
mats: as a native Pages document file, as a Word format document, or 
as a PDF file. After you’ve selected a format, Pages obligingly launches 
Apple Mail for you automatically and creates a new message, ready for 
you to address and send! (Remember, most Internet Service Providers 
have a maximum message size, so if your document is too large it will 
likely be rejected by your mail server.)
 
✓ Sharing through iWeb. Again, click the Share menu, but this time 
choose Send to iWeb. Pages automatically opens the iWeb site you last 
edited and provides your Pages document as a native Pages document 
file or as a PDF file. (If your visitors may be using PCs or Linux, choose 
the PDF option.)
 
✓ Exporting. Don’t forget that Pages can export your work in one of four 
different formats: a PDF document; a Word format document; an RTF 
(Rich Text Format) file; or even plain text. Click Share➪Export, pick your 
format, click Next, and then select the location where Pages should save 
the file. Click Export and sit back while your favorite desktop publishing 
application does all the work.
 
 To keep your document as close to how it appears in Pages as possible, 
I recommend either PDF or Word. Your document will retain far more of 
your original formatting than an RTF or plain-text document would.

A
re you downright afraid of spreadsheets? Does the idea of building a 
budget with charts and all sorts of fancy graphics send you running for 
the safety of the hall closet? Well, good iMac owner, Apple has once again 
taken something that everyone else considers super-complex and turned it 
into something that normal human beings can use! (Much as Apple did with 
video editing, songwriting, and Web site creation — heck, is there any type of 
software that Apple designers can’t make intuitive and easy to use?)
In this chapter, I get to demonstrate how Numbers can help you organize 
data, analyze important financial decisions, and yes, even maintain a house-
hold budget! You’ll soon see why the Numbers spreadsheet program is spe-
cifically designed with the home Mac owner in mind.

280
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
Before You Launch Numbers . . .
Just in case you’re not familiar with applications like Numbers and Microsoft 
Excel — and the documents they create — let me provide you with a little 
background information.
A spreadsheet organizes and calculates numbers by using a grid system of 
rows and columns. The intersection of each row and column is a cell, and 
cells can hold either text or numeric values (along with calculations that are 
usually linked to the contents of surrounding cells).
Spreadsheets are wonderful tools for making decisions and comparisons 
because they let you “plug in” different numbers — such as interest rates or 
your monthly insurance premium — and instantly see the results. Some of 
my favorite spreadsheets that I use regularly include
 
✓ Car and mortgage loan comparisons
 
✓ A college planner
 
✓ My household budget (not that we pay any attention to it)
Creating a New Numbers Document
As does Pages, the desktop publishing application that’s included in iWork 
’09, Numbers ships with a selection of templates that you can modify quickly 
to create a new spreadsheet. (For example, after a few modifications, you can 
easily use the Budget, Loan Comparison, and Mortgage templates to create 
your own spreadsheets.)
To create a spreadsheet project file, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your Applications folder and double-click the iWork ’09 folder 
to display its contents.
 
2. Double-click the Numbers icon.
 
 Numbers displays the Template Chooser window you see in Figure 18-1.
 
3. Click the type of document you want to create in the list to the left.
 
 The document thumbnails on the right are updated with templates that 
match your choice.
 
4. Click the template that most closely matches your needs.
 
5. Click Choose to open a new document using the template you selected.

281

Opening an Existing Spreadsheet File
If a Numbers document appears in a Finder window, you can just double-click 
the Document icon to open it; Numbers automatically loads and displays the 
spreadsheet. However, it’s equally easy to open a Numbers document from 
within the program. Follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the Numbers icon to run the program.
 
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
3. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the left of the dialog and 
then click folders and subfolders until you’ve located the desired 
Numbers document.
 
 If you’re unsure of where the document is, click in the Search box at the 
top of the Open dialog box and type in a portion of the document name, 
or even a word or two of text it contains.
 
4. Double-click the spreadsheet to load it.

282
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
If you want to open a spreadsheet you’ve been working on over the last few 
days, click File ➪Open Recent to display Numbers documents that you’ve 
worked with recently.
Save Those Spreadsheets!
If you’re not a huge fan of retyping data, I always recommend that you save 
your spreadsheets often (just in case of a power failure or a co-worker’s mis-
take). Follow these steps to save your spreadsheet to your hard drive:
 
1. Press Ô+S.
 
 If you’re saving a document that hasn’t yet been saved, the Save As 
sheet appears.
 
2. Type a filename for your new spreadsheet.
 
3. Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to save the file.
 
 This allows you to select common locations, such as your desktop, 
Documents folder, or Home folder.
 
 If the location you want isn’t listed in the Where pop-up menu, you can 
also click the down-arrow button next to the Save As text box to dis-
play the full Save As dialog. Click the desired drive in the Devices list 
at the left of the dialog and then click folders and subfolders until you 
reach the desired location. You can also create a new folder in the full 
Save As dialog.
 
4. Click Save.
After you’ve saved the file the first time, you can simply press Ô+S in the 
future and your changes are saved.
Exploring the Numbers Window
Apple has done a great job of minimizing the complexity of the Numbers 
window. Figure 18-2 illustrates these major points of interest:
 
✓ Sheets list: Because a Numbers project can contain multiple spread-
sheets, they’re displayed in the Sheets list at the left of the window. To 
switch between spreadsheets in a project, click the top-level headings 
(each of which has a spreadsheet icon).
 
✓ Sheet canvas: Numbers displays the rows and columns of your spread-
sheet in this section of the window; you enter and edit cell values within 
the sheet canvas.

283
 Chapter 18: Creating Spreadsheets with Numbers
 
✓ Toolbar: The Numbers toolbar keeps the most common commands 
you’ll use within easy reach.
 
✓ Formula Box: You’ll use the Formula Box to enter formulas into a cell, 
allowing Numbers to automatically perform calculations based on the 
contents of other cells.
 
✓ Format Bar: Located directly under the toolbar, the Format Bar displays 
editing controls for the object that’s currently selected. (If you enter an 
equal sign into the Formula Box, the Format Bar changes into the Formula 
Bar. No, I’m not making this up.) My goodness, this is starting to sound 
like that classic movie about the chocolate tycoon and those kids!

Navigate and Select Cells 
in a Spreadsheet
You can use the scroll bars to move around in your spreadsheet, but when 
you enter data into cells, moving your fingers from the keyboard is a hassle. 
For this reason, Numbers has various movement shortcut keys that you can 
use to navigate, and I list them in Table 18-1. After you commit these keys to 
memory, your productivity shoots straight to the top.

✓ To select a range of multiple adjacent cells, click a cell at any corner of 
the range you want and then drag the mouse in the direction you want.
 
✓ To select a column of cells, click the alphabetic heading button at the 
top of the column.
 
✓ To select a row of cells, click the numeric heading button on the far left 
side of the row.
Entering and Editing Data 
in a Spreadsheet
After you navigate to the cell in which you want to enter data, you’re ready to 
type your data. Follow these steps to enter That Important Stuff:

285
 Chapter 18: Creating Spreadsheets with Numbers
 
1. Either click the cell or press the spacebar.
 
 A cursor appears, indicating that the cell is ready to hold any data 
you type.
 
2. Type in your data.
 
 Spreadsheets can use both numbers and text within a cell — either type 
of information is considered data in the Spreadsheet World.
 
3. To edit data, click within the cell that contains the data to select it and 
then click the cell again to display the insertion cursor. Drag the inser-
tion cursor across the characters to highlight them and then type the 
replacement data.
 
4. To simply delete characters, highlight the characters and press Delete.
 
5. When you’re ready to move on, press Return (to save the data and 
move one cell down) or press Tab (to save the data and move one cell 
to the right).
Selecting the Right Number Format
After your data has been entered into a cell, row, or column, you still might 
need to format it before it appears correctly. Numbers gives you a healthy 
selection of formatting possibilities. Number formatting determines how a cell 
displays a number, such as a dollar amount, a percentage, or a date. 
 
Characters and formatting rules, such as decimal places, commas, and dollar 
and percentage notation, are included in number formatting. So, if your 
spreadsheet contains units of currency, such as dollars, format it as such. 
Then all you need to do is type the numbers, and the currency formatting is 
applied automatically. 
To specify a number format, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format.
 
2. Click the Inspector toolbar button.
 
3. Click the Cells Inspector button in the Inspector toolbar to display the 
settings you see in Figure 18-3.
 
4. Click the Cell Format pop-up menu and click the type of formatting 
you want to apply.

Aligning Cell Text Just So
You can also change the alignment of text in the selected cells. (The default 
alignment for text is flush left and for numeric data, flush right.) Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format.
 
 See “Navigate and Select Cells in a Spreadsheet,” earlier in this chapter, 
for tips on selecting stuff.
 
2. Click the Inspector toolbar button.
 
3. Click the Text Inspector button in the Inspector toolbar to display the 
settings you see in Figure 18-4.
 
4. Click the corresponding alignment button to choose the type of for-
matting you want to apply.
 
 You can choose left, right, center, justified, and text left and numbers 
right. Text can also be aligned at the top, center, or bottom of a cell.
 
You can also select the cells you want to align and click the appropriate align-
ment button in the Format Bar.

Do you need to set apart the contents of some cells? For example, you might 
need to create text headings for some columns and rows or to highlight the 
totals in a spreadsheet. To change the formatting of the data displayed within 
selected cells, select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format and then 
click the Font Family, Font Size, or Font Color buttons on the Format Bar.
Format with Shading
Shading the contents of a cell, row, or column is helpful when your spread-
sheet contains subtotals or logical divisions. Follow these steps to shade 
cells, rows, or columns:
 
1. Select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format.
 
2. Click the Inspector toolbar button.
 
3. Click the Graphic Inspector button in the Inspector toolbar.
 
 Numbers displays the settings you see in Figure 18-5.
 
4. Click the Fill pop-up menu to select a shading option.

6. Click to select a color.
 
7. After you achieve the right effect, click the Close button in the color 
picker.
 
8. Click the Inspector’s Close button to return to your spreadsheet.
 
The Fill function is also available on the Format Bar.
Insert and Delete Rows and Columns
What’s that? You forgot to add a row and now you’re three pages into your 
data entry? No problem. You can easily add or delete rows and columns. 
First, select the row or column that you want to delete or that you want to 
insert a row or column next to, and do one of the following:

289
 Chapter 18: Creating Spreadsheets with Numbers
 
✓ For a row: Right-click and choose Add Row Above, Add Row Below, or 
Delete Row from the shortcut menu that appears.
 
✓ For a column: Right-click and choose Add Columns Before, Add 
Columns After, or Delete Column from the shortcut menu that appears.
 
You can also insert rows and columns using the Table menu. 
The Formula Is Your Friend
Sorry, but it’s time to talk about formulas. These equations calculate values 
based on the contents of cells you specify in your spreadsheet. For example, 
if you designate cell A1 (the cell in column A at row 1) to hold your yearly 
salary and cell B1 to hold the number 12, you can divide the contents of cell 
A1 by cell B1 (to calculate your monthly salary) by typing this formula into 
any other cell:
=A1/B1
By the way, formulas in Numbers always start with an equal sign (=).
“So what’s the big deal, Mark? Why not use a calculator?” Sure, but maybe 
you want to calculate your weekly salary. Rather than grab a pencil and 
paper, you can simply change the contents of cell B1 to 52, and — boom! — 
the spreadsheet is updated to display your weekly salary.
That’s a simple example, of course, but it demonstrates the basis of using for-
mulas (and the reason that spreadsheets are often used to predict trends and 
forecast budgets). It’s the “what if?” tool of choice for everyone who works 
with numeric data.
To add a simple formula within your spreadsheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell that will hold the result of your calculation.
 
2. Click inside the Formula Box and type = (the equal sign).
 
 The Formula Box appears to the right of the Sheets heading, directly 
under the Button bar. Note that the Format Bar changes to show a set of 
formula controls (a.k.a. the Formula Bar).
 
3. Click the Function Browser button, which bears the fx label. (It 
appears next to the red Cancel button on the Formula Bar.)
 
4. In the window that appears, as shown in Figure 18-6, click the desired 
formula and click Insert to add it to the Formula Box.

290

Figure 18-6: 
If you have 
to use 
formulas, 
at least 
Numbers 
can enter 
them for 
you.
 
 
5. Click an argument button in the formula and click the cell that con-
tains the corresponding data.
 
 Numbers automatically adds the cell you indicated to the formula. 
Repeat this for each argument in the formula.
 
6. After you finish, click the Accept button to add the formula to the cell.
That’s it! Your formula is now ready to work behind the scenes, doing math 
for you so that the correct numbers appear in the cell you specified.
 
To display all the formulas that you’ve added to a sheet, click the Formula List 
button in the toolbar.
Adding Visual Punch with a Chart
Sometimes you just have to see something to believe it — hence the ability 
to use the data you add to a spreadsheet to generate a professional-looking 
chart! Follow these steps to create a chart:

291
 Chapter 18: Creating Spreadsheets with Numbers
 
1. Select the adjacent cells you want to chart by dragging the mouse.
 
 To choose individual cells that aren’t adjacent, you can hold down the 
Ô key as you click.
 
2. Click the Charts button on the Numbers toolbar. The Charts button 
bears the symbol of a bar graph.
 
 Numbers displays the thumbnail menu you see in Figure 18-7.
 
3. Click the thumbnail for the chart type you want.
 
 Numbers inserts the chart as an object within your spreadsheet so that 
you can move the chart. You can drag using the handles that appear on 
the outside of the object box to resize your chart. Figure 18-8 illustrates 
the 3-D chart I generated with just a couple of mouse clicks.
 
 Click the Inspector toolbar button and you can switch to the Chart 
Inspector dialog, where you can change the colors and add (or remove) 
the chart title and legend.
 
4. To change the default title, click the title box once to select it; click it 
again to edit the text.
After you’ve added your chart to the sheet, you’ll note that it appears in the 
Sheets list, as also shown in Figure 18-8. To edit the chart at any time, just 
click on the corresponding entry in the Sheets list.

▶ Entering and editing text
▶ Formatting text

▶ Inserting media and shapes
▶ Running a slideshow
▶ Printing slides and notes
I
t seems like only yesterday that I was giving business presentations with 
a clunky overhead projector and black-and-white acetate transparencies. 
Fancy color gradients and animation were unheard of, and the only sound 
my presentations made was the droning of the projector’s fan. I might as well 
have been using tree bark and chalk.
Thank goodness those days are gone forever, because cutting-edge presen-
tation software like Keynote makes slide creation easy and — believe it or 
not — fun! This is the application that Steve Jobs once used for his Macworld 
keynotes every year, and there’s so much visual candy available that you’ll 
never need to shout to wake your audience again.
In this chapter, I demonstrate how simple it is to build a stunning Keynote 
presentation, and how to start and control your slide display from your key-
board (or even your iPhone or iPod touch). Heck, we’ll even print your slides 
and notes so that your audience can keep a copy of your brilliant work!

294
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
Creating a New Keynote Project
As do the other applications in the iWork ’09 suite, Keynote begins the docu-
ment creation process with a Template Chooser window. To create a new 
presentation project, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click your hard drive icon and click the Applications entry in 
the Finder window sidebar. Double-click the iWork folder to open it.
 
 If presentations are your bread and butter, allow the iWork installation 
program to add a Keynote icon to your Dock. Your clicking finger will 
thank you.
 
2. Double-click the Keynote icon.
 
 The Template Chooser window that you see in Figure 19-1 appears. 
(I have to say that these are probably the most stunning visual building 
blocks I’ve ever seen in a presentation application.
 
3. Click the Slide Size pop-up menu at the bottom of the screen to select 
the resolution for your completed slides.
 
Figure 19-1:

Chooser 
window.
 

295
 Chapter 19: Building Presentations with Keynote
 
 Although you don’t necessarily need to select an exact match for the 
screen resolution of your iMac, it’s a good idea to select the closest 
value to the maximum resolution of your projector. (If someone else is 
providing the projector, the default value of 1024 x 768 is a good stan-
dard to use.)
 
4. Click the template that most closely matches your needs.
 
5. Click Choose to open a new document by using the template you 
selected.
Opening a Keynote Presentation
If an existing Keynote presentation file is visible in a Finder window, you can 
double-click the document icon to open the project. If Keynote is already run-
ning, however, follow these steps to load a project:
 
1. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
2. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the left of the dialog; then 
click folders and subfolders until you’ve located the Keynote project. 
(You can also use the Search box at the top of the Open dialog to 
locate the document by name or by some of the text it contains.)
 
3. Double-click the filename to load it.
 
If you want to open a Keynote document that you’ve edited in the recent 
past, things get even easier! Just click File➪Open Recent and you can open 
the document with a single click from the submenu that appears. (Note that 
the Template Chooser window has both Open Recent and Open Existing File 
buttons as well.)
Saving Your Presentation
When you’re done working on a Keynote presentation (or if you’d simply like 
to safeguard your work in a world of power failures), follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ô+S.
 
 If you’re saving a document that hasn’t yet been saved, the familiar Save 
As sheet appears.
 
2. Type a filename for your new document.

296
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
3. Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to save the 
document.
 
 To select a location not on the Where pop-up menu, click the button 
with the down arrow symbol to expand the sheet. You can also create a 
new folder from the expanded sheet.
 
4. Click Save.
Putting Keynote to Work
Ready for the 5-cent tour of the Keynote window? Launch the application 
and create or load a project, and you’ll see the tourist attractions shown in 
Figure 19-2:
 
Figure 19-2:

✓ Slide list: Use this thumbnail list of all the slides in your project to help 
you navigate quickly. Click a thumbnail to switch instantly to that slide.

297
 Chapter 19: Building Presentations with Keynote
 
 The Slide list can also display your project in outline format, allowing 
you to check all your discussion points. (This is a great way to ferret out 
any “holes” in your presentation’s flow.) While in outline mode, you can 
still jump directly to any slide by clicking the slide’s title in the outline. 
To display the outline, click View➪Outline. You can switch back to the 
default Navigator Slide list by clicking View➪Navigator.
 
✓ Layout pane: Your slide appears in its entirety in this pane. You can add 
elements and edit the content of the slide from the Layout pane.
 
✓ Toolbar: As does the toolbar in Pages and Numbers, Keynote’s toolbar 
makes it easy to find the most common controls you’ll use while design-
ing and editing your slides. Clicking an icon in the toolbar performs an 
action, just as selecting a menu item does.
 
✓ Notes pane: If you decide to add notes to one or more slides (either for 
your own use or to print as additional information for your audience), 
click View➪Show Presenter Notes to open the Notes pane. This text box 
appears under the Layout pane.
 
✓ Format Bar: Keynote displays this button strip underneath the 
Keynote toolbar, allowing you to format selected text, paragraphs and 
lists on the fly.
Adding Slides
Sure, Keynote creates a single Title slide when you first create a project, but 
not many presentations are complete with just a single slide! To add more 
slides to your project, use one of these methods:
 
✓ Click the New button on the Keynote toolbar.
 
✓ Choose New Slide from the Slide menu.
 
✓ Press Ô+Shift+N.
 
✓ Right-click (or Control-click) in the Slides list and choose New Slide from 
the menu.
Keynote adds the new slide to your Slides list and automatically switches to 
the new slide in the Layout pane.
 
Need a slide that’s very similar to an existing slide you’ve already designed? 
Right-click the existing slide and choose Duplicate to create a new slide just 
like it. (Consider it cloning without the science.)
To move slides to different positions in the Slides list (and therefore a dif-
ferent order in your Keynote slideshow), drag each slide thumbnail to the 
desired spot in the list.

298
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
Working with Text and Graphics Boxes
You’ve probably noticed that all the text within your first Title slide appears 
within boxes. Keynote uses boxes to manipulate text and graphics. You can 
resize a box (and its contents) by clicking and dragging one of the handles 
that appear around the edges of the box. (Your mouse cursor will change 
into a double-sided arrow when you’re “in the zone.”) The side-selection han-
dles drag only that edge of the frame, whereas the corner-selection handles 
resize both adjoining edges of the selection frame.
 
To keep the proportions of the box constrained, hold down Shift while drag-
ging the corner handles.
Boxes make it easy to move text and graphics together (as a single unit) to 
another location within the Layout pane. Click in the center of the box and 
drag the box to the desired spot; Keynote displays alignment lines to help 
you align the box with other elements around it (or with regular divisions of 
the slide, like horizontal center). As you can see in Figure 19-3, I’m moving a 
box on the slide to a new location, and Keynote has supplied alignment lines 
to help me place it correctly.
 
To select text or graphics within a box, you should double-click the box.
 
Figure 19-3: 
Alignment 
lines are 
provided by 
Keynote as 
you move 
boxes.
 

299
 Chapter 19: Building Presentations with Keynote
 
If you’re resizing a photo in a box, don’t forget to hold down the Shift key as 
you drag the frame. Doing so specifies that Keynote should preserve the 
aspect ratio of the image so that the vertical and horizontal proportions 
remain fixed. You can also flip images horizontally or vertically from the 
Arrange menu.
Adding and Editing Slide Text
As with Pages and Numbers, which also use boxes for text layout, Keynote 
allows you to add or edit text with ease. For example, double-click in a box 
with the text Double-click to edit, and the placeholder text disappears, 
leaving the field ready to accept new text. Any new text you type appears at 
the blinking cursor within the box. 
To edit existing text in your Keynote document, click using the bar-shaped 
cursor to select just the right spot in the text, and drag the insertion cursor 
across the characters to highlight them. Type the replacement text, and 
Keynote obligingly replaces the text that was there with the text you type.
If you want to delete existing text, click and drag across the characters to 
highlight them; then press Delete. You can also delete an entire box and 
all its contents: Right-click (or Control-click) the offending box and choose 
Delete from the menu that appears.
When the contents of a box are just right and you’re finished entering or edit-
ing text, click anywhere outside the box to hide it from view. You can always 
click the text again to display the box later.
Formatting Slide Text 
for the Perfect Look
Keynote doesn’t restrict you to the default fonts for the theme you chose. 
It’s easy to format the text in your slides — you can choose a different font 
family, font color, text alignment, and text attributes such as bolding and itali-
cizing on the fly, whenever you like.
Select the desired text by double-clicking a box and then dragging the text 
cursor to highlight the characters. Now apply your formatting using one of 
these two methods:

300
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
✓ The Format Bar: The font controls on the Format Bar work just as the 
controls on the toolbar do: Either click a font control to display a pop-up 
menu or click a button to immediately perform an action. Clicking the 
Font Size pop-up menu, for example, displays a range of sizes for the 
selected text — with a single click on the B (bold) button, you’ll add the 
bold attribute to the highlighted characters.
 
✓ The Format menu: The controls on the Format menu generally mirror 
those on the Format Bar. To change the alignment from the Format 
menu, click Format and hover the mouse cursor over the Text menu 
item. To change text attributes, click Format and hover your mouse over 
the Font menu.
Using Presenter’s Notes in Your Project
As I mention earlier, you can type text notes in the Notes pane — I use 
them for displaying alternate topic points while presenting my slideshow. 
However, you can also print the notes for a project along with the slides, so 
presenter’s notes are also great for including reminders and To Do points for 
your audience in handouts.
To type your notes, just click within the Notes pane; if it’s hidden, click 
View➪Show Presenter Notes. When you’re done adding notes, click in the 
Slide list or the Layout pane to return to editing mode.
 
To display your notes while practicing, use Keynote’s Rehearsal feature. Click 
Play and choose Rehearse Slideshow, and you can scroll through the notes 
while the slideshow runs. (More on slideshows in a second.)
Every Good Presentation Needs Media
Adding audio, photos, and movies to a slide is drag-and-drop easy in Keynote! 
Simply drag an image, audio, or movie file from a Finder window and place it 
at the spot you want within your document.
You can also use the Media Browser — click the Media button on the tool-
bar and click the Audio, Photos, or Movies button to select the desired 
type. Keynote displays the contents of your various media collections — 
like your iPhoto and iTunes libraries — or you can also navigate to the file’s 
location on your hard drive, or type in a filename in the Search box at the 

301
 Chapter 19: Building Presentations with Keynote
bottom of the browser. When you’ve found the file you want to add, drag 
it to the spot you want in the document. Figure 19-4 illustrates the Media 
Browser in action.
 
Figure 19-4: 
It’s not just 
photos — 
you can 
add audio 
and movie 
clips to a 
slide, too!
 
Adding a Background Shape
Text often stands out on a slide when it sits on top of a background shape. 
To add a shape (such as a rectangle or circle) as a background for your text, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the insertion cursor in the location you want.
 
2. Click the Shapes button on the Keynote toolbar and choose a shape.
 
 The shape appears in your document.
 
3. Click the center of the shape and drag it to a new spot.
 
 Like image boxes, shapes can be resized or moved.
 
4. When the shape is properly positioned and sized, select it and choose 
Arrange➪Send to Back.

302
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
Creating Your Keynote Slideshow
The heart of a Keynote presentation is the slideshow that you build from the 
slides you’ve created. A Keynote slideshow is typically presented as a full-
screen presentation, with slides appearing in linear order as they are sorted 
in the Slides list.
In its simplest form, you can always run a slideshow from a Keynote proj-
ect by clicking the Play button in the toolbar, or by choosing Play➪Play 
Slideshow from the menu. You can advance to the next slide by clicking your 
mouse, or by pressing the right bracket key, which looks like this: ].
Of course, other controls are available besides just the ones that advance to 
the next slide! Table 19-1 illustrates the key shortcuts you’ll use most often 
during a slideshow. 
 
Keynote offers a number of settings that you can tweak to fine-tune your slide-
show. To display these settings, choose Keynote➪Preferences and click the 
Slideshow button in the Preferences window.

If you have an iPhone or iPod touch handy and you’ve installed the Apple 
Keynote Remote application on your device, display the Preferences window 
and click the Remote button to link your iPhone or iPod touch to your iMac 
and Keynote. Now you can use your handheld device as a remote and use it 
during your slideshow!
Printing Your Slides and Notes
Okay, I’ll be honest: I don’t always print handouts for every presentation I 
give, just because some of the slideshows I run are short introductions to 
hands-on demonstrations. However, if you’re presenting a lengthy slideshow 
with plenty of information that you’d like your audience to remember, noth-
ing beats handouts that include scaled-down images of your slides (and, 
optionally, your presenter’s notes).
You’re not limited to just paper, though! You can also use Keynote to create 
an electronic PDF-format document instead of a printed handout, which your 
audience members can download from your Web site. Or, if you’re an educa-
tor with access to an interactive whiteboard (such as the SMARTBoard), you 
can use this new technology with Keynote.
To print your slides and notes, follow these steps:
 
1. Within Keynote, click File and choose Print.
 
 Keynote displays the Print sheet you see in Figure 19-5. (Note that some 
printer-specific features may be different on your screen.)
 
2. Click the desired format.
 
• To print each slide on a separate page at full size, click Individual 
Slides.
 
• To print each slide on a separate page with the presenter’s notes 
for that slide, click Slides with Notes.
 
• To print the contents of your Slides list in Outline view, click 
Outline.
 
• To print a handout with multiple slides per page (and, optionally, 
with presenter’s notes), click Handout. Click the Slides per Page 
pop-up menu to specify the number of slides that Keynote should 
print on each page.

304

3. Select the pages to print.
 
• To print the entire document, select All.
 
• To print a range of selected slides, select the From radio button 
and enter the starting and ending pages.
 
4. Select or deselect specific options from the Options column.
 
 You can include elements such as the date, borders around each slide, 
and the slide number as part of each page of the hardcopy.
 
5. Click the Print button to send the job to your printer.

verybody wants a piece. (Of your iMac, that is.)
Perhaps you live in a busy household with kids, significant others, grandpar-
ents, and a wide selection of friends — all of them clamoring for a chance to 
spend time on the Internet, take care of homework, or enjoy a good game.
On the other hand, your iMac might occupy a classroom or a break room at 
your office — someplace public, yet everyone wants his own Private iDaho 
on the iMac, complete with a reserved spot on the hard drive and his own 
hand-picked attractive Desktop background.
Before you throw your hands up in the air in defeat, read this chapter and 
take heart! Here you find all the step-by-step procedures, explanations, and 
tips to help you build a safe multiuser iMac that’s accessible to all.
(Oh, and you still get to use it, too. That’s not being selfish.)

Once Upon a Time (An 
Access Fairy Tale)
Okay, so you don’t have Cinderella, Snow White, or that porridge-loving kid 
with the trespassing problem. Instead, you have your brother Bob.
Every time Bob visits your place, it seems he needs to do “something” on the 
Internet, or he needs a moment with your iMac to bang out a quick message, 
using his Web-based e-mail application. Unfortunately, Bob’s forays onto 
your iMac always result in stuff getting changed, like your Desktop settings, 
Address Book, and Safari bookmarks.
What you need, good reader, is a visit from the Account Fairy. Your problem 
is that you have but a single user account on your system, and Snow Leopard 
thinks that Bob is you. By turning your iMac into a multiuser system and 
giving Bob his own account, Snow Leopard can tell the difference between 
the two of you, keeping your druthers separate!
With a unique user account, Snow Leopard can track all sorts of things for 
Bob, leaving your computing environment blissfully pristine. A user account 
keeps track of stuff such as
 
✓ Address Book contacts
 
✓ Safari bookmarks and settings
 
✓ Desktop settings (including background images, screen resolutions, and 
Finder tweaks)
 
✓ iTunes libraries, just in case Bob brings his own music (sigh)
 
✓ Web sites that Bob might ask you to host on your computer (resigned 
sigh)
Plus, Bob gets his own reserved Home folder on your iMac’s hard drive, so 
he’ll quit complaining about how he can’t find his files. Oh, and did I mention 
how user accounts keep others from accessing your stuff? And how you can 
lock Bob out of where-he-should-not-be, such as certain applications, iChat, 
Mail, and Web sites (including that offshore Internet casino site that he’s 
hooked on)?
Naturally, this is only the tip of the iceberg. User accounts affect just about 
everything you can do in Snow Leopard and on your iMac. The moral of my 
little tale? A Mark’s Maxim to the rescue:
 
Assign others their own user accounts, and let Snow Leopard keep track of 
everything. Then you can share your iMac with others and still live happily 
ever after!

307
 Chapter 20: Creating a Multiuser iMac
Big-Shot Administrator Stuff
Get one thing straight right off the bat: You are the administrator of your 
iMac. In network-speak, an administrator (or admin for short) is the one with 
the power to Do Unto Others — creating new accounts, deciding who gets 
access to what, and generally running the multiuser show. In other words, 
think of yourself as the Monarch of Mac OS X (the ruler, not the butterfly).
 
I always recommend that you have only one (or perhaps two) accounts with 
administrator-level access on any computer. This makes good sense because 
you can be assured that no one can monkey with your iMac while you’re 
away from the keyboard. So why might you want a second admin account? 
Well, if you’re often away on business, you might need to assign a second 
administrator account to a trusted individual who knows as much about your 
iMac as you do. (Tell ’em to buy a copy of this book.) That way, if something 
breaks or an account needs to be tweaked in some way, the other person can 
take care of it whilst you’re gone (but without giving that person access to 
your personal data).
In this section, I explain the typical duties of a first-class iMac administrator.
Deciding who needs what access
Snow Leopard provides three levels of individual user accounts:
 
✓ Admin (administrator): See the beginning of this section.
 
✓ Standard level: Perfect for most users, these accounts allow access to 
just about everything but don’t let the user make drastic changes to 
Snow Leopard or create new accounts.
 
✓ Managed with Parental Controls level: These are standard accounts 
with specific limits that are assigned either by you or by another admin 
account.
Another Mark’s Maxim is in order:
 
Assign other folks standard-level accounts and then decide whether 
each new account needs to be modified to restrict access as a managed 
account. Never assign an account admin-level access unless you deem it 
truly necessary.
Standard accounts are quick and easy to set up, and I think they provide the 
perfect compromise between access and security. You’ll find that standard 
access allows your users to do just about anything they need to do, with a 
minimum of hassle.

Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
Managed accounts (with Parental Controls) are highly configurable so you 
can make sure that your kids don’t end up trashing the hard drive, sending 
junk mail, or engaging in unmonitored chatting. (Note: Parents, teachers, 
and those folks designing a single public access account for a library or 
organization — this means you.)
 
Snow Leopard also provides Group and Sharing Only accounts, but shy away 
from these advanced levels. Stick with the Big Three levels to ensure that 
everyone has the proper access to your iMac.
Adding users
All right, Mark, enough pregame jabbering — show this good reader how to 
set up new accounts! Your iMac already has one admin-level account set up 
for you (created during the initial Snow Leopard set-up process), and you 
need to be logged in with that account to add a user. To add a new account, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and then click the 
Accounts icon to display the Accounts pane that you see in Figure 20-1.
 
2. Click the New User button — the one with the plus sign at the bottom of 
the accounts list — to display the new user sheet shown in Figure 20-2.
 
 If your New User button is grayed out, your Accounts pane is locked. 
Remember that you can toggle the padlock icon at the lower-left corner 
of most of the panes in System Preferences to lock or allow changes. To 
gain access, do the following:
 
Figure 20-1: 
Add new 
user 
accounts 
here.
 

309
 Chapter 20: Creating a Multiuser iMac
 
Figure 20-2: 
Fill out those 
fields, and 
you have a 
new user.
 
 
a. Click the padlock icon to make changes to the Accounts pane.
 
b. When Snow Leopard prompts you for your admin account password 
(the account you’re currently using), enter it.
 
c. Click OK.
 
 Now you can click the New User button.
 
3. Click the New Account pop-up menu and specify the account level 
status.
 
 Choose from Administrator, Standard, or Managed with Parental 
Controls.
 
 You should have only one or two administrator-level users, and 
your account is already an admin account.
 
4. Type the name that you want to display for this account in the Name 
text box. Press Tab to move to the next field.
 
 Snow Leopard displays this name on the Login screen, so behave! (For 
example, Bob has only one “o” the last time I checked.)
 
5. (Optional) Although Snow Leopard automatically generates the user’s 
short name (for use in iChat, and for naming the user’s Home folder), 
you can type a new one. (No spaces, please.) Press Tab again.
 
6. In the Password text box, type the password for the new account. 
Press Tab to move to the next field.
 
 Generally, I recommend a password of at least six characters, using a 
mixture of alpha and numeric characters.

310
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
 Run out of password ideas? No problem! Click the key button (to the 
right of the Password text box) to display the Password Assistant, from 
which Snow Leopard can automatically generate password suggestions 
of the length you specify. Click the Suggestion pop-up menu, or type 
directly into the field, and Snow Leopard automatically adds the pass-
word you’ve generated into the Password field.
 
7. In the Verify text box, retype the password you chose. Press Tab again 
to continue your quest.
 
8. (Optional) Snow Leopard can provide a password hint after three 
unsuccessful login attempts. To offer a hint, type a short question in 
the Password Hint text box.
 
 From a security standpoint, password hints are taboo. (Personally, I 
never use ’em. If someone is having a problem logging in to a computer I 
administer, you better believe I want to know why.) Therefore, despite 
the recommendation Snow Leopard shows here, I strongly recommend 
that you skip this field — and if you do offer a hint, keep it vague! Avoid 
hints like, “Your password is the name of the Wookie in Star Wars.” Geez.
 
9. (Optional) Click the Turn on FileVault protection check box to enable it.
 
 I’ll discuss this security feature in more detail at the end of this 
chapter — it’s A Good Thing, so I recommend using FileVault.
 
10. Click the Create Account button.
 
 The new account shows up in the list at the left of the Accounts pane.
Each user’s Home folder has the same default subfolders, including Movies, 
Music, Pictures, Sites, and such. A user can create new subfolders within his 
or her Home folder at any time.
Here’s one more neat fact about a user’s Home folder: No matter what the 
account level, most of the contents of a Home folder can’t be viewed by other 
users. (Yes, that includes admin-level users. This way, everyone using your 
iMac gets her own little area of privacy.) Within the Home folder, only the 
Sites and Public folders can be accessed by other users — and only in a lim-
ited fashion. More on these folders later in this chapter.
Modifying user accounts
Next, consider the basic modifications that you can make to a user account, 
such as changing existing information or selecting a new picture to represent 
that user’s unique personality.
To edit an existing account, log in with your admin account, display the 
System Preferences window, and click Accounts to display the account list. 
Then follow these steps:

311
 Chapter 20: Creating a Multiuser iMac
 
1. Click the account that you want to change.
 
 Don’t forget to unlock the Accounts pane if necessary. See the earlier 
section, “Adding users,” to read how.
 
2. Edit the settings that you need to change.
 
 For example, you can reset the user’s password, or (if absolutely neces-
sary) upgrade the account to admin level.
 
3. Click the Picture well and then click a thumbnail image to represent 
this user (as shown in Figure 20-3).
 
Figure 20-3: 
Pick the 
image 
that best 
represents 
a user.
 
 
 An easy way to get an image is to use one from your hard drive. Click 
Edit Picture and then drag a new image from a Finder window into the 
Picture well. (Alternatively, you could click Edit Picture and then click 
the Snapshot button — which bears a tiny camera — to grab a picture 
from your iSight video camera. After you capture the essence of your 
subject as a photo, click Set to return to the Accounts pane.)
 
 Using the default login settings, Snow Leopard displays this image in the 
Login list next to the account name.
 
4. When everything is correct, press Ô+Q to close the System 
Preferences dialog.
 
 There’s no need to save your changes (as a separate step) within System 
Preferences. Snow Leopard does that automatically when you close the 
System Preferences window.

312
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
Standard-level users have some control over their accounts — they’re not 
helpless, ya know. Standard users can log in, open System Preferences, and 
click Accounts to change the account password or picture, as well as the My 
Card assigned to them in Snow Leopard Address Book. All standard users can 
also set up Login Items, which I cover later in this chapter. Note, however, that 
managed users might not have access to System Preferences at all, so they 
can’t make changes. (Read about this in the upcoming section, “Managing 
access settings for an account.”
I banish thee, Mischievous User!
Not all user accounts last forever. Students graduate, co-workers quit, kids 
move out of the house (at last!), and Bob might even find a significant other 
who has a faster cable modem. We can only hope.
Anyway, no matter what the reason, you can delete a user account at any 
time. Log in with your admin account, display the Accounts pane in System 
Preferences, and then follow these steps to eradicate an account:
 
1. Click the account that you want to delete.
 
2. Click the Delete User button (which bears the Minus Sign of Doom). 
Refer to Figure 20-1.
 
 Snow Leopard displays a confirmation sheet, as shown in Figure 20-4. 
By default, the contents of the user’s Home folder are saved in a disk 
image file — which you can restore with Disk Utility — in the Deleted 
Users folder. (This safety is a good idea if the user might return in the 
future, allowing you to retrieve their old stuff. However, this option is 
available only if you have enough space on your hard drive to create 
the Home folder image file.)
 
3. To clean up completely, select the Delete the Home Folder radio 
button and then click OK.
 
 Snow Leopard wipes everything connected with the user account off 
your hard drive.
 
4. Press Ô+Q to close the System Preferences dialog.
Time once again for a Mark’s Maxim:
 
Always delete unnecessary user accounts. Otherwise, you’re leaving holes 
in your iMac’s security — and eating up disk space.

This is your

account.
 
Setting up Login Items 
and Parental Controls
Every account on your iMac can be customized. Understandably, some set-
tings are accessible only to admin-level accounts, and others can be adjusted 
by standard-level accounts. In this section, I introduce you to the things that 
can be enabled (or disabled) within a user account.
Automating with Login Items
Login Items are applications or documents that can be set to launch or load 
automatically as soon as a specific user logs in — for example, Apple Mail or 
Address Book. In fact, a user must be logged in to add or remove Login Items. 
Even an admin-level account can’t change the Login Items for another user.
 
A user must have access to the Accounts pane within the System Preferences 
window in order to use Login Items. As you can read in the following section, a 
user can be locked out of System Preferences, which makes it more difficult 
for Login Items to be added or deleted for that account. (Go figure.)
To set Login Items for your account, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and then click the 
Accounts icon.
 
2. Click the Login Items tab to display the settings that you see in 
Figure 20-5.

314
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
Figure 20-5: 
Add apps to 
your Login 
Items list.
 
 
3. Click the Add button (with the plus sign) to display a file selection 
sheet.
 
4. Navigate to the application you want to launch each time you log in, 
click it to select it, and then click Add.
 
 If you’re in the mood to drag and drop, just drag the applications you 
want to add from a Finder window and drop them directly into the list.
 
5. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your changes.
 
Login Items are launched in the order that they appear in the list, so feel free 
to drag the items into any order you like.
Managing access settings for an account
A standard-level account with restrictions is a managed account. (You can 
read about these accounts earlier in this chapter.) With these accounts, you 
can restrict access to many different places within Snow Leopard and your 
iMac’s applications via Parental Controls. (Naturally, admin-level accounts 
don’t need Parental Controls because an admin account has no restrictions.)
 
In short, Parental Controls come in handy in preventing users — family mem-
bers, students, co-workers, friends, or the public at large — from damaging 
your computer, your software, or Snow Leopard itself to accessing inappropri-
ate material on the Internet (or even just using your iMac after bedtime). If an 
account has been restricted with Parental Controls, the account description 
changes from Standard to Managed in the Accounts list.

315
 Chapter 20: Creating a Multiuser iMac
To display the Parental Controls for a standard account, start here:
 
1. Log in with an admin-level account.
 
2. Open System Preferences and then click Accounts.
 
3. Click the Standard account in the list and then select the Enable 
Parental Controls check box.
Now click the Open Parental Controls button to display the specific category 
tabs that you see in Figure 20-6:
 
✓ System: These settings (which I discuss in more detail in a second) 
affect what the user can do within Snow Leopard as well as what the 
Finder itself looks like to that user.
 
✓ Content: These settings control the Dictionary and Safari applications. 
If you prefer that profane terms be hidden within the Dictionary for this 
user, select the Hide Profanity in Dictionary check box to enable it. Snow 
Leopard also offers three levels of control for Web sites:
 
• Allow Unrestricted Access: Select this radio button to allow unfet-
tered access for this user.
 
• Try to Limit Access: You can allow Safari to automatically block 
Web sites that it deems “adult.” To specify particular sites that 
Safari should allow or deny, click the Customize button.
 
• Allow Access to Only These Websites: Select this radio button to 
specify which Web sites that the user can view. To add a Web site, 
click the Add button (which bears a plus sign); Snow Leopard then 
prompts you for a title and the Web site address.
 
✓ Mail & iChat: Select the Limit Mail and the Limit iChat check boxes to 
specify the e-mail and instant-messaging addresses that this user can 
communicate with. To add an address that the user can e-mail or chat 
with, click the Add button.
 
 If you want a notification if the user is attempting to send an e-mail to 
someone not in the list, select the Send Permission Requests To check 
box to enable it and then type your e-mail address in the text box.
 
✓ Time Limits: Parents, click the Time Limits button, and you’ll shout with 
pure joy! You can limit an account to a certain number of hours of usage 
per weekday (Weekday Time Limits), limit to a specified number of 
hours of usage per weekend day (Weekend Time Limits), and set a bed-
time computer curfew time for both weekdays and weekend days.
 
✓ Logs: Snow Leopard keeps a number of different types of text log files 
(which track where the user goes on the Internet, which applications are 
launched by the account, and the contents of any iChat conversations 

316
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
where the user was a participant). From this central pane, you can moni-
tor all the logs for a particular account. Note that these logs are enabled 
or disabled from other locations within Snow Leopard: For example, 
the log showing the Web sites visited and blocked is enabled from the 
Content panel that I describe a little earlier, whereas the applications 
log is enabled from the System panel. iChat logging is turned on from the 
Preferences dialog within the iChat application.
 
Figure 20-6: 
You don’t 
have to be 
a parent 
to assign 
Parental 
Controls!
 
 
You can always tell whether an account has been assigned Parental Controls 
because the account description changes from Standard to Managed in the 
Accounts list.
Of particular importance are the System controls. Click the System tab to 
modify these settings:
 
✓ Use Simple Finder: The Simple Finder is a great idea for families and 
classrooms with smaller children. For the ultimate in restrictive Snow 
Leopard environments — think public access or kiosk mode — you can 
assign the Simple Finder to an account. Even the Dock itself is restricted, 
sporting only the Finder icon, Trash, the Dashboard, and those folders 
that allow users to access their documents and applications.
 
✓ Only Allow Selected Applications: When this option is enabled, you can 
select the specific applications that appear to the user. These restric-
tions are in effect whether the user has access to the full Finder or just 
the Simple Finder.

317
 Chapter 20: Creating a Multiuser iMac
 
• To allow access to all the applications of a specific type: Select the 
check box next to the desired group heading to enable it. This 
includes iLife, iWork, Internet, Widgets, Other, and Utilities.
 
• To restrict access to all applications within a group: If a group head-
ing check box is enabled and you want to deny access to all the 
applications in that group, clear the check box next to the heading 
to disable it.
 
• To toggle restriction on and off for specific applications within these 
groups: Click the triangle icon next to each group heading to 
expand its list and then either mark or clear the check box next 
to the desired applications. Snow Leopard denotes partial access 
within a group — a mixture of full and restricted applications — 
with a dash mark in the group heading check box.
 
 To locate a specific application, click in the Search box and type 
the application name.
 
• To add a new application to the Allow list: Drag its icon from the 
Finder and drop it in the list within the Other group. After you add 
an application, it appears in the Other group, and you can toggle 
access to it on and off like the applications in the named groups.
 
✓ Can Administer Printers: With this check box enabled, the user can 
modify the printers and printer queues within the Print & Fax pane in 
System Preferences. If disabled, the user can still print to the default 
printer and switch to other assigned printers, but can’t add or delete 
printers.
 
✓ Can Burn CDs and DVDs: Disable this check box to prevent the user 
from recording CDs or DVDs via the built-in disc recording features in 
Mac OS X. (Note: If you load a third-party recording program, such as 
Toast, the user can still record discs with it, so you probably want to 
disallow Toast access for the user in question.)
 
✓ Can Change Password: Enable this check box to allow the user to 
change the account password.
 
 If you’re creating a single standard-level account for an entire group of 
people to use — for example, if you want to leave the machine in kiosk 
mode in one corner of the office or if everyone in a classroom will use 
the same account on the machine — I recommend disabling the ability 
to change the account password. (Oh, and please do me a favor . . . don’t 
create a system with just one admin-level account that everyone is sup-
posed to use! Instead, keep your one admin-level account close to your 
bosom and create a standard-level account for the Unwashed Horde.)
 
✓ Can Modify the Dock: Enable this check box, and the user can add or 
remove applications, documents, and folders from the Dock in the full 
Finder.

Multiuser Rules for Everyone
After you’re hip on user accounts and the changes you can make to them, 
turn to a number of topics that affect all users of your iMac — things like how 
they log in, how a user can share information with everyone else on the com-
puter, and how each user account can be protected from unscrupulous out-
siders with state-of-the-art encryption. (Suddenly you’re James Bond! I told 
you Snow Leopard would open new doors for you.)
Logging on and off in Snow 
Leopard For Dummies
Hey, how about the login screen itself? How do your users identify them-
selves? Time for another of my “Shortest books in the For Dummies series” 
special editions. (The title’s practically longer than the entire book.)
Snow Leopard offers four methods of logging folks in to your multiuser iMac:
 
✓ The username and password login: This is the most secure type of login 
screen you’ll see in Snow Leopard because you have to actually type 
your account username and your password. (A typical hacker isn’t going 
to know all the usernames on your iMac.) Press Return or click the Log 
In button to compete the process.
 
 When you enter your username and password, you see bullets instead of 
your password because Snow Leopard displays bullet characters to 
ensure security. Otherwise, someone could simply look over your shoul-
der and see your password.
 
✓ The list login: This login screen offers a good middle of the road 
between security and convenience. Click your account username in the 
list and type your password when the login screen displays the pass-
word prompt. Press Return or click the Log In button to continue.
 
✓ Fast User Switching: This feature, as shown in Figure 20-7, allows another 
user to sit down and log in while the previous user’s applications are still 
running in the background. This is perfect for a fast e-mail check or a scan 
of your eBay bids without forcing someone else completely off the iMac. 
When you turn on Fast User Switching, Snow Leopard displays the cur-
rently active user’s name at the right side of the Finder menu bar.

319
 Chapter 20: Creating a Multiuser iMac
 
 To switch to another account
 
a. Click the current user’s name in the Finder menu (refer to Figure 20-7).
 
b. Click the name of the user who wants to log in.
 
 Snow Leopard displays the login window, just as if the iMac had 
been rebooted.
 
 The previous user’s stuff is still running, so you definitely 
shouldn’t reboot or shut down the iMac!
 
 To switch back to the previous user
 
a. Click the username again in the Finder menu.
 
b. Click the previous user’s name.
 
 For security, Snow Leopard prompts you for that account’s login 
password.
 
✓ Auto login: This is the most convenient method of logging in but offers 
no security whatsoever. Snow Leopard automatically logs in the speci-
fied account when you start or reboot your iMac.
 
Figure 20-7:

User

all to see.
 

320
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
 I strongly recommend that you use auto login only if
 
• Your iMac is in a secure location.
 
• You are the only one using your iMac.
 
• You’re setting up a public-access iMac, in which case you want 
your iMac to immediately log in with the public account.
 
 Working in a public environment? Never set an admin-level account 
as the auto login account. This is the very definition of ASDI, or A 
Supremely Dumb Idea.
To set up a username/password or list login, open System Preferences, click 
the Accounts icon, and then display the Login Options settings (see Figure 
20-8). Select the List of Users radio button for a list login screen, or select the 
Name and Password radio button to require your users to type their full user-
name and password.
To enable Fast User Switching, mark the Enable Fast User Switching check 
box (as shown in Figure 20-8).
To set Auto Login, choose the account that Snow Leopard should use from the 
Automatic Login pop-up menu (as shown by the now-legendary Figure 20-8).
 
Figure 20-8: 
Configure 
your login 
settings 
from the 
Login 
Options 
pane.
 
Logging out of Snow Leopard all the way (without Fast User Switching) is a 
cinch. Just click the Apple menu (Ú) and then choose Log Out. (From the 
keyboard, press Ô+Shift+Q.) A confirmation dialog appears that will auto-
matically log you off in one minute — but don’t forget that if someone walks 

321
 Chapter 20: Creating a Multiuser iMac
up and clicks Cancel, he’ll be using your iMac with your account! Your 
iMac returns to the login screen, ready for its next victim. Heed this Mark’s 
Maxim:
 
Always click the Log Out button on the logout confirmation dialog before 
you leave your iMac.
Interesting stuff about sharing stuff
You might wonder where shared documents and files reside on your iMac. 
That’s a good question. Like just about everything in Snow Leopard, there’s 
a simple answer. The Users folder on your iMac has a Shared folder within it. 
To share a file or folder, it should be placed in the Shared folder.
 
You don’t have to turn on File Sharing in the Sharing pane of System 
Preferences to use Shared folders on your iMac. Personal File Sharing affects 
only network access to your machine by users of other computers.
Each user account on your iMac also has a Public folder within that user’s 
Home folder. This is a read-only folder that other users on your iMac (and 
across the network) can access: They can only open and copy the files that 
it contains. (Sorry, no changes to existing documents from other users, or 
new documents from other users.) Every user’s Public folder contains a 
Drop Box folder, where other users can copy or save files but can’t view the 
contents. Think of the Drop Box as a mailbox where you drop off stuff for 
the other user.
Encrypting your Home folder can be fun
Allowing others to use your iMac always incurs a risk — especially if you 
store sensitive information and documents on your computer. Although your 
login password should ensure that your Home folder is off limits to everyone 
else, consider an extra level of security to prevent even a dedicated hacker 
from accessing your stuff.
To this end, Snow Leopard includes FileVault, which automatically encrypts 
the contents of your Home folder. Without the proper key (in this case, either 
your login password or your admin’s master password), the data contained 
in your Home folder is impossible for just about anyone to read. (I guess the 
FBI or NSA would be able to decrypt it, but they’re not likely a worry at your 
place!)

322
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
The nice thing about FileVault is that it’s completely transparent to you and 
your users. In other words, when you log in, Snow Leopard automatically 
takes care of decrypting and encrypting the stuff in your Home folder for you. 
You literally won’t know that FileVault is working for you — which is how 
computers are supposed to work.
To turn on FileVault protection for a specific account, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and then click the 
Security icon.
 
2. Click the FileVault button.
 
3. If necessary, click Set Master Password to create a master password.
 
 You need to be logged in with an admin-level account to set a master 
password. However, this needs to be done only once, no matter how 
many accounts you’re hosting on your iMac. Using this master pass-
word, any admin-level user can unlock any Home folder for any user.
 
 Before you move to Step 4, note that you must be logged in using the 
account that requires the FileVault protection. (Therefore, if you had to 
log in using your admin-level account to set a master password, you 
have to log out and log in again using the account you want to protect. 
Arrgh.)
 
4. Click the Turn on FileVault button.
 
5. Enter your account’s login password when prompted and then 
click OK.
 
6. Click the Turn on FileVault button on the confirmation screen.
 
7. After Snow Leopard encrypts your Home folder and logs you out, log 
in again normally.
 
 You’re done!
 
Remember those passwords. Again, do not forget your account login pass-
word, and make doggone sure that your admin user never forgets the master 
password! If you forget these passwords, you can’t read anything in your 
Home folder, and even the smartest Apple support technician will tell you that 
nothing can be done.

I
n my book, network access ranks right up there with air conditioning and 
the microwave oven. Like other “I can’t imagine life without them” kinds 
of technologies, it’s hard to imagine sharing data from your iMac with others 
around you without a network. Sure, I’ve used a sneakernet (the old-fashioned 
term for running back and forth between computers with a floppy disk), but 
these days, Apple computers don’t even have floppy drives.
Nope, networking is here to stay. Whether you use it to share an Internet 
connection, challenge your friends to a nice relaxing game of WWII battlefield 
action, or stream your MP3 collection to other computers that use iTunes, 
you’ll wonder how you ever got along without one. In this chapter, I fill you in 
on all the details you need to know to get your iMac hooked up to a new (or 
an existing) network.
What, Exactly, Is the 
Network Advantage?
If you have other family members with computers or if your iMac is in an 
office with other computers (including those rascally PCs), here’s just a 
sample of what you can do with a network connection:

324
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
✓ Share an Internet connection. This is the major reason why many fami-
lies and most small businesses install a network. Everyone can simul-
taneously use the same digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable Internet 
connection on every computer on the network.
 
✓ Share a printer. You say your fellow employee — or even worse, your 
big sister — has a great printer connected to their computer? Luckily, 
that printer can be shared with anyone across your network.
 
✓ Copy and move files of all sizes. Need to get a large iDVD project 
from one Mac to another? With a network connection, you can accom-
plish this task in just minutes. Otherwise you’d have to burn that file 
to a DVD-R or use a Flash drive. A network connection makes copying 
as simple as dragging the project folder from one Finder window to 
another.
 
✓ Share documents across your network. Talk about a wonderful col-
laboration tool. For example, you can drop a Word document or Keynote 
presentation file in your Public folder and ask for comments and edits 
from others in your office.
 
✓ Stream music and video. With iTunes, you can share your audio and 
video media collection on your iMac with other Macs and PCs on your 
network. Your eyes and ears can’t tell the difference!
 
✓ Play multiplayer games. Invite your friends over and tell ’em that you’re 
hosting a LAN party (the techno-nerd term for a large gathering of game 
players, connected through the same network, all playing the same mul-
tiplayer game. (Suddenly you’ll see firsthand just how devious a human 
opponent can be.) Each participant needs to buy a copy of the same 
game, naturally, but the fun you’ll have is worth every cent you spend. 
Don’t forget the chips!
If your iMac isn’t within shouting distance of an existing network or you don’t 
plan on buying any additional computers, stop right here — a lone iMac hang-
ing out in your home with no other computers around won’t need a network.
 
If you have just your iMac and an Internet connection and you have no plans 
to add another computer or a network printer, a network isn’t necessary.
The Great Debate: Wired versus Wireless
After you decide that you indeed need a network for your home or office, you 
have another decision to make: Should you install a wired network (running 
cables between your computers) or a wireless network? Heck, should you 
throw caution completely to the wind and build a combination network with 
both wireless and wired hardware?

 Chapter 21: Building (Or Joining) a Network
Your first instinct is probably to choose a wireless network for convenience. 
After all, this option allows you to eliminate running cables behind furniture 
(or in the ceiling of your office building). Ah, but I must show you the advan-
tages to a wired network as well. Table 21-1 shows the lowdown to help you 
make up your mind.

As I call it, here are the advantages of choosing a wired or a wireless network 
setup:
 
✓ Wired: Using a wired network offers two significant perks over a wire-
less network:
 
• Faster speeds: In general, wired networks that are compatible with 
your iMac are many times faster than the fastest 802.11n wireless 
connections.
 
 The performance of a wireless connection can be compromised by 
interference (from impeding structures, such as concrete walls; 
and from household appliances, such as some wireless phones and 
microwave ovens) and by distance.
 
• Better security: A wired network doesn’t broadcast a signal that can 
be picked up outside your home or office, so it’s more secure.
 
 Hackers can attack through your Internet connection. Always use a 
firewall. I subtly emphasize this point in the section, “USE YOUR 
FIREWALL!,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Wireless: A wireless connection really has only one advantage, but it’s 
a big one: convenience (which, in this case, is another word for mobility 
for all your networked devices).
 
 Accessing your network anywhere within your home or office — without 
cables — is so easy. You can also easily connect a wireless printer. And 
when using an AirPort Express mobile Base Station, even your home 
stereo can get connected to your MP3 collection on your iMac. Read 
more about Base Stations later on.

Sharing Internet Access
Time to see what’s necessary to share an Internet connection. In this section, 
I cover two methods of connecting your network to the Internet. (And before 
you open your wallet, keep in mind that you might be able to use your iMac 
to share your broadband connection across your network!)
Using your iMac as a sharing device
Figure 21-1 illustrates how you can use your iMac to provide a shared 
Internet connection across a simple wireless network, using either
 
✓ A broadband DSL or cable connection
 
✓ An external USB dialup modem
 
 I recommend sharing a dialup modem Internet connection only if you 
have no other option. A dialup modem connection really can’t handle 
the data transfer speeds for more than one computer to access the 
Internet comfortably at one time. (In plain English, an external USB 
modem that you add to your iMac isn’t fast enough for both you and 
your significant other to surf the Web at the same time.) Sharing a dialup 
connection just isn’t practical.
In either configuration, your iMac uses the Mac OS X Snow Leopard built-in 
Internet connection sharing feature to get the job done, but your iMac must 
remain turned on to allow Internet sharing. I show you how to do this in the 
upcoming section, “Network Internet connections,” later in this chapter.
Using a dedicated Internet sharing device
Figure 21-2 illustrates how a broadband connection works if you use a dedi-
cated Internet sharing device (often called an Internet router) to connect to 
your cable or DSL modem. You have to buy this additional hardware, but 
your iMac doesn’t have to remain turned on just so everyone can get on the 
Internet.
Internet routers usually include either wired or wireless network 
connections — and many include both.

Setting up an Internet router is usually a pretty simple matter, but the 
configuration depends on the device manufacturer and usually involves a 
number of different settings in System Preferences that vary according to the 
model of router you’re installing. Grab a diet cola, sit down with the router’s 
manual, and follow the installation instructions you’ll find there. (In some 
cases, you may need to set up your cable or DSL modem as a bridge between 
your ISP and your router, which should be covered in your modem and 
router manuals as well.)

Most Internet routers offer a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
server, which automatically assigns Internet protocol (IP) addresses, and I 
strongly recommend that you turn on this feature!
What Do You Need to Connect?
Most normal folks — whom I define as those who have never met a network 
system administrator, and couldn’t care less — think that connecting to a 
network probably involves all sorts of arcane chants and a mystical symbol 
or two. In this section, I provide you with the shopping list that you need to 
set up a network — or connect to a network that’s already running.
Wireless connections
Today’s iMacs come complete with built-in AirPort Extreme wireless hard-
ware, so if you already have an AirPort Extreme or Express Base Station, 
you’re set to go. Otherwise, hold on tight while I lead you through the hard-
ware requirements for wireless networking. (Kinda ironic, don’t you think?)
 
The maximum signal range — and effectiveness — of any wireless network can 
be impeded by intervening walls or by electrical devices, such as microwave 
ovens and some wireless phones, all of which can generate interference.

329
 Chapter 21: Building (Or Joining) a Network
Connecting an iMac to an existing wireless network
Connecting an Intel iMac to an existing wireless network requires no extra 
hardware because your hardware is already built in. (Whew. That was easy!)
Using a base station to go wireless
If you decide that you want to build your own wireless network, you eschew 
cables, or you want to add wireless support to your existing wired network, 
you need a base station. The base station can act as a bridge between com-
puters using wireless and your existing wired network. Such a wireless base 
station will have either
 
✓ A port that can connect to your existing wired network’s switch
 
✓ A full built-in switch for wired connectivity (which means you can sell 
your old wired Ethernet switch to your sister in Tucson)
And, of course, a base station can simply act as a central switch for your 
wireless network (with no support for a wired network at all).
You can use either a cool Apple Base Station or a boring 802.11n generic 
wireless base station; however, the Apple hardware requires less configura-
tion and tweaking. (Sounds like a Mark’s Maxim!)
 
If you don’t want the hassle of tweaking PC hardware to accommodate your 
aluminum iMac, buy Apple hardware and software.
Apple Base Station models
As listed in Table 21-2, your iMac can work with three different Apple Base 
Station models for wireless networking:
 
✓ AirPort Extreme
 
 I recommend using AirPort Extreme if your network needs an enhanced 
antenna, which provides greater range. You can read about connectiv-
ity ranges in the upcoming Table 21-2. The Extreme is also a good pick if 
you need wired connectivity on your network.
 
✓ AirPort Express (as shown in Figure 21-3)
 
Figure 21-3: 
The AirPort 
Express por-
table Base 
Station.
 

330
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
 I recommend using AirPort Express if you want to
 
• Carry your wireless base station with you. Express is much smaller 
than the other Apple Base Station models. (Think “party on the 
patio” or a LAN gaming get-together at a friend’s house.)
 
• Connect your home stereo for wireless music streaming. You can use 
the AirTunes sharing feature in iTunes.
 
✓ Time Capsule
 
 Apple’s Time Capsule unit isn’t just a wireless remote hard drive: It can 
also act as a full AirPort Extreme Base Station. In fact, the wireless speci-
fications for a Time Capsule unit and an AirPort Extreme Base Station 
are almost identical.
 
 The 802.11n standard used by the AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, and 
AirPort Express Base Stations delivers a connection that’s several times 
faster than the old AirPort Base Station’s 802.11b/802.11g standards. 
802.11n is also compatible with all the older standards — 802.11b/a/g — 
so I highly recommend that you stick with 802.11n in the future. It plays 
well with others, and at warp speed, to boot!

 Chapter 21: Building (Or Joining) a Network
 
The names of the Apple Base Stations are irritatingly similar; Apple usually 
does a better job differentiating their product names. Jot down the name of 
your model on a sticky note and stick it on your iMac’s Desktop just so you 
don’t get confused.
Installing an Apple Base Station is simple:
 
1. If you have a DSL or cable modem, connect it to the Ethernet LAN port 
on the Base Station with an Ethernet cable.
 
2. If you have an existing wired Ethernet computer network using a 
switch or router, connect it to the WAN (wide area network) port on 
the Base Station with an Ethernet cable.
 
 Only the AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule stations have a WAN port.
 
3. If you have a USB printer, connect it to the USB port on the Base 
Station.
 
 I cover the steps to share a printer in the upcoming section, “Sharing a 
network printer.”
 
4. Connect the power cable from the AC power adapter.
 
 The AirPort Express and Time Capsule units have a built-in AC adapter, so 
if you’re using one of these models, just plug the device itself into the wall.
 
5. Switch on your Base Station.
 
6. Run the installation software provided by Apple on your iMac.
Using non-Apple base stations
If any company other than Apple manufactured your wireless base station, 
the installation procedure is almost certainly the same. (Naturally, you 
should take a gander at the manufacturer’s installation guide just to make 
sure, but I added many different brands of these devices and used the same 
steps for each one.)
However, I should note that Apple wireless hardware uses a slightly different 
security encryption standard than most PC wireless hardware, which results 
in an extra hurdle when connecting to a non-Apple base station with your 
iMac. (More on this in the next section. For now, just remember that I recom-
mend using Apple wireless hardware with your iMac whenever possible. It’s 
just a little easier!)
Joining a wireless network 
As far as I’m concerned, the only two types of base stations on the planet are 
Apple and non-Apple (which includes all 802.11n and 802.11g Base Stations 
and access points). In these two sections, I relate what you need to know to 
get onboard, using either type of hardware.

332
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
Apple AirPort Base Stations
To join a wireless network that’s served by any flavor of Apple Base Station, 
follow these steps on each Mac with wireless support:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Network icon.
 
3. From the Connection list on the left, click AirPort.
 
4. Mark the Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar check box.
 
5. Click the Apply button.
 
6. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your settings.
 
7. Click the AirPort status icon (which looks like a fan) on the Finder 
menu bar.
 
8. From the AirPort menu, choose an existing network connection that 
you’d like to join.
 
 The network name is the same as the network name you chose when 
you set up your AirPort Base Station.
 
9. If you set up a secure network, enter the password you assigned to the 
network during setup.
By the way, security is always A Good Thing, and I strongly recommend that 
you enable the password encryption features of your Apple Base Station 
while installing it! (Luckily, the Apple Base Station setup application leads 
you through this very process.) In the words of an important Mark’s Maxim:
 
Keep uninvited guests out of your network! Use your base station’s security 
features and encrypt your data!
Some wireless networks might not appear in your AirPort menu list. These 
are closed networks, which can be specified when you set up your AirPort 
Base Station. You can’t join a closed network unless you know the exact net-
work name (which is far more secure than simply broadcasting the network 
name). To join a closed network, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Join Other Network from the AirPort menu.
 
 To open the menu, click the AirPort status icon (which looks like a fan) 
on the Finder menu bar.
 
2. Type the name of the network.
 
3. If the network is secured with WEP or WPA2 encryption — the two 
most popular security standards for protecting your data through 
encryption — click the Security pop-up menu and select which type of 
encryption is being used.
 
4. Enter the network password, if required.

333
 Chapter 21: Building (Or Joining) a Network
To disconnect from an AirPort network, click the AirPort menu and either
 
✓ Choose Turn AirPort Off.
 
✓ Connect to another AirPort network.
 
 In other words, if you choose another available AirPort network from 
the AirPort menu, your iMac will automatically drop the previous con-
nection. (You can only be connected to one wireless network at a time, 
which makes Good Sense.)
Using non-Apple Base Stations
If you’re using your iMac to connect to a non-Apple base station, you might 
need to follow a specific procedure that takes care of the slightly different 
password functionality used by standard 802.11b/g/n hardware.
Snow Leopard can take care of many potential wireless “language barriers” 
caused by security encryption — the two most common forms are WEP and 
LEAP — so whether you need to massage your password to connect to your 
non-Apple base station depends on the specific hardware and encryption 
system that it uses.
 
To read or print the latest version of this procedure, fire up Safari and visit 
http://kbase.info.apple.com/index.html, searching on the number 
106250. (This is the Apple Knowledge Base article number, which you can type 
in the first search field.) This article provides the details on how to convert a 
standard wireless encrypted password to a format that your AirPort Extreme 
hardware can understand.
Wired connections
If you’re installing a wired network, your iMac already comes with most of 
what you need for joining your new cabled world. You just connect the hard-
ware and configure the connection. Don’t forget that you also need cables 
and an inexpensive Ethernet switch. (If you’re using an Internet router or 
other hardware sharing device, it almost certainly has a built-in 4 or 8-port 
switch.)
Connecting iMac hardware to a wired network
Your Ethernet 10/100/1000 port (which looks like a slightly oversized 
modem port) is located in the line of ports on the back of your iMac, ready 
to accept a standard Ethernet Cat5/Cat5E/Cat6 cable with RJ-45 connectors. 
If you’re connecting to an existing wired network, you need a standard 
Cat5/Cat5E/Cat6 Ethernet cable of the necessary length. I recommend a 
length of no more than 25 feet because cables longer than 25 feet are often 
subject to line interference (which can slow down or even cripple your 

334
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
connection). You also need a live Ethernet port from the network near your 
iMac. Plug the cable into your iMac, and then plug the other end into the 
network port.
Wired network hardware
If you don’t know your switch from your NIC, don’t worry. Here, I provide you 
with a description of the hardware that you need for your wired network.
Wired network components
If you’re building your own wired network, you need
 
✓ A switch: This gizmo’s job is to provide more network ports for the 
other computers in your network. They typically come in 4- and 8-port 
configurations.
 
 As I mention earlier in this chapter, most Internet routers (sometimes 
called Internet sharing devices) include a built-in switch, so if you’ve 
already invested in an Internet router, before you go shopping for a 
switch make doggone sure that the router doesn’t already come 
equipped with the ports you need!
 
✓ A number of Ethernet cables: Exactly how many cables you need is 
determined by how many computers you’re connecting. If you’re work-
ing with a gigabit Ethernet system, you need Cat5E or Cat6 cables. Cat6 
cables provide better performance, but they are more expensive.
 
Naturally, if you’re using a broadband Internet connection, you also have a 
DSL or cable modem. These boxes always include a port for connecting to 
your wired Ethernet network. (If you have one of the new breed of wireless 
modems — which acts as a wireless base station — don’t panic because it 
should also have a wired port for connecting to your existing switch.)
Wired network connections
After you assemble your cables and your router or switch, connect the 
Ethernet cables from each of your computers to the router or switch, and 
then turn on the device. (Most need AC power to work.) Check the manual 
that comes with your device to make sure that the lights you’re seeing on the 
front indicate normal operation. (Colors vary by manufacturer, but green is 
usually good.)
Next, connect your cable or DSL modem’s Ethernet port to the WAN port on 
your switch with an Ethernet cable. If your modem isn’t already on, turn it on 
now and check for normal operation.

335
 Chapter 21: Building (Or Joining) a Network
When your router or switch is powered on and operating normally, you’re 
ready to configure Mac OS X for network operation. Just hop to the upcom-
ing section, “Connecting to the Network.” (How about that? Now you can add 
network technician to your rapidly growing computer résumé!)
Joining a wired Ethernet network
After all the cables are connected and your central connection gizmo is 
plugged in and turned on, you’ve essentially created the hardware portion of 
your network. Congratulations! (Now you need a beard and suspenders.)
With the hardware in place, it’s time to configure Snow Leopard. In this sec-
tion, I assume that you’re connecting to a network with an Internet router or 
switch that includes a DHCP server.
Follow these steps on each Mac running Mac OS X that you want to connect 
to the network:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Network icon (under Internet & Network).
 
3. From the Connection list on the left, click Ethernet.
 
4. Click the Configure pop-up menu (see Figure 21-4) and choose Using 
DHCP.
 
Figure 21-4:

336
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
5. Click the Apply button.
 
 The Apply button is grayed out in the figure because my Status (in this 
dialog) is Connected.
 
 Enjoy the automatic goodness as Mac OS X connects to the DHCP server 
to obtain an IP address, a subnet mask, a gateway router IP address, and 
a Domain Name System (DNS) address. (Without a DHCP server, you’d 
have to add all this stuff manually. Ugh.)
 
 A few seconds after clicking the Apply button, you should see the infor-
mation come up. You might also notice that the DNS Server field is 
empty, but fear not because Mac OS X is really using DNS Server infor-
mation provided by the DHCP server.
 
6. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences and save your settings.
 
 You’re on!
Connecting to the Network
All right! The hardware is powered up, the cables (if any) are installed and 
connected, and you configured Snow Leopard. You’re ready to start (or join) 
the party. In this section, I show you how to verify that you’re connected as 
well as how to share data and devices with others on your network.
Verifying that the contraption works
After you have at least two computers on a wired or wireless network, test 
whether they’re talking to each other over the network by pinging them. (No, 
I didn’t make up the term, honest.) Essentially, pinging another computer is 
like yelling, “Are you there?” across a crevasse.
To ping another computer on the same network from any Mac running Snow 
Leopard, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and then click Utilities.
 
2. Double-click the Network Utility icon to launch the application.
 
3. Click the Ping tab; see upcoming Figure 21-5.
 
4. In the Please Enter the Network Address to Ping text field, enter the IP 
address of the computer that you want to ping.

337
 Chapter 21: Building (Or Joining) a Network
 
• If you’re pinging another Mac running Mac OS X, you can get the IP 
address of that machine by simply displaying its Network pane within 
System Preferences, which always displays the IP address.
 
• If you’re trying to ping a PC running Windows and you don’t know the IP 
address of that machine, follow these steps:
 
a. Click Start, right-click My Network Places (XP)/Network (Vista and 
Windows 7) and then choose Properties.
 
b. From the Network Connections window, right-click your Local Area 
Network connection icon and then choose Status.
 
c. Click the Support tab.
 
 The IP address of that PC is proudly displayed.
 
5. Select the Send Only x Pings radio button and enter 2 in the text field.
 
6. Click the Ping button.
 
• Yay!: If everything is working, you should see results similar to 
those shown in Figure 21-5, in which I’m pinging my Windows 
server at IP address 192.168.0.104, across my wired Ethernet 
network.
 
• Nay: If you don’t get a successful ping, check your cable connec-
tions, power cords, and Mac OS X settings. Folks using a wireless 
connection might have to move closer to the network base station 
to connect successfully, especially through walls.

Look, Ma,

Sharing stuff nicely with others
It works . . . by golly, it works! Okay, now what do you do with your all-new 
shining chrome network connection? Ah, my friend, let me be the first to con-
gratulate you, and the first to show you around! In this section, I cover the 
most popular network perks. (And the good news is that these perks work 
with both wired and wireless connections.)
Network Internet connections
If your DSL or cable modem plugs directly into your iMac (rather than a 
dedicated Internet sharing device or Internet router), you might ponder just 
how the other computers on your network can share that spiffy high-speed 
broadband connection. If you’re running a wireless network, it comes to the 
rescue!
Follow these steps to share your connection wirelessly:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon (under Internet & Network).
 
3. Click the Internet Sharing entry in the Services list to the left of the 
pane.
 
4. From the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu, choose Ethernet.
 
5. Mark the AirPort check box (in the To Computers Using list).
 
 Snow Leopard displays a warning dialog stating that connection sharing 
could affect your Internet service provider (ISP) or violate your agree-
ment with your ISP. I’ve never heard of this actually happening, but if 
you want to be sure, contact your ISP and ask the good folks there.
 
6. Click Start in the warning dialog to continue.
 
7. Select the On check box next to the Internet Sharing entry in the 
Services list.
 
8. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
 
Sharing an Internet connection (without an Internet router or dedicated hard-
ware device) through Mac OS X requires your iMac to remain on continuously. 
This is no big deal if you’re using your iMac as a Web server — and your iMac 
has absolutely no problem remaining on ad infinitum — but tell others in your 
office or your home that the svelte iMac must remain on, or they’ll lose their 
Internet connection!

339
 Chapter 21: Building (Or Joining) a Network
Don’t forget that you won’t need to configure Internet sharing if your DSL or 
cable modem connects to a dedicated sharing device or router. That snazzy 
equipment automatically connects your entire network to the Internet.
Network file sharing
You can swap all sorts of interesting files with other Macintosh computers on 
your network. When you turn on Personal File Sharing, Snow Leopard lets all 
Macs on the network connect to your iMac and share the files in your Public 
folder. (Note: Sharing across a network is different from sharing a single com-
puter betwixt several people. I cover that environment in Chapter 20.)
Follow these steps to start sharing files and folders with others across your 
network:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon.
 
3. Select the On check box next to the File Sharing service entry to 
enable the connections for Mac and Windows sharing.
 
 Other Mac users can connect to your computer by clicking Go in the 
Finder menu and choosing the Network menu item. The Network window 
appears, and your iMac is among the choices. If the other Macs are run-
ning Snow Leopard, your iMac’s shared files and folders appear in a Finder 
window, and they’re listed under the Shared heading in the Sidebar.
 
 Windows XP users should be able to connect to your Mac from their 
My Network Places window, and Vista and Windows 7 users can use 
the Network window. Those lucky Windows folks also get to print to 
any shared printers you’ve set up. (The following section covers shared 
printers.)
 
4. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
 
Snow Leopard conveniently reminds you of the network name for your iMac at 
the bottom of the Sharing pane.
Sharing a network printer
Boy, howdy, do I love describing easy procedures, and sharing a printer on a 
Mac network ranks high on the list! You can share a printer that’s connected 
to your iMac (or your AirPort Extreme, Time Capsule, or AirPort Express 
Base Station) by following these very simple steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon.

340
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
 
3. Select the On check box next to the Printer Sharing service entry.
 
4. From the list at the right of the System Preferences window, select the 
printer you want to share.
 
5. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
A printer that you share automatically appears in the Print dialog on other 
Macs connected to your network.
Running a Web site from a network
Web jockeys tell you that Mac OS X is a great platform for running a Web site 
that you can access from either the Internet or your local network. In fact, it’s 
ridiculously easy to engage the mind-boggling power of Snow Leopard’s built-
in Apache Web server. (Keep in mind, however, that your iMac must always 
be on and connected to the Internet, or your Web pages won’t be available to 
your folks in Schenectady.)
To begin serving Web pages, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon.
 
3. Select the On check box next to the Web Sharing service entry.
 
4. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
To check out the default HTML page that ships with Apache, open the System 
Preferences Sharing pane again and click the link that appears under the 
heading Your Computer’s Website. Note that Snow Leopard also creates a 
personal Web site under your username, which is different from the default 
Web site created by Apache. Click the link under the heading Your Personal 
Website to display this page.
To add pages to your Web server, navigate to the Sites folder that resides in 
your Home folder. Because this is the root of your Apache Web server, the 
files that you add to this folder are accessible from your Web server.
 
Don’t forget that folks connecting to your Web site across the Internet must 
use your public IP address! Your iMac’s IP address appears in the Built-in 
Ethernet description on the Network pane in System Preferences. If you’re 
using an Internet router or Internet connection sharing device, your public IP 
address might be different, so the links on the Web Sharing pane might not 
work for folks outside your local network. Check the documentation for the 
device to determine how to find your actual public IP address. Also, your 
router or sharing device might require you to specify which computer on your 
network is to receive HTTP (Web) page requests and send the pages. Again, 
this should be covered in the device manual.

 Chapter 21: Building (Or Joining) a Network
USE YOUR FIREWALL!
Yep. That’s the only heading in this entire book that’s all uppercase. It’s that 
important.
The following Mark’s Maxim, good reader, isn’t a request, a strong recom-
mendation, or even a regular Maxim — consider it an absolute command-
ment (right up there with Get an antivirus application now).
 
Turn on your firewall now.
When you connect a network to the Internet, you open a door to the outside 
world. As a consultant to several businesses and organizations in my home-
town, I can tell you that the outside world is chock-full of malicious individu-
als who would dearly love to inflict damage on your data or take control of 
your iMac for their own purposes. Call ’em hackers, call ’em delinquents, or 
call ’em something I can’t repeat, but don’t let them in!
Snow Leopard comes to the rescue again with the built-in firewall within Mac 
OS X. When you use this, you essentially build a virtual brick wall between 
you and the hackers out there (both on the Internet, and even within your 
local network). Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Security icon.
 
3. Click the Firewall tab.
 
4. Click the Start button to activate your firewall.
 
5. Click the Advanced button.
 
6. Select the Automatically Allow Signed Software to Receive Incoming 
Connections check box.
 
7. Select the Enable Stealth Mode check box.
 
 This is an important feature that prevents hackers from trolling for your 
iMac on the Internet — or, in normal-speak, searching for an unpro-
tected computer — so it’s much harder for them to attack you.
 
8. Click OK.
 
9. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.
Snow Leopard even keeps track of the Internet traffic that you do want to 
reach your iMac, such as Web page requests and file sharing. When you acti-
vate one of the network features that I demonstrate in the preceding section, 

342
Part V: Getting Productive with iWork and Other Tools 
Snow Leopard automatically opens a tiny hole (called a port by net-types) 
in your firewall to allow just that type of communication to your iMac. For 
example, if you decide to turn on Web Sharing (as I demonstrate earlier), 
Snow Leopard automatically allows incoming Web access.
You can also add ports for applications that aren’t on the firewall’s Allow list. 
This includes third-party Instant Messaging clients, multiplayer game servers, 
and the like. Depending on the type of connection, Snow Leopard will often 
automatically display a dialog prompting you for confirmation before allow-
ing certain traffic, so most folks won’t need to do anything manually.
However, you can add a program manually to your list of allowed (or 
blocked) Firewall ports. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click the Security icon.
 
3. Click the Firewall tab.
 
4. Click the Advanced button.
 
5. Click the Add button.
 
 Snow Leopard displays a standard File browsing sheet.
 
6. Browse to the application that requires access to the outside 
world — or the application that you want to block from outside 
communication — and click it to select it.
 
7. Click the Add button in the File sheet.
 
 The application appears in the Firewall list. By default, it’s set to Allow 
Incoming Connections.
 
8. If you want to block any incoming communication to the application, 
click the Allow Incoming Connections pop-up menu and choose Block 
Incoming Connections instead.
 
9. Click the Close button to exit System Preferences.

iMac starts acting strangely, the troubleshooting 
tips you find in this part can help you get your favorite 
machine back to normal. I also provide you with all the

step-by-step instructions for upgrading your computer 
with goodies like additional RAM or external devices.

It Just . . . Sits . . . There
In This Chapter
▶ Avoiding the blame (righteously)
▶ Putting basic troubleshooting precepts to work
▶ Using Mark’s Troubleshooting Tree
▶ Getting help
I
 wish you weren’t reading this chapter.
Because you are, I can only surmise that you’re having trouble with your 
iMac, and that it needs fixing. (The other possibility — that you just like read-
ing about solving computer problems — is more attractive, but much more 
problematic.)
Consider this chapter a crash course in the logical puzzle that is computer 
troubleshooting: namely, the art of finding out What Needs Fixing. You also 
see what you can do when you just plain can’t fix the problem by yourself.
Oh, and you’re going to encounter a lot of Tips and Mark’s Maxims in this 
chapter — all of them learned the hard way, so I recommend committing 
them to memory on the spot!
Can You Troubleshoot? Yes, You Can!
Anyone can troubleshoot. Put these common troubleshooting myths to rest:
 
✓ It takes a college degree in computers to troubleshoot. Tell that to my 
troubleshooting kids. They’ll think it’s a hoot because they have Apple 
computers of their own in their bedrooms. You can follow all the steps 
in this chapter without any special training.

346
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
✓ I’m to blame. Ever heard of viruses? Failing hardware? Buggy software? 
Any of those things can be causing the problem. Heck, even if you 
do something by accident, I’m willing to bet it wasn’t on purpose. It’s 
Mark’s Maxim time:
 
 Don’t beat yourself up — your iMac can be fixed.
 
✓ I need to buy expensive utility software. Nope. You can certainly 
invest in a commercial testing and repair utility if you like. My favorite is 
TechTool Pro from Micromat (www.micromat.com), but a third-party 
utility isn’t a requirement for troubleshooting. (I would, however, con-
sider an antivirus application as a must-have, and you should have one 
already. Hint, hint.)
 
✓ There’s no hope if I can’t fix it. Sure, parts fail, and computers crash, 
but your Apple Service Center can repair just about any problem. And 
(ahem) if you backed up your iMac (like I preach throughout this book), 
you’ll keep that important data (even if a new hard drive is in your 
future).
 
✓ It takes forever. Wait until you read the Number One Rule in the next 
section; the first step takes but 15 seconds and often solves the prob-
lem. Naturally, not all problems can be fixed so quickly, but if you follow 
the procedures in this chapter, you should fix your iMac (or at least 
know that the problem requires outside help) in a single afternoon.
With those myths banished for good, you can get down to business and start 
feeling better soon.
Basic Troubleshooting 101
In this section, I walk you through my Should-Be-Patented Troubleshooting 
Tree as well as the Snow Leopard built-in troubleshooting application, Disk 
Utility. I also introduce you to a number of keystrokes that can make your 
iMac jump through hoops.
The Number One Rule: Reboot!
Yep, it sounds silly, but the fact is that rebooting your iMac can often solve a 
number of problems. If you’re encountering these types of strange behavior 
with your iMac, a reboot might be all you need to heal
 
✓ Intermittent problems communicating over a network
 
✓ A garbled screen, strange colors, or screwed-up fonts
 
✓ The Swirling Beach Ball of Doom that won’t go away after several minutes

347
 Chapter 22: It Just. . .Sits. . .There
 
✓ An application that locks up
 
✓ An external device that seems to disappear or can’t be opened
To put it succinctly, here’s a modest Mark’s Maxim:
 
Always try a reboot before beginning to worry. Always.
 
Try to save all your open documents before you reboot. That might not be 
possible, but try to save what you can.
If you need to force a locked application (one that’s not responding) to quit 
so you can reboot, follow these steps to squash that locked application:
 
1. Click the Apple (Ú) menu and choose Force Quit.
 
 The dialog that you see in Figure 22-1 appears on your screen.
 
Figure 22-1: 
Force a 
recalcitrant 
application 
to take off.
 
 
2. Click the offending application and then click the Force Quit button.
 
 If you can get everything to quit, you should be able to click the Apple 
menu and choose Shut Down (not Restart) without a problem.
If your iMac simply won’t shut down (or you can’t get the offending applica-
tion to quit), then do what must be done:
 
1. Press and hold your iMac Power button until it shuts itself off.
 
 You have to wait about four seconds for your iMac to turn itself off.
 
2. Wait about ten seconds.
 
3. Press the Power button again to restart the computer.
 
Note that you should not simply pull your iMac’s power cord out of the AC 
socket (or turn off your power strip) to turn it off — pressing and holding the 
power switch on your iMac is a less destructive path to the same end.

348
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
After everything is back up, check whether the problem is still apparent. If 
you use your iMac for an hour or two and the problem doesn’t reoccur, you 
likely fixed it!
 
Rebooting fixes problems because it resets everything — even your network 
connection. Rebooting also fixes problems due to brownouts or those notori-
ous AC power flickerings that we all notice from time to time.
Special keys that can come in handy
A number of keys have special powers over your iMac. No, I’m not kidding! 
These keys affect how your iMac starts up, and they can really come in handy 
whilst troubleshooting.
Using Safe Boot mode
You can use Safe Boot mode to force Snow Leopard to run a directory check 
of your boot hard drive and disable any Login Items that might be interfering 
with Snow Leopard. Use the Shut Down menu item from the Apple (Ú) menu 
to completely turn off your iMac, press the Power button to start the com-
puter. Then press and hold down the Shift key immediately after you hear the 
startup tone. After Snow Leopard has completely booted, restart your iMac 
again (this time without the Shift key) to return to normal operation.
Startup keys
Table 22-1 provides the lowdown on startup keys. Hold the indicated key 
down either when you push your iMac Power button or immediately after the 
screen blanks during a restart. (As I just mentioned, the Shift key is the excep-
tion; it should be pressed and held down after you hear the startup tone.)
Danger, Will Robinson!
Many Disk Utility functions can actually wipe 
your hard drives clean of data instead of repair-
ing them! These advanced functions aren’t 
likely to help you with troubleshooting a prob-
lem with your existing volumes, anyway.
Remember: Don’t use these Disk Utility func-
tions unless an Apple technician tells you to 
use them:
 ✓ Partitioning and erasing drives
 ✓ Setting up RAID arrays
 ✓ Restoring files from disk images

All hail Disk Utility, the 
troubleshooter’s friend
Snow Leopard’s Disk Utility is a handy tool for troubleshooting and repairing 
your hard drive. You can find it in the Utilities folder within your Applications 
folder.
Fire up Disk Utility, click the volume and click the First Aid tab to bring up 
the rather powerful-looking window shown in Figure 22-2.
In the left column of the Disk Utility window, you can see
 
✓ The physical hard drives in your system (the actual hardware)
 
✓ The volumes (the data stored on the hard drives)
 
 You can always tell a volume because it’s indented underneath the 
physical drive entry.
 
✓ Any CD or DVD loaded on your iMac
 
✓ Disk images you’ve mounted
 
✓ USB or FireWire Flash drives

350
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
Figure 22-2: 
The physi-
cian of hard 
drives —         
Snow 
Leopard’s 
Disk Utility.
 
For example, in Figure 22-2, I have one hard drive (the 298.1GB entry) and one 
USB Flash drive (the 3.7GB entry). The hard drive has two volumes (Wolfgang 
and Mother), and the USB drive has one volume (MLC USB).
 
The information at the bottom of the Disk Utility window contains the specifi-
cations of the selected drive or volume . . . things like capacity, free space, and 
the number of files and folders for a volume, or connection type and total 
capacity for a drive.
Repairing disk permissions
Because Snow Leopard is built on a Unix base, lots of permissions can apply 
to the files on your drive — that is, who can open (or read or change) every 
application, folder, and document on your hard drive. Unfortunately, these 
permissions are often messed up by wayward applications or power glitches 
or application installers that do a sub-par job of cleaning up after themselves. 
And if the permissions on a file are changed, often applications lock up or 
refuse to run altogether.
 
I recommend repairing your disk permissions with Disk Utility once weekly. 
Figure 22-3 shows a permissions repair sweep on my internal hard drive’s 
volume.

351
 Chapter 22: It Just. . .Sits. . .There
 
Figure 22-3: 
A suc-
cessful 
run, using 
Repair Disk 
Permissions.
 
Use these steps to repair permissions on your iMac’s hard drive:
 
1. Make sure that you’re logged in with an admin account.
 
2. Save and close any open documents.
 
 Chapter 20 shows you how to log in as an admin user.
 
3. Double-click the Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder.
 
4. Click the volume that you want to check.
 
5. Click the Repair Disk Permissions button.
 
 I don’t worry about verifying. If something’s wrong, you end up clicking 
Repair Disk Permissions, anyway. Just click Repair Disk Permissions; if 
nothing pops up, that’s fine.
 
6. To finish the process, always reboot after repairing permissions.
 
 This last step allows you to see whether a problem has been corrected!
Repairing disks
Disk Utility can check the format and health of both hard drives and volumes 
with Verify Disk — and, if the problem can be corrected, fix any error with 
Repair Disk.

352
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
Using Disk Utility to repair your hard drive carries a couple of caveats:
 
✓ You can’t verify or repair the boot disk or the boot volume. This actu-
ally makes sense because you’re using that disk and volume right now.
 
 To verify or repair your boot hard drive, you need to boot from your 
Mac OS X installation disc by using the C startup key. (Refer to Table 
22-1 for keys that come in handy.) After your iMac boots from the Mac 
OS X installation disc, choose the Utilities menu and click Disk Utility.
 
 You should be able to select your boot hard drive or volume, and the 
Verify Disk and Repair Disk buttons should be enabled.
 
✓ You can’t repair CDs and DVDs. CDs and DVDs are read-only media and 
thus can’t be repaired at all (at least by Disk Utility).
 
 If your iMac is having trouble reading a CD or DVD, wipe the disc with a 
soft cloth to remove dust, oil, and fingerprints. Should that fail, invest in 
a disc-cleaning contrivance of some sort.
If you need to verify and repair a disk or volume, follow these steps:
 
1. If you need to repair your boot drive and volume, save all your open 
documents and reboot from either an external drive or your Mac OS 
X Installation disc.
 
2. Double-click the Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder.
 
3. In the list at the left side of the Disk Utility window, click the disk or 
volume that you want to check.
 
4. Click the Repair Disk button.
 
5. If changes were made (or if you had to boot from a disc or external 
drive), reboot after repairing the disk or volume.
Should I reinstall Mac OS X?
This question seems to get a lot of attention 
on Mac-related Internet discussion boards 
and Usenet newsgroups — and the answer 
is a definitive perhaps. (I know. That’s really 
helpful.)
Here’s the explanation. You shouldn’t lose a 
single byte of data by reinstalling Mac OS X, so 
it’s definitely okay to try it. However, reinstalling 
Mac OS X isn’t a universal balm that fixes all 
hardware and software errors. 
Follow the iMac Troubleshooting Tree all the 
way to the end before you consider reinstall-
ing Snow Leopard. Contact an Apple support 
technician via the Apple Web site before you 
take this step.

Mark’s iMac Troubleshooting Tree
As the hip-hop artists say, “Alright, kick it.” And that’s just what my iMac 
Troubleshooting Tree is here for. If rebooting your iMac hasn’t solved the 
problem, follow these steps in order (until either the solution is found, or you 
run out of steps — more on that in the next section).
Step 1: Investigate recent changes
This is a simple step that many novice Mac owners forget. Simply retrace 
your steps and consider what changes you made recently to your system. 
Here are the most common culprits:
 
✓ Did you just finish installing a new application? Try uninstalling it by 
removing the application directory and any support files that it might 
have added to your system. (And keep your applications current with 
the most recent patches and updates from the developer’s Web site.)
 
 From time to time, an application’s preference file — which stores all the 
custom settings you make — can become corrupted. Although the appli-
cation itself is okay, it might act strangely or refuse to launch. To check 
your preference files for signs of corruption, try scanning your iMac 
applications with Preferential Treatment, a freeware AppleScript utility 
by Jonathan Nathan, available from his Web site at www.jonn8.com/
html/pt.html. (Preferential Treatment will flag any dicey preference 
files, setting them up for a quick trip to the Trash.)
 
✓ Did you just apply an update or a patch to an application? Uninstall 
the application and reinstall it without applying the patch. If your iMac 
suddenly works again, check the developer’s Web site or contact its 
technical support department to report the problem.
 
✓ Did you just update Snow Leopard by using Software Update? Updating 
Snow Leopard can introduce problems within your applications that 
depend on specific routines and system files. Contact the developer of 
the application and look for updated patches that bring your software in 
line with the Snow Leopard updates. (And use Software Update in auto-
matic mode to check for Mac OS X updates at least once weekly.)
 
✓ Did you just make a change within System Preferences? Return the 
options that you changed back to their original settings; then consult 
Chapter 6 for information on what might have gone wrong. (If the setting 
in question isn’t in Chapter 6, consider searching Snow Leopard’s online 
Help or the Apple support Web site for more clues.)
 
✓ Did you just connect (or reconnect) an external device? Try unplugging 
the device and then rebooting to see whether the problem disappears. 
Remember that many peripherals need software drivers to run — and 
without those drivers installed, they won’t work correctly. (Not to men-
tion that updated drivers may be available.) Check the device’s manual or 
visit the company’s Web site to search for software that you might need.

354
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
If you didn’t make any significant changes to your system before you encoun-
tered the problem, proceed to the next step.
Step 2: Run Disk Utility
The preceding section shows how to repair disk permissions on your Snow 
Leopard boot drive.
 
If you’re experiencing hard drive problems, consider booting from your Mac 
OS X Installation CD or DVD to run a full-blown Repair Disk checkup on your 
boot volume.
Step 3: Check your cables
Cables work themselves loose, and they fail from time to time. Check all your 
cables to your external devices — make sure that they’re snug — and verify 
that everything’s plugged in and turned on. (Oh, and don’t forget to check for 
crimps in your cables or even Fluffy’s teeth marks.)
 
If a FireWire or USB device acts up, swap cables around to find whether you 
have a bad one. A faulty cable can leave you pulling your hair out in no time.
Step 4: Check your Trash
Check the contents of your Trash to see whether you recently deleted files 
or folders by accident. Click the Trash icon on the Dock once to display the 
contents. If something’s been deleted by mistake, drag it back to its original 
folder, and try running the application again.
I know this one from personal experience. A slight miscalculation while 
selecting files to delete made an application freeze every time I launched it.
Step 5: Check your Internet and network connections
Now that always-on DSL and cable modem connections to the Internet are 
common, don’t forget an obvious problem: Your iMac can’t reach the Internet 
because your ISP is down, or your network is no longer working!
A quick visual check of your DSL or cable modem will usually indicate 
whether there’s a connection problem between your modem and your ISP — 
for example, my modem has a very informative activity light that I always 
glance at first. However, if your iMac is connected to the Internet through a 
larger home or office network and you can’t check the modem visually, you 
can check your Internet connection by pinging www.apple.com, as shown in 
Figure 22-4.

355
 Chapter 22: It Just. . .Sits. . .There
 
1. Open your Utilities folder (inside your Applications folder).
 
2. Double-click Network Utility.
 
3. Click the Ping button.
 
4. Enter www.apple.com in the Address box.
 
5. Click Ping.
 
 You should see successful ping messages similar to those in Figure 22-4. 
If you don’t get a successful ping and you can still reach other comput-
ers on your network, your ISP is likely experiencing problems. If you 
can’t reach your network at all, then the problem lies in your network 
hardware or configuration.
 
Figure 22-4: 
Ping 
apple.
com to 
check your 
Internet 
connection.
 
Step 6: Think virus
If you made it to this point, it’s time to run a full virus scan — and make sure 
that your antivirus application has the latest updated data files, too. My 
antivirus application of choice is Virus Barrier X from Intego (www.intego.
com). (If a virus is detected and your antivirus application can’t remove it, try 
quarantining it instead, which basically disables the virus-ridden application 
and prevents it from infecting other files.) I can also recommend ClamX AV, 
the antivirus application from www.clamxav.com (if you like ClamX AV, you 
can send a donation to the author).
Step 7: Disable your Login Items
Mac OS X might encounter problems with applications that you’ve marked as 
Login Items within System Preferences. In this step, I show you how to iden-
tify login problems and how to fix ’em.

356
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
Checking for problems
It’s time to use another nifty startup key (refer to Table 22-1). This time, hold 
down Shift after you hear the startup tone.
This trick disables your account’s Login Items, which are run automatically 
every time you log in to your iMac. If one of these Login Items is to blame, 
your iMac will simply encounter trouble every time you log in.
Finding the Login Item that’s causing trouble
If your iMac works fine with your Login Items disabled, follow this procedure 
for each item in the Login Items list:
 
1. Open System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login 
Items button.
 
2. Delete the item from the list; then reboot normally.
 
 You can delete the selected item by clicking the Delete button, which 
bears a minus sign.
 
 When your iMac starts up normally with Login Items enabled, you dis-
covered the perpetrator. You’ll likely need to delete that application and 
reinstall it. (Don’t forget to add each of the working Login Items back to 
the Login Items list!)
Step 8: Turn off your screen saver
This is a long shot, but it isn’t unheard of to discover that a faulty, bug-ridden 
screen saver has locked up your iMac. (If you aren’t running one of the Apple-
supplied screen savers and your computer never wakes up from Sleep mode 
or hangs while displaying the screen saver, you found your prime suspect.)
Open System Preferences, click Desktop & Screen Saver, click the Screen 
Saver button, and then either switch to an Apple screen saver or drag the Start 
slider to Never.
 
If this fixes the problem, you can probably remove the screen saver by delet-
ing the application in the Screen Savers folder inside your Mac OS X Library 
folder. If you can’t find the screen saver application, use Spotlight to search 
for it.
Step 9: Run System Profiler
Ouch. You reached Step 9, and you still haven’t uncovered the culprit. At this 
point, you narrowed the possibilities to a serious problem, like bad hard-
ware or corrupted files in your Mac OS X System Folder. Fortunately, Snow 

357
 Chapter 22: It Just. . .Sits. . .There
Leopard provides System Profiler, which displays real-time information on 
the hardware in your system. Click the Apple menu and choose About This 
Mac; then click More Info. Figure 22-5 illustrates a typical healthy result from 
one of the Hardware categories, Disc Burning. Click each one of the Hardware 
categories in turn, double-checking to make sure that everything looks okay.
 
You don’t have to understand all the technical hieroglyphics. If a Hardware 
category doesn’t return what you expect or displays an error message, 
though, that’s suspicious.

serial number (which you can display in System Profiler) and which version of 
Mac OS X you’re using.

Chapter 23
I Want to Add Stuff
In This Chapter
▶ Adding memory
▶ Upgrading your hard drive
▶ Adding USB and FireWire devices
▶ Reviewing what add-ons are available
“N
o iMac is an island.” Somebody famous wrote that, I’m sure.
Without getting too philosophical — or invoking the all-powerful Internet yet 
again — the old saying really does make sense. All computer owners usually 
add at least one peripheral (external device), such as a printer, backup drive, 
joystick, iPod, or scanner. I talk about the ports on your iMac in Chapter 1. 
Those holes aren’t there to just add visual interest to the back end of your 
treasured iMac. Therefore, I cover your USB and FireWire ports (and what 
you can plug in to them) in detail in this chapter.
Ah, but what about the stuff inside your aluminum supercomputer? That’s 
where things get both interesting and scary at the same time. In this chapter, 
I describe what you can add to the innards of your computer as well as how 
to get inside there if you work up the courage to go exploring. (Don’t tell your 
family or your friends, but adding memory to an aluminum iMac is as simple 
as loosening a screw and pulling on a plastic tab. There’s actually nothing to 
fear whatsoever.)
Here’s the trick: Just make it sound like an adventure from Mission: 
Impossible, and folks will crown you their new resident techno-wizard!

More Memory Will Help
Hey, wait a second. No however stuck on the end? You mean for once, there 
isn’t an exception? Aren’t all computers different? Hard as it is to believe, just 
keep in mind this Mark’s Maxim:
 
More memory helps.
Period. End of statement. No matter what type of computer you own, how old 
it is, or what operating system you use, adding more memory to your system 
(to the maximum it supports) significantly improves the performance of your 
operating system (and practically every application that you run).
 
Memory maximizes the power of your computer: The more memory you have, 
the less data your iMac has to temporarily store on its hard drive. Without get-
ting into virtual memory and other techno-gunk, just consider that extra 
memory as extra elbowroom for your applications and your documents. 
Believe me, both Mac OS X and Windows efficiently make use of every kilobyte 
of memory that you can provide.
Figuring out how much memory you have
To see how much memory you have in your computer, click the Apple menu 
(Ú) and choose About This Mac. Figure 23-1 shows the dialog.
 
The 4GB of memory supplied by Apple is plenty for running applications from 
the iLife and iWork suites as well as any of the applications bundled with Snow 
Leopard.
 
Figure 23-1: 
Find out 
how much 
memory 
your iMac 
has.
 

361
 Chapter 23: I Want to Add Stuff
At the time of this writing, the current crop of iMacs has sockets for four 
1066 MHz PC3-8500 DDR3 SDRAM memory modules. (Don’t fret over what 
those abbreviations mean. Rest assured that this memory type is fast.) Each 
module can range up to 4GB of memory, so you can install as much as 16GB 
of memory on your iMac.
How you plan memory upgrades depends on how much memory you want. 
If your iMac uses the two default 2GB modules supplied by Apple, you can 
add RAM by inserting memory modules in the empty slots. At the time of this 
writing, a 4GB memory module should set you back about $150 or so.
If your iMac already has all four memory slots filled and you’d still like to add 
more system RAM, it’s time to remove one or all of the existing modules and 
replace them with full 4GB modules. With all four slots filled with 4GB mod-
ules, you’ll have the coveted 16GB that marks you as one of the “In” People.
 
If your primary applications include video editing, game playing, or image edit-
ing, you can use all the memory your iMac can hold.
Unfortunately, Apple’s prices for RAM are . . . well . . . outrageous. (As in, 
“Boy, howdy, I can’t afford that!”) Therefore, I can heartily recommend any 
one of these online sources that cater to Mac owners:
 
✓ MacMall (www.macmall.com)
 
✓ CDW (www.cdw.com/content/brands/apple/default.aspx)
 
✓ Crucial (www.crucial.com)
 
✓ SmallDog (www.smalldog.com)
 
✓ Newegg (www.newegg.com)
Getting inside your iMac
Apple designed the world’s best all-in-one com-
puter. That even includes making it EZ-Open. 
(Forgive me if your treasured work of art now 
reminds you of a longneck beer bottle. Come 
to think of it, the level of technical knowledge 
required to gain access to either one is about 
the same.)
Unlike earlier “picture frame” iMac models, 
however, you can’t remove the back completely. 
In fact, Apple allows the owner of an iMac to 
perform only one kind of upgrade, and there’s 
only one opening you need to worry about. 
(Note: You’ll void your warranty by tinkering 
with anything other than your memory slots, so 
don’t even think about it.) Naturally, an Apple 
repair technician can get deeper into the 
machine, but I hope that you never need aid 
from those folks.

Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
Installing memory modules
I’m happy to report that adding extra memory to your system is one of the 
easiest internal upgrades that you can perform. Therefore, I recommend that 
you add memory yourself unless you simply don’t want to mess with your 
iMac’s internal organs. Your local Macintosh service specialist will be happy 
to install new RAM modules for you (for a price).
To add memory modules to an aluminum iMac, follow these steps:
 
1. Get ready to operate.
 
a. Spread a clean towel on a stable work surface, like your kitchen 
table. The towel helps protect your screen from scratches.
 
b. Find a Phillips screwdriver.
 
c. Shut down your iMac.
 
d. Unplug all cables from the computer.
 
2. Tilt the computer over and lay the screen flat (face-down) on top of 
the towel.
 
3. Loosen the screw at the bottom of the computer’s case.
 
 Apple thought of everything! There’s only one tiny screw, and you can’t 
lose said screw because it’s captive. It actually stays in the door, so 
don’t try to remove it completely.
 
4. Remove the RAM access door.
 
5. Stow the RAM access door safely out of reach of kids and cats.
Let’s get grounded!
Follow one cardinal rule when the unguarded 
insides of any computer are in easy reach: 
Always ground yourself before you touch any-
thing! Your body can carry enough static elec-
tricity to damage the RAM you’re installing or 
removing, and touching those modules without 
grounding yourself is an invitation for disaster.
Grounding yourself is easy to do: Just touch any 
metal surface around your work table, such as 
a chair leg or your local metal sink. After you 
ground yourself, you can then safely handle 
RAM chips that you remove (if any) as well as 
the new ones that you’re installing.
If you walk anywhere in the room — say, hunt-
ing for a screwdriver, or taking a sip of liquid 
reinforcement that you stashed a comfortable 
and safe distance away — you must ground 
yourself again before you get back to work. 
Remember: You can actually pick up a static 
charge by simply walking. Go figure.

363
 Chapter 23: I Want to Add Stuff
Tah-dah! That wasn’t much of a challenge, was it? Here’s your chance to gaze 
with rapt fascination at a small portion of the bare innards of your favorite 
computer.
 
1. Ground thyself!
 
 Check out the sidebar, “Let’s get grounded!”.
 
2. If you need to remove a module for your upgrade, untuck the tab over 
the existing module.
 
3. Gently pull on the tab to remove the module (as shown in Figure 23-2).
 
 Save the old module in the static-free packaging that held the new 
module. Your old RAM (which you can now sell on eBay) will be pro-
tected from static electricity.
 
4. Position the new module(s) in the socket(s).
 
a. Line up the module’s copper connectors toward the socket.
 
b. Line up the notch in the module aligned with the matching spacer in 
the socket. See what I mean in Figure 23-3.

ule’s tabs click into place on both ends of the socket.
 
6. Tuck any loose tabs back into the body of your iMac.
 
7. Replace the RAM access door, reversing Steps 3–5 of the preceding 
step list.
 
 Waxing nostalgic: This is rather like changing the oil on my Dad’s 1970 
Ford pickup truck.
Congratulations! You’ve done it — you’re now an iMac memory guru! To 
verify that all is well with your iMac, boot the computer and once again click 
the Apple menu and choose About This Mac. Your iMac should report the 
additional memory.
Can I Upgrade My Hard Drive?
Asking whether you can upgrade your hard drive is a trick question. Yes, 
you certainly can upgrade your hard drive. But before you start cruisin’ the 
Internet for a 2TB monster, though, I have two suggestions:

365
 Chapter 23: I Want to Add Stuff
 
✓ Be sure you really need a hard drive upgrade.
 
 Apple is pretty generous when configuring hard drive storage for its 
base systems. (Current models run with anywhere from a 500GB to a 
whopping 2TB drive — yep, that’s 2 terabytes, or 2,000GB! Something 
tells me that your prized walnut brownie recipe will have plenty of 
elbow room on a 2TB drive, as will a huge amount of digital video.)
 
 I’ll be honest here: Most folks simply don’t need more than 500GB of 
hard drive space. You’re likely to find that you still have plenty of wide 
open spaces for a typical family’s needs on your hard drive unless 
you’re heavily into
 
• Digital video (DV)
 
• Cutting-edge video games
 
• Tons of high-quality digital audio
 
• Four generations of high-resolution digital photos of your family 
(hey, it’s possible!)
 
✓ If you decide that you do need to upgrade, don’t install your internal 
hard drive yourself.
 
 Read more about this in the upcoming section, “Gotta have internal.”
 
If you’re short on hard drive space, clean up your existing hard drive by delet-
ing all the crud you don’t need, such as game and application demos, dupli-
cate or “work” copies of images and documents, archived files you 
downloaded from the Internet, and the contents of your Trash. You can read 
how in Chapter 24.
Consider your external options
If you do need additional hard drive space, I recommend using an external 
drive. Use a high-speed FireWire or USB port to connect a second hard drive 
the quick and easy way.
Most of today’s FireWire and USB peripherals don’t even require the driver 
software that Mac old-timers remember with such hatred. You simply plug 
in a FireWire or USB device, and it works. You can move your external drive 
between different Macs with a minimum of fuss and bother.
An external hard drive can do anything that your internal hard drive can do. 
You can boot from it, for example, or install a different version of Mac OS X 
(great for beta testers like me).

366
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
Apple’s Time Capsule unit is an external hard drive with a difference — it 
stores the huge Time Machine backup files created by the Macs running Snow 
Leopard on your network, and it uses a wireless connection to transfer data! 
(In fact, if you’re thinking of adding a wireless base station to your wired net-
work, your Time Capsule actually acts as a full AirPort Extreme base station, 
complete with USB port for connecting a USB printer.) At the time of this writ-
ing, Time Capsule is available with either a 1TB ($299) or 2TB ($499) drive.
 
Here’s one problem with external drives: Data transfers more slowly this way 
than via an internal drive (even with a FireWire 800 connection). That’s why 
most Mac owners use their external drives for storing backups and little-used 
documents and applications. Their favorite applications and often-used docu-
ments are housed on the internal drive.
Putting a port to work
An aluminum iMac carries two kinds of high-speed ports, either of which is a 
good match for connecting any external device.
USB 2.0
The USB standard is popular because it’s just as common in the PC world as 
in the Mac world. (Most PCs don’t have a FireWire port.) Your iMac carries 
its USB 2.0 ports on the back of the case. Hardware manufacturers can make 
one USB device that works on both types of computers.
 
I heartily recommend that you avoid using any USB 1.1 devices (except, per-
haps, a USB 1.1 modem, keyboard or mouse). USB 1.1 is very slow compared 
with the USB 2.0 standard although you can connect a USB 1.1 device to a USB 
2.0 port with no problem at all. You should buy only USB 2.0 external hard 
drives, CD/DVD recorders, or Flash drives. ’Nuff said.
FireWire 800
A FireWire 800 drive offers much better performance than either a FireWire 
400 or a USB 2.0 drive, and today’s FireWire 800 drives are getting cheaper 
every day. Your iMac proudly sports a FireWire 800 port on the back.
 
The physical FireWire 800 connector is shaped differently than an older 
FireWire 400 port, so don’t try to force the wrong connector into the wrong 
port!
Connecting an external drive
With FireWire or USB, you can install an external hard drive without opening 
your iMac’s case. With your iMac turned on and the external drive discon-
nected from the AC outlet, follow these steps:

367
 Chapter 23: I Want to Add Stuff
 
1. Connect the FireWire or USB cable betwixt the drive and your 
computer.
 
2. Plug the external drive into a convenient surge protector or UPS 
(uninterruptible power supply).
 
3. Switch on the external drive.
 
4. If the drive is unformatted (or formatted for use under Windows), 
partition and format the external drive.
 
 The drive comes with instructions or software for you to do this. (Don’t 
worry, external drives typically come from the factory completely 
empty, and you won’t damage anything by formatting it. To be sure, 
check the drive’s manual.) Partitioning divides the new drive into one 
(or more) volumes, each of which is displayed as a separate hard drive 
under Snow Leopard.
 
 If the drive comes preformatted for use with a Windows PC, I strongly 
suggest reformatting it for use with Mac OS X — this will result in faster 
performance and more efficient use of space.
After the drive is formatted and partitioned, it immediately appears on the 
Desktop. Shazam!
Gotta have internal
If you decide that you have to upgrade your existing internal hard drive — or 
if your internal drive fails and needs to be replaced — you must take your 
iMac to an authorized Apple service center and allow the techs there to sell 
you a drive and make the swap. Here are four darned good reasons why:
 
✓ Warranty: As I mention in the sidebar, “Getting inside your iMac,” you’re 
very likely to void your iMac’s warranty by attempting a drive upgrade 
yourself.
 
✓ Selection: If you’re worried about picking the proper drive, an Apple 
technician can order the right drive type and size for you . . . no worries.
 
✓ Difficulty: Swapping a hard drive in your iMac is nothing like adding 
RAM modules. It’s complex and involves breaking into your iMac — not 
A Good Thing, even for the knowledgeable Mac guru.
 
✓ Backup: That very same Apple service technician can back up all the 
data on your existing drive and move it to the new drive, saving you 
from losing a single document. That will save you time and possible 
angst.

368
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
To those who truly won’t be satisfied with their lives until they upgrade an 
internal drive in an iMac: Yes, I’m sure you can find a magazine article that 
purports to show you how. Even better, I’ve seen many how-to articles on the 
Web that will lead you down a rosy path to a hard drive upgrade. Here’s my 
take on those savvy instructions: You’re walking into a field of land mines with 
someone else’s map, so you had better have complete faith in your tech skills. 
(And a darn good backup.)
Attractive Add-Ons
The USB and FireWire toys I cover in this section might add a cord or two to 
your collection at the back of your iMac, but they’re well worth the invest-
ment. And they can really revolutionize how you look at technologies, such 
as television, digital audio, and computer gaming.
Game controllers
If you’re ready to take a shot at the enemy — whether they be Nazi soldiers, 
chittering aliens, or the latest jet fighters — you’ll likely find your keyboard 
and mouse somewhat lacking. (And if that enemy happens to be a friend of 
yours playing across the Internet, you’ll be ruthlessly mocked while you’re 
fumbling for the right key combination.) Instead, either pick up a USB joystick 
(for flying games) or a gamepad (for arcade and first-person shooting games)!
Video controllers
For armchair directors, specialized USB digital video controllers make editing 
easier. The ShuttleXpress from Contour Design (www.contourdesign.com) 
provides a five-button jog control that can be configured to match any DV 
editor. For around $40, you’ll have the same type of editing controller as do 
those dedicated video-editing stations that cost several thousand dollars.
Audio hardware
Ready to put GarageBand to the test with your favorite version of Chopsticks? 
You need a USB piano keyboard, and I recommend the Keystation 61es from 
M-Audio (www.m-audio.com), which retails for a mere $200. It provides 61 
keys and uses a USB connection.

Chapter 24
Tackling the Housekeeping
In This Chapter
▶ Cleaning unnecessary stuff off your hard drive
▶ Backing up your data
▶ Fixing permissions errors
▶ Automating tasks in Snow Leopard
▶ Updating Mac OS X automatically
N
othing runs better than a well-oiled machine, and your iMac is no 
exception. In this chapter, I demonstrate how you can make good use 
of every byte of storage space provided by your hard drive. 
With a little Snow Leopard maintenance, such as Time Machine (for back-
ing up and restoring your hard drive), and frequent scans of your hard drive 
for permissions errors, you can ensure that your iMac is performing as effi-
ciently as possible. Automator allows your iMac to perform tasks automati-
cally that used to require your attention. In addition, configuring Software 
Update to run automatically can allow you to live life free and easy, watching 
your favorite soaps and eating ice cream (or yogurt — your pick).
Cleaning Unseemly Data Deposits
Criminy! Where does all this stuff come from? Suddenly that spacious 500GB 
hard drive has 19GB left, and you start feeling pinched.
Before you consider buying a new internal or external hard drive (which you 
can read about in Chapter 23), take the smart step: “Sweep” your hard drive 
clean of unnecessary and space-hogging software.

370
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
Getting dirty (or, cleaning 
things the manual way)
If you’re willing to dig into your data a little, there’s no reason to buy addi-
tional software to help you clean up your hard drive. All you really need is 
the willpower to announce, “I simply don’t need this application any longer.” 
(And, sometimes, that’s tougher than it might seem.)
Unnecessary files and unneeded folders
Consider all the stuff that you probably don’t really need:
 
✓ Game demos and shareware that you no longer play (or even remember)
 
✓ Movie trailers and other QuickTime video files that have long since 
passed into obscurity
 
✓ Temporary files that you created and promptly forgot
 
✓ Log files that chronicle application installations and errors
 
✓ StuffIt archives that you downloaded and no longer covet
 
✓ iTunes music that no longer appeals to your ear
How hard is it to clean this stuff off your drive? Easier than you might think!
 
✓ You can easily delete files.
 
✓ You can get rid of at least the lion’s share of any application (often the 
whole application) by deleting its application folder that was created 
during the installation process.
Removing an application or file from your hard drive is usually two simple 
steps:
 
1. Display the file or application folder in a Finder window.
 
2. Delete the file or folder with one of these steps:
 
• Drag the icon to the Trash.
 
• Press Ô+Delete.
 
• Right-click the icon and choose Move to Trash.
 
• Select the icon and click the Delete button on the Finder toolbar (if 
you added one).
Truly, no big whoop.

371
 Chapter 24: Tackling the Housekeeping
 
Mac owners like you and me can once again feel superior to the Windows folks 
because most Mac OS X applications don’t need a separate, silly “uninstall” 
program. In fact, Macintosh software developers have always followed a 
simple general rule: All (or virtually all) of an application’s support data 
should reside in a single folder.
 
Don’t forget to actually empty the Trash, or you’ll wonder why you aren’t 
regaining any hard drive space. (Snow Leopard works hard to store the con-
tents of the Trash until you manually delete it, just in case you want to unde-
lete something.) To get rid of that stuff permanently and reclaim the space, 
do the following:
 
1. Click the Trash icon on the Dock and hold down the mouse button — 
or right-click — until the pop-up menu appears.
 
2. Choose Empty Trash.
Associated files in other folders
Some applications install files in different locations across your hard 
drive. (Applications in this category include the Microsoft Office suite and 
Photoshop.) How can you clear out these “orphan” files after you delete the 
application folder?
The process is a little more involved than deleting a single folder, but it’s still 
no big whoop. Here’s the procedure:
 
1. Click the Search text box in a Finder window.
 
 You can read more about Search and Finder windows in Chapter 7.
 
2. Type the name of the application in the Search text box.
 
 Figure 24-1 shows this search. I want to remove Toast Titanium, so I 
search for every file with the word toast in its name.
 
3. Decide which of these files belong to the to-be-deleted application. 
 
 Be sure that the files you choose to delete are part of the deleted appli-
cation. For example, a text file with the name Instructions on Making a 
Perfect Piece of Toast might not be part of Toast Titanium.
 
 Many associated files either
 
• Have the same icon as the parent application
 
• Are in the Preferences, Caches, or Application Support folders
 
4. In the Search Results window, click the associated file(s) that you 
want to delete and just drag them to the Trash.
 
 Don’t empty the Trash immediately after you delete these files. Wait a 
few hours or a day. That way, if you realize that you deleted a file that 
you truly need, you can easily restore it from the Trash.

Using a commercial cleanup tool
If you’d rather use a commercial application to help you clean up your hard 
drive, a number of them are available, but most are shareware applications 
that perform only one task. For example, Tidy Up! from Hyperbolic Software 
(www.hyperbolicsoftware.com) does one thing, but it does it well. It 
finds duplicate files on your hard drive, matching by criteria such as file-
name, size, and extension. It’s a good tool at $30.
For a truly comprehensive cleanup utility, I recommend Spring Cleaning, 
from Smith Micro Software (my.smithmicro.com), the same company that 
produces the archiving utility StuffIt. Spring Cleaning sells for $50. Not much 
crud squeaks by all those search routines, including duplicates, orphan pref-
erence files, and log files. Spring Cleaning even includes a separate feature 
called MacUninstaller that can help automate the steps that I cover in the 
preceding section.
Backing Up Your Treasure
Do it.
I’m not going to lecture you about backing up your hard drive . . . well, per-
haps just for a moment. Imagine what it feels like to lose everything — names, 
numbers, letters, reports, presentations, saved games, photographs, and 
music. Then ask yourself, “Self, isn’t all that irreplaceable stuff worth just a 
couple of hours every month?”

373
 Chapter 24: Tackling the Housekeeping
Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
 
Back up. On a regular basis. Then store those DVDs or that external backup 
device somewhere safe, away from calamities.
Take my word for it — you will thank me some day!
You can back up your files either by saving them to external media or by 
using Snow Leopard’s awesome Time Machine feature.
Saving Files
The simplest method of backing up files is simply to copy the files and fold-
ers to an external hard drive or a CD or DVD. Nothing fancy, but it works.
Backing up to an external hard drive
If you have an external hard drive on your iMac, you can easily drag backup 
files to it from your internal hard drive (I cover external hard drives in 
Chapter 23):
 
1. Open separate Finder windows for
 
• The external hard drive
 
• The internal hard drive
 
2. Select the desired files that you want to back up from your internal 
drive.
 
3. Drag the selected files to the external drive window.
Backing up to CD and DVD
You can burn backup files to a recordable CD or DVD.
Burning backups from the Finder
To use the Finder’s Burn feature with a CD or DVD, follow these steps:
 
1. Load a blank disc into your iMac’s optical drive.
 
 If you’re using the default settings in the CDs & DVDs pane in System 
Preferences, a dialog asks you for a disc name.

374
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
2. Into the disc’s Finder window, drag the files and folders that you want 
to back up.
 
 They can be organized any way you like. Don’t forget that the total 
amount of data shouldn’t exceed 4GB or so (on a standard recordable 
DVD) or 8GB (on a dual-layer recordable DVD). You can see how much 
free space remains on the disc at the bottom of the disc’s Finder window. 
 
3. Click File and then choose Burn Disc from the menu.
 
 You can also click the Burn button on the Recordable DVD bar — it 
appears at the top of the disc’s Finder window. 
 
4. Choose the fastest recording speed possible.
 
5. Click Burn.
Burning backups from other recording applications
If you’ve invested in Toast Titanium from Roxio (www.roxio.com) or 
another CD/DVD recording application, you can create a new disc layout to 
burn your backup disc. (Think of a layout as a “road map” indicating which 
files and folders Toast should store on the backup.)
 
You can save that disc layout and use it again. This simplifies the process of 
backing up the same files in the future (if you don’t move folders or files from 
their current spot).
Putting Things Right with Time Machine
If you enable backups via Snow Leopard’s Time Machine feature, you can 
literally move backward through the contents of your iMac’s hard drive, 
selecting and restoring all sorts of data. Files and folders are ridiculously 
easy to restore — and I mean easier than any restore you’ve ever performed, 
no matter what the operating system or backup program. Time Machine can 
even handle such deleted items as Address Book entries or photos you sent 
to the Trash from iPhoto!
Because Time Machine should be an important and integral part of every Mac 
owner’s existence, the Time Machine icon is included on the Dock. (Apple is 
not messing around!)
 
Apple’s Time Capsule device is designed as a wireless storage drive for your 
Time Machine backup files — if you’re interested in a single Time Machine 
backup location for multiple Macs across your wireless network, Time 
Capsule is a great addition to your home or office.

375
 Chapter 24: Tackling the Housekeeping
 
Before you can use Time Machine, it must be enabled within the Time 
Machine pane in System Preferences. I cover the Time Machine configuration 
settings (and how to turn the feature on) in more detail in Chapter 6. 
Here’s how you can turn back time, step by step, to restore a file that you 
deleted or replaced in a folder.
 
1. Open the folder that contained the file you want to restore.
 
2. In a separate window, open your Applications folder and launch the 
Time Machine application, or click the Time Machine icon on the 
Dock (which bears a clock with a counter-clockwise arrow).
 
 The oh-so-ultra-cool Time Machine background appears behind your 
folder, complete with its own set of buttons at the bottom of the screen 
(as shown in Figure 24-2). On the right, you see a timeline that corre-
sponds to the different days and months included in the backups that 
Snow Leopard has made.
 
3. Click within the timeline to jump directly to a date (displaying the 
folder’s contents on that date).
 
 Alternatively, use the Forward and Back arrows at the right to move 
through the folder’s contents through time. (You should see the faces 
of Windows users when you “riffle” through your folders to locate some-
thing you deleted several weeks ago!)
 
 The backup date of the items you’re viewing appears in the button bar 
at the bottom of the screen.
 
4. After you locate the file you want to restore, click it to select it.
 
5. Click the Restore button at the right side of the Time Machine button bar.
 
 If you want to restore all the contents of the folder, click the Restore All 
button instead.
Time Machine returns you to the Finder, with the newly restored file now 
appearing in the folder. Out-standing!
 
To restore specific data from your Address Book or images from iPhoto, 
launch the desired application first and then launch Time Machine. Instead 
of riffling through a Finder window, you can move through time within the 
application window.
For simple backup and restore protection, Time Machine is all that a typi-
cal Mac owner at home is likely to ever need. Therefore, a very easy Mark’s 
Maxim to predict:
 
Get an external hard drive, connect it and turn on Time Machine. Do it 
now. Don’t make a humongous mistake.

Maintaining Hard Drive Health
Shifty-eyed, sneaky, irritating little problems can bother your hard drive: per-
missions errors. Incorrect disk and file permissions can
 
✓ Make your iMac lock up
 
✓ Make applications act screwy (or refuse to run at all)
 
✓ Cause weird behavior within a Finder window or System Preferences
To keep Snow Leopard running at its best, I recommend that you fix permis-
sions errors at least once per week. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and then click Utilities.
 
2. Double-click the Disk Utility icon.
 
3. Click the volume at the left that you want to check. (Volume is just 
computer-speak for a named partition, like Macintosh HD, which 
appears under your physical hard drive.)
 
4. Click the Repair Disk Permissions button.
 
 Disk Utility does the rest and then displays a message about whatever it 
has to fix. (When will someone invent a car with a Repair Me button?)

Automating Those Mundane Chores
One popular feature in Snow Leopard — Automator — has generated a lot of 
excitement. You use Automator (as shown in Figure 24-3) to create custom-
ized tools that automate repetitive tasks.
 
Figure 24-3: 
Automator 
is a dream 
come true 
for those 
who hate 
repetitive 
tasks.
 
You can also create workflows, which are sequential (and repeatable) opera-
tions that are performed on the same files or data, and then your Automator 
application can automatically launch whatever applications are necessary to 
get the job done.
Here’s a great example: You work with a service bureau that sends you a CD 
every week with new product shots for your company’s marketing department. 
Unfortunately, these images are flat-out huge — taken with a 12-megapixel 
camera — and they’re always in the wrong orientation. Before you move them 
to the Marketing folder on your server, you have to use Preview to laboriously 
resize each image and rotate it, and then use the Finder window to save the 
smaller version.
With help from Automator, you can build a custom application that automati-
cally reads each image in the folder, resizes it, rotates it, generates a thumbnail 
image, prints the image, and then moves the massaged images to the proper 
folder. You’ll find Automator in your Applications folder. Currently, Automator 
can handle specific tasks within about 30 or 40 applications (including the 
Finder), but both Apple and third-party developers are busy adding new 
Automator task support to all sorts of new and existing applications.

Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
Creating an application in Automator
To create a simple application with Automator, launch the application and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select Custom and click Choose.
 
2. Click the desired item in the Library list.
 
 Automator displays the actions available for the item you’ve selected. 
Some of these items are media files, while others include Address Book 
contacts, files and folders in the Finder, PDF documents and even Apple 
Mail messages.
 
3. Drag the desired action from the Library pane to the workflow pane.
 
4. Modify any specific settings provided for the action you chose.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1–3 to complete the workflow.
 
6. Click Run (upper right) to test your application.
 
 Use sample files while you’re fine-tuning your application, lest you acci-
dentally do something deleterious to an original (and irreplaceable) file!
 
 Figure 24-4 illustrates an application that will take care of the earlier 
example — resizing and rotating a folder full of images, and then moving 
them to the Pictures folder.
 
7. When the application is working as you like, press Ô+Shift+S to save it.
 
Figure 24-4: 
Now you 
can handle 
10 or 1,000 
images in 
a folder 
— your 
application 
does the 
work!
 

379
 Chapter 24: Tackling the Housekeeping
 
8. In the Save As dialog that appears, type a name for your new 
application.
 
9. Click the Where pop-up menu and specify a location where the file 
should be saved.
 
10. Click the File Format pop-up menu and choose Application.
 
11. Click Save.
 
 Your new Automator application icon appears, sporting an Automator 
robot standing on a document.
 
 If you’re going to use your new Automator application often, you can 
drag the application icon to your Dock or to your desktop.
 
To find all the actions of a certain type within the Library list, click in the 
Search box at the bottom of the Library pane and type in a keyword, such as 
save or burn. You don’t even need to press Return!
Running applications at start up
If your Automator application should run every time you log in, follow these 
steps to set it up as a Login Item:
 
1. Open System Preferences.
 
2. Display the Accounts pane.
 
3. Click the Login Items button.
 
4. Click the plus button at the bottom of the list.
 
5. Navigate to the location of your new Automator application.
 
6. Click Add.
 
 Now your Automator application is really automatic. 
 
Many third-party applications have their own Automator actions. Check the 
developer’s Web site often to see whether additional Automator applications 
have been added that you can download.
Updating Mac OS X Automatically
I prefer my iMac to take care of cleaning up after itself, so updating Snow 
Leopard should be automatic as well. In Mac OS X Snow Leopard, operating 
system updates are performed by the Software Update application.

380
Part VI: The Necessary Evils: Troubleshooting, Upgrading, Maintaining 
 
Software Update uses the Internet, so you need an Internet connection to 
shake hands with the Apple server and download any updates.
Software Update can be found in two convenient spots:
 
✓ The Apple menu: Click the Apple menu (Ú) and then click Software 
Update, which displays the Update dialog and alerts you to anything 
new that’s available.
 
✓ System Preferences: Click the Software Update icon to display the 
Software Update pane that you see in Figure 24-5.
 
 If you take the System Preferences route, you can set Software Update to 
check for updates automatically:
 
a. Mark the Check for Updates check box to enable it.
 
b. Choose the time period from the Check for Updates pop-up menu.
 
 Software Update covers every Apple application, so I usually check once 
daily just to make sure that I don’t miss anything.
 
 If something needs to be updated, the program alerts you, either auto-
matically downloading the update(s) or displaying a dialog letting you 
know what you can update (depending on the settings you choose in the 
System Preferences Software Update pane).
You can even check for updates immediately from System Preferences. That, 
dear reader, is just plain thoughtful design.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
A
h, what book in the For Dummies series is truly com-
plete without the infamous Part of Tens? Here you 
find lots of this author’s raw opinion on things like tips for 
boosting your computer’s performance and Ten Things to

Ten Ways to Speed Up Your iMac
In This Chapter
▶ Adding memory
▶ Using spoken commands
▶ Defragmenting your drive
▶ Banishing the desktop background
▶ Using column mode
▶ Customizing the Dock
▶ Using keyboard shortcuts
▶ Customizing your Finder windows
▶ Launching recent applications and documents
▶ Using the Go menu
E
ven an iMac with an Intel Quad-Core i7 processor can always go just a 
bit faster . . . or can it? There’s actually a pretty short list of tweaks that 
you can apply to your iMac’s hardware to speed it up, and these suggestions 
are covered in this chapter.
You can also work considerably faster within Snow Leopard by customizing 
your Desktop and your Finder windows, which makes it easier to spot and use 
your files, folders, and applications. That’s in this Part of Tens chapter, too.
Finally, you can enhance your efficiency and make yourself a power user by 
tweaking yourself. (Sounds a bit tawdry or even painful, but bear with me, 
and you’ll understand.) 

384
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Nothing Works Like a Shot of Memory
Okay, maybe shot is the wrong word, but adding additional memory to your 
iMac (by either replacing or adding a memory module) is the single surefire 
way to speed up the performance of your entire system. That includes every 
application as well as Snow Leopard itself.
With more memory, your iMac can hold more of your documents and data in 
memory, and thus has to store less data temporarily on your hard drive. It 
takes your iMac much less time to store, retrieve, and work with data when 
that data is in RAM (short for random access memory) rather than on your 
hard drive. That’s why your system runs faster when you can fit an entire 
image in Photoshop in your iMac’s system memory.
Hold a Conversation with Your iMac
Many Mac owners will attest that you can significantly increase your own 
efficiency by using the Speakable Items feature, which allows you to speak 
common commands within applications and Finder windows. Your voice is 
indeed faster than either your mouse or your fingers! Common commands in 
the Speakable Items folder include “Log me out” and “Get my mail.”
To enable Speakable Items, choose System Preferences➪Speech and then 
select the On radio button next to Speakable Items to enable speech recogni-
tion. Remember, by default, that the speech recognition system is active only 
when you press and hold the Esc key.
Vamoose, Unwanted Fragments!
Apple would probably prefer that I not mention disk fragmentation because 
Snow Leopard doesn’t come with a built-in defragmenting application. (Go 
figure.) A disk-defragmenting application reads all the files on your drive and 
rewrites them as continuous, contiguous files, which your machine can read 
significantly faster.
To keep your hard drive running as speedily as possible, I recommend 
defragmenting at least once monthly. You can use third-party applications 
like Micromat’s TechTool Pro (www.micromat.com) to defragment your 
drive.

385
 Chapter 25: Ten Ways to Speed Up Your iMac
Keep Your Desktop Background Simple
It’s funny that I still include this tip in a chapter dedicated to improving per-
formance. After all, I recommended using a solid color background in my first 
books on Mac OS 8 and Windows 98! Just goes to show you that some things 
never change.
If you’re interested in running your system as fast as it will go, choose a 
solid-color background from the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System 
Preferences. (In fact, there’s even a separate category that you can pick 
called Solid Colors.)
Column Mode Is for Power Users
One of my favorite features of Mac OS X is the ability to display files and fold-
ers in column view mode. Just click the Column button in the standard Finder 
window toolbar, and the contents of the window automatically align in well-
ordered columns.
Other file display options require you to drill through several layers of fold-
ers to get to a specific location on your hard drive — for example, Users/
mark/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music, which I visit on a regular basis. In 
column mode, however, a single click drills a level deeper, and often you 
won’t even have to use the Finder window’s scroll bars to see what you’re 
looking for. Files and folders appear in a logical order. Plus, it’s much 
easier to move a file (by dragging it from one location on your hard drive to 
another) in column mode. 
Make the Dock Do Your Bidding
Just about every Mac owner considers the Mac OS X Dock a good friend. But 
when’s the last time you customized it — or have you ever made a change to 
it at all?
You can drag files and folders to the Dock, as well as Web URLs, applications, 
and network servers. You can also remove applications and Web URLs just as 
easily by dragging the icon from the Dock and releasing it on your Desktop. 

386
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
I find that I make a significant change to my Dock icons at least once every 
week. I find nothing more convenient than placing a folder for each of my cur-
rent projects on the Dock or adding applications to the Dock that I might be 
researching for a book or demonstrating in a chapter.
 
You can position the Dock at either side of the Desktop or even hide the Dock 
from sight entirely to give yourself an extra strip of space on your Desktop for 
application windows. 
It All Started with Keyboard Shortcuts
Heck, keyboard shortcuts have been around since the days of WordStar and 
VisiCalc, back when a mouse was still a living rodent. If you add up all those 
seconds of mouse-handling that you save by using keyboard shortcuts, you’ll 
see that you can save hours of productive time every year.
You’re likely already using some keyboard shortcuts, like the common edit-
ing shortcuts Ô+C (Copy) and Ô+V (Paste). When I’m learning a new applica-
tion, I often search through the application’s online help to find a keyboard 
shortcut table and then print out that table as a quick reference. Naturally, 
you can also view keyboard shortcuts by clicking each of the major menu 
groups within an application. Shortcuts are usually displayed alongside the 
corresponding menu items.
Hey, You Tweaked Your Finder!
Here’s another speed enhancer along the same lines as my earlier tip about 
customizing your Dock: You can also reconfigure your Finder windows to 
present you with just the tools and locations that you actually use (rather 
than what Apple figures you’ll use).
For example, you can right-click the toolbar in any Finder window and choose 
Customize Toolbar. By default, Snow Leopard’s Finder toolbar includes only 
the default icon set that you see at the bottom of the sheet, but you can drag 
and drop all sorts of useful command icons onto the toolbar. You can save 
space by displaying small-sized icons, too.
 
The Sidebar — which hangs out at the left side of the Finder window — is a 
healthy, no-nonsense repository for those locations that you constantly visit 
throughout a computing session. For example, I have both a Games folder and 
a Book Chapters folder that I use countless times every day — it’s important 
to balance work with pleasure, you know — and I’ve dragged both of those 
folders to the Sidebar. 

387
 Chapter 25: Ten Ways to Speed Up Your iMac
Keep in Touch with Your Recent Past
Click that Apple menu (Ú) and use that Recent Items menu! I know that 
sounds a little too simple, but I meet many new Apple computer owners every 
year who either don’t know that the Recent Items menu exists or forget to 
use it. You can access both applications and documents that you’ve used 
within the last few days. Consider the Dock and Finder Sidebar as permanent 
or semipermanent solutions, and the Recent Items menu as more of a tempo-
rary solution to finding the stuff that you’re working on right now.
Go Where the Going Is Good
To round out this Part of Tens chapter, I recommend another little-known 
(and under-appreciated) Finder menu feature (at least among Macintosh nov-
ices): the Go menu, which is located on the Finder menu.
The Go menu is really a catchall, combining the most important locations on 
your system (like your Home folder and your iDisk) with folders that you’ve 
used recently. Plus, the Go menu is the place where you can connect to serv-
ers or shared folders across your local network or across the Internet.
Pull down the Go menu today — and don’t forget to try out those spiffy key-
board shortcuts you see listed next to the command names. (For example, 
press Ô+Shift+H to immediately go to your Home folder.) And if a Finder 
window isn’t open at the moment, a new window opens automatically — such 
convenience is hard to resist!

f you’ve read other books that I’ve written in the For Dummies series, you 
might recognize the title of this chapter: It’s a favorite Part of Tens sub-
ject of mine that appears often in my work. I don’t like to see any computer 
owner fall prey to pitfalls. Some of these pitfalls are minor — like being less 
than diligent about keeping your iMac clean — but others are downright 
catastrophic, like providing valuable information over the Internet to persons 
unknown.
All these potential mistakes, however, share one thing in common: They’re 
easily prevented with a little common sense — as long as you’re aware of 
them. That’s my job. In this chapter, I fill in what you need to know. Consider 
these pages as experience gained easily!

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Man, That Is the Definition of Sluggish
Let’s see, what could I be talking about? Oh, yes . . . only a USB 1.1 external hard 
drive, Flash drive or CD-ROM drive could be as slow as a turtle on narcotics.
Unfortunately, you’ll still find countless examples of USB 1.1 storage hard-
ware hanging around. The auction site, eBay, is stuffed to the gills with USB 
1.1 hard drives. A USB 1.1 hard drive is simply a slow-as-maple-syrup-in-
January embarrassment. If a peripheral’s job is to store or move data quickly — 
I’m talking hard drives, network connections, CD-ROM drives, and USB Flash 
drives — opt for a USB 2.0 or FireWire device.
Phishing Is No Phun
Phishing refers to an attempt by unsavory characters to illegally obtain your 
personal information. If that sounds like an invitation to identity theft, it is — 
and thousands of sites have defrauded individuals like you and me (along with 
banks and credit card companies) out of billions of dollars.
A phishing scam works like this: You get an e-mail purporting to be from a 
major company or business, such as eBay, a government agency, a social net-
working site, or a major credit card company. The message warns you that 
you have to update your login or financial information to keep it current, or 
that you have to validate your information every so often — and even pro-
vides you with a link to an official-looking Web page (although sometimes full 
of spelling errors, and always with a bogus address). After you enter informa-
tion on that bogus page, it’s piped directly to the bad guys, and they’re off to 
the races.
Here’s a Mark’s Maxim that every Internet user should take to heart:
 
No legitimate company or agency will solicit your personal information 
through an e-mail message!
 
Never respond to these messages. Don’t use the link provided in the 
phishing e-mail! If you smell something phishy, open your Web browser and 
visit the company’s site (the real one) by typing in the address directly; then 
contact the company’s customer support department to report the scam. 
In fact, sending any valuable financial information through unencrypted 
e-mail — even to those whom you know and trust — is a bad idea. E-mail 
messages can be intercepted or can be read from any e-mail server that 
stores your message.

391
 Chapter 26: Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague
Put Floppy Disks to Rest
Did you know that the iMac was the first model produced by a major com-
puter manufacturer that didn’t include a floppy drive? Apple always looks 
ahead five years when it develops a new computer model, and the good folks 
in Cupertino accurately predicted the demise of the stodgy 1.44MB floppy 
disk. 
If you still need a portable storage bin of some sort to carry from computer 
to computer, I heartily recommend that you pick up a USB Flash drive. These 
drives hold anywhere from 2 to 256GB, and they work in any USB port. (And 
they’re downright warp-drive fast when compared with a floppy disk, espe-
cially the USB 2.0 variety.)
Do You Really Want a 
Submerged Keyboard?
Your answer should be an unequivocal “No!” — and that’s why everyone 
should make it a rule to keep all beverages well out of range of keyboards, 
speakers, mice, backup drives, and any other piece of external hardware. 
Especially when kids or cats are in close proximity to your iMac.
Cleaning up a hazardous soda spill is hard enough in the clear, but if that 
liquid comes in contact with your hardware, you’re likely to be visited with 
intermittent keyboard problems (or, in the worst-case scenario, a short in an 
external peripheral or your iMac’s motherboard).
Suffice it to say that 12 inches of open space can make the difference between 
a simple cleanup and an expensive replacement!
Don’t Use Antiquated Utility Software
If you’re using Snow Leopard you should upgrade your older utility pro-
grams. These older disk utility applications can actually do more damage 
than good to a hard drive under Mac OS X Snow Leopard. A number of 
things changed when Apple made the leap to Snow Leopard, including subtle 
changes to disk formats and memory management within applications. With 
an out-of-date utility, you could find yourself with corrupted data.

392
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Make sure that you diagnose and repair disk and file errors by using only a 
utility application that’s specifically designed to run in Snow Leopard, like 
TechTool Pro from Micromat (www.micromat.com). Your iMac’s hard drive 
will definitely thank you.
(Oh, and while you’re at it, don’t forget to check the manufacturer’s Web site 
for any updates to drivers or application software for your third-party exter-
nal hardware! ’Nuff said.)
Don’t Endorse Software Piracy
This one’s a real no-brainer — remember, Apple’s overall market share among 
worldwide computer users currently weighs in at little more than 12 percent. 
Software developers know this, and they have to expect (and receive) a return 
on their investment, or they’re going to find something more lucrative to do 
with their time. As a shareware author, I can attest to this fact firsthand.
An iMac is a great machine, and Snow Leopard is a great operating system, 
but even the best hardware and the sexiest desktop won’t make up for an 
absence of good applications. Pay for what you use, and everyone benefits.
Call It the Forbidden Account
You might never have encountered the root, or System Administrator, account 
within Mac OS X — and that’s always A Good Thing. Note that I’m not talking 
about a standard administrator (or admin) account here. Every iMac needs at 
least one admin account (in fact, it might be the only visible account on your 
computer), and any standard user account can be toggled between standard 
and admin status with no trouble at all (by another admin account).
The root account, though, is a different beast altogether, and that’s why it’s 
disabled by default. All Unix systems have a root account; because Snow 
Leopard is based on a Unix foundation, it has one, too. Anyone logging in 
with the root account can do anything on your system, including deleting or 
modifying files in the System folder (which no other account can access). 
Believe me: Deliberately formatting your hard drive is about the only thing 
worse than screwing up the files in your System folder.

393
 Chapter 26: Ten Things to Avoid Like the Plague
Luckily, no one can accidentally access the root/System Administrator 
account. In fact, you can’t assign the root account with System Preferences; 
you must use the Terminal application in Utilities (within your Applications 
folder). Unless an Apple support technician tells you to enable and use it, you 
should promptly forget that the root account even exists.
Don’t Settle for a Surge Suppressor
Technically, there’s nothing wrong with using a surge suppressor to feed power 
to your iMac and all your external peripherals, but it doesn’t do the entire job. 
Your system is still wide open to problems caused by momentary brownouts, 
not to mention the occasional full-fledged blackout. Losing power in the middle 
of a computing session will likely lead to lost documents and might even result in 
disk or file errors later. With an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), you can rest 
easy knowing that your iMac will have a few minutes more of “ilife.”
Most Mac owners know about the backup battery power that a UPS provides, 
but they don’t know about the extra work performed by most UPS units: 
namely, filtering your AC current. A filtering UPS prevents electronic noise 
(think about a vacuum being used next to a TV set) and momentary current 
spikes. These days, you’ll find good UPS models for under $100.
Refurbished Hardware Is No Deal at All
Boy, howdy, do I hate refurbished stuff. To quote someone famous, “If the 
deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”
Examine what you get when you buy a refurbished external hard drive. 
It’s likely that the drive was returned as defective, of course, and was then 
sent back to the factory. There, the manufacturer probably performed the 
most cursory of repairs, perhaps tested the unit for a few seconds, and then 
packed it back up again. (I should, however, note that Apple sells refurbished 
Macs, and generally has a good reputation for value on these computers.)
 
Before you spend a dime on a bargain that’s remanufactured — I can’t get 
over that term — make sure that you find out how long a warranty you’ll 
receive, if any. 
If at all possible, I recommend spending the extra cash on trouble-free, brand-
new hardware that has a full warranty.

394
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
iMacs Appreciate Cleanliness
Clean your machine. Even though your iMac has a fan, dust is an insidious 
enemy within the confines of your computer’s case. I know Mac owners who 
celebrate each passing year by opening up their machines to blow them 
clean of dust bunnies with a can of compressed air. (I’m one of them, as a 
matter of fact.)
 
If you’re adding memory to your aluminum iMac, as I demonstrate in Chapter 23, 
take advantage of the chance and use that trusty can of compressed air to 
clean up.
Your screen should be cleaned at least once every two or three days. Never 
spray anything — cleaners, water, anything! — directly on your screen or 
your iMac’s case. I highly recommend using premoistened LCD cleaning 
wipes to safely clean your iMac monitor.
Your iMac case needs only a thorough wiping job with a soft cloth should 
stay spotless. Don’t forget to turn off your Aluminum Supercomputer.
