Registry Hives
A hive is a logical group of keys, subkeys, and 
values in the registry that has a set of supporting 
files loaded into memory when the operating 
system is started or a user logs in.

Myth
They are not the same. Hives always have corresponding files 
on disk.
Some root keys are links to other parts of the registry and do 
not have corresponding files.
Four of the hives are subkeys of HKLM
REGISTRY ROOT KEYS ARE THE 
SAME AS HIVES
