Preface to the sixth edition
When we began this revision in 2019, the price of copper was $2.60/lb. As we com-
plete it today, the price is $4.38/lb. By the time you read these words, it may be back
down to $2.60 again! Regardless, it has been some time since there was so much interest
in the availability and technology of copper supply. The long-term prospects for the
industry appear to be bright, and prospectors are scouring the globe for ore, from
mountaintops in the Andes to the bottom of the oceans. The lists of top-producing mines
and smelters in this book demonstrate the increase in capacity of the industry from our
previous edition.
Technology advances in the industry over the previous decade have been largely
evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The most signiﬁcant developments include the
following:
•
the adoption of Chinese bottom-blown and side-blown bath smelting and converting
technology;
•
the creation of ﬂowsheets for handling increasingly complex ores and concentrates;
•
improved technology for processing high-strength off-gases;
•
higher current densities in electroreﬁning and electrowinning practice.
Other things have not changed. The PeirceeSmith converter is still the primary
means of producing blister copper; ﬂash furnaces are still being commissioned for
concentrate smelting, and casting processes are still largely the same. Some technologies
have more value than previously thought!
There has also been a change in the creative team behind this book. Matt King has
decided to ﬁnd other uses for his nights and weekends; in his place, we welcome to
the group Dr. Gerardo Alvear Flores, currently based in Singapore. Gerardo has vast
experience in the copper industry, which has taken him over his career to multiple con-
tinents and production facilities, and his experience will enhance our efforts and improve
our direction.
As with previous efforts, this edition of Extractive Metallurgy of Copper is largely a
product of the copper industry as a whole, since so many engineers and scientists
volunteered their time and expertise (along with photographs and drawings) to make
sure we got it right. Our guides included

CHAPTER 1
Overview
1.1 Introduction
Copper is most commonly present in the earth’s crust as coppereironesulﬁde and
copper sulﬁde minerals, primarily chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and chalcocite (CuS2). The
concentration of these minerals in a mine is low. Typical copper ores contain from
0.3% Cu (open pit mines, Fig. 1.1) to 1.7% Cu (underground mines, Fig. 1.2). The
rest is noneconomic rock. Pure copper metal is mostly produced from these ores by
concentration, smelting, and reﬁning (Fig. 1.3).
Copper also occurs to a lesser extent in oxidized minerals (carbonates, oxides,
hydroxysilicates, sulfates). Copper metal is usually produced from these minerals by
leaching, solvent extraction, and electrowinning (Fig. 1.4). These processes are also
used to treat chalcocite (Cu2S).

The shovel is placing blasted ore in the truck from where it will go to processing. The water truck is
suppressing dust. The front-end loader is cleaning up around the shovel. The shovel is electric. Its insu-
lated power wire mostly lies on the surface except over the wire bridge under which all vehicles travel
to and from the shovel. (Photograph courtesy of FreeporteMcMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.).

A third major source of copper is scrap copper and copper alloys. Yearly production of
copper from recycled used objects is 15%e20% of mine production. In addition, there
is considerable remelting and reﬁning of scrap generated during fabrication and manu-
facture. Total copper production in 2018 (mined and from end-of-use scrap) was 25
million tonnes.
This chapter introduces the principal processes by which pure copper is extracted
from ore and scrap. It also indicates the relative industrial importance of each. Finally,
it discusses worker safetydbecause it is so important.
1.2 Oreerock differentiation in the mine
A mine consists of regions of economic ore and regions of noneconomic rock, e.g.,
quartz and feldspar (Berger et al., 2008). These regions are located by drilling, sampling,
and analyzing the drill core for Cu. Where possible the noneconomic rock is not mined.
When the mine can only be developed by mining intertwined ore and rock, the ore is
sent to copper production and the rock goes to waste heaps. The material at the ore/rock
boundary is carefully sampled and analyzed to ensure that ore is not mistakenly sent to
the waste rock heaps.
Figure 1.2 Underground mining operation. Underground mine showing wheeled mining machine.
The drills on the right end of the vehicle are drilling up into the ore body. The drilled holes are
subsequently ﬁlled with explosive which, when detonated, break the ore and drop the ore pieces
onto the mine ﬂoor. The ore pieces are then elevated to the mine surface where they are crushed
and sent to processing. A new mine in Arizona contains w1.5% Cu, 0.04% Mo in chalcopyrite and
molybdenite minerals. w120 kilotonnes per day of this ore will be mined w2300 m below ground
level. About one-fourth of the world’s mined copper is obtained by underground mining; the
remainder is by surface mining. (Purchased from Roslyn Budd: www.buddphotography.com.au).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

1.3 Extracting copper from coppereironesulﬁde ores
About 80% of the world’s mined copper originates in chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) ores.
Chalcopyrite is extremely difﬁcult to dissolve in aqueous solutions, so the vast majority
of copper extraction from these ores is pyrometallurgical. Extraction by this approach
entails
(a) isolating the ore’s CueFeeS and CueS mineral particles in a concentrate by froth
ﬂotation
(b) smelting this concentrate to molten high-Cu sulﬁde matte
(c) converting (oxidizing) this molten matte to impure molten blister copper
(d) ﬁre- and electroreﬁning this impure copper to ultrapure copper.
Increasingly, smelting and converting are being combined, especially in China.
1.3.1 Concentration by froth ﬂotation
Copper ores being mined in 2020 are far too dilute in Cu (0.3%e1.7%) to be smelted
directly. Heating and melting their huge quantity of waste rock would require
prohibitive amounts of fuel. The rock would also produce impossibly large amounts
of molten oxide slag. Fortunately, the ore’s CueFeeS and CueS minerals can be
isolated by physical means into high-Cu concentrate, which can then be smelted
economically.
The most effective method of isolating the Cu minerals is froth ﬂotation. This process
causes small CueFeeS and CueS mineral particles to become attached to air bubbles
rising through a ﬁnely ground ore slurry (Fig. 1.5). Selectivity of ﬂotation is created by

Figure 1.5 Schematic view of ﬂotation cell. Reagents cause CueFe sulﬁde and Cu sulﬁde minerals in
the ore to attach to rising air bubbles, which are then collected in a short-lived froth. This froth is
dewatered to become concentrate. The unﬂoated waste passes through several cells before being dis-
carded as a ﬁnal tailing. Many types and sizes (up to 300 m3) of cell are used (Chapter 3).

using chemical reagents (collectors) that make the Cu minerals water-repellent while
leaving waste minerals covered by water (i.e., wetted).
This water repellency causes Cu mineral particles to attach to the ﬂotation cell’s rising
bubbles while the other mineral particles remain unﬂoated. The ﬂoated minerals overﬂow
the cell in a froth that, when dewatered, becomes w25% Cu concentrate. The low-Cu
waste rock particles underﬂow the cell. They are dewatered and sent to tailing ponds.
Flotation is preceded by crushing and grinding the mined Cu ore to small (w100 mm
diameter) particles. Its use has led to adoption of smelting processes that efﬁciently smelt
ﬁnely ground solids.
A video of mining and mineral processing may be seen in The Mining Process at Copper
Mountain Mine. This mine produces 30,000 tonnes of ore and 160,000 tonnes of waste
rock per day.
1.3.2 Matte smelting
Matte smelting oxidizes and melts ﬂotation concentrate in a large, hot (1250C)
furnace (Figs. 1.3 and 1.6). The objective of the smelting is to oxidize S and Fe from
the CueFeeS concentrate to produce an intermediate Cu-enriched molten sulﬁde
matte. The oxidant is oxygen-enriched air. Example reactions are

Simultaneously, the iron oxide is ﬂuxed with quartz to give a low melting point
molten slag. A representative reaction is
1220 °C
30 °C
1250 °C

iron oxide                     in rock and
molten slag
quartz flux
(1.2)
The concentrate’s gangue (waste rock) minerals also dissolve in the molten slag.
Reactions (1.1) and (1.2) are both exothermic; they supply most of the smelting
process’s heat requirement.
The products of smelting are (a) molten sulﬁde matte (55%e70% Cu) containing
most of the Cu in the concentrate and (b) molten oxide slag with as little Cu as possible.
The molten matte is subsequently converted (oxidized) in a converting furnace to form
impure molten copper. The slag is treated for Cu recovery, then discarded or sold
(Chapter 10).
SO2-bearing offgas (10e60 volume% SO2, remainder mostly N2) is also produced.
SO2 is harmful to ﬂora and fauna, so it must be removed before the offgas is released
to the atmosphere. This is done by capturing the SO2 as sulfuric acid (Chapter 11).
Matte smelting is mostly done in ﬂash furnaces (Fig. 1.6). It is also done in top lance
and submerged tuyere furnaces (Chapter 6). Three smelters smelt Cu-rich concentrate
directly to molten copper (Chapter 10). This is unusual because single-furnace smelting
with normal (25% Cu) concentrate produces too much high-Cu slag.
1.3.3 Converting
Copper converting is oxidizing the intermediate molten matte from smelting with air or
oxygen-enriched air. It removes Fe and S from the matte to produce crude (99% Cu)
molten copper. This molten copper is subsequently sent to ﬁre- and electroreﬁning.
Most converting is done in cylindrical PeirceeSmith converters (Fig. 1.7a), but newer
continuous converting processes are eating into this dominance (Chapter 8).
1.3.3.1 PeirceeSmith converting
PeirceeSmith converting entails pouring large ladles of molten smelting furnace matte
(1220C) into a cylindrical converter through a large central mouth (Fig. 1.7b). The
oxidizing oxygen-enriched air blast is then started and the converter is rolled, forcing
the blast into the molten matte through a row of tuyeres along the length of the vessel.
The heat generated in the converter by Fe and S oxidation is sufﬁcient to make the
process autothermal.
Overview

The converting takes place in two sequential stages:
(a) the FeS elimination or slag-forming stage:
1220 °C              30 °C            30 °C
1200 °C
1200 °C
2 FeS( )   +   3 O2(g)   +   SiO2(s)     →     Fe2SiO4( )   +   2 SO2(g)   +   heat
in molten matte  in air blast    in quartz flux             molten slag       in offgas
(1.3)
Figure 1.7a PeirceeSmith converter for producing molten “blister” copper from molten CueFeeS
matte. Typical production rates are 200e600 tonnes of copper per day. Oxygen-enriched air or air
“blast” is blown into the matte through submerged tuyeres. Silica ﬂux is added through the converter
mouth or by air gun through an endwall. Offgas is collected by means of a hood above the converter
mouth. (From Chapter 2.1 - Copper Production in Treatise on Process Metallurgy, Volume 3: Industrial
Processes, 1st Edition, Copyright Elsevier 2013 Pages 534e624).

(b) the copper-making stage:

molten matte   in air blast     impure molten     in offgas
'blister' copper
(1.4)
Copper making (b) occurs only after the matte contains less than about 1% Fe, so that
most of the Fe can be removed from the converter (in slag) before copper production
begins. Likewise, signiﬁcant oxidation of copper does not occur until the sulfur content
of the copper falls below w0.02%. Blowing is terminated near this sulfur end point. The
resulting molten blister copper (1200C) is poured out and sent to reﬁning, whereupon
the converter is reﬁlled with molten matte and the process starts again.
Because conditions in the converter are strongly oxidizing and agitated, Peircee
Smith converter slag inevitably contains 4%e8% Cu. This Cu is recovered by settling
and/or ambient temperature froth ﬂotation. The resulting low-Cu slag is then discarded
or sold (Chapters 10 and 20).
SO2, 8e12 vol.% in the converter offgas, is a byproduct of both converting reactions.
It is combined with smelting furnace gas and captured as sulfuric acid. There is, however,
some leakage of SO2(g) into the atmosphere during charging and pouring. This problem
is encouraging development of continuous converting processes. The most prominent of
these is ﬂash converting (Chapter 8).
1.3.4 Direct-to-copper smelting
Smelting and converting are sequential steps in oxidizing CueFeeS concentrates to
metallic copper. It would seem natural that these two steps should be combined to
produce blister copper directly in one furnace. It would also seem natural that this should
be done continuously rather than batchwise.
In 2020, blister copper is made in a single furnace at only three placesdOlympic Dam,
Australia; Glogow, Poland; and Chingola, Zambiadall using a ﬂash furnace. The strong
oxidizing conditions in a direct-to-copper furnace produce a slag with 14%e24%
oxidized Cu. The expense of reducing this dissolved Cu back to copper metal has so
far restricted the process to low-Fe concentrates, which produce little slag.
Continuous smelting/converting, even in more than one furnace, has energy, SO2
collection, and cost advantages. Metso Outotec ﬂash, Mitsubishi lance, and Noranda sub-
merged-tuyere smelting/converting all use this approach, described in Chapter 6 through
Chapter 8.

1.3.5 Fire reﬁning and electroreﬁning of blister copper
The blister copper from the above processing is electrochemically reﬁned to high-purity
cathode copper. This ﬁnal copper contains less than 20 ppm undesirable impurities. It is
suitable for electrical and almost all other uses.
Electroreﬁning requires strong, thin, ﬂat anodes to interleave with cathodes in an
electroreﬁning cell, Fig. 1.8. These anodes are produced by (a) sequential air oxidation
then natural gas reduction of blister copper then (b) casting the resulting ﬁre-reﬁned copper
in open, anode-shape molds (Figs. 12.2 and 12.3.).
Copper electroreﬁning entails
(a) electrochemically
dissolving
copper
from
ﬁre-reﬁned
anodes
into
CuSO4eH2SO4eH2O electrolyte
(b) electrochemically plating pure copper (without the anode impurities) from the elec-
trolyte onto stainless-steel cathodes by passing DC electrical current through the
electrolyte between anodes and cathodes.
Copper is deposited on the cathodes for 7e14 days. The cathodes are then removed
from the cell. The copper is stripped, washed, and (a) sold or (b) melted and cast into use-
ful products.
The electrolyte is an aqueous solution of H2SO4 (150e200 kg/m3) and CuSO4
(40e50 kg Cu/m3). In use, it also contains impurities and trace amounts of chloride
and organic addition agents, Section 14.5.1.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Many anode impurities are insoluble in this electrolyte (Au, Pb, Pt metals, Sn). They
do not interfere with the electroreﬁning. They are collected as solid slimes and treated for
Cu and byproduct recovery, Chapter 20.
Other impurities, such as As, Bi, Fe, Ni, and Sb, are partially or fully soluble.
Fortunately, they do not plate with the copper at the low voltage of the electroreﬁning
cell (w0.3 V). They must, however, be kept from accumulating in the electrolyte to
avoid physical contamination of the cathode copper. This is done by continuously
bleeding part of the electrolyte through a puriﬁcation circuit.
An older form of the process is to plate cathode copper onto thin pure copper sheets.
In this case the entire cathode is lifted from the cell, washed, and sent to users.
1.4 Hydrometallurgical extraction of copper
About 80% of copper from ore is produced by ﬂotation, smelting, and reﬁning. The
remaining 20% is produced hydrometallurgically. Hydrometallurgical extraction entails
(Fig. 1.3)
(a) sulfuric acid leaching of Cu from broken or crushed ore to produce impure
Cu-bearing aqueous solution
(b) transfer of Cu from the resulting weak, impure solution to pure, high-Cu-strength
electrolyte via solvent extraction
(c) electrodepositing pure cathode copper sheets from this pure electrolyte
The ores most commonly treated this way are (a) naturally oxidized Cu minerals,
including carbonates, hydroxy-silicates, sulfates, and (b) chalcocite, Cu2S.
The leaching is mostly done by dripping dilute sulfuric acid (w10 kg H2SO4 per m3
of solution) onto a layer of broken or crushed ore (0.3%e2.3% Cu) and allowing the acid
to trickle through to collection ponds, Figs. 1.4 and 1.5. Several months of leaching are
required for efﬁcient Cu extraction from the ore.
After this ﬁrst extraction another layer of ore is placed on top of the leached layer and
the process is repeated and so on.
Oxidized minerals are dissolved by the sulfuric acid by reactions like
CuO(s) 
+   H2SO4( )     →   
Cu2+(aq) +   
2–
4
SO
(aq)   +   H2O( )

(1.5)
Sulﬁde minerals, on the other hand, require oxidation, schematically:
bacterial enzyme catalyst
Cu2S(s)   +   2.5O2(g)   +   H2SO4( )
→ 
2Cu2+(aq)  +  2
2–
4
SO
(aq) +  H2O( )
in ore
in air
in sulfuric acid

(1.6)
As indicated, sulﬁde leaching is greatly speeded up by bacterial action (Chapter 15).
Overview
11

Leaching is occasionally applied to Cu-bearing ﬂotation tailings, mine wastes, old
mines, and fractured ore bodies. However, leaching of ore heaps is far and away the
largest hydrometallurgical Cu extraction technique.
1.4.1 Solvent extraction
The solutions from heap leaching contain w3 g/L of Cu and w3 g/L of H2SO4 plus
dissolved impurities, such as Fe and Mn. These solutions are too dilute in Cu and too
impure for direct electrodeposition of pure copper metal. The Cu must be transferred
to pure, high-Cu electrolyte to make pure copper.
The transfer is achieved by
(a) extracting Cu from an impure leach solution into a Cu-speciﬁc liquid organic
extractant
(b) separating by gravity the Cu-loaded extractant from the Cu-depleted leach solution
(c) stripping Cu from the loaded extractant into 180 g/L H2SO4 electrolyte.
Extraction and stripping are carried out in large mixer-settlers, Fig. 1.9.
The solvent extraction process is represented by the reaction:
30 °C

Figure 1.9 Schematic view of solvent extraction mixer-settler for extracting Cu from pregnant leach
solution into organic extractant. The Cu-loaded organic phase goes forward to another mixer/setter
(“stripper”) where Cu is stripped from the organic into pure, strongly acidic, high-Cu electrolyte for
electrowinning. The process is continuous.
12
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

This shows that a low-acid (i.e., low H⁺) aqueous phase causes the organic extractant
to load with Cu (as R2Cu). It also shows that a strong acid solution causes the organic to
unload (i.e., strip).
Thus, when organic extractant is contacted with weak acid pregnant leach solution
[step (a) above], Cu is loaded into the organic phase. Then when the organic phase is
subsequently put into contact with high (w180 g/L) H2SO4 electrolyte [step
(c) above], the Cu is stripped from the organic into the electrolyte at high Cu2⁺ strength,
suitable for electrowinning.
The extractants complex with considerable Cu but almost no impurities. They pro-
duce electrolytes that are strong in Cu (w50 g/L) but dilute in impurities.
1.4.2 Electrowinning
The Cu in the above electrolytes is mostly recovered by electrodepositing pure metallic
copper onto stainless-steel cathodes, Fig. 1.10. Electrowinning is similar to electroreﬁn-
ing except that the anode is inert, almost always 99% Pb alloy.

They typically contain <20 parts per million impurities. Note the polymer side stripsdthey prevent

As with electroreﬁning, the copper is plated on the cathode by passing DC current
through the electrolyte between anodes and cathodes. About 2 V is required.
Pure metallic copper (less than 20 ppm undesirable impurities) is plated on the
cathode. Oxygen gas is evolved at the anode.
A recent development is the use of precious metal-coated titanium cathodes, which
lowers electrowinning energy consumption.
1.5 Melting and casting cathode copper
The ﬁrst steps in making products from electroreﬁned and electrowon copper are melting
and casting, Fig. 1.11. The melting is almost always done in vertical shaft furnaces,
Fig. 19.2. The copper cathode sheets are charged to the top of the furnace. They descend
into the furnace and are melted by ascending hot combustion gases. Low-sulfur fuels pre-
vent sulfur pickup. Reducing ﬂames prevent excessive oxygen pickup.
The molten copper is mostly cast in continuous casting machines from where it goes
to rolling or extrusion then manufacturing. An especially important combination is
continuous bar casting/rod rolling, Chapter 19.
1.5.1 Types of copper product
The copper described above is Grade 1 copper. It contains w0.025% oxygen and the
cathode impurities. It is the most common type of primary copper product.
A second type is oxygen-free copper (<5 ppm O). It is used for highly demanding
applications, such as high-end audio equipment. It is made from cathode copper by
electric induction melting with added pure graphite for removing O as CO(g).
About 35% of copper is used in alloy form as brasses, bronzes, etc. Much of the copper
for these alloys comes from recycle scrap.
1.6 Recycle of copper and copper alloy scrap

amounts
to
15%e20%
of
the
above-described
copper-from-mine
production
(International Copper Study Group, 2020).

scrap is usually smelted in shaft furnaces but other furnaces (e.g., electric) are also used.
Overview
15

Processing and manufacturing also produce copper and alloy scrap, called new scrap.
Most of this scrap is easily recovered by internal recycle.
Production of copper from scrap (a) requires considerably less energy than mining and
processing of copper ore; (b) minimizes carbon emissions; (c) avoids mine, concentrator,
leach, and smelter wastes; and (d) helps to ensure the availability of copper for future
generations.
The treatment given to copper scrap depends on its purity, Fig. 1.10. The lowest
grade scrap is smelted and reﬁned like concentrate in primary or secondary (scrap)
smelters/reﬁneries. Higher-grade scrap is ﬁre-reﬁned then electroreﬁned. The highest-
grade scrap (mainly manufacturing waste) is often melted and cast without reﬁning. Its
copper is used for nonelectrical products, including tube, sheet, and alloys.
Alloy scrap (brass, bronze) is melted and cast as alloy. There is no advantage to sepa-
rating it into pure metals. Some slagging is done during melting to remove dirt and other
contaminants. The product alloy composition is adjusted by combining alloy and
individual metal scrap as needed.
1.7 Safety
Of paramount concern in copper miningemanufacturing operations is safety (Mathis &
Galloway, 2016). A safe working environment is fostered by
(a) setting an accident-free workplace as a primary goal
(b) close attention to safety by management, even in tough economic times
(c) inclusion of safety considerations during design and construction
(d) thorough worker safety training with regular updates
(e) mandatory wearing of safety apparel, such as steel-toed boots and hard hats
(f) effective lighting in all work areas, especially underground
(g) thorough maintenance and hazard identiﬁcation/elimination
(h) thorough investigation of any accident or near-miss and resolution of any indicated
problems
(i) “stay safe” discussions before every work shift
(j) personal responsibility for safety
(k) three-point contact when ascending or descending stairs and ladders.
Detailed safety concerns in various segments of copper making (e.g., smelting)
are presented in later chapters. Safety excellence is detailed in STEPS to Safety Culture
Excellence (Mathis & Galloway, 2013).
1.8 Environment
Production of pure metallic copper from mineral deposits (mines) involves many steps,
including mining, concentration, smelting, leaching, and electroreﬁning or electro-
winning, as well as land and water transportation.
16
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Mining raises dust during blasting and trucking. It also alters the landscape by
removing material from the surface and dumping waste rock in piles around the mine.
Concentration raises dust during crushing and produces small-particle tailings waste
during concentration. Most concentrators minimize water use and contamination by
recycling as much water as possible from the tailing ponds.
Smelting produces SO2-bearing offgas. Fortunately, processes have been developed
to capture this SO2(g) and make it into sulfuric acid, itself a valuable product. Smelters
also produce solidiﬁed oxide slag which, in some locations, is a valuable abrasive and
cement-making raw material.
Heap leaching alters the landscape by placing ore on the earth’s surface and acid
leaching it in the open. Extreme caution must be taken to prevent the acid from reaching
the water table.
Electroreﬁning and electrowinning are contained in buildings, so their impact on the
environment is not large. Generation of sulfuric acid mist above the electrolytic cells can
adversely affect the working environment. Covering the cells and providing effective
extraction fans ameliorates this problem. Well-designed workplace clothing and
equipment are also essential. An important example is ﬁltered breathing equipment for
employees. These issues are discussed in depth in their speciﬁc chapters.
Beyond legal requirements, an important goal of the copper industry is to produce
pure copper while minimizing deleterious effects on the environment. In 2020, this is
a top goal of copper management and employees. Post-mine-life landscape rehabilitation
is an important part of attaining this goal. Several videos describe rehabilitation (Hanson,
2016; Munsey, 2015; Teck Resources Limited, 2016).
1.9 Summary
About 80% of the world’s primary copper is produced by concentration, smelting, and
reﬁning of sulﬁde ores. The other 20% is produced by heap leaching, solvent extraction,
and electrowinning of oxidized and chalcocite ores. Secondary copper production from
recycled end-of-use objects is 15%e20% of primary copper production (ICSG, 2018).
Electrochemical processing is always used to produce high-purity copper: electro-
reﬁning in the case of pyrometallurgical extraction and electrowinning in the case of
hydrometallurgical extraction. The principal ﬁnal copper product is Grade 1 copper
(w250 ppm oxygen and <20 ppm unwanted impurities). It is suitable for nearly all uses.
The trend in copper extraction is toward processes that do not harm the environment
and consume less energy and water. This has led to
(a) energy- and pollution-efﬁcient oxygen-enriched smelting
(b) efﬁcient recovery of SO2(g) from smelter offgas as sulfuric acid
(c) leachingsolvent extractionelectrowinning ﬂowsheets
(d) increased water recycle
(e) increased recycle of end-of-use scrap
(f) reclamation of end-of-life mines and hydrometallurgical leach sites.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

CHAPTER 2
Production and use
Metallic copper occasionally occurs in nature. For this reason, it has been known to man
since about 10,000 B.C. (Copper Development Association, 2020). Its early uses were in
jewelry, utensils, tools, and weapons. Although its use gradually increased over the years,
it was only in the 20th century, with the global adoption of electricity, that copper usage
really expanded. Copper is essential to economic and technological development, so sub-
stantial growth in its applications has continued in the 21st century, driven by the rapid
industrialization of China and other emerging-market economies (Fig. 2.1).
This chapter discusses production and use of copper around the world. It gives pro-
duction, use and price statistics, and identiﬁes and locates the world’s largest copper-
producing plants.
2.1 Properties and uses of copper
Copper is an excellent conductor of electricity and heat. It also resists corrosion. It is easily
fabricated into wire, pipe, and other forms, and is easily joined by soldering and brazing.
It is also malleable, ductile, and tough (not brittle). All of these properties are widely
exploited (Table 2.1).
Figure 2.1 World use of reﬁned copper, which has grown from less than 500,000 t in 1900 to more
than 24.5 million tons in 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% (International
Copper Study Group, 2019).

Copper is readily alloyed with zinc, tin, nickel, and other metals to improve its cast-
ability, strength, and corrosion resistance. Brass (CueZn alloy) is an especially useful alloy
that has a low solidiﬁcation temperature and high ﬂuidity, allowing efﬁcient casting into
intricate shapes. Berylliumecopper is heat treatable, is as hard and strong as steel, and can
be used for several applications (Materion, 2020). Alloys account for about 25% of copper
usage.
Among its signiﬁcant beneﬁcial properties, copper
•
is easily drawn into extremely ﬁne wire;
•
is easily extruded into thin pipe and other shapes;
•
is easily machined and threaded;
•
is readily cast into intricate shapes, especially in alloy form;
•
is antibacterial (useful in medical piping and other equipment);
•
is nonmagnetic;
•
has an attractive sheen and color;
•
exhibits low metal-against-metal friction (in alloy form);
•
has catalytic properties; and
•
does not oxidize during use, so has a long service life and can be recycled without loss.
Fig. 2.2 shows the distribution of copper usage in various industries (International
Copper Study Group, 2019). Its major use is in conduction of electricity, ranging
from small domestic installations to high-voltage heavy-current applications. It is widely
used in generators, motors, transformers, and in renewable energy. Its other major use
today is in communication technologies, such as high-speed data transmission, area net-
works, cellphones, personal computers, and other electronic equipment. Copper can be
used in construction for building wire, plumbing, and heating and refrigeration, as well as
for its aesthetic appeal. Use of copper-based building materials in regions with high
seismic activity can limit earthquake damage owing to its ability to absorb energy.
Its durability, machinability, and ability to be cast with high precision makes copper
suitable for the manufacture of industrial equipment, such as gears, bearings, and turbine

tonnes in 2019 (International Copper Study Group, 2020), most of which was in the

form of concentrates (see Chapter 3); about 20% of mine production uses hydrometal-
lurgical processing involving solvent extraction and electrowinning (SXeEW) of copper
cathode (Chapters 15 and 16).
The Andes mountain region of South America (Chile and Peru) is the world’s largest
source of copper, accounting for about one-third of global output (Table 2.2). China and
the United States of America are major producers, followed by the African Copper belt
(Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia). The remaining production is scat-
tered around the world. The world’s 20 largest mines are listed in Table 2.3 and plotted in
Fig. 2.4.
2.3 Copper minerals, mines, and cut-off grades
Table 2.4 lists the main copper minerals. These minerals occur at low concentrations in
ores. The remainder of the ore is mostly oxide rock, such as quartz and potassium feld-
spar, with a small amount of waste sulﬁde minerals, such as pyrite.
A copper mine consists of regions of (i) ore, containing economic quantities of Cu
minerals, and (ii) waste rock, containing low, uneconomic quantities of Cu minerals.
These regions are located by drilling, sampling, and analyzing drill core for Cu. Where
possible, the waste rock is not mined. Where the ore and rock are intertwined, they
must be mined together and separated later, as described in Chapters 3 and 4.
Mined Cu ore typically contains 0.5% Cu (open-pit mines) and 2% Cu (underground
mines). Many Cu ores also contain small amounts of valuable minor metals, such as gold,

silver, molybdenum, rhenium, and cobalt, which can be proﬁtably recovered during pro-
cessing. Custom smelters can proﬁt from the recovery of nickel, selenium, tin, zinc, and
lead that is present in copper concentrates.
The average grade of ore that is extracted from any given mine is determined by the
cut-off grade (% Cu). This value determines the split between materials classiﬁed as ore
from that considered waste. Material with a copper content of less than the cut-off grade
cannot be proﬁtably treated for copper recovery and is considered waste. It is removed
to large waste dumps.
Cut-off grade depends on the current copper selling price and the mining and extrac-
tion costs. If, for example, the price of copper rises and costs are constant, it may become
proﬁtable to treat lower-grade material. This means that cut-off grade (and average ore
grade) will decrease. Lower copper prices and increased costs have the opposite effect.
Higher levels of gold, silver, and molybdenum extraction decrease Cu cut-off grade
because these elements provide additional income per tonne of ore.
Average world Cu ore grades (%Cu) are falling at about 25% per decade as copper-
rich mines become depleted and newly located deposits contain less copper (Calvo et al.,
2016). As shown in Fig. 2.5, it is now rare to ﬁnd a large copper deposit averaging more
than 1% or 2% Cu; furthermore, the mineralogy of new orebodies is becoming more

Sulﬁde minerals are treated by pyrometallurgical processing (Fig. 1.1); carbonates, chlorides,
oxides, silicates, and sulfates are treated by hydrometallurgical processing (Fig. 1.2), although
secondary sulﬁdes, e.g. chalcocite are increasingly being in this manner (see Chapter 14).

complex and the time required from discovery of the deposit to commissioning of a mine
has substantially increased (Winton Group, 2017).
2.4 Locations of processing plants
2.4.1 Smelters
The ﬁrst stage of copper extraction from sulﬁde ores is production of high-grade (w25%
Cu) particulate concentrate from low-grade (w0.5%e2% Cu) ore (Chapters 3 and 4).
This is always done at the mine site to avoid costly long-distance transport of the ore’s
waste rock.
The resulting concentrate is usually transported by truck or train from the mine to a
regional port, then by ship to coastal or riverside smelters around the world, located
mainly in China, Japan, and Europe. China is by far the biggest importer, processing
w7000 kt/a of Cu-in-concentrate. Chile is by far the largest concentrate exporter,
shipping out w3000 kt/a of contained Cu.
The world’s largest smelters are listed in Table 2.5 and their locations are shown in
Fig. 2.6. In 2018, China accounted for about 40% of world smelter production, followed
by Chile (10%) and Japan (7%).
2.4.2 Electroreﬁneries
The main product of smelting is copper anodes, which are treated in an electroreﬁnery to
produce pure high-grade (<25 ppm impurities) copper cathode. Copper electroreﬁneries
are usually built near the smelter that supplies them with anodes or in a convenient central

(International Copper Study Group, 2017), which favors coastal and riverside electroreﬁ-
neries. The world’s largest electroreﬁneries are listed in Table 2.6 and shown in Fig. 2.7.
2.4.3 Hydrometallurgical plants
LeacheSXeEW operations are always located next to their mines. This is because ores that
are suitable for leaching are low in copper grade, and hence uneconomic to transport. The
world’s largest copper leacheSXeEW operations are listed in Table 2.7 and their locations
are shown in Fig. 2.8. This technology dominates in Chile and the African Copper Belt.
2.5 Price of copper
Fig. 2.9 shows the price of copper from 1958 to 2020. The dollar price increased steadily
until 2002 then rose rapidly, reaching record high values in 2011. The post-2005 high
prices were due to the huge demand for copper by China during its rapid industrialization
and infrastructure growth. The large swings in price since then are mostly the result of
short-term variations in Chinese demand, with some due to arbitrary U.S. tariffs.

will also boost consumption because wind turbines and solar panels require larger
amounts of copper, per unit of energy generated, than traditional coal and gas plants.
Electric and hybrid cars also use considerably more copper than conventional vehicles
(International Copper Study Group, 2019).
2.7 Summary
Copper is produced around the world. About 40% is mined in the western mountain re-
gion of South America. Mined ore grades (%Cu) have fallen over the years as today’s rela-
tively high Cu grade deposits are mined out and newly discovered deposits contain
smaller amounts of Cu.
Concentrators and leachsolvent extractionelectrowinning plants are located near
their mines. Smelters and reﬁneries are increasingly located near sea ports so that they can
receive concentrates from mines around the world.
Copper’s most exploited property is its high electrical conductivity, in conjunction
with its excellent corrosion resistance, formability, and joinability. Its high thermal con-
ductivity and corrosion resistance are also exploited in many heat transfer applications.
Copper is readily alloyed with other metals (mostly zinc) to make complex, strong,
corrosion-resistant castings.
Worldwide, about 21 million tonnes of copper are mined each year. Currently, about
one-third of copper is recycled at the end of its useful life (Statistica, 2020) (Chapter 18),
which adds an additional 5 million tonnes into the market.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

CHAPTER 3
Production of high copper
concentratesdcomminution and
ﬂotation (Johnson et al., 2019)
The grade of copper ores is typically too low (0.5%e2% Cu) for economic direct
smelting. Heating and melting the huge quantity of largely worthless rock would
require too much energy and too much furnace capacity. For this reason, all ores
destined for pyrometallurgical processing are physically concentrated before smelting.
The product of this step is concentrate, which contains w30% Cu (virtually all as sulﬁde
minerals).
Ores destined for hydrometallurgical processing are rarely concentrated. Cu is usually
extracted from these ores by direct leaching of crushed or milled ore (Chapter 14).
This chapter describes the production of high-grade concentrate from low-grade ore.
Processing of sulﬁde minerals is emphasized because these minerals account for virtually
all Cu concentration.
3.1 Concentration ﬂowsheet
Concentration of Cu ores consists of isolating the copperdcontaining minerals from the
rest of the ore. It entails the following:
(a) blasting, crushing, and grinding the ore to a size where the Cu mineral grains are
liberated from the non-Cu mineral grains, known as comminution, and
(b) physically separating the liberated Cu minerals from non-Cu minerals by froth ﬂota-
tion to generate a Cu-rich concentrate and Cu-barren tailings Chapter 4.
Fig. 1.2 shows these processes in relation to the overall copper-making ﬂowsheet.
Figs. 3.1 and 3.11 describe them in detail.
Copper concentrators typically treat 10,000e150,000 tonnes of ore per day, depend-
ing on the production rate of their mines (ICSG, 2010).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

3.2 The comminution process
To liberate the copper-containing minerals from the gangue materials in the ore (Chapter 2)
and enable them to be collected by ﬂotation into a concentrate, the ore should be ﬁnely
ground.
Comminution is performed in three stages:
(a) breaking the ore by explosions in the mine (blasting);
(b) crushing large ore pieces by compression in gyratory or roll crushers; and
(c) wet grinding of the crushed ore in rotating tumbling mills, where abrasion, impact,
and compression all contribute to breaking the ore.
The ﬁnal ﬁneness of grind is mainly determined by the number of times an ore par-
ticle passes through the grinding mills. Separate crushing and grinding steps are necessary
because it is not possible to break massive run-of-mine ore pieces while at the same time
controlling the ﬁneness of grind that is necessary for the ﬂotation step.
3.2.1 Crushing
Crushing is mostly done in the mine, mostly using gyratory crushers (Bearman, 2019,
Fig. 3.2). This permits ore to be transported out of an open-pit mine by conveyor. It
also permits easy hoisting of ore out of an underground mine. The crushed ore is stored
in a coarse-ore stockpile, from which it is sent by conveyor to a grinding mill. The ore
from crushing is then sent for grinding.
3.2.2 Grinding
3.2.2.1 Grind size and liberation of copper minerals
To isolate the copper-containing minerals into a concentrate, the ore should be ﬁnely
enough ground to liberate the Cu mineral grains from the non-Cu mineral grains.
The extent of grinding required to do this is determined by the size of mineral grains
in the ore. Laboratory-scale ﬂotation tests on materials of different particle sizes are usu-
ally required to determine the grind size that is required to liberate the copper minerals.
Fig. 3.3A shows the effect of grind size on recovery of Cu into the concentrate, while
Fig. 3.3B shows the corresponding Cu concentration in the tailings. There is an optimum
grind size for maximum recovery of Cu to the concentrate in the subsequent ﬂotation
step. Too large a grind size causes some Cu mineral grains to remain combined with
or occluded by non-Cu mineral grains, preventing their ﬂotation; too ﬁne a grind size
causes the rising bubbles in the ﬂotation process to push the very tiny Cu-containing par-
ticles aside, preventing their contact with the bubble and reducing their recovery to the
concentrate. In addition, very ﬁne rock and Fe-sulﬁde mineral particles may agglomerate
with very ﬁne Cu-sulﬁde particles, preventing them from ﬂoating.
Production of high copper concentratesdcomminution and ﬂotation
33

Liberation of mineral grains from each other generally requires grinding to w100 mm
diameter particle size. Flotation begins to be adversely affected when particles less
than w10 mm are produced.
Grinding requires considerable electrical energy (Table 3.1). This is another reason to
avoid overgrinding.
Figure 3.2 Gyratory crusher for crushing as-mined ore to w0.2 m diameter pieces. The crushing is
done by compression of ore pieces between the eccentrically rotating spindle and the ﬁxed crusher
wall. The crushing surface on the spindle can be up to 3 m high, 1.5 m diameter. Crushing rates are
10,000e150,000 tonnes of ore per day. (International Copper Study Group (ICSG) World Copper Fact-
book, IWCC and ICA.)

3.2.2.2 Grinding equipment
Grinding produces ore particles of sufﬁcient ﬁneness for Cu mineral recovery by ﬂota-
tion. The most common grinding mills are semiautogenous (SAG) and autogenous (AG)
mills and cone mills (Fig. 3.4; Giblett, 2019; Jones & Pena, 1999). A grinding circuit usu-
ally consists of one SAG or AG mill and one or two cone mills. Grinding is continuous
and fully integrated with the subsequent ﬂotation operation. Grinding is always done
wet, with mixtures of w70 mass% solids in water.
3.2.2.3 Autogenous and semiautogenous mills
The crusher product is ground in an SAG or AG mill (Giblett, 2019). AG mills crush the
ore without the need for iron or steel grinding media. They are used when the ore is hard

to a eccentric cone mill for ﬁnal grinding. The oversize pebbles are recycled through a
small ball mill for ﬁnal reduction. This procedure maximizes ore throughput and mini-
mizes electrical energy consumption.
3.2.2.4 Ball mills (Giblett, 2019)
The ball mill accepts the oversize from hydrocyclone sizing of the SAG mill product. Ball
mills give a controlled ﬁnal grind and produce ﬂotation feed of a uniform size. Ball mills
tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5e10 cm diameter but grad-
ually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typi-
cally 75 vol.% ore and 25% steel.
The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and
size-control cyclones. The cyclones send correct-size material on to ﬂotation and direct
oversize material back to the ball mill for further grinding.

3.2.2.5 HPGR
Fig. 3.5 sketches a high pressure grinding (HPGR) roll crusher. This equipment is used
extensively in the cement, diamond, and iron ore industries. First deployed in the copper
industry in 2006 at the Cerro Verde concentrator in Peru, it has since been adopted by
several copper producers as a replacement for the ball mills used to grind oversize product
from the SAG mill (Fig. 3.1; Burchardt et al., 2010). It is increasingly used as a replace-
ment for the SAG mill itself (Daniel et al., 2019).
Its perceived advantages are 15%e25% lower electrical energy consumption per
tonne of ore and its ability to fracture ore at the mineral grain boundaries (although
this is probably more advantageous for leaching than for froth ﬂotation). Its major disad-
vantage appears to be its difﬁculty in handling wet, sticky ores and high clay ores and a
10%e25% higher initial capital cost (Daniel et al., 2019). HPGR mills are lower capacity
than SAG mills, so operating multiple units in parallel is required in a production
environment.

surfaced rolls. Constant crushing pressure is provided by hydraulic pistons pressing on the movable

3.3 Particle size control of ﬂotation feed
A critical step in grinding is ensuring that its product particles are ﬁne enough for efﬁcient
ﬂotation. Coarser particles must be isolated and returned for further grinding.
Size control is universally done by hydrocyclones (Fig. 3.6; Flintoff & Knorr, 2019). A
hydrocyclone uses the principle that, under the inﬂuence of a force ﬁeld, large ore par-
ticles in a watereore mixture (slurry) tend to move faster than small ore particles.
Figure 3.6 Cutaway view of hydrocyclone showing (A) tangential input of watereore particle feed
and (B) separation of the feed into ﬁne particle and coarse particle fractions. (Reproduced from
Boldt, J. R., & Queneau, P. (1967). The winning of nickel. Toronto: Longmans Canada Ltd. courtesy Vale

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

This principle is put into practice by pumping the grinding mill discharge into a
hydrocyclone at high speed, 5e10 m/s. The slurry enters tangentially (Fig. 3.6), giving
it a rotational motion inside the cyclone. This creates a centrifugal force which accelerates
ore particles toward the cyclone wall. The water content of the slurry, typically w60% by
mass, is adjusted so that (a) the oversize particles are able to reach the wall, where they are
dragged out by water ﬂow along the wall and through the apex of the cyclone, and
(b) the correct (small) size particles do not have time to reach the wall before they are
ﬂushed out with the main slurry ﬂow through the vortex ﬁnder.
The principal control parameter for the hydrocyclone is the water content of the
incoming slurry. An increase in the water content of the slurry gives less hindered move-
ment of particles and allows a greater fraction of the input particles to reach the wall and
pass through the apex. This increases the fraction of particles being recycled for regrind-
ing and ultimately leads to a more ﬁnely ground ﬁnal product. A decrease in water con-
tent has the opposite effect.
3.3.1 Instrumentation and control
Grinding circuits are extensively instrumented and closely controlled (Fig. 3.7, Table 3.2).
The objectives of the control are to
(a) produce particles of appropriate size for efﬁcient ﬂotation recovery of Cu minerals;
(b) produce these particles at a rapid rate;
(c) produce these particles with a minimum consumption of energy.
The most common control strategy is to ensure that the sizes of particles in the ﬁnal
grinding product are within predetermined limits, as sensed by an on-stream particle-size
analyzer (Outotec, 2016; O’Keefe et al., 2014, pp. 694e703), and then optimize produc-
tion rate and energy consumption while maintaining this correct size. Fig. 3.7 and the
following describe one such control system.
3.3.1.1 Particle-size control
The particle-size control loop in Fig. 3.7 controls the particle size of the grinding product
by automatically adjusting the rate of water addition to the hydrocyclone feed sump. If,
for example, the ﬂotation feed contains too many large particles, an electronic signal from
the particle-size analyzer (S) automatically activates water valves to increase the water
content of the hydrocyclone feed. This increases the fraction of the ore being recycled
to the ball mills and gives a ﬁner grind.
Conversely, too ﬁne a ﬂotation feed automatically cuts back on the rate of water addi-
tion to the hydrocyclone feed sump. This decreases ore recycle to the grinding mills,
thereby increasing the particle size of the ﬂotation feed. It also permits a more rapid initial
feed to the ball mills and minimizes grinding energy consumption.

43

3.3.1.2 Ore throughput control
The second control loop in Fig. 3.7 gives maximum ore throughput rate without over-
loading the ball mill. Overloading might become a problem if, for example, the ball mill
receives tough, large particles which require extensive grinding to achieve the small par-
ticle size needed by ﬂotation.
The simplest mass ﬂow control scheme is to use the hydrocyclone sump slurry level to
adjust the ore feed rate to the grinding plant. If, for example, slurry level sensor (L) detects
that the slurry level is rising (due to tougher ore and more hydrocyclone recycle), it auto-
matically slows the input ore feed conveyor. This decreases ﬂow rates throughout the
plant and stabilizes ball mill loading and sump level.
Detection of a falling sump level, on the other hand, automatically increases ore feed
rate to the grinding plant, to a prescribed rate or to the maximum capacity of another part
of the concentrator, such as the ﬂotation circuit.
There is, of course, a time delay (5e10 min) before the change in ore feed rate is felt
in the hydrocyclone feed sump. The size of the sump must be large enough to accom-
modate further buildup (or draw-down) of slurry during this delay.

3.3.2 Automated mineralogical analysis
An important modern tool for optimizing concentrate production is quantitative scan-
ning electron microscopy which, for any assemblage of ore particles, (a) indicates the
mineral grain makeup of every particle in the assemblage, showing liberated, partially
liberated, and unliberated copper mineral grains, and (b) suggests whether more or less
grinding will give improved Cu recovery to the concentrate (Aylmore, 2019; Zahn
et al., 2007). Fig. 3.8 shows an example concentrate assemblage. This can be done
routinely or speciﬁcally when Cu recovery to concentrate unexpectedly decreases. Auto-
mated mineralogical analysis can also be useful in the initial design of a new concentrator
by indicating the minerals and mineral grain associations of ore samples from around the
entire mineral deposit.

3.4 Froth ﬂotation fundamentals
The indispensable tool for Cu concentrate production is froth ﬂotation (Fuerstenau et al.,
2007). This technique is used to upgrade an ore to a concentrate by selectively ﬂoating
copper-containing minerals away from noncopper minerals. The principles of froth ﬂota-
tion are as follows:
(a) Sulﬁde minerals are normally wetted by water (hydrophilic), but they can be condi-
tioned with reagents (known as collectors) that cause them to become water repellent
(hydrophobic).

Figure 3.8 Scanning electron microscope image of Cu sulﬁde concentrate particle assemblage. The
key is shown at left. The bottom right particle is w70 mm across. As expected, most of the particles
are Cu sulﬁde minerals. However, the concentrate contains many silicate particles, which indicates
that concentrate cleaning could be improved. Fe sulﬁdes have also ﬂoated so that depression could
also be improved. Further grinding might liberate a few more Cu sulﬁde particles, but for the most
part grind size is about optimum. (Courtesy of Anglo American: Research.)
46
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

(b) Cu sulﬁde minerals can selectively be made hydrophobic by their interaction with
the collector, leaving other minerals wetted.
(c) Collisions between w1 mm diameter rising air bubbles and the now water-repellent
Cu minerals result in attachment of the Cu mineral particles to the bubbles (Fig. 3.9).
The Cu minerals are ﬂoated to the surface of the slurry by the air bubbles.
(d) The still wetted noncopper mineral particles do not attach to the rising bubbles and
remain in the slurry.
Industrially, the process entails (a) conditioning a watereore mixture (slurry) to make
the Cu minerals water repellent while leaving the non-Cu minerals hydrophilic and
(b) passing a dispersed stream of small bubbles up through the slurry. These procedures
cause the Cu mineral particles to attach to the rising bubbles which carry them to the
top of the ﬂotation cell (Fig. 3.10). The other minerals are left behind. They depart
the cell through an underﬂow system. These are mostly nonsulﬁde gangue with a small
amount of pyrite.
The last step in the ﬂotation process is creating a strong but short-lived froth by adding
frother when the bubbles reach the surface of the slurry. This froth prevents bursting of the
bubbles and release of the Cu mineral particles back into the slurry. The froth overﬂows
the ﬂotation cell, often with the assistance of paddles (Fig. 3.10), and into a trough. There
it collapses and ﬂows into a collection tank.
Figure 3.9 Photograph of water-repellent mineral particles attached to rising bubbles. The input bub-
bles in industrial ﬂotation are w1 mm diameter, which is about the size of the largest bubble in this
photograph. (Photograph by H. Rush Spedden.)

A sequence of ﬂotation cells is designed to optimize Cu recovery and the Cu grade in
the concentrate (Fig. 3.11). The froth from the last set of ﬂotation cells is, after water
removal, the Cu concentrate.
3.5 Flotation chemicals (Nagaraj et al., 2019; Woodcock et al., 2007)
3.5.1 Collectors
The reagents (collectors) which create the water-repellent surfaces on sulﬁde minerals are
heteropolar molecules. They have a polar (charged) end and a nonpolar (hydrocarbon)
end. They attach their polar (charged) end to the mineral surface (which is itself polar),
leaving the nonpolar hydrocarbon end extended outward (Fig. 3.12). It is this orientation
that imparts the water-repellent character to the conditioned mineral surfaces.
A commonly used collector is xanthate, e.g.,

300 m3 cylindrical tanks. They operate continuously. (Credit: Li et al., 2019, Figure 2.)
48
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Other sulfur-containing molecules, particularly dithiophosphates, mercaptans, and
thiocarbamates, are also used. Commercial collectors are often blends of several of these
reagents. About 10e50 g collector is required per tonne of ore feed.
3.5.2 Selectivity in ﬂotation
The simplest froth ﬂotation separation is that of sulﬁde minerals from waste oxide min-
erals, such as andesite, granodiorite, and granite. It uses collectors which, when dissolved
in a watereore slurry, preferentially attach themselves to sulﬁdes. These collectors mostly
have a sulfur group at the polar end, which attaches to sulﬁde minerals but ignores oxides.

3.5.3 Differential ﬂotation modiﬁers
Separating sulﬁde minerals, such as chalcopyrite from pyrite, is somewhat more complex.
It relies on modifying the surfaces of non-Cu sulﬁdes so that the collector does not attach
to them while still attaching to Cu sulﬁdes.
The most common modiﬁer is the OH (hydroxyl) ion. Its concentration is varied by
adjusting the basicity of the slurry with burnt lime (CaO), occasionally with sodium car-
bonate (Na2CO3). The effect is demonstrated in Fig. 3.13, which shows how chalcopy-
rite, galena, and pyrite can be ﬂoated from each other. Each line on the graph marks the
boundary between ﬂoat and nonﬂoat conditions for the speciﬁc mineraldthe mineral
ﬂoats to the left of its curve, but not to the right.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

A bulk PbeCu sulﬁde concentrate could therefore be produced by ﬂotation at pH
6.5. The Pb and Cu sulﬁdes could then be separated at pH 9, which occurs after addition
of more CaO.
The modifying effect of OHe is due to its competition with collector anions, such as
xanthates, for a place on the mineral surface. OHe ions are, for example, selectively
adsorbed on pyrite. This prevents appreciable xanthate adsorption on the pyrite, selec-
tively depressing it. However, too many OHe ions will also depress chalcopyrite, so excess
CaO must be avoided.
3.5.4 Frothers
Collectors and modiﬁers give selective ﬂotation of Cu minerals from non-Cu minerals.
Frothers create the strong but short-lived froth which holds the ﬂoated Cu minerals at the
top of the cell. Frothers produce a froth which is strong enough in the ﬂotation cell to
support the ﬂoated Cu minerals, but breaks down quickly once the froth and its attached
minerals overﬂow the cell.
Thousands of compounds have been developed as frothers over the years. Most are
either short chain aliphatic alcohols (linear, branched, or MIBC) or polyglycols (polyeth-
ylene or polypropylene). Once the standard choice, pine oil has become much less pop-
ular in recent years. Most commercial frothers are mixtures, and formulation changes are
frequent.

compositions.

Frothers stabilize the froth by absorbing their OHe polar end in water, while their
branched (nonpolar) chains form a cross-linked network in air. The froth should not
be long lived, so the branched chain hydrocarbon tails should not be too long. The addi-
tion of frothers also decreases bubble size, which provides more relative surface to attach
mineral particles to.
3.6 Flotation of Cu ores
Selective ﬂotation of Cu sulﬁde minerals (chalcopyrite, chalcocite, and bornite) from ox-
ide rock and Fe sulﬁde minerals (mainly pyrite) is usually done with xanthate, dithiophos-
phate, mercaptan, or thionocarbamate collectors; burnt lime (CaO) for pH (OHe ion)
control; and mixed alcohol frothers. A representative ﬂowsheet, industrial data, and
example reagents are shown in Fig. 3.11 and Tables 3.3e3.5.
The ﬂowsheet in Fig. 3.11 shows four sets of ﬂotation cells:
(a) the rougherescavenger cells ﬂoat the incoming groundeore slurry under conditions
which give efﬁcient recovery of Cu to the froth with a reasonable froth grade
(15%e20% Cu);
(b) the cleaner cells in which ﬂotation of non-Cu minerals in reground concentrate from
the rougherescavenger cells is depressed with CaO to produce a higher grade Cu
concentrate;
(c) the recleaner cells maximize concentrate grade (%Cu) by giving rock and Fe sulﬁde
minerals a ﬁnal depression under quiescent conditions;
(d) the cleanerescavenger cells scavenge the last traces of Cu to the froth from the cleaner
tails by the addition of more collector before the tails are discarded.
The froths from the rougherescavengers and cleanerescavengers are ground before
being sent to the cleaners (Fig. 3.11). This releases previously unliberated Cu mineral
grains.
The rougherescavenger and cleanerescavenger cells are designed to maximize Cu
recovery to concentrate. The cleaner and recleaner cells maximize concentrate grade.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Circuits such as that in Fig. 3.11 give w90% recovery of Cu sulﬁde minerals
and w30% Cu concentrate grade (Tables 3.4 and 3.5).
3.7 Flotation cells
Fig. 3.10 shows a mechanical ﬂotation cell (Nelson & Lelinski, 2019). Air bubbles are
introduced into the slurry through a rotating agitator at the bottom of the cell. The
agitator shears the air into the 1 mm diameter bubbles needed for Cu mineral attachment.
It also disperses the bubbles across the cell.
3.7.1 Column cells
Many new Cu ﬂotation plants use column cells for cleaner ﬂotation (Tables 3.5 and 3.6;
Figs. 3.14 and 3.15). These cells provide separate zones for particleebubble attachment
and for draining of nonattached low-Cu particles from the froth (Mankosa et al., 2019).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

3.8 Flotation process control
Modern ﬂotation plants are equipped with sensors and automatic control systems (Shang
et al., 2009). The principal objectives of the control are to maximize Cu recovery,
concentrate grade (% Cu), and ore throughput rate. The principal variables sensed are
as follows (Table 3.7):
(a) ore particle size after grinding and regrinding (Cirulis & Poplaswski, 2019);
(b) % Cu, % solids, pH, and mass ﬂowrate of the process streams (especially the input and
output streams);
(c) froth height in the ﬂotation cells.
Impeller speeds and air input rates in the ﬂotation cells are also often sensed. The ad-
justments made on the basis of the sensor readings are as follows:
(a) water ﬂowrates into hydrocyclone feed sumps to control grinding recycle, and thus
ﬂotation feed (ore) particle size;
(b) ﬂotation reagent (collector, frother, and depressant) and water addition rates
throughout the ﬂotation plant;
(c) slurry level in the ﬂotation cells, by adjusting the underﬂow valves in each cell.
3.8.1 Continuous chemical analysis of process streams
Of particular importance in ﬂotation control is continuous measurement of Cu concen-
tration in the solids of the process streams. This is typically done by X-ray ﬂuorescence
analysis, which may be accomplished by either sending samples to a central X-ray analysis
Table 3.6 Column ﬂotation cells around the world. Virtually all are used for cleaning gangue from the
ﬁnal concentrate (thereby increasing Cu grade).

unit or by using small X-ray units in the process streams themselves. The analyses are
often done by ﬁxed-crystal wavelengthedispersive spectrometry (Aylmore, 2019;
Xore, 2014).
These analyses are used to monitor and optimize plant performance by automatically
controlling (for example) reagent addition rates, grind size, and ﬂotation cell operation. In
modern plants, the control is done by a supervisory computer (Barrette et al., 2009).
Advanced mineralogical techniques are also being more commonly employed to
improve the performance and control of ﬂotation circuits (Celik et al., 2011).

3.8.2 Machine vision systems
Several large concentrators have installed machine vision systems on their ﬂotation cells
(Outotec, 2018). These systems determine froth quality and froth overﬂow rate. They are
used to automatically adjust grind size, reagent addition rates, and froth depth, to maxi-
mize Cu recovery in their rougher and scavenger cells and Cu grade in their cleaner and
recleaner cells (Massinaei, 2015; Supomo et al., 2008).
Freeport’s Grasberg concentrator installed 172 machine vision systems. These systems
and new process strategies increased Cu-to-concentrate recovery by several percent
(Supomo et al., 2008).
3.9 Flotation product processing
3.9.1 Thickening and dewatering
The product from ﬂotation contains 75e80 wt-% water, most of which must be
removed before the concentrate can be transported and smelted. Most of this dewatering
is performed by settling in large quiescent thickeners (Schoenbrunn et al., 2019). The solids
settle under the inﬂuence of gravity to the bottom of the thickener from where they are
scraped to a central discharge by a slowly rotating rake (Parsapour et al., 2019). Faster
settling is encouraged by adding small quantities of organic ﬂocculants, such as polyacryl-
amides (Ferrera et al., 2009), to the input slurry. These cause the ﬁne particles to ﬂoccu-
late, which results in faster settling velocities.
The underﬂows from the thickeners still contain 30%e40% water. This is reduced to
10%e15% in rotary vacuum ﬁlters and then further reduced to 8%e12% in pressure ﬁl-
ters or ceramic disc vacuum ﬁlters (Meadows, 2019; Outotec, 2020a,b). The water con-
tent of the concentrate when it is shipped (approximately 8%) is a compromise between
the cost of shipping water and the need to minimize concentrate losses as dust during
transport (Garshasb & Saulters, 2019).
3.9.2 Tailings
Flotation tailings account for w98% of the ore fed to the concentrator. They are stored in
large tailings dams near the mine property. Water is reclaimed from the dams and
recycled to the concentrator (ICMM, 2012).
Most concentrators are zero water discharge plants, which means that no water can be
discharged from the plant but must be internally recycled. This minimizes water con-
sumption and avoids mixing concentrator efﬂuents with the surrounding water table.
The pH of the tailings water is close to that required for rougherescavenger ﬂotation,
so this recycle minimizes CaO consumption. Cu ﬂotation tailings typically contain
0.02%e0.15% Cu on a dry basis (Table 4.3).

3.10 Other ﬂotation separations
Copper ﬂotation consists mainly of separating Cu sulﬁde minerals from nonsulﬁde
rock and Fe-sulﬁde minerals. Many Cu deposits also contain molybdenite. Others
contain pentlandite ((Ni,Fe)9S8), sphalerite (ZnS), or galena (PbS). These can all be sepa-
rated from Cu minerals by selective ﬂotation. Molybdenite ﬂotation is discussed in
Chapter 20. The ﬂotation of sphalerite, galena, and Ni and Cu oxides is discussed by
Biswas and Davenport (1994). Pentlandite ﬂotation is described by Crundwell et al.
(2011).
3.10.1 Gold ﬂotation
Au is present in many Cu sulﬁde ores, from just traces to w1 g/t Au (104 wt.-% Au).
Au is mostly present in Cu sulﬁde ores as metal and AgeAu alloy (electrum) grains. Some
may also be present as tellurides. These grains of Au and Au alloy may be liberated par-
ticles, attached to other minerals, encapsulated in sulﬁde mineral particles, or encapsu-
lated in oxide particles. They seem to be preferentially associated with bornite and
pyrite (Agorhom et al., 2015).
The Au-containing mineral grains in CueAu ores may be smaller than their compan-
ion copper sulﬁde mineral grains, so higher Au recovery requires ﬁner grinding. Opti-
mum grind size is best determined by controlled in-plant testing.
Fortunately, all of these gold mineral types ﬂoat efﬁciently under the same conditions
as copper sulﬁde minerals, using xanthate, dithiophosphate, and thionocarbamate collec-
tors and conventional frothers such as methyl isobutyl carbinol (Agorhom et al., 2015;
Woodcock et al., 2007). Generally speaking, liberated Au metal, Au alloy, and Au min-
eral particles ﬂoat with chalcopyrite and other sulﬁde minerals and report to the bulk
concentrate (Zahn et al., 2007). Au recoveries to the concentrate of 80%e85% are
typical. However, efforts to depress pyrite ﬂotation to reduce sulfur levels in the concen-
trate can also reduce gold recovery.
Kendrick et al. (2003) suggest that Au recovery to concentrate can be increased w10%
by decreasing the pH of the ore slurry from 10.7 to 9.5. This also appreciably lowers
CaO consumption. Special collectors have also been developed for copper ores with
signiﬁcant gold content. These collectors are a blend of monothiophosphates and dithio-
phosphates, and may be worth considering for CueAu concentrators.
3.11 Summary
Copper ores typically contain 0.5%e2% Cu. They must be concentrated to w30% Cu
before smelting. The universal concentration technique is froth ﬂotation of ﬁnely ground
ore particles.
Production of high copper concentratesdcomminution and ﬂotation
63

The feed to froth ﬂotation is produced by comminution, which includes the
following:
(a) blasting ore fragments from the mine walls (w0.1 m diameter);
(b) crushing these fragments in eccentric and roll crushers (w0.01 m diameter);
(c) grinding the crushed ore in rotating tumbling mills (<100 mm diameter).
The resulting ﬁnely ground particles are then sent continuously to froth ﬂotation.
Froth ﬂotation entails attaching ﬁne Cu sulﬁde mineral particles to bubbles and
“ﬂoating” them out of a watereore mixture. The ﬂotation is made selective by using re-
agents which make the Cu sulﬁde minerals water repellant (hydrophobic), while leaving
the other minerals wetted (hydrophilic).
Typical Cu sulﬁde recoveries to concentrate are 85%e90%. Typical concentrate
grades are 30% Cu (higher with chalcocite, bornite, and native copper mineralization).
Column ﬂotation cleaner cells are particularly effective at giving a high Cu grade in
the concentrate.
Modern concentrators are automatically controlled to give maximum Cu recovery,
maximum %Cu in the concentrate, and maximum ore throughput rate at minimum
cost. Expert control systems help optimize the performance of ﬂotation plants. On-
stream particle size and on-stream X-ray ﬂuorescence analyses are key components of
this automatic control.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

CHAPTER 4
Pyrometallurgical processing of
copper concentrates
4.1 Fundamental thermodynamic aspects associated with
pyrometallurgical copper processing
Before introducing basic chemical reactions involved in the pyrometallurgical processing
of copper concentrates, it is necessary to understand some basic thermochemical
concepts.
Pyrometallurgical processing of metals in the presence of a combined oxygen and sul-
fur atmosphere involves the following two reactions:
2M þ O2 ¼ 2 MO
(4.1)
2M þ S2 ¼ 2 MS
(4.2)
For reactions (4.1) and (4.2), their respective equilibrium constants can be represented
by Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4), respectively.
Log Kð4:1Þ ¼ 2 logðaMO=aMÞ  log pO2
(4.3)
Log Kð4:2Þ ¼ 2 logðaMS=aMÞ  log pS2
(4.4)
In these expressions, Ki, P, and a represent the equilibrium constant for each reaction
and the partial pressures and activities of elements and compounds. Combination of re-
actions (4.1) and (4.2) to generate Eq. (4.5) indicates how oxides and sulﬁdes will interact
under an oxygenesulfur environment.
2 MS þ O2 ¼ 2 MO þ S2
(4.5)
log Kð4:5Þ ¼ 2 logðaMO=aMSÞ þ log pS2  log pO2
(4.6)
where Eq. (4.6) indicates the relationship between the activities of the metal oxide and
sulﬁde for given oxygen and sulfur partial pressures at a deﬁned temperature. In this
expression, the equilibrium constant K is indirectly calculated from the relationship
between the free energy at equilibrium for reaction (4.5), assuming pure compounds
(unitary activity), from the following expression:
DG ¼ 2:303 RT logKð4:5Þ
(4.7)
In expression 4.7, R is the ideal gas constant, T the absolute temperature, and K the
equilibrium constant for reaction 4.5.

An additional relationship required to understand the behavior between oxides
and sulﬁdes is given by the relationship between oxygen and sulfur, represented by reac-
tion (4.8):
1=2 S2ðgÞ þ O2ðgÞ ¼ SO2ðgÞ
(4.8)
log Kð4:8Þ ¼ log pSO2  1=2 log pS2  log pO2
(4.9)
Expressions (4.6) and (4.9) can be represented in an oxygenesulfur potential (or pre-
dominance) diagram, as shown in Fig. 4.1. The ﬁgure indicates that iron oxide is more
stable than copper oxide at low oxygen potentials, with both metal sulﬁdes stable at
similar sulfur potentials. The diagram also indicates that it is thermodynamically feasible
to oxidize iron sulﬁde and increase the copper concentration in a sulﬁde phase. This prin-
ciple is represented by the following chemical reaction and its equilibrium constant:
FeSðlÞ þ 1=2O2ðgÞ ¼ FeOðlÞ þ 1=2 S2ðgÞ
(4.10)
log Kð4:10Þ ¼ logðaFeO=aFeSÞ þ 1=2ðlog pS2  log pO2Þ

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Eq. (4.11) is represented by the iso-concentration copper lines in Fig. 4.1, indicating
the equilibrium between slag and copper matte phases for a given sulfur and oxygen po-
tential in the graph.
Fig. 4.1 also shows the sulfur dioxide isobars for 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 atm. The area be-
tween both isobars represents the conditions in which copper smelting and converting
processes are conducted, depending on the following:
•
Oxygen enrichment deﬁned for the process (from air to 100% oxygen)
•
Moisture of the materials fed to the process (bath smelting up to 10%)
The operating isobar for each operation will be deﬁned based on type of feed (dry or
feed), amount of fuel required to support the reactions, availability of industrial oxygen,
and type of concentrate to be treated. However, most of the technologies will take
advantage of the intensive use of oxygen. This will then translate into higher sulfur di-
oxide partial pressure for the generated process gases.
4.2 The Yazawa diagram and pyrometallurgical copper processing
The oxygenesulfur potential diagram concept shown in Fig. 4.1 was used by Yazawa
(1979) to describe, from the metallurgical thermodynamics point of view, aspects
involved in the pyrometallurgical processing of copper bearing materials, using thermo-
dynamic and phase equilibria information available at that time. This representation can
be considered a sort of navigation tool to understand the theoretical restrictions of copper
pyrometallurgical processes, and behavior and potential interaction of copper with iron
and minor elements. For a deeper understanding on how different phase equilibria data
were combined to construct the Yazawa diagram, the reader should refer to the recom-
mended reading section of this chapter.
Fig. 4.2 shows an updated version of the Yazawa diagram, prepared with support of
PyrosearchdUniversity of Queensland, using the FactSage public database ( Jak et al.,
2016). Fig. 4.2 also shows the original boundary lines calculated by Yazawa (1979).
From Fig. 4.2, we can identify the main “metallurgical road” for copper processing,
A / B / C (C0) / D / E and B / B0, as follows:
•
Copper smelting: Following the path A / B copper concentrates are gradually com-
busted (oxidized) to a given matte grade by controlled oxygen addition (speciﬁc ox-
ygen per unit of fed material). Through this process, iron is oxidized, sulfur is
combusted to SO2, and slag is formed by adding silica as a ﬂux.
•
SlageMatte separation: Following path B / B0, matte and slag are given proper con-
ditions to allow settling of matte droplets and recovery of copper.
•
Converting:
o Batch ProcessdSlag Blowing following path B / C: Copper matte is oxidized to
ﬁnalize the controlled oxidation of iron. The formed slag has a signiﬁcant amount
of copper and must be treated to recover the contained copper units (ﬂotation or
recycling to smelting unit).
Pyrometallurgical processing of copper concentrates
69

o Batch ProcessdCopper Blowing following path C / D: After removal of slag
generated in the previous step, the high-grade matte is converted to blister copper,
by removing most of the remaining sulfur (over 20% of the high-grade copper
matte is sulfur).
o Continuous Converting following the path B (close to the 70% Cu matte grade)
/ C0: Copper matte is directly converted to blister, avoiding an intermediate step
as in the batch process. Slag is processed or recycled to the smelting step to recover
the contained copper units.
•
Direct to Blister process: For special concentrates, normally low in iron, it is possible
to produce blister copper in a single step. This follows the path A / C0 (Location of
C0 will depend on the ﬁnal S content of blister of the respective process).
•
Reﬁning:
o Desulfurization from an intermediate location between C0 and D to D, sulfur is
removed by addition of oxygen.
o Reduction from D to E, excess oxygen is removed to about 1000 ppm to allow
casting of copper into anodes.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

4.3 Smelting: the ﬁrst processing step
As shown in Fig. 4.2, production of blister copper involves a sequential movement across
the oxygenesulfur potential diagram, with controlled increase of the oxygen potential
which reduces the sulfur potential. This sequence must be followed to
•
Achieve a controlled release of heat generated by the combustion of copper
concentrates,
•
Control copper losses and the amount of slag.
From a theoretical point of view, copper concentrates could be directly combusted
(point A) (oxidized) to produce metallic Cu and ferrous oxide (point D), as follows:
CuFeS2ðsÞ þ 5=2 O2ðgÞ/CuðlÞ þ FeOðsÞ þ 2 SO2ðgÞ
(4.12)
Cu2SðsÞ þ O2ðgÞ/2CuðlÞ þ SO2ðgÞ
(4.13)
FeS2ðsÞ þ 5=2 O2ðgÞ/FeOðsÞ þ 2 SO2ðgÞ
(4.14)
Additional gangue material contained in the copper concentrates, such as alumina,
magnesia, and calcia, will join the iron oxide and with the addition of a proper ﬂuxing
material (silica) will form slag.
Reactions 4.12e4.14 are exothermic, meaning that they generate heat that must be
released from the reactor without comprising its integrity and the safety of people. In
addition, the large jump in oxygen potential from point A to D also involves the oxida-
tion of copper sulﬁde as follows:
Cu2SðsÞ þ 3=2O2ðgÞ/Cu2OðlÞ þ SO2ðgÞ
(4.15)
Therefore, the outcome of direct processing of chalcopyrite-based copper concen-
trate will result in a large amount of slag, due to the oxidation of iron (normally
25%e20% of Fe in these type of concentrates), and large copper losses in the form of cop-
per oxide. These outcomes make this process unattractive from the commercial point of
view as primary copper recovery will be low and an additional process step will be
required to recover the contained copper in the slag.
Therefore, the art of smelting consists of deﬁning an optimum matte grade to control
the heat release for a given reactor, the amount of generated slag, and the oxidation of
copper, in which reaction (4.15) can manage the resulﬁdization of copper oxide, as
follows:
FeSðl; in matteÞ þ Cu2Oðl; in slagÞ / Cu2Sðl; in matteÞ þ FeOðl; in slagÞ
(4.16)
Kð4:15Þ ¼ ðaCu2S $ aFeOÞ=ðaFeS $ aCu2OÞ
(4.17)
The expression for the equilibrium constant of this reaction is shown in Eq. (4.17).
This reaction has a strong tendency to shift to the right side of the equation with an equi-
librium constant of 2.78$104 at 1200C, meaning that any oxidation of copper will be

buffered by iron sulﬁde. In other words, if enough iron sulﬁde is present in the molten
phase, copper will be resulﬁdized. The general smelting principle represented by reaction
(4.15) will control the overall reaction of combustion of the copper concentrate
expressed by reaction (4.17).

(4.18)
Reaction (4.18) shows that the combustion of a chalcopyrite concentrate will form
three phases: matte, slag, and gas. A third element on the reactant side is the ﬂuxing agent,
required to allow proper separation of the produced molten product, an oxysulﬁde
mixture that with the addition of a solvent (ﬂuxing agent) in the proper proportion al-
lows the formation of a sulﬁde-rich phase (copper matte) and an oxide-rich phase (liquid
slag). The gas phase will contain the combusted sulfur in the form of sulfur dioxide.
The extraction process (matteeslag separation) represented by reaction 4.18 can be
illustrated with the help of the SiO2eFeOeFeS phase diagram, shown in Fig. 4.3.
The left edge of the diagram represents a solution consisting only of FeS and FeO. In
silica-free melts with FeS concentrations above w31 mass%, a single oxysulﬁde liquid
is formed. However, when silica is added, a liquid-state miscibility gap appears. This
gap becomes larger as more silica is added.
Lines a, b, c, and d represent the equilibrium compositions of the two liquids. The
sulﬁde-rich melt is known as matte. The oxide-rich melt is known as slag.
The process of separation between matte and slag, represented by reaction Eq. 4.16, is
known as matte smelting. It accomplishes the partial removal of Fe needed to make the
ﬁnal copper making stage successful.
4.3.1 Slag phase: FeOeFe2O3eSiO2 system
From a value point, the slag phase is a residue from the smelting stage. However, from the
metallurgical point of view, it has a predominant role to play to ensure proper reﬁning of
the metal containing phase. The chemical and physical properties of the slag are therefore
of paramount importance for an efﬁcient metallurgical process.
Slag is a solution of molten oxides. These oxides include FeO from Fe oxidation,
SiO2 from ﬂux and concentrate, and other oxide impurities from concentrate. Oxides
commonly found in slags include ferrous oxide (FeO), ferric oxide (Fe2O3), silica
(SO2), alumina (Al2O3), calcia (CaO), and magnesia (MgO). As Fig. 4.3 shows, small
amounts of sulﬁdes can also be dissolved in FeOeSiO2 slags. Small amounts of calcia
and alumina in slags decrease this sulﬁde solubility, Table 4.1.
The molecular structure of molten slag is described by dividing its oxides into three
groups: acidic, basic, and neutral. The best-known acidic oxides are silica and alumina.
72
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

When these oxides melt, they polymerize, forming long polyions such as those shown in
Fig. 4.4. These polyions give acidic slags high viscosities, making them difﬁcult to work
with. Acidic slags also have low solubilities for other acidic oxides. This can cause difﬁ-
culty in copper making because impurities which form acidic oxides (e.g., As2O3, Bi2O3,
Sb2O3) will not be removed in slag, i.e., they will remain in matte or copper.
Adding basic oxides such as calcia and magnesia to acidic slags breaks the polyions into
smaller structural units. As a result, basic slags have low viscosities and high solubilities for
acidic oxides. Up to a certain limit, adding basic oxides also lowers the melting point of a
slag. Copper making slags generally contain small amounts of basic oxides.
Neutral oxides such as FeO and Cu2O react less strongly with polyions in a molten
slag. Nevertheless, they have much the same effect. FeO and Cu2O have low melting

points, so they tend to lower a slag’s melting point and viscosity. The slags produced in
industrial matte smelting consist primarily of FeO, Fe2O3, and SO2, with small amounts
of Al2O3, CaO, and MgO, Table 4.2.

Information extracted from (Ramachandran et al., 2003).

Along the bottom boundary line, the slag is saturated with solid FeO. The boundary at
right marks the compositions at which dissolved FeO and Fe2O3 react to form solid
magnetite, according to reaction (4.19):
FeOðsÞþFe2O3ðsÞ/Fe3O4ðsÞ
(4.19)
Most of the smelters will operate close to magnetite saturation conditions, represented
by the line BC and control the precipitation of magnetite by the addition of silica. From
the thermodynamic point of view, this will translate in lowering the activity of FeO in
the slag by the formation of fayalite as follows:
FeOðsÞ þ SiO2ðsÞ/FeO  SiO2ðl; slagÞ
(4.20)
However, again there is a trade-off. Flux costs money and the energy required to heat
and melt; it also costs more as more silica ﬂux is used and the operational window to have
a liquid slag is also narrowed, as shown in Fig. 4.6. To have a suitable slag with the right
physical and chemical properties, the metallurgist will control the Fe/SiO2 ratio to ensure
that the slag is within the operational window suitable for the process. Fig. 4.6 shows the

relationship between matte grade and Fe/SiO2 ratio at 1200C and a sulfur dioxide par-
tial pressure of 0.25 atm. The liquid operational window for the Fe/SiO2 ratio is strongly
inﬂuenced by the presence of minor oxides for a given matte grade.
In addition, viscosities of smelting slags increase as the silica concentration increases.
This makes slag handling more difﬁcult and reduces the rate at which matte particles settle
through the slag layer. If the matte particles settle too slowly, they will remain entrained
in the slag when it is tapped. This increases Cu losses. As a result, the correct levels of FeO
and SiO2 in the slag require another balancing act.
Extensive oxidation and lower smelting temperatures encourage the formation of
Fe2O3 in the slag and further formation of magnetite. Avoiding and/or proactively con-
trolling these conditions minimizes magnetite precipitation and potential foaming of the
molten material from the reactor.
Along the left-hand boundary, the slag is saturated either with metallic iron or solid
fayalite (Fe2SiO4). Under the oxidizing conditions of industrial copper smelting, this
never occurs. Table 4.2 lists the compositions of some smelter slags, including their
Cu content. Controlling the amount of Cu dissolved in smelting slag is an important
part of smelter strategy, as demonstrated by Chapter 10.
In addition to the chemical and compositional properties of the slag, physical prop-
erties are also relevant to ensure a proper metal extraction process. Among these proper-
ties, the slag viscosity is one of the most relevant in the copper smelting process. A slag

with adequate viscosity will help to control copper losses due to lower entrainment and
in bath smelting applications (Chapter 10) to help protect refractory materials in the
reactor.
Many measurements have been made of the viscosities of molten slags. These have
been used to develop a model which calculates viscosities as a function of temperature
and composition (Utigard & Warczok, 1995). The model relies on calculation of a vis-
cosity ratio (VR). VR is the ratio of A (an equivalent mass% in the slag of acidic oxides) to
B (an equivalent mass% of basic oxides):
VR ¼ A=B
(4.21)
A ¼ ð%SiO2Þ þ 1:5ð%Cr2O3Þ þ 1:2ð%ZrO2Þ þ 1:8ð%Al2O3Þ

þ 2:3ð%Na2O þ %K2OÞ þ 0:7ð%Cu2OÞ þ 1:6ð%CaF2Þ
(4.23)
Utigard and Warczok related VR to viscosity by regression analysis against their exist-
ing database, obtaining the following:

Since the work of Utigard and Warczok, several efforts have been conducted to mea-
sure viscosities and develop models to calculate them. Among these efforts, CSIRO
(Commonwealth Scientiﬁc Industrial Research Organization, Australia) developed a
thermodynamic computational package, MPE (Multiphase Equlibrium), for ferrous
and nonferrous smelting applications (Zhang, 2002). The software allows prediction of
equilibrium compositions and viscosities and solidus content in slags. Fig. 4.7 shows
the application of the CSIRO MPE package to calculate the effect of Fe/SiO2 ratio un-
der copper smelting conditions at 1200 and 1250C. The secondary vertical axis shows
the % solids in the slag only at 1200C, as the slag is fully liquid at 1250C.
4.3.2 Calcium ferrite and olivine slags systems
The ferrous silicate melts discussed in the previous section have been the basis for the slags
used in most primary copper smelting and converting technologies. However, ferrous sil-
icate slags have limitations. The most important is the need to control magnetite forma-
tion (Eq. 4.19). In bath smelting or converting, this is a problem because the magnetite
crust that forms during the initial reaction can act as a process barrier. The second is the
relatively small window of compositions where the slag is molten at smelting tempera-
tures (Fig. 4.8). Ferrous silicate slags are relatively acidic, which makes it more difﬁcult
to use them to remove impurities such as As, Bi, and Sb that form acidic oxides.
78
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The development of the Mitsubishi converter (Chapter 8) was accompanied by the
adoption of CaO-based (rather than SiO2 based) slag, better known as calcium ferrite
(Jahanshahi & Sun, 2003). Early in the development of the process, it was found that
blowing O2-rich blast onto the surface of fayalite slag produced a crust of solid magnetite.

This made further converting impossible. CaO, on the other hand, reacts with magnetite,
molten Cu, and O2 to form a molten Cu2OeCaOeFe3O4 slag (Fig. 4.9). The slag typi-
cally contains 14%e16% Cu, 40%e55% Fe (mostly Fe3þ), and 15%e20% CaO.
Calcium ferrite slag has a low viscosity (0.025e0.04 kg/m-s), and speciﬁc gravities are
3.1e3.8, less than that of comparable fayalite slags (Vadasz et al., 2001). Surface tensions
are 0.58e0.60 N/m. This improves settling rates after smelting. The CaO in the slag
lowers the activity of Fe2O3, and this prevents magnetite formation. The activity coef-
ﬁcient of Cu2O is also higher in calcium ferrite slags. This means that the solubility of
Cu2O is reduced, which means lower copper losses. Calcium ferrite slags are more basic
than fayalite slags, which lower the activity coefﬁcient of impurity oxides such as As2O3
and Sb2O3. The result is enhancing removal of these impurities. Calcium ferrite slags are
also less likely to engage in foaming.
The advantages of calcium ferrite slag have led to its adoption for bath converting fur-
naces (Chapter 9). However, there are drawbacks to the use of this slag, especially in
smelting. Fig. 4.9 shows the CaOeFeOxeSiO2 phase diagram at 1300C (Tsukihashi
& Kimura, 2000). As it shows, the solubility of silica in CaOeFeOx melts is low. This
makes smelting of concentrates with signiﬁcant levels of silica difﬁcult (Vartiainen
et al., 2003). The other signiﬁcant difﬁculty with the use of calcium ferrite slags is their
aggressive behavior toward the mag-chrome (MgOeCr2O3) refractories used in copper
Figure 4.9 Liquidus line for the CaOeSiO2e(FeOx) system at 1300C (Tsukihashi & Kimura, 2000). The
minimal solubility of silica in calcium ferrite slags is apparent, as is the wider solubility range of olivine
(ferrous calcium silicate) slags.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

smelting and converting furnaces (Fahey et al., 2004). The frequent lining repair and
replacement that occurs as a result increases downtime and expense. As a result, extensive
research has been conducted over the past decade on a more suitable type of slag.
Fig. 4.10 shows the liquid region at 1250C for slags in the CaOeFeOxeSiO2 system
at different oxygen potentials (Jak et al., 2000). Slags in this region have been called ferrous
calcium silicate (FCS) or olivine ((Fe,Ca)2SiO4) slags. Their properties represent a compro-
mise between those of calcium ferrite and fayalite slags. As a result, they are a possible
alternative to fayalite slags for copper smelting. They have also been chosen for the Metso
Outotec Ausmelt C3 converting process (Wood et al., 2016).
4.3.3 Matte (Sundström et al., 2008)
As Fig. 4.3 shows, immiscibility between matte and fayalite slag increases with increasing
silica content (Yazawa, 1956). A high sulfur/iron ratio also increases the completeness of
separation as do calcia and alumina, Table 4.1.
There is some silica and oxygen solubility in matte, but Li and Rankin (1994) demon-
strated that increasing Cu2S in matte decreases these solubilities “dramatically.” As a
result, the typical industrial matte contains only about 1% oxygen.
Mattes do not consist of polyions like those in slags. They appear instead to be best
represented as molten salts (Shimpo et al., 1986). Their speciﬁc gravity is higher than
that of slags and so they form the bottom layer in smelting furnaces. As Fig. 4.11 shows,
their melting points are lower than the 1200C of most slags.
Their viscosities are low as well: w0.003 kg/m$s versus 0.2e1 kg/m-s for typical
slags. Nevertheless, smelting furnaces are operated at about 1250C, to ensure molten
slag and superheated matte. This ensures that the matte and slag stay molten during tap-
ping and transfer.
Figure 4.10 Liquidus isotherms in the CaOeFeOxeSiO2 system at 1250C and varying oxygen poten-
tial (Jak et al., 2000).
Pyrometallurgical processing of copper concentrates

The surface tension of Cu2SeFeS mattes ranges from 0.33 to 0.45 N/m, increasing
with Cu2S content. Temperature has little effect (Kucharski et al., 1994).
Speciﬁc gravity of matte ranges linearly from 3.9 for pure FeS to 5.2 for pure Cu2S. It
decreases slightly with increasing temperature. Multiplying these speciﬁc gravities by the
kinematic viscosities measured by Nikiforov et al. (1976) yields viscosities of about
0.003 kg/m-s for pure Cu2S at 1250C, falling to about 0.002 kg/m-s for mattes with
35% FeS. The value then rises rapidly with increasing FeS. It decreases slowly with
increasing temperature.
Measurements of interfacial tension between molten mattes and slags were reviewed
by Nakamura and Toguri (1991). Interfacial tension increases from near zero in low-Cu
mattes to about 0.20 N/m for high-Cu mattes (70 mass% Cu2S). Matte-speciﬁc elec-
trical conductances are 200e1000 U-cm (Liu et al., 1980; Pound et al., 1955).
4.3.4 Off-gas
The off-gas from smelting contains SO2 generated by the smelting reactions, N2 from the
air used for oxidizing the concentrate, and small amounts of CO2, H2O and volatilized
Figure 4.11 Cu2SeFeS phase diagram redrawn from Schlegel & Schuller, 1952. Actual matte melting
temperatures are lower than the liquidus line temperature due to impurities in the matte.
82
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

impurity compounds. The strength of the off-gas is usually 10e60 vol.-% SO2. The
strength depends on the type of O2-containing gas used for smelting, the amount of
air allowed to leak into the furnace, and the grade of matte produced. The concentration
of SO2 (vol.-%SO2) in smelter off-gases has risen in recent years. This is due to increased
use of oxygen in smelting, which reduces the amounts of nitrogen and hydrocarbon
combustion gases passing through the furnace.
Smelter off-gases may also contain substantial levels of dust (up to 0.3 kg/Nm3). This
dust comes from (a) small particles of unreacted concentrate or ﬂux, (b) droplets of matte/
slag that did not settle into the slag layer in the furnace, and (c) volatilized elements in the
concentrate such as arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and lead, which have either solidiﬁed as
the gas cools or reacted to form nonvolatile compounds. The dust generally contains
20e40 mass% Cu, making it potentially valuable. It is nearly always recycled to the smelt-
ing furnace, but it may be treated hydrometallurgically to recover Cu and remove dele-
terious impurities from the smelting circuit (Chapter 21).
4.4 The copper converting process
During smelting, formation of magnetite (reaction 4.18) has been controlled by addition
of silica (4.19) and activity of FeS has gradually decreased. The molten products of the
smelting process are then separated, normally in a settling process within the smelting
reactor or in a separate vessel. Matte then is ready to continue its copper making journey.
From the thermodynamic point of view, using the Yazawa predominance diagram,
copper matte must be transformed to blister copper by further reducing the sulfur poten-
tial and increasing the oxygen potential. This process is represented in Fig. 4.12 by the
black arrow across the path A / B / C / D for batch converting, as follows:
•
Path A / B: Slag Blowing:
•
Path B / C: Copper blowing:
In continuous converting, on the other hand, the process will follow the path A0/ C0
for a continuous converting process. Location of points A0 and C0 in the predominance
diagram will depend on the smelting practice and type of continuous converting process.
4.4.1 Reactions involved in batch converting
During the slag blowing stage, copper content in matte is increased by the elimination of
remaining FeS in the copper matte and formation of slags:
FeSðlÞ þ 3=2O2ðgÞ/FeOðsÞþSO2ðgÞ
(4.25)
FeOðsÞ þ SiO2ðsÞ/FeO  SiO2ðl; slagÞ
(4.20)
Pyrometallurgical processing of copper concentrates

2 FeSðlÞ þ 7=2O2ðgÞ/Fe2O3ðsÞ þ 2 SO2ðgÞ
(4.26)
FeOðsÞ þ Fe2O3ðsÞ/Fe3O4ðsÞ
(4.19)
6 FeOðsÞ þ O2ðgÞ/2 Fe3O4ðsÞ
(4.27)
Copper oxide formation will also increase as the activity of FeS decreases, and there is
not enough FeS to drive the equilibrium of reaction 4.15 to the formation of Cu2S:
FeS (l, in matte) þ Cu2O (l, in slag) / Cu2S (l, in matte) þ FeO (l, in slag)(4.16)
At a given point of the process, slag is skimmed (point B), and matte is charged once
again, resulting in an increase of the sulfur potential and therefore a reduction in copper
matte grade (backwards in path AB), and the oxidation process continues. This process is
repeated several times until there is enough high-grade matte (point B) to continue with
the converting of copper sulﬁde.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Copper blowing will eliminate a small amount of the remaining iron (w2% Fe in
matte) and gradually remove the remaining sulfur from Cu2S, as follows:
Cu2SðsÞþO2ðgÞ/2 CuðlÞþSO2ðgÞ
(4.13)
2Cu2OðlÞ þ Cu2SðgÞ/6CuðlÞ þ SO2ðgÞ
(4.28)
The copper blows will end when reaction 4.28 cannot proceed any more as Cu2S has
completely converted. The end point represented by Point D in Fig. 4.12 corresponds to
sulfur levels between 300 and 500 ppm.
4.4.2 Reactions involved in continuous converting
Continuous copper converting chemistry varies depending on the technology applied to
convert copper matte. In general terms, these processes can be classiﬁed into the
following categories:
•
Continuous converting with two molten phases: Copper sulﬁde is fully converted to
copper, with the remaining sulfur dissolved in the copper. Molten phases are slag and
copper
•
Continuous converting with three molten phases: Blister copper is in equilibrium
with copper sulﬁde (white metal) and slag.
The above classiﬁcation can be explained with the help of the CueS phase diagram
shown in Fig. 4.13. Let us consider a continuous converting process at 1200C.
The endpoint of the converting process is deﬁned by the speciﬁc amount of oxygen
provided for the converting reactions. If the amount of oxygen is below the amount
required to completely convert Cu2S to Cu, represented by Point c in the phase
diagram, the generated blister copper will be in equilibrium with Cu2S at a composition
of 80% copper, represented by Point a, in the ﬁgure. Therefore, the blister copper
will be saturated with Cu2S. The minimum amount of sulfur required to achieve this
condition is about 1% at 1200C. On the other hand, if enough oxygen is supplied
to convert Cu2S, the generated blister copper will be in the region represented by
the range of compositions betweenc and d, and only two molten phases will be in
equilibrium.
From the chemistry point of view, chemical reactions will depend on the type of pro-
cess, the choice of ﬂash or bath converting, and the slag chemistry involved (calcium
ferrite or olivine slags). A more detailed explanation is given in the continuous converting
chapter.

4.5 The reﬁning process
The last step in the copper making process is the reﬁning of blister, represented by the
path C / D / E for batch converting and C0/ E for continuous converting. The
process consists of two steps:
•
Oxidation to remove the remaining sulfur
•
Reduction aimed to reduce oxygen
The main chemical reactions involved are as follows:
Oxidation:
O2ðgÞ ¼ 2Oðin copperÞ
(4.29)
Sðin copperÞ þ 2 Oðin copperÞ ¼ SO2ðgÞ
(4.30)
Reduction:
CðsÞ þ Oðin copperÞ ¼ COðgÞ
(4.31)
COðgÞ þ Oðin copperÞ ¼ CO2ðgÞ
(4.32)
H2ðgÞ þ Oðin copperÞ ¼ H2OðgÞ
(4.33)
A detailed explanation of this process is given in Chapter 12.

phases in equilibrium. Two molten phases in equilibrium (zone dec) correspond to blister copper in
equilibrium with molten slag. Three molten phases in equilibrium (zone bec) correspond to molten

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

4.6 Minor elements
Copper concentrates, given their nature, also contain minor valuable and deleterious el-
ements. These elements have been present in relatively small concentrations compared
with copper, sulfur, iron, and gangue materials. Typical minor metals are gold and silver
(precious metals), nickel, lead, cobalt, bismuth, zinc, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, sele-
nium, and tellurium. In addition, halides and radioactive elements such as uranium
also report in copper concentrates.
However, as copper consumption has dramatically increased in recent years (Alvear
Flores et al., 2018), more complex copper concentrates have been processed in copper
smelters, gradually increasing the concentration of minor elements. Elements of concern
include arsenic, antimony, and bismuth due to their nature and detrimental impact dur-
ing the electroreﬁning process (Moats et al., 2016).
A great effort has been done to understand the behavior of these elements under cop-
per making conditions (Chaubal et al., 1989; Chen et al., 2010; Itagaki & Yazawa, 1982;
Nagamori & Chaubal, 1982a,b; Takeda et al., 1983). Behavior of minor elements in the
overall copper making process will depend on their speciﬁc mineralogy, physical and
chemical properties, and afﬁnity with the respective formed phases in smelting, convert-
ing, and reﬁning.
Process engineers need to understand the behavior of each one of these elements to
•
Optimize recovery of valuable metals that will contribute to the smelting business.
•
Optimize the removal of deleterious elements that will affect the copper cathode
properties.
•
Deﬁne suitable slag compositions to optimize removal of certain elements.
•
Deﬁne individual minor element capacities for each smelting technology.
•
Deﬁne optimum outlets for minor elements.
The recovery of minor valuable elements is normally achieved via the following:
•
Leaching of metallurgical dusts generated in the copper smelting and converting
processes,
•
Concentration and crystallization of electrolyte,
•
Recovery from copper slimes from the electroreﬁning process.
4.6.1 Deportment of minor elements
Once minor elements are under given oxygen and sulfur potentials, they will distribute
among the condensed and gas phases, depending on their relative afﬁnity for each phase.
Minor element deportment to each phase will be deﬁned by the following aspects,
among others:
•
Matte grade (and therefore oxygen and sulfur potential),
Pyrometallurgical processing of copper concentrates
87

•
Stability of each element as oxide, sulﬁde, or metallic form,
•
Partial pressure of each formed minor element species,
•
Process temperature,
•
Total off-gas volume,
•
Slag capacity for each minor element,
•
Activity coefﬁcient of each minor element species in their respective molten phase,
•
Degree of agitation of the reactor.
Several authors have developed thermodynamic models to explain the deportment of
minor elements during smelting, converting, and reﬁning Alvear Flores et al., 1999;
Chaubal et al., 1989; Chen & Jahanshahi, 2010; Itagaki et al., 2002; Nagamori & Chau-
bal, 1982a, 1982b; Tan & Zhang, 1997; Kim and Sohn, 1996).
Thermodynamic packages have also incorporated existing information to predict mi-
nor element behavior. Fig. 4.14 shows the predictions for As distribution based on the
MPE CSIRO package.
Minor element deportment between phases varies depending on process conditions
and applied technologies. Table 4.3 compares some key minor element distributions dur-
ing smelting for the ﬂash furnace (Moats et al., 2016), TSLeISASMELT, Dongying Fan-
gyuan, and Mitsubishi processes. Technology providers normally will argue about their
speciﬁc technology advantages for efﬁcient removal of minor elements to the gas and slag
phases. However, process engineers must be careful when using this information, as oper-
ating conditions under which these data were collected are sometimes not directly
comparable.
In addition, smelting process conditions and, subsequently, deportment behavior
must be revised in light with increasing environmental restrictions. This is especially
applicable to smelting slags, if they are to be valorized for other applications (Klaffenbach
et al., 2018).

4.6.2 Recovery of minor elements
The focus for the removal of deleterious elements is to deﬁne appropriate operating con-
ditions to achieve the expected anode speciﬁcations required by the electroreﬁning pro-
cess. On the other hand, for valuable elements, process engineers are expected to deﬁne
suitable conditions to maximize their recovery. Both objectives although seemingly con-
tradictory have in common the need for secondary processes to recover these elements,
followed by disposal or sale. These objectives are normally achieved via the following:
•
Leaching of metallurgical dusts generated by copper smelting and converting
processes
•
Removal of impurities from the electrolyte
•
Neutralization of acid plant efﬂuents
•
Recovery from copper slimes from the electroreﬁning process.

4.6.2.1 Dust leaching
Used for removal and stabilization of deleterious elements and recovery of copper and
precious metals. This option is an alternative for smelters that requires to bleed impurities
as their main outlets so that their levels in slag and anode copper are below standard limits.
Industrial examples for this alternative are the Ecometales dust leaching plant in Calama,
Chile, and the Glencore Mount Isa Mine smelting dust leaching plant in Queensland,
Australia.
4.6.2.2 Removal of impurities from the electrolyte
Integrated to the copper electroreﬁning process, some amount of electrolyte must be pu-
riﬁed to maintain the electrolyte solution under the required standard to achieve efﬁcient
copper electrodeposition. This process is carried out in three main steps:
•
Copper electrowinning,
•
Electrowinning of As, Sb, and Bi,
•
Evaporation and crystallization of nickel
These processes are discussed in the copper electroreﬁning chapter.
4.6.2.3 Neutralization of efﬂuents of the acid plant
As minor elements are volatilized from the smelting and converting processes, some of
the formed species cannot condense and are carried out to the gas cleaning section of
the acid plant and removed into a liquid efﬂuent that must be neutralized.
4.6.2.4 Removal and recovery from copper anode slimes
Precious metals and other valuable elements such as selenium, tellurium, and tin precip-
itate to the bottom of the electrolytic cells during the electro reﬁning processes. Tank
house sections are periodically cleaned, and slimes are removed from each cell and
ﬁltered. The recovered slimes are processed in a dedicated precious metal plant and valu-
able elements are recovered via a series of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical
processes.
4.7 Summary
The pyrometallurgical production of copper from sulﬁde concentrates is a journey
involving the gradual oxidation of copper concentrates in sequential steps. These steps
are smelting, converting, and reﬁning. In some special cases, copper can be produced
in a single step, when iron content is low enough to produce a reasonably low amount
of slag. The overall copper making process can be explained by using the oxygenesulfur
predominance diagrams. This tool is a navigation chart to understand the overall copper
making process.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

A proper understanding of the inﬂuence of the sulfur and oxygen potential is needed
to deﬁne proper operating points by selecting appropriate matte grade for the smelting
process, adequate slag compositions to ensure suitable slag quality, and controlled copper
losses.

Pyrometallurgical processing of copper concentrates

CHAPTER 5
Theory to practice: pyrometallurgical
industrial processes
5.1 General considerations
As indicated in Chapter 4, pyrometallurgical processing of copper concentrates is based
on the continuous management of the sulfur and oxygen potentials. This is done in
sequential stages to control the heat released from the chemical reactions, and the overall
copper recovery.
The sulfureoxygen potential management principle is the corner stone used by
technologists for the development and design of pyrometallurgical processes. This metal-
lurgical principle is applied in conjunction with core technology principles to deﬁne
appropriate metallurgical conditions under which a deﬁned technology could be applied
to the processing a given feedstock.
Selection of operating parameters will be driven by design considerations associated
with aspects such as the following:
•
Concentrate mineralogy and particle size distribution for each of the present species.
•
Igniting characteristics of the copper concentrate to be processed.
•
Composition and nature of gangue materials: Relevant to deﬁne suitable slag compo-
sition, and overall heat load that the process can handle.
•
Matte grade: relevant to deﬁne overall smelting-converting heat release for each stage
and ﬁrst-pass copper recovery.
•
Operating temperature: Some technologies will choose to operate with superheated
slag or under the slag liquidus temperature. This strategy will impact the reactor
design and expected furnace campaign life, depending one use of intensive reactor
cooling.
•
Oxygen enrichment: A relevant element to determine the overall reactor heat bal-
ance, off-gas handling requirements, and volatilization of minor elements.
•
Fe/SiO2 ratio: To deﬁne slag generation and ﬁrst copper pass recovery.
•
Furnace heat management: Deﬁne the degree of cooling required by the reactor and
indirectly the overall furnace campaign.
•
Moisture content: Required in some cases to minimize feed carryover and heat
balance of the process (bath smelting). However, increases the off-gas volume
handling and affects the water balance in the gas cleaning plant.
The above-mentioned parameters are part of general design criteria used by technol-
ogist to engineer pyrometallurgical process and operating parameters to be controlled by

process engineers. The next chapters will show how these parameters are applied in the
design and operation of the ﬂash and bath smelting technologies, currently under use in
pyrometallurgical processing.
5.2 Technology evolution since 1970
The ﬁrst edition of Extractive Metallurgy of Copper was published during a pivotal time in
the development of the copper smelting industry. The world was facing an oil crisis that
transformed the industry, gradually replacing reverberatory furnaces into ﬂash smelting
and bath smelting technologies, increasing the sulfur capture, and reducing the consump-
tion of fuel. Many smelters, operating old fashion high oil consumption technologies
(reverberatory furnace technology), were forced to shut down as their operating costs
were not competitive at that time (Mackey et al., 2014). Energy consumption was in
comparison 60% higher than current average of modern bath and ﬂash smelting technol-
ogies (Coursol et al., 2015).
At the time that the ﬁrst edition of Extractive Metallurgy of Copper was published, new
processes, such as the Noranda, El Teniente, and the Mitsubishi, were in their initial stage
of development, while the ﬂash smelting was the main technology option available to
modernize smelters, with 22 new ﬂash smelters licensed by 1976 (Mackey et al.,
2014). Since then, the copper industry has seen several technological changes aimed to
support to growing demand for copper (three times increase from 1976 to 2018). Tech-
nologies such as the Noranda, El Teniente, Top Submerged Lance (ISASMELT and
Ausmelt (now Metso-Outotec-Ausmelt), Mitsubishi Process, Vanyukov, and most
recently the full spectrum of new Chinese technology developments are now treating
large tonnages of copper concentrate in a single furnace.
During the last 40 years, the copper industry has witnessed dramatic technology
changes to support the growing copper demand. The ﬁrst golden age of development
from 1970 to 1985, with the development of bath smelting technologies, has been
followed by the gradual modernization of smelters, driven by increasing copper demand,
cost reduction, and increasing environmental regulations. Then, since 1995, the copper
industry has witnessed the implementation of brown and greenﬁeld projects, and the
increasing of smelters average copper processing capacities from below 100,000 tonnes
per year to levels of 400,000 tonnes per year (Risopatron, 2020). Fig. 5.1 shows a
comparison of smelter capacities between 1980 and 2013.
Fig. 5.2 identiﬁes some technological milestones over the last 40 years in the copper
smelting industry. Some selected milestones have been the following:
•
1973 e Development of the Noranda Reactor: Originally aimed to produce blister
copper, this bath smelting technology allowed the production of high matte grade
(Tarassoff, 1984).

Australia, the technology was industrially developed by Mount Isa Mines
(ISASMELT) and Metso-Outotec-Ausmelt (Previously Ausmelt) and applied to
the processing of base metals (Arthur & Hunt, 2005; Floyd, 2005).
•

Arizona, and Mount Isa, Australia (Bhappu, Larson, & Tunis, 1993).
•
1995 e Kennecott-Outokumpu Flash Converting plant starts operating, providing a
new option for continuous converting of copper (Newman, 1998).

•
2018 e Implementation of new environmental regulations for sulfur emission in

This technological evolution has been also driven by the increasing demand for high
environmental performance standards required by local authorities to copper smelters,
aimed to increase sulfur capture from main off-gas streams, secondary emissions from
converter aisles, and management of deleterious elements such as arsenic, lead, and hal-
ogens elements, among others.
Over the last 20 years, several smelters were required to update their technologies to
meet these new standards. Table 5.1 shows a selection of modernization projects
executed in the last 20 years.
In terms of technology, Fig. 5.3 compares the melting technology distribution since
1995 (Risopatron, 2020). Flash smelting continues to be the dominant technology;
however, bath smelting technologies have grown in acceptance since 1995.
By 2020, there are not many copper smelters left behind to transform their respective
operational conﬁgurations from old technology to modern technologies and several
Chinese smelters are now in operation with a combination of Flash Furnace, TSL
furnaces, Bottom Blowing Smelting, Side Blowing Smelting, among others. Table 5.2
lists a comparison between main smelting and converting technologies in 1995 and 2019.

5.3 Copper making technology classiﬁcation
For purpose of proper metallurgical and engineering design understanding, copper
making technologies are classiﬁed as follows:
•
Flash smelting and converting technologies
•
Bath smelting and converting technologies
•
Continuous copper making technologies
Table 5.3 describes main features of copper making technologies and current
applications for each category.
For ﬂash and cyclone smelting technologies, the main principle is the ignition of dried
feed with enriched air or pure oxygen at the outlet of a burner, followed by the free fall
and combustion of the particles into a settler to allow reduction of overoxidized particles
and separation of phase. Fundamental principles and detailed technology discussions for
the Flash and Cyclone smelting and converting technologies are presented in Chapter 6.
For bath smelting and converting technologies, the main principle is the reaction
between feed (concentrate or matte) and oxygen (air or oxygen-enriched air) into the
copper matte/blister/slag molten phases, depending on the process and technology.
The main chemical reactions and more details discussions are presented for the following
bath smelting technologies in Chapter 7:
•
Noranda, El Teniente, and Vanyukov Technologies.
•
Bottom Blowing and Side Blowing Technologies.
•
Top Submerged Lance technology (ISASMELT, Metso Outotec AusmeltMet).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Continuous or direct production of copper has been also focusing of development in
the copper making industry. The following applications are based on the number of
stages required to produce copper:
Single stage direct to blister production: Based in ﬂash smelting/converting principles.
Dry feed is ignited with oxygen-enriched air at the outlet of a burner, reduction of
overoxidized materials in a settler, and subsequent separation of gas and molten phases
(blister copper from slag). Slag is further reduced in an electric furnace allowing recovery
of copper. Copper is further reﬁned in anode furnaces. The principles and applications of
this technology are discussed in Chapter 9.
Two stages anode copper production: Newly developed technology by Dongying
Fangyuan in China. This combines continuous smelting of copper concentrate into
high matte grade in the smelting reactor and continuous matte tapping into a
convertingereﬁning reactor. Slag from the smelting reactor is batch tapped. The
convertingereﬁning process is gradually done in a single reactor by managing
the oxygenesulfur potential with addition of aireoxygenenatural gas, as required.
The process is continuous from the chemical reaction point of view but batch from
the tapping point of view. Oxygen-enriched air is added via bottom tuyeres (lances)
into the reactors. Two convertingereﬁning reactors give the required buffer capacity
required by the smelting reactor. Copper is cast into anodes and sent to the electroreﬁn-
ing process.
Three stages blister copper production: The Mitsubishi process is a cascade arrange-
ment of three reactors for smelting, slag cleaning, and converting (Goto et al., 1998).
Feeding materials are injected into the matte phase in the smelting furnace which kept

where matte and slag are separated. Copper matte ﬂows into the converting furnace
where is further oxidized into blister copper. Oxygen-enriched air is added by lances
into the molten matte (smelting) and copper (converting furnace). Further details of
the Mitsubishi process are discussed in Chapter 9. In addition, Chinese technologists
have developed a three-stage copper making process using bottom blowing technology
as core principle (Yongcheng et al., 2019).

demonstrations of the efforts made to reduce operating cost, increase productivity,
improve environmental performance, and remain competitive in a low margin business.
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the copper smelting technology business has
witnessed the consolidation of large-scale smelting. As shown in Fig. 5.1, the joint
proportion of smelters between 900e1500 and over 1500 kt/y increased from a com-
bined total of 29%e70% from year 2000 to year 2017, with most of the western plants

western smelting plants with smelting capacities over 300 ktpa achieved with one smelt-
ing reactor (Concentrate throughput equivalent to over 1.2 mtpa) (ICSG Data base,
2017).
Most of the plants listed in Table 5.4 were upgraded and have increased their capacity
since year 2000 and their instantaneous smelting throughput.
High-intensity smelting has been facilitated by technical developments aimed to
enhance the performance of plants in aspects such as the following:
•
Ultradense phase injection in bath smelting furnaces to increase instantaneous feed
rate at higher availabilities and equipment reliability (Coleman and Money, 2008;
Coleman, 2016)
•
Intensive cooling for reactors to increase furnace campaign and throughput (Konefal
et al., 2016; Joubert et al., 2016)
•
Improvements in drilling and tapping operations to improve overall plant availability
(Musuka et al., 2019)
•
Development of more efﬁcient and environmentally friendly rotary dryers (Tuominen
& Berg, 2019)
•
Conveying and feeding systems (Firky et al., 2019; Tajla et al., 2019)
•
Improvements in ﬂash smelter burners to reduce dust generation and improve
combustion quality (Chen et al., 2016)
•
Further development in boiler performance by using special coatings to increase tube
life (Martinez, 2013)
•
On-line monitoring systems for refractory thickness (Sadri et al., 2016; Vukovic et al.,
2016)
•
Furnace integrity and Refractory material improvements to increase furnace
campaign length (Degel et al., 2016; Degel, Joubert, Filwiezer, Filwiezer, & Hanel,
2019; Wallner et al., 2016)

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

5.5 Chinese technology developments since 2000
China has become the largest smelting country in the world; as in the last decade, an
increasing effort has been done by Chinese technologists to adapt existing processes
and/or create new ones to meet their country needs. Table 5.5 shows a selected list of
brownﬁeld and greenﬁeld projects implemented in China in the last 15 years using
with different technology conﬁgurations (Tang, 2018; ISCG, 2019; Tang, 2019; Zhang,
2018). Flash technologies are still the most relevant technology package selected for
large-scale smelting. However, for intermediate size smelting, bath smelting technologies
seem to be predominant.
The main Chinese technology innovations in the last 20 years have been focused on
the following aspects:
•
Development and implementation of the cyclone smelting technology
•
Development and implementation of the bottom blowing smelting and converting
technology
•
Dongying Fangyuan two-stage copper making process and
•
Development and implementation of the side blowing smelting (Wang, 2019)
In addition to their own developments, Chinese technologists have also developed
large-scale smelting using Flash smelting and Converting and Top Submerged Lance
technologies (ISASMELT and Ausmelt-Outotec).
Bing Tan and Supin Yao (Tang, 2019) described in detail the main copper pyromet-
allurgical technological developments in China (2019). They highlight the following
aspects:
•
Cyclone smelting technology: Chinese improvements of the original Flash Smelt-
ing technology, developing a new ﬂash burner that allowed a reduction in dust gen-
eration and copper losses with an increasing availability
•
Bottom blowing smelting (BBS): Based on the QSL and Noranda-El Teniente
processes, this innovation injects high pressureeenriched air into the bath, allowing
the production of high copper matte grade at a relatively low copper content
when compared with Noranda and Teniente technologies (Baojun reference)
•
Continuous Copper Smelting and Converting (BBRs-BBRc): Aimed to small
to medium-size smelters, this technology applies the BBS principle to the converting
of copper matte by continuous transferring of copper matte into the converting
reactor
•
Two-stage copper smelting process (SLS and SLCR): With its origins on the
SKS (BBS) process, the two-stage smelting process combines the smelting of copper
concentrate in the SLS furnace with the converting and reﬁning to produce anode
quality copper in the SLCR furnace.
Theory to practice: pyrometallurgical industrial processes
111

•
Side blowing smelting technology: Originally developed to improve perfor-
mance of reverberatory, blast, and Vanyukov furnaces. The newest version
corresponds to the Jifeng side blowing furnace technology. Oxygen-enriched air is
blown into the slag close to matte layer for smelting, and tuyeres on top of the furnace
are used to supply secondary air.
•
Side-blown Smelting D Top-blown multilance continuous converting
technology: Matte ﬂows continuously from the side blowing smelting furnace
into the converting furnaces where top blowing lances provide the required oxygen
for the converting process.
Selected process parameters applied in Chinese smelting and converting technologies
are shown in Table 5.6. A more detailed descriptions of each of these technologies are
presented in the respective bath smelting, ﬂash smelting, and converting chapters.

projects in the last 15 years (ICSG, 2017; Tang, 2019; Zhang, 2018).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

5.6 Summary
Pyrometallurgical processing of copper concentrates to produce pyroreﬁned copper is
based on the continuous management of the sulfur and oxygen potentials. The oxygene
sulfur potential management is done in sequential stages to control heat released from the
chemical reactions and the overall copper recovery. This principle has been the corner
stone applied by technologists to conceptualize and develop pyrometallurgical copper
making technologies.
Developments over the last 40 years have been focused on increase smelting capacity
in single reactors increasing from the range of 80 tph to over 200 tph. This increase has
been supported by technology developments in several aspects such as reactor design,
sulfur capture, peripherical equipment, plant reliability, and process control.
Since year 2000, the copper business has witnessed an explosive demand for copper
consumption, a global shift of the smelting business to China and the development and
commissioning of mega smelters across the globe with productions to the level of
400,000 tpy of copper.
The last 10 years have been also crucial with the incorporation of innovative smelting
technologies in China.

CHAPTER 6
Flash smelting (Davenport et al., 2001)
Flash smelting accounts for around half of all Cu matte smelting. It entails blowing
oxygen, air, dried CueFeeS concentrate, silica ﬂux, and recycle materials into a 1250
C hearth furnace. Once in the hot furnace, the sulﬁde mineral particles of the concen-
trate (e.g., CuFeS2) react rapidly with the O2 of the blast. This results in controlled oxida-
tion of the concentrates Fe and S, a large evolution of heat and melting of the solids.
The process is continuous. When extensive oxygen enrichment of the blast is prac-
ticed, it is nearly autothermal. It is perfectly matched to smelting ﬁne particulate concen-
trates (w100 mm) produced by froth ﬂotation.
The products of ﬂash smelting are the following:
1. molten CueFeeS matte, w65% Cu, considerably richer in Cu than the input
concentrate
2. molten ironesilicate slag containing 1 or 2% Cu
3. hot dusteladen offgas containing 30e70 vol.-% SO2.
Three ﬂash furnaces produce molten copper directly from concentrate (Chapter 5).
Two other Metso Outotec ﬂash furnaces produce molten copper from solidiﬁed/ground
matte. This is ﬂash converting (Chapter 8).
The goals of ﬂash smelting are to produce the following:
1. molten matte at constant composition and temperature for feeding to converters
2. slag which, when treated for Cu recovery, contains only a tiny fraction of the Cu
input to the ﬂash furnace
3. offgas strong enough in SO2 for its efﬁcient capture as sulfuric acid.
There are two types of ﬂash smelting: the Metso Outotec process (w44 furnaces in
operation), and the Inco process (2 furnaces in operation). The Outotec process was
formerly known as the Outokumpu process, and may occasionally be referred to in
this chapter by the previous name.
6.1 Metso Outotec ﬂash furnace
Fig. 6.1 shows a typical 2010 design Metso Outotec ﬂash furnace. It is 26 m long, 8 m
wide, and 2 m high (all dimensions inside the refractories). It has a 7 m diameter, 8 m
high reaction shaft and a 5 m diameter, 10 m high off-gas uptake. It has one concentrate
burner and is designed to smelt up to 4500 tonnes of concentrate per day. It has four
matte tapholes and four slag tapholes.
Outotec ﬂash furnaces vary considerably in size and shape (Tables 6.1 and 6.2). How-
ever, they all have the following ﬁve main features:

1. concentrate burners (usually one, but a few have four) which combine dry particulate
feed with O2-bearing blast and blow them downward into the furnace
2. a reaction shaft where most of the reaction between O2 and CueFeeS feed particles
takes place
3. a settler where molten matte and slag droplets collect and form separate layers
4. water-cooled copper block tapholes for removing molten matte and slag
5. an uptake for removing hot SO2-bearing offgas.
6.1.1 Construction details (Fagerlund et al., 2010)
The interior of a Metso Outotec ﬂash furnace consists of high-purity direct-bonded
magnesiaechrome bricks. The bricks are backed by water-cooled copper cooling jackets
on the walls and by sheet steel elsewhere. Reaction shaft and uptake refractory is backed
by water-cooled copper cooling jackets or by sheet steel, cooled with water on the
outside.
The furnace rests on a 2-cm thick steel plate on steel-reinforced concrete pillars. The
bottom of the furnace is air cooled by forced convection. Much of the furnace structure is
in operating condition after 11 years of use ( Janney et al., 2007). Slag line bricks may have
eroded, but the furnace can usually continue to operate without them. This is because
magnetite-rich slag deposits on cool regions of the furnace walls.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

6.1.2 Cooling jackets
Recent design cooling jackets are solid copper with Monel 400 (Nie30%Cu) alloy tube
embedded inside. The tube is bent into many turns to maximize heat transfer from the
solid copper to water ﬂowing in the Monel tube (McKenna, Voermann, et al., 2010).
The hot face of the cooling jacket is cast in a wafﬂe shape. This provides a jagged face
for refractory retention and magnetite slag deposition. Jackets are typically 0.75 
0.75  0.1 m thick with 0.03 m diameter, 0.004 m wall Monel tube. The use of these
jackets over increasing areas of the furnace is a key to increasing campaign life and
reducing air inﬁltration to the furnace ( Jin et al., 2016; Romppanen et al., 2019). It is
now possible to cover almost all of the furnace.
A problem with the use of water in cooling jackets is the possibility of leaks into the
furnace ( Jin et al., 2016). These leaks are a safety risk, due to the potential for steam explo-
sions (Kennedy et al., 2015). As a result, several alternative cooling ﬂuids are being consid-
ered as a replacement, both for furnace and taphole cooling elements. New systems created
by Metso Outotec can detect water leaks and minimize water usage (Bjöklund et al., 2013).
6.1.3 Concentrate burner (Fig. 6.2)
Dry concentrate and O2-rich blast are combined in the furnace reaction shaft by blowing
them through a concentrate burner. Dry ﬂux, recycle dust, and crushed reverts (matte
and slag inadvertently frozen during transport around the smelter) are also added through
the burner. A year 2010 concentrate burner consists of the following:
1. an annulus through which O2-rich blast is blown into the reaction shaft
2. a central pipe through which concentrate falls into the reaction shaft
3. a distributor cone at the burner tip, which blows air horizontally through the
descending solid feed.
Special attention is paid to uniform distribution of blast and solid feed throughout the re-
action shaft. It is achieved by introducing blast and solids vertically and uniformly into quad-
rants around the burner and by blowing the solids outwards with central jet distributor air.
Continued development of the ﬂash furnace over the past decade has focused on
improving burner operations (Romppanen et al., 2019). The use of computational ﬂuid
dynamics to predict the impact of changing conditions has been especially important
( Jastrzebski et al., 2013; Jokilaakso & Taskinen, 2019; Otaka et al., 2016). The goals
of burner improvements include increasing capacity, decreasing dust generation, and
maximizing oxygen efﬁciency. Important factors include the levels of oxygen enrich-
ment, combustion gas velocity, feed injection angle, and burner aperture size.
A variation of this burner design is the Sumitomo-type concentrate burner which uses
an oxygenefuel burner located at the central jet distributor to accelerate the ignition of
the concentrate particles (Nagai et al., 2013; Otaka et al., 2016). Experiments have shown
that blowing some of the air from the side reduces dust generation by about one fourth,
although at some cost to oxygen efﬁciency.
Flash smelting
125

A signiﬁcant new development in burner design has been the invention of a “pulse
cyclone” burner to replace the sleeve-type style burner designed by Outokumpu
(Zhou, 2013). This replaces the central feed nozzle with tangential introduction of
concentrate to the burner head using the combustion “air” (70%e90% O2), which causes
a swirling cyclonic motion, rotating at 100e200 m/s. A small amount of oxygen is pulsed
through the center of the cyclone. This changes the nature of the cones of swirling par-
ticles exiting the burner, The result is called “rotationesuspension” smelting, which re-
duces the dust generation, allows processing of up to 400 tonnes per hour of concentrate,
and apparently eliminates the need for fuel combustion. This burner is used so far only in
China, but there may be more like these in the future.
6.1.4 Supplementary hydrocarbon fuel burners
All Metso Outotec ﬂash furnaces are equipped with hydrocarbon fuel burners atop the
reaction shaft and through the settler walls and roof. Shaft-top burners keep the process
in thermal balance. Settler burners eliminate cool zones in the furnace. They are also used
to adjust slag temperature.

w100 mm, silica ﬂux, w1 mm, recycle dust, and recycle crushed reverts, w1 mm.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

6.1.5 Matte and slag tapholes
Molten matte and slag are tapped through single-hole water-cooled copper chill blocks
embedded in the furnace walls. The holes are typically 60e80 mm diameter. They are
plugged with moist ﬁreclay which is solidiﬁed by the heat of the furnace when the
clay is pushed into the hole. They are opened by chipping out the clay and by melting
it out with steel oxygen lances. Matte is tapped via copper or refractory-lined steel laun-
ders into cast steel ladles for transport to converting. Matte is also granulated to w0.5 mm
granules in a water torrent when Outotec ﬂash converting is used instead of Peircee
Smith converting (Chapter 8). Slag is tapped down water-cooled copper launders into
(a) an electric settling furnace for Cu settling and recovery or (b) ladles for truck haulage
to Cu recovery by slow cooling/grinding/ﬂotation.
Both withdrawals are only partial. Reservoirs of matte and slag (w0.5 m deep each)
are maintained in the furnace. Tapping of matte is continuously rotated around its tap-
holes. This washes out solid buildups on the furnace ﬂoor by providing matte ﬂow over
the entire hearth.
Tapping is one of the more dangerous aspects of ﬂash furnace operation, especially
when oxygen lances are used to open the taphole (Romppanen et al., 2019). As furnace
capacities grow, continuous tapping may be more feasible in the future ( Jokilaakso &
Taskinen, 2019).
6.2 Peripheral equipment
The Metso Outotec ﬂash furnace is surrounded by the following:
1. concentrate blending equipment
2. solids feed dryer
3. ﬂash furnace feed bins and feed system
4. oxygen plant
5. blast preheater (optional)
6. waste heat boiler (Chapter 11)
7. dust recovery and recycle system
8. gas cleaning system (Chapter 11)
9. sulfuric acid plant (Chapter 11)
10. secondary gas collection and treatment system (Chapter 11)
11. Cu-from-slag recovery system (Chapter 10)
6.2.1 Concentrate blending system
Most ﬂash furnaces smelt several concentrates plus small amounts of miscellaneous mate-
rials, such as precipitate Cu. They also smelt recycle dust, sludges, slag ﬂotation concen-
trate, and reverts. These materials are blended to give constant composition feed to the
Flash smelting
127

ﬂash furnace. Constant composition feed is the surest way to ensure smooth ﬂash furnace
operation and continuous attainment of target compositions and temperatures.
Two techniques are used:
1. bin-onto-belt blending by which individual feed materials are dropped from holding
bins at controlled rates onto a moving conveyor belt
2. bedding, where layers of individual feed materials are placed on long (occasionally cir-
cular) shaped piles, then reclaimed as vertical slices of blend (Urbaniak et al., 2019).
The blended feed is sent to a dryer. Flux may be included in the blending or added
just before the dryer.
6.2.2 Solids feed dryer
Concentrate and ﬂux are always dried prior to ﬂash smelting to ensure even ﬂow through
the concentrate burner. Steam and rotary dryers are used (Chen & Mansikkaviita, 2006;
Hoshi et al., 2010; Talja et al., 2010). The water contents of moist and dry feed are typi-
cally 6%14% and 0.2 mass% H2O.
Rotary dryers evaporate water by passing hot gas from natural gas or oil combustion
through the moist feed. The temperature of the drying gas is kept below w500C (by
adding nitrogen, recycle combustion gas, or air) to avoid spontaneous oxidation of the
concentrate. Some smelters recycle anode furnace offgas (Chapter 11) or warm air
from acid plant SO3 coolers to their rotary dryers to decrease fuel consumption. In addi-
tion, steam from the ﬂash furnace waste heat boiler can also be used to indirectly preheat
rotary kiln air to decrease fuel consumption (Hoshi et al., 2010).
Steam dryers rotate hot, steam-heated stainless steel coils through the moist feed.
Modern designs have a drum that rotates in the same direction as the steam coils to mini-
mize tube wear and improve water evaporation efﬁciency.
Steam drying has the advantages of the following:
1. efﬁcient use of ﬂash furnace waste heat boiler steam
2. little SO2, dust, and off-gas evolution because hydrocarbon combustion is not used
3. low risk of concentrate ignition because steam drying is done at a lower temperature
(w200C) than combustion gas drying (w500C)
4. approximately 14% less energy consumption than a similar capacity rotary dryer
(Chen & Mansikkaviita, 2006)
5. steam drying is being adopted widely in new and existing Outotec ﬂash smelters with
capacities in a single dryer up to 200 t/h wet feed (Talja et al., 2010)
6.2.3 Bin and feed system
Dried feed is blown up from the dryer by a pneumatic lift system (Walker et al., 2010). It
is caught in acrylic bags and dropped into bins above the ﬂash furnace reaction shaft. It
is fed from these bins onto drag or screw (preferred) conveyors and sometimes into a
128
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

loss-in-weight feeder (Reed & Coleman, 2019; Romppanen et al., 2019). From the loss-
in-weight feeder, it ﬂows on an air slide to the concentrate burner. The rate of feeding is
adjusted by varying the speed of the conveyors below the bins. The use of the loss-in-
weight feeder provides an accurate measurement of the mass ﬂow of feed to the furnace.
Older feed systems were based on volumetric ﬂow. A recent innovation is FeedGuard,
which continually measures the evenness of the concentrate ﬂow to the burner. This
allows quick detection of blockages and other problems and thus quicker response.
Bin design is critical for controlled feeding of the ﬂash furnace. Fine dry ﬂash furnace
feed tends to hang up on the bin walls or ﬂood into the concentrate burner. This is
avoided by mass ﬂow bins (Dudley, 2009) that are steep enough and smooth enough
to give even ﬂow throughout the bin.
6.2.4 Oxygen plant
The principal oxygen plant in an Outotec ﬂash smelter is usually a cryogenic liquefac-
tion/distillation unit producing 200e1100 tonnes oxygen per day. It delivers
92e99.95 vol.-% O2 industrial oxygen gas (0.8e2 bar gauge) to the ﬂash furnace
(Deneys et al., 2007). Some smelters also use molecular sieve oxygen plants (vacuum
pressure swing absorption or pressure swing absorption) to supplement their liquefac-
tion/distillation oxygen. Molecular sieve plants are small (<200 tonnes oxygen/day)
units that produce oxygen with a purity of around 90 vol.-% O2; Ar is the main impurity.
They are suitable for incremental additions to the output of the main oxygen plant.
Oxygen-enriched blast is prepared by mixing industrial oxygen and air as they ﬂow to
the concentrate burner. The oxygen is added through a diffuser (holed pipe) protruding
into the air duct. The diffuser is located about six duct diameters ahead of the concentrate
burner to ensure good mixing.
The rates at which oxygen and air ﬂow into the concentrate burner are important
ﬂash furnace control parameters. They are measured by oriﬁce or mass ﬂow ﬂowmeters
and are adjusted by butterﬂy valves.
6.2.5 Blast heater (optional)
A few Metso Outotec ﬂash furnaces use heated blast. The blast is heated typically to
100e450C using hydrocarbon-ﬁred shell-and-tube heat exchangers. Hot blast ensures
rapid CueFeeS concentrate ignition in the ﬂash furnace. It also provides energy for
smelting. Modern, highly oxygen-enriched ﬂash furnaces use ambient (w30C) blast.
Concentrate ignition is rapid with this blast at all temperatures.
6.2.6 Waste heat boiler
Offgas leaves an Outotec ﬂash furnace at about 1300 C. Its sensible heat is recovered as
steam in a horizontal waste heat boiler (Chapter 11).
Flash smelting
129

6.2.7 Dust recovery and recycle system
Metso Outotec ﬂash furnace offgases typically contain 0.1e0.2 kg of dust per Nm3 of off-
gas. The dust consists of mainly oxides (e.g. Cu2O, Fe3O4). It becomes sulfated by SO2
and O2 in the waste heat boiler and electrostatic precipitators (Chapter 11). This sulfated
dust is collected and recycled to the ﬂash furnace for Cu recovery. In many ﬂash smelters,
air or industrial oxygen are deliberately fed into the offgas to sulfate the dust (Davenport
et al., 2001). Controlling the oxidation and sulfation behavior of the dust minimizes
accretion formation in the uptake and waste heat boiler (Miettinen et al., 2010).
About 70% of the dust leaving the uptake drops out in the waste heat boiler. The
remainder is caught in electrostatic precipitators (Chapter 11) where the particles are
charged in a high voltage electrical ﬁeld, caught on a charged wire or plate and period-
ically collected as dust “clumps” by rapping the wires and plates. Electrostatic precipitator
exit gas contains w0.1 g of dust per Nm3 of gas (Parker, 1997).
The collected dust contains approximately 25% Cu. It is almost always recycled to the
ﬂash furnace for Cu recovery. It is removed from the boilers and precipitators by drag and
screw conveyors, transported pneumatically to a dust bin above the ﬂash furnace and
combined with the dried feed just before it enters the concentrate burner.
6.3 Flash furnace operation
Tables 6.1 and 6.2 indicate that Metso Outotec ﬂash furnaces
1. smelt up to 4200 tonnes per day of new concentrate
2. typically produce w65% Cu matte (depending on the matte converting process)
3. use 45%e88% O2 blast, sometimes slightly heated
4. burn hydrocarbon fuel to some extent, mostly in the reaction shaft.
This section describes how the furnaces operate.
6.3.1 Startup and shutdown
Operation of an Outotec ﬂash furnace is begun by heating the furnace to its operating
temperature with hydrocarbon burners or hot air blowers. The heating is carried out
gently and evenly over a week or two to prevent uneven expansion and spalling of
the refractories. Adjustable springs attached to ﬁxed position I beams keep the walls
and hearth under constant pressure during the heating. During initial heatup, paper is
inserted between newly laid hearth bricks to burn out and compensate for brick expan-
sion. Concentrate feeding is begun as soon as the furnace is at its target temperature. Full
production is attained in a day or so. Shutdown consists of the following:
1. overheating the furnace for 7e10 days to melt solid buildups
2. starting hydrocarbon burners
3. stopping the concentrate burner
130
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

4. draining the furnace with hydrocarbon burners on
5. turning off the hydrocarbon burners
6. turning off the cooling water
7. allowing the furnace to cool at its natural rate.
6.3.2 Steady-state operation
Steady-state operation of a ﬂash furnace entails the following:
1. feeding solids and blast at a constant rate
2. drawing SO2-rich gas from the gas uptake at a constant rate
3. tapping matte from the furnace on a scheduled basis or as needed by the converter(s)
4. tapping slag from the furnace on a scheduled basis or when it reaches a prescribed level
in the furnace.
The next section describes how steady-state operation is attained.
6.4 Control
The Outotec ﬂash furnace operator must smelt concentrate at a steady, speciﬁed rate
while
1. producing matte of speciﬁed Cu grade
2. producing slag of speciﬁed SiO2 content
3. producing slag at speciﬁed temperature
4. maintaining a protective coating of magnetite-rich slag on the furnace interior
(Fig. 6.3).
6.4.1 Concentrate throughput rate and matte grade controls
Basic Outotec ﬂash furnace strategy is to charge dried concentrate mix to the furnace at a
prescribed rate and to base all other controls on this rate. Having chosen concentrate feed
rate, the ﬂash furnace operator must next select the grade (% Cu) of his product matte, i.e.
the extent of Fe and S oxidation. It is selected as a compromise between the following:
1. maximizing SO2 evolution in the ﬂash furnace (where it is captured efﬁciently) and
2. keeping enough Fe and S in the matte so that subsequent converting can operate auto-
thermally while melting its required amount of Cu scrap and smelter recycle materials.
Physically, matte grade is set by adjusting the ratio of oxygen input rate in the blast to
concentrate feed rate until the target matte composition is obtained. A large ratio results
in extensive Fe and S oxidation and high-grade (% Cu) matte. A small ratio gives the
opposite. Physically, the ratio is controlled by adjusting the rates at which air and oxygen
enter the furnace, after setting a constant concentrate feed rate. A newly developed servo-
actuator improves the accuracy of air ﬂow control, which reduces maintenance costs
(Romppanen et al., 2019).
Flash smelting
131

6.4.2 Slag composition control
The iron oxide formed by concentrate oxidation is ﬂuxed with SiO2 to form liquid slag.
The amount of SiO2 is based upon the slag having a low solubility for Cu and sufﬁcient
ﬂuidity for easy tapping and a clean matte/slag separation. An SiO2/Fe mass ratio of
0.7e1.0 is used. It is controlled by adjusting the rate at which ﬂux is fed to the solids
feed dryer.
6.4.3 Temperature control
Matte and slag temperatures are measured as matte and slag ﬂow from the furnace.
Disposable thermocouple probes and optical pyrometers are used. Matte and slag
Figure 6.3 Example control system for Metso Outotec ﬂash furnace. The three loops control slag tem-
perature, slag composition, and matte composition. Slag temperature may also be controlled by
adjusting reaction shaft hydrocarbon burner combustion rate. It is ﬁne-tuned by adjusting settler
burner combustion rates. Matte grades 1.5% Cu and temperatures 20C are obtained.
132
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

temperatures are controlled by adjusting (a) the rate at which N2 coolant enters the
furnace (mainly in air) or (b) hydrocarbon burner combustion rates. Slag temperature
is adjusted somewhat independently of matte temperature by adjusting settler hydrocar-
bon burner combustion rates.
Matte and slag temperatures are typically 1220 and 1250C, respectively. They are
chosen for rapid matte/slag separation and easy tapping. They are also high enough to
keep matte and slag molten during transport to their destinations. Excessive temperatures
are avoided to minimize refractory and cooling jacket wear.
6.4.4 Reaction shaft and hearth control (Davenport et al., 2001)
Long ﬂash furnace campaign lives require that magnetite-rich slag be deposited in a
controlled manner on the furnace walls and hearth. Magnetite slag deposition is encour-
aged by the following:
1. highly oxidizing conditions in the furnace
2. low operating temperature
3. low SiO2 concentration in slag
It is discouraged by reversing these conditions and by adding coke or coal to the
furnace. An ultrasoniceacoustic technique developed by Hatch has proven useful in
monitoring hearth conditions (Sadri et al., 2016). Campaigns up to 11 years in duration
have been achieved for ﬂash smelting furnaces ( Janney et al., 2007).
6.5 Impurity behavior
Flash furnace concentrates inevitably contain impurities from their original ore. They
must be separated from Cu during smelting and reﬁning. Table 6.3 shows that this is
partially accomplished during ﬂash smelting, as portions of the impurities report to the
slag and offgas, while almost all the Cu reports to the matte. Important exceptions to
this are gold, silver, and platinum group metals. They accompany Cu through to electro-
reﬁning where they are recovered as byproducts (Chapter 21). Most Ni also follows Cu.
Industrial impurity distribution is complicated by recycle of the following:
1. ﬂash furnace and converter dusts
2. ﬂash furnace slag concentrate
3. converter slag concentrate and (occasionally) molten converter slag
4. solid reverts from around the smelter
5. acid plant sludges
Nevertheless, Table 6.3 provides guidance as to how impurities distribute themselves
during ﬂash smelting.
Flash smelting
133

6.5.1 Nonrecycle of impurities in dust
Impurities are also found in ﬂash furnace dust (Table 6.3). This dust is usually recycled to
the ﬂash furnace for Cu recovery, so it is not usually an escape route for impurities. How-
ever, some ﬂash smelters, including Chuquicamata, Kennecott (Kaur et al., 2010), Saga-
noseki, and Kosaka (Maeda et al., 1998), recover Cu from some of their dust
hydrometallurgically rather than by recycle to the ﬂash furnace. This allows the impu-
rities to leave the smelter in leach plant residues. It is particularly effective for removing
As, Bi, and Cd from the smelter. Lead is removed to a lesser extent.
6.5.2 Other industrial methods of controlling impurities
Flash smelters that treat several concentrates blend their high- and low-impurity concen-
trates to ensure that impurity levels in their product anodes are low enough for efﬁcient
electroreﬁning. Flash smelters that are dedicated to treating high-impurity concentrates
control anode impurity levels by (a) minimizing dust recycle or (b) modifying converting
and ﬁre reﬁning to increase impurity removal (Larouche et al., 2003).
6.6 Outotec ﬂash smelting recent developments and future trends
Outotec ﬂash furnace smelting capacity and campaign life has increased in recent years
through enhancements in the design of the feed system, concentrate burner, and furnace
cooling elements (Romppanen et al., 2019). Advances in process control and dust sulfa-
tion techniques have also contributed. The future development foreseen by Metso Out-
otec is use of its ﬂash furnace for direct-to-copper smelting (Chapter 10) of lower grade

concentrates and further use of continuous ﬂash converting (Urbaniak et al., 2019; Zhou,
2013, Chapter 8). Both have the advantages of improved SO2 capture and an SO2-free
workplace because they eliminate batch PeirceeSmith converting.
6.7 Inco ﬂash smelting
Inco ﬂash smelting blows industrial oxygen, dried CueFeeS concentrate, SiO2 ﬂux, and
recycle materials horizontally into a hot (w1250C) furnace. Once in the furnace, the
oxygen reacts with the concentrate to generate the following:
1. molten matte, 55%e60% Cu
2. molten slag, 1%e2% Cu
3. offgas, 60e75 vol.% SO2.
The matte is tapped into ladles and sent to converting. The slag is tapped into ladles
and sent to stockpile, with or without Cu-from-slag removal (Chapter 11). The offgas is
water quenched, cleaned of dust, and sent to a sulfuric acid plant. The Inco ﬂash furnace
is also used to recover Cu from molten recycle converter slag. The slag is poured into the
furnace via a steel chute and water-cooled door (Fig. 6.4).
At the start of 2010, there are four Inco ﬂash furnaces in operation: at Almalyk, Uzbe-
kistan (Ushakov et al., 1975); Hayden, Arizona (Marczeski & Aldrich, 1986); and Sud-
bury, Ontario (two furnaces; Carr et al., 1997; Humphris et al., 1997; Zanini et al.,
2009). The Almalyk and Hayden furnaces smelt CueFeeS concentrates. The Sudbury
furnaces smelt NieCueCoeFeeS concentrates to produce w45% Ni þ Cu þ Co
matte and w1% Ni þ Cu þ Co slag.
6.7.1 Furnace details
The Inco ﬂash furnace is made of high-quality MgO and MgOeCr2O3 brick (Fig. 6.4).
Its main components are as follows:
1. concentrate burners, two at each end of the furnace
2. end- and sidewall water-cooled copper cooling jackets
3. a central off-gas uptake
4. sidewall tapholes for removing matte
5. an endwall taphole for removing slag
6. an endwall chute for charging molten converter slag
6.7.2 Concentrate burner
Inco concentrate burners are typically w0.25 m diameter, 1 m long, 1 cm thick stainless
steel pipes, water cooled with an internal ceramic sleeve. They are fed with industrial ox-
ygen, blown in horizontally, and dry feed, dropped in from above through an angled
tube (Fig. 6.5).
Flash smelting
135

The diameter of the burner barrel gives an oxygen/feed entry velocity of w40 m per
second. This velocity creates a concentrate/oxygen ﬂame that reaches the central uptake.
The burners are typically angled 7 degrees down and 7 degrees in so that the ﬂame plays
on the slag surface rather than on the roof and walls.
6.7.3 Water cooling
Inco furnace side and endwalls are ﬁtted with water-cooled copper ﬁngers, plates, and
shelves to maintain the integrity of the furnace structure (McKenna, Newman, et al.,
2010). As in the Outotec furnace, water cooling causes magnetite-rich slag to deposit
on the furnace walls. This protects the bricks and water-cooled copper, extending
furnace life. An Inco furnace can be operated for ﬁve or 6 years without reconstruction.
Repairs are done annually and while the smelter is stopped for nonfurnace reasons, e.g.

acid plant maintenance. The end of a furnace campaign is usually caused by excessive re-
fractory erosion, especially at the slag line.
6.7.4 Matte and slag tapholes
The Inco furnace is equipped with four sidewall matte tapholes and an endwall slag
taphole. Each consists of a single-hole refractory block ﬁtted in a water-cooled copper
plate. Tapping and plugging are similar to Outotec ﬂash furnace tapping and plugging
(Section 6.1.5).
Reservoirs of slag (w0.5 m deep) and matte (0.2e1.0 m deep) are always kept in the
furnace. The matte level is kept well below the slag taphole. This avoids accidental tap-
ping of matte with slag. Matte tapping is rotated continuously between the four tapholes
to keep matte ﬂowing across the entire ﬂoor. This minimizes localized magnetite
buildups on the furnace ﬂoor.
6.7.5 Gas uptake
The central off-gas uptake is brick or castable refractory backed by copper cooling jackets
or stainless steel. A small amount of oxygen is injected into the uptake. It burns the
elemental sulfur that is present in Inco furnace offgas. This prevents the sulfur from
precipitating in downstream cooling and dust collection equipment.
6.7.6 Auxiliary equipment
The auxiliary equipment required for Inco ﬂash smelting is the following:
1. oxygen plant (Section 6.2.4)
2. concentrate blending system (Section 6.2.1)
3. solids feed dryer
4. four concentrate burner feed systems
5. off-gas cooling system
6. dust recovery and recycle system
7. secondary gas collection and treatment system (Chapter 12)
8. sulfuric acid plant (Chapter 12).
6.7.7 Solids feed dryer (Carr et al., 1997)
Inco furnace solid feed (concentrate, ﬂux, reverts, and recycle sludges) is dried to give an
even ﬂow of solids through the concentrate burners. This is essential to create a uniform
oxygen concentrate suspension in the furnace. Natural gaseﬁred ﬂuid bed dryers are used
(Liu et al., 2007). The dryer feed is typically 10% H2O; the dried product, w0.2% H2O.
The ﬂuidization gas is combustion gas plus air at w330C. A ﬁxed bed of 1e10 mm
gravel distributes the ﬂuidization gas across the bed.
Flash smelting
137

The ﬂuidized dried feed particles and their surrounding gas are drawn at w90C
through acrylic or aramid fabric tubes stretched on wire frameworks. About 99.99% of
the concentrate is caught on the outside of the fabric. It is removed by reverse nitrogen
or air pulsation and dropped into a large storage bin. From there, it is sent by conveyors or
air slides to four dry charge bins above the furnace, one for each concentrate burner.
6.7.8 Concentrate burner feed system
The solid charge to the Inco ﬂash furnace consists mainly of dried feed blend from the
ﬂuid bed dryer. It drops from its dry charge bins onto drag or screw conveyors which
then drop it into the concentrate burners. The feed system may also include separate
touch-up ﬂux, touch-up revert, and converter dust bins. Material is drawn from these
bins as needed to control ﬂash furnace product temperature and slag composition. The
rate of withdrawal from each bin is controlled by adjusting the speed of the drag or screw
conveyor beneath the bin.
6.7.9 Off-gas cooling and dust recovery systems (Humphris et al., 1997)
Inco offgas is cooled and cleaned of dust in (a) a water spray evaporation cooler where the
offgas is cooled from w1230 to 80C and where 90% of the entrained dust is removed as
sludge or (b) scrubbers and wet electrostatic precipitators. The equipment is stainless steel
to minimize corrosion. The offgas (60e75 vol.-% SO2) is pulled through the equipment
by fans, which push the gas onward to a sulfuric acid plant for SO2 treatment.
Solids from the cooler and dust removal equipment contain w35% Cu. The Cu is
recovered by neutralizing and dewatering the sludge then recycling it through the
concentrate dryer and ﬂash furnace.
6.8 Inco ﬂash furnace summary
The Inco ﬂash furnace uses industrial oxygen (no air) to smelt CueFeeS and NieCue
CoeFeeS concentrates. It produces high Cu and high NieCueCo mattes. It introduces
dry feed and industrial oxygen through four horizontal burners and removes SO2 offgas
through a central gas uptake. The offgas is water quenched and sent to a sulfuric acid plant
to capture its SO2.
Very little nitrogen enters the Inco furnace, so its blast and offgas handling systems are
small. Also, the strong offgas is ideal for SO2 capture.
Inco ﬂash furnace slag can contain less than 1% Cu, which can be discarded without
Cu recovery treatment. This gives it a cost advantage over most other modern smelting
techniques. If desired, converter slag can also be recycled through the furnace for Cu re-
covery. However, this procedure upsets an otherwise steady process.
138

6.9 Inco versus Outotec ﬂash smelting
There are many more Outotec ﬂash furnaces than Inco ﬂash furnaces. Outotec advan-
tages include the following:
1. higher concentrate throughput rates (double that of the Inco ﬂash furnace)
2. single concentrate burner in place of four Inco burners
3. recovery of off-gas heat in a waste heat boiler as useful steam
4. dry dust recycle
5. engineering and operational support
6.10 Summary
Metso Outotec ﬂash smelting accounts for around half of all Cu matte smelting. It is also
used in three locations for direct-to-copper smelting and in two locations for continuous
converting.
It blows oxygen, air, dried concentrate, ﬂux, and particulate recycle materials as a
well-dispersed mixture into a hot reaction shaft. Smelting reactions are extremely fast un-
der these conditions. Outotec ﬂash furnaces smelt w4000 tonnes of new concentrate per
day.
Modern Outotec ﬂash furnaces operate with high oxygen blast and very little hydro-
carbon fuel. Most of the energy for heating and melting comes from Fe and S oxidation.
This operation also gives strong SO2 offgas from which SO2 can be captured efﬁciently as
sulfuric acid.
Metso Outotec ﬂash furnaces are operated under automatic control to give constant
temperature, constant composition products at a rapid rate and with minimum energy
consumption. Matte and slag compositions are controlled by adjusting the ratios of O2
input rate to concentrate feed rate, and of ﬂux input to concentrate input. Product tem-
peratures are controlled by adjusting the N2/O2 ratio of the input blast and the hydro-
carbon fuel combustion rate.
Wide adoption of Outotec ﬂash smelting is due to its efﬁcient capture of SO2, its rapid
production rate, and its small energy requirement. Its only limitation is its inability to
smelt scrap.

CHAPTER 7
Bath matte smelting processes
Chapter 5 described ﬂash smelting, the predominant worldwide technology for produc-
ing copper mattes. The advantages of ﬂash smelting are well known and the technology is
well established. However, ﬂash smelting also has disadvantages. The biggest is its use of
ﬁne, dry concentrate particles as feed. Fine particles react faster, which is desirable.
However, they also settle less quickly. As a result, ﬂash furnaces generate considerable
quantities of dust. To reduce this dust generation, a large settling area is built into ﬂash
furnaces. This increases the size of the vessel, and thus its cost.
Bath smelting, a technological alternative to ﬂash smelting, has been subject of reno-
vated interest in the last 15 years, initially with the growth of Top Submerged Lance
(TSL) plants, followed by the development of new smelting technologies in China
such as Bottom Blowing Smelting (BBS) and Side Blowing Furnace (SBF).
Bath smelting process involves the reaction of copper concentrate (dry or wet) with
oxygen. The main smelting reactions will take place in the molten matte, molten slag, or
partially on top of the molten bath, depending on the selected technology. The main
technologies using bath smelting principles are as follows:
•
Noranda and El Teniente submerged tuyeres,
•
Vanyukov submerged tuyeres,
•
TSL: ISASMELT and Metso Outotec Ausmelt,
•
Mitsubishi Process,
•
Chinese smelting processes:
•
Bottom Blowing Smelting (SBS),
•
Side blowing smelting process (SBF).
Bath smelting technologies operates producing intermediate copper matte grades
(55% w 65% Cu) or high copper matte grade (70% w 75%Cu). Intermediate copper
matte grade will be normally processed in a two-stage batch converting process. High
copper matte grades will be processed in a single batch converting stage. However,
this approach also generates the disadvantage of a highly oxidized converter slag with
low ﬂuidity and excess metallic copper entrainment, as discussed in Section 8.3.
Extensive S oxidation from continuous smelting allows a more efﬁcient SO2 capture by
virtually eliminating a slag blowing stage in the subsequent converting process. Teniente,
Noranda, and the newly developed Chinese bath smelting technologies gain this SO2
advantage from the violent stirring created by submerged injection of blast. The stirring
dissolves and suspends magnetite in slag, preventing excessive deposition on the furnace

refractories even under the highly oxidizing conditions of super high grade matte
production.
This chapter describes the above-mentioned option except for the Mitsubishi process
that will be described in Chapter 9 as part of the continuous copper making processes.
7.1 Submerged tuyere: Noranda and Teniente processes
CueFeeS concentrate is (a) dried and blown into the furnace through four to six dedi-
cated submerged tuyeres or (b) thrown moist (w8% H2O) with ﬂux, recycle materials,
and scrap onto the slag surface through an end wall.
The products of the processes are high-grade molten matte (72%e74% Cu, 3%e7%
Fe, and w20% S), slag (6%e10% Cu, 1200e1250C), and offgas with 20e26 vol. % SO2
(before dilution). The matte is sent to PeirceeSmith converters for a single blowing
copper making stage (in same cases combination with Flash furnace matte from another
reactor, allows to have a traditional two stage converting process), the slag is sent to a Cu
recovery process, and the offgas is sent to cooling, dust recovery, and a sulfuric acid plant
for sulfur recovery.
All or most of the energy for heating and melting the charge come from Fe and S
oxidation, i.e.,

furnaces always contain layers of molten matte (70%e74% Cu) and slag. Oxygen for
concentrate oxidation is provided by blowing enriched air through submerged tuyeres
into the molten matte layer.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

7.1.1 Noranda process (Prevost et al., 2007; Zapata, 2007)
The Noranda process was initially conceived as a direct-to-copper smelting process. The
furnace at Noranda produced molten copper from 1973 to 1975. It was switched to high-
grade matte production to (a) lower impurity levels in the smelter’s anode copper and
(b) increase smelting rate. Noranda furnaces now produce super high (70%e74% Cu),
low-sulfur (w20% S) matte. This maximizes SO2 production in the continuous smelting
furnace and minimizes SO2 production in discontinuous PeirceeSmith converters,
maximizing SO2 capture as sulfuric acid.
The Noranda furnace is a 0.1 m thick horizontal moly-steel barrel lined inside with
about 0.5 m of magnesiaechrome refractory (Zapata, 2007). Industrial furnaces are w5 m
diameter and 21e26 m long. They have 54 to 66 submerged tuyeres (5 or 6 cm diameter)
along the length of the furnace (Fig. 7.1).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Noranda smelting entails the following:
(a) continuously blowing oxygen-enriched air blast (40 volume% O2, 1.6 bar gauge)
through submerged tuyeres into the molten matte
(b) continuously blowing dried concentrate and blast through w5 special submerged
tuyeres into the matte layer (Antofagasta, Chile) and/or continuously feeding moist
concentrate through an endwall onto the slag bath surface (Rouyn-Noranda,
Canada)
(c) continuously drawing offgas through a large mouth and hood at the top of the
furnace
(d) intermittently tapping matte and slag through submerged tapholes.
Flux, reverts, scrap, and coal/coke are also thrown onto the top of the molten slag
bath. Molten converter slag is also occasionally recycled through the Noranda furnace
mouth.
The blast tuyeres are periodically cleared by breaking blockages with a steel bar.
Noranda and Teniente use Gaspe tuyere punchers (see Chapter 8 for Gaspe machine
description).
Figs. 7.3 and 7.4 show the Noranda Reactors at Horne and Altonorte smelters,
respectively.
The furnace is equipped with a rotation mechanism. It is used to correctly position the
tuyere tips in the molten matte layer and to roll the tuyeres above the liquids during
maintenance and repair. It also automatically rolls the tuyeres above the liquids in the
event of a power failure or other emergency.
7.1.2 Reaction mechanisms
The reaction mechanisms in the Noranda furnace are as follows:
(a) sulﬁde concentrate is blown into the matte layer or thrown by “slinger” belt onto
the slag surface

(b) the concentrate particles enter the matte layer where they melt and are oxidized by
tuyere O2
(c) Fe oxides from the oxidation react with SiO2 ﬂux to form slag, which rises to the top
of the bath
(d) SO2 from the oxidation rises through the bath and leaves the furnace along with N2
from the tuyere blast and CO2 and water vapor from hydrocarbon combustion.
Other parts of the charge such as scrap, sludges, and recycle materials melt and un-
dergo oxidation and slagging. Oxides rise to the slag layer, while copper and precious
metals (mostly from scrap) descend and join the matte layer.
7.1.3 Separation of matte and slag
Matte and slag are intimately mixed in the tuyere region. They are allowed to separate in
a quiet tuyere-free zone at the taphole end of the furnace (Fig. 7.1). Matte falls, SO2/N2

gas rises, and slag forms a top layer dilute enough in Cu for tapping from the furnace. It
contains w6% Cu, 30% dissolved and 70% as entrained matte. It is tapped from the
furnace and sent for Cu recovery by solidiﬁcation/comminution/ﬂotation (Chapter 10).
7.1.4 Impurity behavior
Table 7.3 describes impurity behavior during Noranda smelting. It shows that harmful
impurities report mainly to slag and offgas. Most As, Bi, Pb, and Sb can be removed
from the Cu circuit by not recycling offgas solids (recovered dust) to smelting or
converting.

7.1.5 Scrap and residue smelting
The feed to the Noranda furnace at Noranda, Quebec, includes 10þ% end-of-use scrap
(Coursal et al., 2007). The scrap includes precious metal and copper-containing slags,
ashes, residues (up to 14% moisture), precious metal catalysts, wire cables, jewelry,
telephone scrap, automobile parts, and precious metal computer and electronic scrap.
However, recycling of beryllium (a potential carcinogen) and radioactive materials are
strictly forbidden.
Tuyere blast stirring in the Noranda furnace rapidly melts these materials and causes
their precious metals and Cu to be rapidly absorbed in matte. Also, the high temperature
and intensity of smelting cause potentially harmful organic compounds to be oxidized
completely to CO2 and H2O.
7.1.6 Operation and control
Noranda smelting is started by heating the furnace with hydrocarbon burners. Molten
matte is then poured in through the furnace mouth (tuyeres elevated). Once a meter
or so of molten matte is in place, the tuyere “blast” is started and the tuyeres are rolled
into the molten matte to begin oxidation and heat generation. Concentrate and ﬂux
feeding is then started and normal smelting is begun. About a week is taken to heat
the furnace, provide the molten matte, and attain full production.
The initial molten matte is prepared by melting matte pieces or high-Cu concentrate
in a converter or unused furnace in the smelter. Smelting is terminated by inserting
hydrocarbon burners into the furnace, stopping smelting, and pouring slag then matte
out the furnace mouth.
7.1.7 Control (Zapata, 2007)
Once steady operation has been reached, the furnace is controlled to
(a) smelt concentrates, scrap, and other metal-bearing solids at the company’s prescribed
rates
(b) produce matte and slag of prescribed composition and temperature
(c) maintain prescribed depths of matte and slag in the furnace.
Matte composition is controlled by adjusting the ratio of oxygen input in the blast to
the rate of solid feed input. Increasing this ratio increases matte grade (by increasing Fe
and S oxidation) and vice versa. It is often altered by adjusting solid feed input rate at
a constant O2-in-blast injection rate. This gives constant rate SO2 delivery to the sulfuric
acid plant.
Matte/slag temperature (1200e1250C) is controlled by altering the ratio of hydrocar-
bon combustion rate to solid feed input rate. The ratio is increased to raise temperature and
vice versa. It is altered by adjusting coal/coke feed rate and natural gas combustion rate.
Matte/slag temperature may also be controlled by adjusting the N2/O2 ratio of the blast.
150
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Slag composition is controlled by adjusting the ratio of ﬂux input rate to solid feed
input rate. The target SiO2/Fe ratio is w0.7.
In addition, the mix of metal-bearing solid feed to the furnace is controlled to keep
impurity levels in the matte below preset values. This is done to avoid excessive impurity
levels in the product anodes.
Feed rates and O2 input rate are monitored continuously. Matte samples are taken
every hour (analyses being returned 15 min later), and slag samples every 2 h. Bath
temperature is monitored continuously with optical pyrometers (Fig. 7.5) sighted
through two tuyeres (Zapata, 2007).
Matte and slag depths are monitored hourly with a 2.5 cm diameter vertical steel bar.
This is done to (a) ensure that there is enough matte above the tuyeres for efﬁcient O2
utilization and (b) produce an even blast ﬂow by maintaining a constant static liquid
pressure at the tuyere tips. The depths are adjusted by altering matte and slag tapping
frequency.
7.1.8 Production rate enhancement
The smelting rate of the furnace near Antofagasta, Chile, has more than doubled since
2003. Most of the increase has been due to increased furnace blowing availability,
now over 90%. This in turn is the result of improved control over matte and slag
compositions and temperatures, and better taphole dependability, which improves
control over matte and slag depths (Zapata, 2007).
7.2 Teniente smelting
The Teniente technology was developed by Caletones Smelter in Chile with the ﬁrst
unit starting operation in 1977 (Campos et al., 1993). The process evolved from testwork
done in PeirceeSmith converters to smelt copper concentrates. In its origin, the process
involved a hybrid operation processing molten matte from reverberatory furnaces and
wet feed added from the side wall of the furnace. However, with the decommissioning
of reverberatory furnaces and the incorporation of solid injection technology, the process
evolved to dry concentrate injection into the molten matte using special injection tuyeres
using ultradense injection systems (Coleman et al., 2008).
The Teniente smelting shares many features with Noranda smelting (Carrasco et al.,
2007; Moyano et al., 2010). It
(a) uses a cylindrical furnace with submerged tuyeres (Fig. 7.2)
(b) blows oxygen enriched air through the tuyeres into molten matte
(c) feeds dry concentrate through dedicated tuyeres
(d) (sometimes) charges moist concentrate onto its matte/slag surface
(e) produces high Cu, low Fe, and low S matte, which it sends to PeirceeSmith
converting for copper making (i.e., Fe and S oxidation).
Table 7.4 gives operating details of two Teniente smelting furnaces.

7.2.1 Process description
Teniente furnaces are 4e5 m diameter and 14e23 m long. The furnace barrels are
steel, w0.05 m thick, lined with about 0.5 m of magnesiaechrome refractory. The
furnaces have 35e50 tuyeres (5 or 6 cm diameter) along 65% of their length. The
remaining 35% of the furnace length is a quiet settling zone.
All Teniente furnaces blow dry concentrate into the furnace through four or six dedi-
cated tuyeres (Moyano et al., 2010; Rosales et al., 2010). Flux, recycle materials, and
(sometimes) moist concentrate are charged onto the matte/slag surface. Reactions are
similar to those in the Noranda furnace. The principal products of the process are molten
matte (72%e74% Cu, 3%e7% Fe, w21% S), molten Feesilicate slag (6%e10% Cu), and
offgas (w25 vol.-% SO2).
The operational procedure to start the furnace after a refractory maintenance
shutdown involves the following sequence (Moyano et al., 2010):
(a) preheating the furnace with hydrocarbon burners according to a predeﬁned heating
curve,
(b) charging molten matte to the furnace, keeping tuyeres outside the molten bath,
(c) starting blowing oxygen-enriched air through the tuyeres, rotating them into the
molten bath,
(d) starting normal feeding of concentrate, ﬂux, and recycles, generating the matte and
slag layers to the normal operating levels,
(e) Increasing feed rate until achieving steady production state,
(f) starting tapping matte and slag as required.
The initial charge of matte required for the start-up is normally from another furnace
in operation (when more than one smelting line is in operation) or from a stand-by
furnace (i.e., PeirceeSmith Converter) able to melt solid matte or smelting high-grade
concentrate. The startup to full production process takes about 1 week.

7.2.2 Steady operation and process control
Steady operation of a Teniente furnace consists of the following (Morrow & Gajaredo,
2009; Moyano et al., 2010):
(a) continuous injection of dried concentrate and air through four to six dedicated
submerged tuyeres
(b) continuous blowing of oxygen-enriched air (w40 vol.-% O2) through submerged
tuyeres
(c) continuous surface charging of ﬂux and solid recycle materials onto the bath surface
(d) continuous withdrawal of offgas
(e) intermittent tapping of matte and slag through submerged tapholes
(f) occasional recycling of molten converter matte through the furnace mouth.
7.2.2.1 Temperature control
Operating parameters are controlled to produce matte and slag of speciﬁed compositions
at a given operating temperature, normally deﬁned to ensure proper slag ﬂuidity and
furnace refractory integrity.
Liquid temperature is measured by optical pyrometers through two of the tuyeres or
onto the slag tapping stream. Slag temperature (w1240C) is controlled by adjusting
revert feed rates and blast oxygen enrichment level. Reducing the enrichment means
that more N2 is input, which acts as a coolant. Temperature is typically controlled within
about 20C (Morrow & Gajaredo, 2009).
7.2.2.2 Slag and matte composition control
Matte and slag compositions are measured by on-site X-ray analysis. Results are available
15e120 min after a sample is taken.
Slag composition is controlled by adjusting ﬂux feed rate. It is controlled to an SiO2/
Fe ratio of 0.65. This, plus good temperature control, gives a slag Fe3O4 content of
15%e20%, which maintains a protective (but not excessive) layer of solid magnetite
on the furnace refractory.
Matte grade is controlled by adjusting the ratio of total O2 input to concentrate feed
rate. This ratio controls the degree of Fe and S oxidation, hence matte composition.
7.2.2.3 Matte and slag depth control
Matte and slag depths are measured frequently by inserting a steel bar vertically from
above. Matte depth is controlled to give w0.5 m of matte above the tuyeres. This ensures
efﬁcient use of tuyere O2.
Heights of matte and slag above the tuyeres are also controlled to be as constant as
possible. This gives a constant static pressure of liquid above the tuyeres, hence a constant
ﬂow of blast. The heights are kept constant by adjusting matte and slag tapping
frequencies.

7.2.3 Impurity distribution
Table 7.5 shows impurity behavior during Teniente smelting. As with Noranda smelting,
As, Bi, Pb, Sb, and Zn are largely removed in slag and offgas. Se is removed less
efﬁciently.
Teniente impurity removal appears to be slightly less effective than Noranda impurity
removal (Table 7.3). This may, however, be due to differences in furnace feeds and mea-
surement techniques.
7.2.4 Campaign life and hot tuyere repairing
The campaign lives of Teniente and Noranda furnaces are 1e2 years. Refractory wear in
the tuyere region is often the limiting factor.
Most Teniente furnaces mount their tuyeres in four detachable panels (Carrasco et al.,
2007; Guzman et al., 2007). These panels can be detached and replaced without cooling
the furnace. This signiﬁcantly improves furnace availability.
7.2.5 Furnace cooling
Chapters 6 and 9 show that ﬂash and vertical lance furnaces need to be cooled by many
copper water jackets and sprays. Teniente and Noranda furnaces use very little water
cooling due to their simple barrel design and submerged oxidation reactions. This cool-
ing simplicity is a signiﬁcant advantage.
7.2.6 Off-gas heat recovery
Teniente and Noranda furnaces cool their offgases by water evaporation rather than by
heat recovery boilers.
Improved smelting control and increased waste heat boiler (WHB) reliability may
make heat recovery boilers economic for future Teniente and Noranda furnace retroﬁts.
The steam will be especially valuable for steam drying of tuyere injection concentrates
and heap leach lixiviants.

7.3 Vanyukov submerged tuyere smelting
Vanyukov smelting is performed in stationary, submerged tuyere furnaces (Fig. 7.6). It
was developed in the former Soviet Union by A.V. Vanyukov at the National University
of Science and Technology “MISIS.” The technology is currently in use in Kazakhstan
(Balkhash smelter) Russia (Norilsk Cu; Sredneuralsk), and Uzbekistan (Almalyk smelter)
(Table 7.6).
The application of the Vanyukov process to copper was tested in 1974 in Balkhash
smelter and ﬁnally implemented in 1985. The process since then has been through several
developments and optimizations such as modiﬁcations to reduce dust carryover, modiﬁ-
cation of the off-gas stream to increase capacity, increase of the slag reduction area, and
increase in number of electrodes (Ospanov, 2020).
The process entails the following (Tarasov & Paretsky, 2003):
(a) charging moist concentrate (up to 8% H2O), reverts, ﬂux, and occasionally lump
coal through two roof ports (Fig. 7.6)
(b) blowing oxygen enriched air (50e95 volume% O2, 9 bar gauge) into the molten slag
layer through tuyeres on both sides of the furnace. The tuyeres are located w0.5 m
below the slag surface.
Figure 7.5 Schematic of in-tuyere optical pyrometer. Its main component is an optical ﬁber which
transmits a color image of in-furnace matte to a distant computer for temperature interpretation.
Its other key component is a periscope optical ﬁber holder which automatically lowers when the
Gaspe puncher moves into position to punch this tuyere. Industrially, ball valves (Adapted from Heath
and Sherwood, 2021) are used to prevent blowback rather than simple ﬂap valves.

Smelting is continuous. The furnace always contains layers of molten matte and slag.
The smelting reactions are similar to those in Noranda and Teniente smelting furnaces.
Matte and slag are tapped intermittently through tapholes at opposite ends of the furnace.
Weirs are provided to give quiet matte/slag separation near the slag taphole (Fig. 7.7).
Matte grade is 45%e74% Cu, and slag Cu content is 0.7%e2%. The off-gas strength
is 25e40 vol.-% SO2, depending upon blast oxygen enrichment and hydrocarbon
combustion rate.
7.3.1 Stationary furnace
Unlike the rotatable Noranda and Teniente furnaces, the Vanyukov furnace is stationary.
The advantages of this are a directly connected gas collection system and no moving parts.
The disadvantage is that the Vanyukov furnace cannot lift its tuyeres above the slag for
maintenance and repair or in a blower emergency. This may be the reason that the
process is not more widespread.

7.3.2 Operational challenges at Balkhash smelter (Ospanov, 2020)
Some of the operational challenges currently faced by the Vanyukov technology at
Balkhash smelter are as follows:
•
Processing of relatively low sulfur content concentrates requiring additional heat
source
•
Relatively high content of gangue in the concentrate (7% Fe3O4) requiring additional
heat source
•
Need to add natural gas and/or coal to compensate heat balance of the process
(increasing operating cost)
•
Need of additional ﬂux to slag gangue material
Partially, the problem of supplementary heat source has been overcome by the imple-
mentation in 2011 of an oil heating devices.
7.4 Top Submerged Lance
In 1971, researchers at the Australian Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research
Organisation began investigating the use of top-lancing technology for injecting coal into
tin slags to improve reduction kinetics (Arthur & Partington, 2007; Collis, 2002; Floyd,
2002). This research led to the development and application of the air-cooled top entry
submerged Sirosmelt lance to the processing of a wide range of raw materials. CSIRO
licensed the Sirosmelt technology to Mount Isa Mines (now Glencore) and Ausmelt
(Now Metso Outotec Ausmelt), and they continued engineering and developing
the technology to copper, lead, and other commodities. The TSL technology has found
commercial application worldwide, becoming a signiﬁcant factor copper smelting,
particularly since 1995. Their share of the copper processing market is about 15% (Inter-
national Copper Study Group, 2019) Chapter 5. Table 7.7 shows the list of current TSL
operating plants (Metso Outotec Ausmelt, 2020; ISASMELT, 2020). Processing capac-
ities described in the table correspond to the original design. Some plants have upgraded
their capacities since commissioning.
7.4.1 Basic operations
Ausmelt and ISASMELT TSL copper smelting processes entail dropping moist solid
feed into a tall cylindrical furnace while blowing oxygen-enriched air through a vertical
lance into the mixture of molten matte and slag known as the bath (Matusewicz et al.,
2007). The use of an advanced process control system results in the furnace operation be-
ing largely automated (Alvear Flores, Hunt, & Zhang, 2010). Bath temperature is
controlled to 10C from the set point by use of on-line temperature monitoring and
advanced process control strategies (Arthur & Simon, 2005).

The products of the process are a matte/slag mixture and strong SO2 offgas (w25%
SO2). The matte/slag mixture can be tapped periodically or continuously into a fuel-
ﬁred or electric settling furnace for separation. The choice of separating furnace is decided
largely by the local cost of electricity. Fig. 7.8 shows the Southern Peru Copper Corpo-
ration Ilo Smelter ISASMELT furnace with the rotary furnaces during the construction
of the plant in 2005. The settled matte (w60% Cu) is sent to conventional converting.
The slag (0.7% Cu) is discarded.
The offgas leaving the molten bath is postcombusted to ensure total oxidation of
sulfur, volatiles, and any CO remaining in the top of the furnace. In Ausmelt furnaces,
this is done using the outermost pipe in the lance assembly, known as a shroud.
ISASMELT furnaces accomplish this by injecting air in the freeboard area of the
furnace or in the WHB (Herrera et al., 2013).The postcombusted gas enters the vertical
upcomer of the WHB radiation section where gases are cooled to the appropriate tem-
perature, minimizing the formation of sticky dust in the ﬁrst section of the radiation

section. The downcomer section can be connected to s spray cooler or to a convection
section. The spray cooler or the convection section will bring the off-gas temperature
down to the inlet requirements of the electrostatic precipitator (350C). After dedusting
in the electrostatic precipitator, the gases are conveyed to the gas cleaning and the acid
plant, respectively.
Most of the energy for smelting comes from oxidizing the concentrate charge.
Additional energy is provided by combusting (a) oil, gas, or coal ﬁnes blown through
the vertical lance and (b) coal ﬁnes in the solid charge. TSL furnaces are versatile, can treat
a wide range of copper concentrates materials, and use a variety of fuels, depending on
the most cost-effective option available at the site.

7.4.2 Feed materials
Ausmelt/ISASMELT feed is moist concentrate, ﬂux, and recycle materials, some-
times pelletized (Tables 7.8 and 7.9). Drying of the feed is not necessary because the
smelting reactions take place in the matte/slag bath rather than above it. Moist feed
also decreases dust evolution. About 1% of the feed is captured as dust.
Oxygen enrichment air is blown into the molten bath with a standard selection of
50e65 vol.-% O2. This initial range allows plants to be expanded by means of additional
oxygen using the same WHB and similar total off-gas ﬂows.
TSL furnaces are normally designed to operate just below autothermal conditions to
allow space for proper temperature control. This is achieved by adding small amounts of
additional fuel (solid, liquid, or gas) with the feed (coal) or through the lance (natural gas,
or diesel).
7.4.3 The TSL furnace and lances
Fig. 7.9 shows a typical TSL furnace. It is a vertically aligned steel barrel, 3.5e5 m in
diameter, and 12e16 m high. The largest furnace processes well over 5000 tonnes of
concentrate per day. It is lined inside with chromeemagnesite refractory, and can be
backed with copper water cooling blocks (Table 7.8 and 7.9). Its roof consists of
water-cooled copper slabs or steel panels (Binegar, 1995; Voltura, 2004). Tapping is
done through one or more water-cooled tapping blocks (ISASMELT) or a weir system
(Reuter & Matusewicz, 2010; Ausmelt, 2005). The weir system allows continuous oper-
ation of the furnace, providing more stability to the operation of the subsequent settling
furnace.

Fig. 7.10 shows a TSL lance. It consists of a stainless-steel outer pipe (up to 0.5 m
diameter) for oxygen-enriched air and a carbon steel inner pipe for oil or natural gas.
The outer pipe is normally immersed about 0.3 m into the furnace slag. The inner
pipe ends about 1 m above the slag surface. The lance pressure is low enough to allow

12 m high. It smelts up to 3000 tonnes of new concentrate per day. The outside of the furnace is often
water cooled with copper cooling blocks. The main product of the furnace is a mixture of molten
matte and slag, which is sent to an electric or gas-ﬁred matte/slag separation furnace.

use of a single-stage blower, rather than a compressor (Alvear Flores, Hunt, & Zhang,
2006; Bill et al., 2002). The Ausmelt lance assembly includes an additional outer
pipe for oxygen addition, which does not extend into the bath.
The lance tip is cooled by swirling the enriched air blast in the annulus between the
pipes (Bill et al., 2002). The swirled gas extracts heat from the outside pipe and causes a
protective slag layer to freeze on the pipe surfaces. Helical swirl vanes in the annulus are
used to create this effect.
Despite this, the immersed lance tip slowly erodes away. The lance is lowered to
compensate for this erosion. It is removed and replaced when w1 m has eroded. Better
Figure 7.10 Sketch of Isasmelt lance tip. Vanes for swirling blast down the lance tip are shown. The
swirling gives rapid heat transfer from lance to blast, causing a protective layer of slag to freeze on the
outside of the lance tip (Solnordal & Gray, 1996).
Bath matte smelting processes
169

operational practice has extended lance replacement time from 1 week to as many as 4 in
some cases (Arthur & Partington, 2007; Bill et al., 2002; Reuter & Matusewicz, 2010;
Walqui et al., 2006). The used lances are refurbished for reuse by welding a new 1 m sec-
tion of outside pipe to the bottom tip, a process that takes less than an hour. Lance wear is
minimized by avoiding excessive immersion (exposure to the matte layer) and limiting
the oxygen content of the blast (nitrogen cooling effect).
7.4.4 Smelting mechanisms
TSL smelting is different from ﬂash smelting and bath tuyere injection. The main differ-
ence is the oxygen transfer mechanism under which the matte formation occurs. It is
commonly believed that dissolved magnetite in the slag serves as a catalyst of sorts for
the overall process. Alvear Flores, Hunt, & Zhang (2010) propose this reaction sequence
as follows:
6CuFeS2 þ 18Fe3O4 / 54 FeO þ 7SO2 þ 3Cu2S þ 2FeS þ 4FeO
(7.2)
54 FeO þ 9O2 / 18Fe3O4
(7.3)
The proposed mechanism intends to demonstrate that the oxidation process is
achieved through a controlled oxidation of the slag. As a result, a minimum amount
of spinel (magnetite) is required bs the process (5% according to Binegar, 1995). TSL fur-
naces require therefore to operate just under slag liquidus temperature to ensure the
proper amount of % solid in the slag. The operating temperature will vary depending
on the slag composition and will normally between 1150 and 1200C. TSL furnaces
also operate with silica/iron ratio 0.65e0.85 for ISASMELT, and 0.6e0.7 for
Ausmelt. Operating under the liquidus temperature also allows to refractory wear
and achieve large smelting campaigns. Mount Isa Mines has reported achieving campaign
in the proximity of 4 years (Edwards et al., 2013).
7.4.5 Impurity elimination
Bill et al. (2002) report impurity elimination into slag and offgas during Isasmelt smelting
as 91% As, 85% Cd, 76% Bi, 68% Zn, 61% Sb, 60% Tl, 44% Pb, and 29% Te. Arsenic
retention in the matte is less than half of that obtained using other smelting technology
(Alvear Flores, Hunt, & Zhang, 2006), making TSL smelting technology especially suitable
for high arsenic concentrates. Elimination of As, Bi, Pb, and Sb is encouraged by decreasing
oxygen enrichment. Off-gas solids are recycled to the smelting furnace for Cu recovery, so
they are not usually an escape route for impurities. TSL furnaces have been successfully
commissioned to process complex materials in Belgium (Alvear Flores, Hourn, & Salas,
2013) and Kazakhstan (Burrows et al., 2013, 2018) and Namibia (Nolte & Kruger, 2019).
170
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

7.4.6 Startup and shutdown
Smelting is started by the following:
(a) preheating the furnace
(b) slowly charging about 2 m of solid slag pieces
(c) melting the slag, using the lance as an oxy-fuel burner
(d) immersing the smelting lance in the molten slag
(e) beginning normal concentrate smelting.
At least 1 day is required. Smelting is terminated by stopping the solid feed, draining
the furnace, and turning off the lance. The furnace is then allowed to cool at its natural
rate.
Steady operation consists of continuous feeding of solid charge through the roof feed
port and continuous blowing of oxygen-enriched air into the molten bath. The furnace is
computer controlled to give a speciﬁed concentrate smelting rate while producing matte
and slag of desired composition and temperature. Matte/slag temperature is sensed by
thermocouples embedded in the furnace walls (MacLeod et al., 1997). It is controlled
by adjusting the rate at which fossil fuel is supplied through the lance.
Matte and slag compositions are determined by X-ray ﬂuorescence analysis of samples
from each matte/slag tap. The compositions are controlled by adjusting the O2/concen-
trate and ﬂux/concentrate ratios in the furnace input.
7.5 Chinese bath smelting technology developments: SKS-BBS
process and side-blow smelting
During the last 10 years, Chinese technologists have reported several innovations in the
nonferrous metals processing, with the following copper bath smelting processing tech-
nologies developed and implemented at industrial scale:
•
SKS, BBS (Bottom Blowing Smelting),
•
Submerged lance smelting,
•
Side-blown smelting.
Fig. 7.11 shows a schematic view of the SKS-BBS furnace (Lile et al., 2016) . The
SKS-BSB was ﬁrstly implemented at demonstration scale (10,000 tpy copper) at Sin
Quyen Copper Smelter in Vietnam, followed by a fully commercial scale plant Shandong
Dongying (Bin & Suping, 2019). Nine smelters are reported to have implemented this
bath smelting technology in 2019 (Bin & Suping, 2019). The submerged lance smelting
is a variation of the SKS-BBS technology developed as part of a two-stage continuous
smelting process by Dongying Fangyuan. The process is described in Chapter 9.
The Side-blown smelting principle is a variation of the Vanyukov furnace principle,
in which a stationary furnace has enriched air blown into the molten matte (Baiyin
furnace, Jinfeng furnace).
Bath matte smelting processes
171

In addition, SKS-BBS and Side-blown technologies have been also coupled with
continuous copper converting technologies, such as Bottom Blowing Converting and
aimed to replace batch converting and to develop continuous production of blister
copper from copper concentrates. These efforts are discussed in Chapter 9.
7.5.1 SKS-BBS process
The oxygen bottom-blown smelting process was originally developed at Shuikoushan
smelter and hence it was named SKS process. Fig. 7.11 shows a schematic view of the
SKS-BBS furnace. Wet feed is continuously fed to the furnace from feed ports located
on top of the furnace shell. The horizontally positioned furnace shell dimensions can
vary depending on the processing capacity with lengths between 16.5 and 30 m and di-
ameters between 4.4 and 5.8 m (Li, 2016; Wang et al., 2016). The furnace is lined with
380 mm thick chromeemagnesia bricks with water cooling only applied to the tapholes.
The SKS-BBS process entails the following:
(a) Continuously blowing oxygen-enriched air through the lances, located in the
bottom of the furnace shell, into the molten matte.
(b) Continuously feed of wet concentrate through feedports located on top of the
furnace shell.
(c) Continuously drawing offgas though a furnace uptake, located on one side of the
furnace.
(d) Intermittently tapping matte and slag from water-cooled tapholes located on oppo-
site sides of the furnace shell
Flux, coal, and reverts are also added, as required through the feed ports.
The SKS-BBS process has been applied for processing of relatively low copper con-
tent materials, containing signiﬁcant amounts of minor oxides. This feature, combined
with the use of high-pressure injection, has allowed the use of high oxygen enrichment.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

7.5.2 SKS-BBS reaction mechanisms
The main reactions involved in the SKS-BBS process are similar to those of the Noranda
and El Teniente processes when feed was added from the top of the furnace. Wang et al.
(2016) proposed a combination of a cross-section mass transfer and at a longitudinal sec-
tion multiphase interface mass transfer behavior to explain the fundamental metallurgical
aspects of the SKS-BBS process. The model, shown in Fig. 7.12, shows the proposed
cross-section and longitudinal model with six different zones across the reactor. Ta-
ble 7.10 presents the main characteristics attributed to each reactor zone. According to
Wang, the model is based on thermochemical fundamental analysis and practical obser-
vations in the SKS plants. However, plant data with longitudinal and vertical sampling to
validate the model are not reported in this publication.
7.5.3 SKS-BBS refractory campaign
The SKS-BBS technology is still novel and there are not enough plant data available at
the time of this edition to understand how long the refractory campaign could last. How-
ever, use of high pressureeenriched air and low operating temperature (under liquidus
temperature, with solids in suspension) ensures a relatively long refractory campaigns.
Gonzalez reported SKS-BBS campaigns of 1.5 years and 36 months from one operation
(Gonzalez, White, & Walters, 2019). New information should be available in the coming
years as smelters have been recently commissioned, to conﬁrm reported data.
Chen et al. (2016) reported analysis of accretions formed at the bottom of the furnace,
mainly consisting of spinel (olivine phase with entrained matte) and glass phases. The
sampled accretions were from the following:
•
Vicinity of the oxygen lance: Formed at high temperature and high oxygen partial
pressure in equilibrium with refractory material,
•
Side wall settling area: Formed at lower temperature showing high-Cu spinel,
magnetite spinel, and silica crystals in a crystalline structure (SiO2)

different zones within the reactor, with different chemical reactions and physical separation processes
taking place. (Reprinted from E proceedings Cu 2016, with permission from the Mining and Materials
Processing Institute of Japan).

7.5.4 SKS-BBS lances (Bin and Suping, 2019; Li, 2016; Xiaohong, Kefei,
Shuangjie, & Xin, 2016)
Fig. 7.13 shows a typical design of an SKS-BBS lance (Xiaohong, Kefei, Shuangjie, &
Xin, 2016). High pressure, enriched air required for the smelting of the materials is added
via lances (similar to tuyeres) located on the bottom of the furnace. Oxygen is injected
through the outer ring, while oxygen ﬂows through the inner ring of the lance. The
pressure is between 0.5 and 0.8 MPa. The number of lances varies depending on the
processing capacity. Typical intermediate size furnaces will have between ﬁve and nine
lances in service and large furnaces will have up to 28 lances. The lance is of two-
sleeved pipes, with inner pipe ﬂowing oxygen and outer air. The injection pressure is
in the range of 0.5e0.8 Mpa and the oxygen enrichment between 70% and 75%. The
relatively high injection pressure allows the formation of accretions that help protecting
the lance tip.
The SKS-BBS lances have the following characteristics:
•
Lance operates submerged on the matte phase
•
It has double casing and the inner tube has a constant section area
•
Separation between the lances is between 0.8 and 1.3 m
•
There are two channels between the inner and outer tube with cooling air ﬂowing
between the channels
•
Head of the lance is manufactured of high-quality materials to allow longer service life
•
Lance must be monitored on regular basis to ensure proper performance
In larger SKS-BBS plants, number of lances increase to 28 units.

7.5.5 SKS-BBS operating parameters
Table 7.11 shows selected design and operating parameters of SKS-BBS furnaces in
China (Bin & Suping, 2019; Wang, Liu, Yang, Tang, & Liao, 2019; Kapusta & Watt,
2019; Yan, 2016). Plant capacities ﬂuctuate between 600,000 and 1,000,000 t/y of cop-
per concentrates. The furnace operates on high Fe/SiO2 ratio decreasing the amount of
generated slag. There is a slight temperature proﬁle between the matte, slag, and off-gas
phases. Slag temperature seems to be selected just under the liquidus temperature,
ensuring adequate proportion of solids in the slag to protect the refractories.
7.5.6 SKS-BBS minor elements distribution (Li, 2016; Lile et al., 2016)
Table 7.12 shows the distribution of minor elements for the SKS-BBS process. To
compare the data with other technologies, process conditions associated with the parti-
tion are required. However, in general, the SKS-BBS process shows a large volatilization
of arsenic and lead. The two references show discrepancies in the deportment of bismuth
and lead.

7.5.7 Side-blown smelting process (Wang, Liu, Yang, Tang, & Liao, 2019)
The Side-blown smelting process (Side Blown Furnace, SBF) has been applied for the pro-
cessing of copper concentrates and industrial solid wastes (Wang, Liu, Yang, Tang, &
Liao, 2019). The SBF concept, originally developed to treat high lead slags, has been
gradually applied to the processing of a wide range of raw materials, including zinc waste
materials, industrial wastes, slags, among others. The SBF process has the following main
characteristics:
(a) Mixed feed materials are continuously fed to the furnace top
(b) Enriched air is blown into the molten slag (Jifeng version) or matte (Baijin version)
via tuyeres located on the side of the furnace
(c) The narrow cross-section allows to have a vigorous agitation to ensure fast and
complete reactions
Some of the main features of the SBF process are as follows:
•
Simple feed preparations as drying or pelletizing are not required
•
Low dust ration (below 2%)
•
Moisture of feed between 7% and 10% (as received)
•
Low copper content in slag
•
High oxygen enrichment (up to 85%)
•
Coal is added to maintain heat balance and control magnetite levels
In terms of reaction mechanism, Ling (2019) listed a series of chemical reactions to
describe the SBF process. The proposed reactions are, in general, similar to those reported
for the SKS-BBS process. Typical selected operating parameters for SBF plants are shown
in Table 7.11
7.5.8 Baijin and Jifeng SBF furnace design
Fig. 7.14 and 7.15 show typical structures of the SBF Baijin and Jifeng furnaces (Bin &
Suping, 2019; Wang, Liu, Yang, Tang, & Liao, 2019). The SBF furnace is a stationary
vessel that can be divided in three main areas (bottom to top view):
•
Hearth: Made of fused MgeCr refractory bricks. This area also has water-cooled
jackets at the bath level
•
Middle section consisting of the bath and postcombustion areas

Top section: Also includes a steel water-cooled jacket around the feedport area
The nozzles are located on both side of the furnace and are made of stainless steel and
red metal copper composites. They are installed within the copper jacket structure.
A water-cooled partition wall is located at the uptake shaft near the charging ports.
Matte and slag discharging areas are located at opposite ends of the furnace. Matte is dis-
charged via a syphon and slag via overﬂow. Emergency discharge holes are also provided
at both ends of the furnace in case of emergency-operational requirements.
The main differences between the Baijin and Jifeng designs are the following:
•
The Jifeng design blows the enriched air into the molten slag Fig. 7.15
•
The Baijin design blows the enriched air into the molten matte Fig. 7.14. This design
also incorporates a settling area in addition to the smelting area, achieving lower
copper contents in the slag (0.80% Cu)
•
The Baiyin process does not have a postcombustion tuyere line in their design
The SBF process has been also coupled with the horizontal multilance top blowing
furnace as part of a continuous copper making process (Ling, 2019).

7.5.9 Baijin and Jifeng SBF typical operating parameters
Table 7.11 shows some selected operating parameters for the SBF furnaces at Chifeng and
Heding smelters (Bin & Suping, 2019; Wang, Liu, Yang, Tang, & Liao, 2019; Kapusta &
Watt, 2019; Yan, 2016).
7.6 Concluding remarks
The main characteristic of bath smelting processes is the transfer of oxygen into molten
phase to produce copper matte. Oxygen can be transferred to the slag as in case of TSL
processes, Vanyukov, and the SBF-Baijin process or to the molten bath as in case of the
SKS-BBS, Noranda, El Teniente, and SBF Jifeng processes.
Bath smelting processes are ﬂexible and capable of processing a variety of materials
from low- to high-grade copper. They can operate from medium (35%) to very high
(90%) oxygen enrichment conditions. Depending on the process, they can produce
matte grades from 55% to 74% copper.
Submerged blowing of blast causes violent stirring of the matte/slag bath. This results
in rapid melting and oxidation of the furnace charge. It also prevents excessive deposition
of solid magnetite in the furnace even under highly oxidizing conditions. The violent
stirring also permits extensive smelting of scrap and reverts.

Bath matte smelting processes

7.6.1 Tuyere lance processes
SKS-BBS, SBF, Teniente, and Noranda are submerged tuyere (or lance) smelting
processes. They oxidize Fe and S by blowing oxygen-enriched air through submerged
tuyeres into a matte-slag bath. The principal product is super high grade matte,
72%e74% Cu.
The Teniente and Noranda use horizontal refractory-lined cylindrical furnaces with a
horizontal line of submerged tuyeres. The furnaces are rotatable so that their tuyeres can
be rolled out of the liquids when blowing must be interrupted.
The SKS-BBS process has a similar furnace design injecting enriched oxygen via
lances located on the furnace shell bottom.
The SBF process is a stationary vessel with two different design, injected enriched air
via tuyeres into the slag (Baijin process) or matte (Jifeng process).
The SKS-BBS process has experienced a signiﬁcant growth in the last 10 years, with
several plants installed in China.
Compared with the traditional Noranda and El Teniente bath smelting processes, the
SKS-BBS process uses high oxygen enrichment at relatively high injection pressure.
The process also operates at high Fe/SiO2 ratios, achieving low copper content in slag.
The process operates under relatively low operating temperatures achieving larger
furnace refractory campaigns compared with the Noranda and El Teniente processes.
A third submerged tuyere copper smelting technology is Vanyukov smelting. It uses
stationary furnaces and is used in Russia and Kazakhstan.
7.6.2 TSL processes
TSL Metso Outotec Ausmelt and ISASMELT smelting processes are done in verti-
cally aligned cylindrical furnaces 3.5e5 m diameter and 12e16 m high. The smelting en-
tails the following:
(a) dropping moist concentrate, ﬂux, and recycle materials into a molten matte/slag
bath in a hot furnace
(b) blowing oxygen-enriched air through a vertical lance into the matte/slag bath.
Most of the energy for smelting is obtained from oxidizing the Fe and S in the
concentrate.
The principal product of the furnace is a matte/slag mixture. It is tapped into a
hydrocarbon ﬁred or electric settling furnace. The products after settling are 60% Cu
matte and 0.7% Cu slag. The main advantages of the process are as follows:
(a) its small footprint, which makes it easy to retroﬁt into existing smelters
(b) its ability to process a variety of feed materials, and
(c) its small evolution of dust.

CHAPTER 8
Converting of copper matte
8.1 Introduction
As explained in Section 4.4, copper converting is the oxidation of molten CueFeeS
matte to form molten blister copper (99% Cu). It entails oxidizing Fe and S from the
matte with oxygen-enriched air or air blast.
The main raw materials for converting are
•
CueFeeS matte (molten and/or solid) from the smelting stage
•
ﬂux to allow slag formation with the oxidized iron
•
oxygen for the oxidation (air, or oxygen-enriched air)
•
additional cooling agents to manage heat generation and increase copper production,
in the form of Cu-bearing materials such as solidiﬁed Cu-bearing reverts and copper
scrap.
The main products of copper matte converting are
1. molten blister copper, which is sent to ﬁre reﬁning and electroreﬁning,
2. molten slag, which is sent to Cu recovery, and
3. SO2-bearing offgas, which is sent to cooling, dust removal, and H2SO4 manufacture.
The heat for converting is supplied entirely by Fe and S oxidation, i.e., the process is
autothermal. As heat is released through the converting process, several other inputs are
fed to the process to allow a proper heat management.
The converting process can be carried out on a batch or continuous basis. Table 8.1
compares some relevant fundamental aspects of batch and continuous copper converting
processes.
A batch process involves addition of molten matte to a reactor, addition of silica ﬂux
and gradual oxidation in one or two stages, depending on the iron content of the copper
matte:
•
Slag blowing, meant to oxidize iron sulﬁde from the matte, and
•
Copper blowing, to remove sulfur from copper sulﬁde, generating blister copper.
Air (often enriched) is blown into molten matte through submerged tuyeres (Figs. 8.1
and 8.2).
For smelters processing intermediate grade matte (55%e65% Cu), slag blowing is
done in sequential stages. The reactor is charged with an initial load, starting the oxida-
tion process for removal of iron. It is then loaded once again, after a ﬁrst blowing to
repeat the process and increase the total amount of material in the reactor, until achieving
the right amount of high-grade matte (bath level), to continue with the copper blowing
stage.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Smelters processing high copper content matte grade (above 75%) use a single copper
blowing stage, with a highly oxidized rich copper containing slag poured at the end of the
converting process.
The copper continuous converting process, on the other hand, has a different oper-
ating strategy. The reactor operates at a ﬁxed oxygenesulfur potential, corresponding to
the required sulfur level in blister. This condition is deﬁned by the copper content in the
slag in equilibrium with the blister copper, aimed to instantaneously remove iron and
sulfur and produce the required blister copper. These two operating philosophies are
described in Chapter 4.
The main two ﬂuxes used for converting processes are
•
Silica: Used for batch and continuous converting
•
Lime or limeesilica mixture: Used for continuous converting

8.2 Technology options for batch and continuous copper converting
Most of the smelters are currently using the PeirceeSmith batch converting process.
Even though this technology is more than 100 years old, smelters are still investing in
upgrading these installations and adding ancillary supporting systems to improve their
environmental performance and meet tighter regulations (Gas Cleaning & Energy
Solutions, 2020; Ramírez, 2019). Hoboken converters, an alternative batch converting
technology, are currently in use at Caraiba Metais and Miami Smelter.
A new variation of batch copper converting is the DongyingeFangyuan convertinge
reﬁning process, to be discussed in Chapter 9 as part of continuous copper processes. In
Figure 8.1 PeirceeSmith Converter. Note the blast supply, rotating seal and bustle pipe connected to
the tuyeres. Flux and Cu-bearing reverts are added from bins above the offgas uptake or by air gun
(Garr Gun) through an end of the converter. The converter rotates around its long axis in order to lift its
tuyeres out of the liquids when it is not blowing and submerge them correctly in the matte during
blowing, Fig. 8.2. (Converter drawing courtesy HarbisoneWalker Refractories, Pittsburgh, PA).

this process, the gradual oxidation is managed until the copper achieves sulfur and oxygen
contents of anode copper quality, making it suitable for casting and electroreﬁning (Cui
et al., 2016).
Continuous copper converting, aimed to improve productivity, reduce cost, and
improve environmental performance, has been a permanent focus of attention in the
copper industry.
In 1985, Kennecott and Outokumpu reported their initial testwork to develop ﬂash
converting. The testwork involved the exploration of several process conditions to
convert ground copper matte (55%e70% Cu) to blister copper (Asteljoki et al., 1985).
The concept was ﬁnally industrially implemented at Kennecott Utah Copper Smelter
in 1995. Noranda (now Glencore) capitalized their experience in the development of
the Noranda Process (also tested for a direct to blister process), with pilot test work con-
ducted between 1991 and 1993, engineering design, construction, and commissioning of
the Noranda Converter in 1997 (Boisvert et al., 1998). The Mitsubishi process, on the
other hand, explored the option of combining their continuous converting process
developed with the Noranda reactor at Port Kembla smelter in Australia in 2000
(West et al., 2002). Top Submerged Lance technology providers Ausmelt (now Meto
Outotec Ausmelt) and Glencore also reported their efforts to implement their converting
processes since early 2000, with new processes tested and industrially demonstrated in
China (Wood, Matusewicz, & Reuter, 2009) and Zambia (Hunt & de Vries, 2019).
Despite these efforts, no more than ﬁve plants were using continuous converting pro-
cesses in 2010. However, after 2010 and following the increasing copper demand driven

by the Chinese economy, several new plants have been commissioned in China. Ta-
ble 8.2 shows the current list of the smelters using continuous converting technologies
(Bin & Suping, 2019; ICSG, 2017; Kapusta, 2019b; Yongcheng et al., 2019). Most of
these plants use ﬂash converting and newly developed Chinese processes such as bottom
blowing converting and top blowing converting (Feng & Huilan, 2019).

some solid Fe3O4
(8.1)
For intermediate copper matte grades, converting takes place in two stages. The ﬁrst
stage is the slag-forming stage when Fe and S are oxidized to FeO, Fe3O4, and SO2 by re-
actions like
FeSðlÞ þ 1.5 O2ðgÞ/FeOðsÞ þ SO2ðgÞ
(8.2)
3FeSðlÞ þ 5O2ðgÞ/Fe3O4ðsÞ þ 3SO2ðgÞ
(8.3)
The melting points of FeO and Fe3O4 are 1377 and 1597C, so silica ﬂux is added to
form a liquid slag with FeO and Fe3O4.
2FeOðlÞ þ SiO2ðsÞ/2FeO SiO2ðlÞ
(8.4)
The slag-forming stage is ﬁnished when the Fe in the matte has been lowered to
about 1%. The principal product of the slag-forming stage is impure molten Cu2S (white
metal) at w1200C.
The second stage is copper making when the sulfur in Cu2S is oxidized to SO2. Copper
is not appreciably oxidized until it is almost devoid of S. Thus, the blister copper product
of converting is low in both S and O (0.001%e0.03% S, 0.1%e0.8% O). Nevertheless, if
this copper were cast, the S and O would form SO2 bubbles or blisters, which give blister
copper its name.
For high-grade matte, the converting process is carried out in a single combined slag-
copper blowing stage. The chemistry is similar, but activities of magnetite and copper oxide
are higher, increasing the amount of solids in equilibrium with the liquid slag and the copper
content in the slag. The implications of this operational strategy are discussed in Section 8.3.
Industrially, matte is charged to the converter in several steps, with each step followed
by oxidation of FeS from the charge. This is represented by several steps of increasing
(oxidation) and reduction of matte grade (fresh copper matte added) during the slag
blowing. Slag is poured from the converter after each oxidation step and a new matte
addition is made (Fig. 8.3). In this way, the amount of Cu in the converter gradually in-
creases until it is sufﬁcient (100e250 tonnes Cu as molten Cu2S) for a ﬁnal copper mak-
ing blow. At this point, the Fe in the matte is reduced by oxidation to about 1%, a ﬁnal
slag is removed, and the resulting white metal is oxidized to molten blister copper. The
converting process is terminated when copper oxide begins to appear in samples of the
molten copper.

The molten copper is poured from the converter into ladles and transported by crane
to a ﬁre-reﬁning furnace (Chapter 12) for S and O removal and casting of anodes. A start-
to-ﬁnish converting cycle typically lasts 6e12 h (Tables 8.3 and 8.4).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

8.3.2 Copper making reactions
Blowing air and oxygen into molten white metal creates a turbulent Cu2Secopper
mixture. The products of oxidation in this mixture are SO2, molten copper and copper
oxide. The molten copper is dense and ﬂuid. It quickly sinks below the tuyeres. The most
probable copper making reactions are
Cu2S þ 1.5O2/Cu2O þ SO2
(8.5)
Cu2S þ 2Cu2O/6CuðlÞ þ SO2
(8.6)
though some copper may be made directly by
Cu2S þ O2/2CuðlÞ þ SO2
(8.7)
In principle, there are three sequential steps in copper making, as indicated on the
CueS phase diagram (Fig. 8.4).
1. Blowing of air and oxygen into the Cu2S removes S as SO2 to give S-deﬁcient white
metal, but no metallic copper. The reaction for this step is
`Cu2S þ xO2/Cu2S1x þ xSO2
(8.8)
It takes place until the S is lowered to 19.6% (Fig. 8.4, point b, 1200C).
2. Subsequent blowing of air and oxygen creates a second liquid phase, metallic copper
(1% S, point c), to appear. It appears because the average composition of the liquids is
now in the liquideliquid immiscibility region. The molten copper phase is dense and
sinks to the bottom of the converter (Fig. 8.5). Further blowing oxidizes additional S
from the Cu2S, and the amount of molten copper increases at the expense of the
white metal, according to reaction (8.6). As long as the combined average

composition of the system is in the immiscibility range, the converter contains both
white metal (19.7% S) and molten copper (1% S). Only the proportions change.

and only molten copper (1% S) remains. Further blowing removes most of the

stage of converting. In practice, the liquid “b” region is a Cu2SeCueCu2Oegas foam/emulsion from which
metallic copper “c” descends and SO2 and N2 ascend. The immiscibility of copper and Cu2S is due to their
different structures; copper is metallic while Cu2S is a semiconductor. (After Peretti, E. A. (1948). An analysis
of the converting of copper matte. Discussions of the Faraday Society, 4, 179e184).

remaining S (point d). Great care is taken during this period to ensure that the copper
is not overoxidized to Cu2O. This care is necessary because Cu2S is no longer avail-
able to reduce Cu2O back to Cu by reaction (8.5).
Step (1) is very brief, because of the reduced requirements for S oxidation. Step (3) is
also brief. Its beginning is marked by a change in the converter ﬂame color from clear to
green when metallic copper begins to be oxidized in front of the tuyeres. This tells the
converter operator that the copper blow is nearly ﬁnished.
8.3.3 Elimination of impurities during converting
The principal elements removed from matte during converting are Fe and S. However,
many other impurities are partially removed as vapor or in slag. Table 8.5 shows some
minor element distributions. The outstanding feature of the data is that impurity reten-
tion in the product blister copper increases signiﬁcantly with increasing matte grade (%Cu
in matte). This is because high-Cu mattes have less blast blown through them, and they
form less slag.
The table also shows that signiﬁcant amounts of impurities report to the offgas. They
are eventually collected during gas cleaning as part of the generated dust or in efﬂuents
from the acid plant. The collected dust contains sufﬁcient Cu to be recycled to the smelt-
ing furnace. However, such recycle returns all impurities to the circuit as well. For this
reason, some smelters treat the dusts for impurity removal before they are recycled (Men-
doza and Luraschi, 1993). Bismuth, in particular, is removed because it causes brittleness
in the ﬁnal copper anodes and it can be a valuable byproduct.
8.4 Industrial PeirceeSmith converting operations
Modern industrial PeirceeSmith converters are typically 4.5 m diameter by 12 m long.
They consist of a 5 cm steel shell lined with w0.5 m of magnesiteechrome refractory

brick. Converters of these dimensions treat 600e1000 tonnes of matte per day to pro-
duce 500e900 tonnes of copper. Typical compositions of converter raw materials and
products are shown in Table 8.6.
A smelter will have two to ﬁve converters depending on its overall smelting capacity.
Oxygen-enriched air or air is blown into a converter at 600e850 Nm3/min and 1.2 bar
gauge. It is blown through a single line of 50 mm diameter tuyeres, 40 to 60 per converter.
It enters the matte 0.5e1 m below its surface, nearly horizontal (Lehner et al., 1993).
The ﬂowrate per tuyere is about 14 Nm3/min at a velocity of 100e130 m per second.
Blowing rates above about 17 Nm3/min/tuyere cause slopping of matte and slag from
the converter (Johnson et al., 1979). High blowing rates without slopping are favored
by deep tuyere submergence in the matte (Richards et al., 1986).
About half of the operating PeirceeSmith converters enrich their air blast with indus-
trial oxygen, up to w29 vol-% O2.
8.4.1 Tuyeres
PeirceeSmith tuyeres are carbon steel or stainless steel pipes embedded in the converter
refractory (Fig. 8.2). They are joined to a distribution bustle pipe which is afﬁxed the
length of the converter and connected through a rotatable seal to a blast supply ﬂue.
The blast air is pressurized by electric or steam driven blowers. Industrial oxygen is added
to the supply ﬂue just before it connects to the converter.
Steady ﬂow of blast requires periodic clearing (punching) of the tuyeres to remove
matte accretions which build up at their tips, especially during the slag blow (Fig. 8.6;
Bustos et al., 1984, 1988). Punching is done by ramming a steel bar completely through
the tuyere. It is usually done with a Gaspe mobile carriage puncher which runs on rails
behind the converter. Fig. 8.7 shows (a) an automatic Gaspe tuyere puncher and (b) an
operator control desk. Gaspe can be (Hinsberger & Marinigh, 2020; Marinigh, 2009)

Semiautomatic: In addition to the features of the manual machine, offers the option
to have a CCTV camera to provide remote control of the puncher from a remote
location, as shown in Fig. 8.7B. Alignment between tuyere puncher and tuyere is
fully automated. The traversing drive uses a DC servomotor capable of storing the
location of tuyeres relative to the punching machine. Punching cylinder control is
manually controlled by the operator,
•
Automatic: Machine not equipped with operator cab. In addition to the charac-
teristic of the semiautomatic machines, all punching cylinder control is fully auto-
mated. CCTV camera is also useful for verifying alignment of the recorded tuyere
location.
Punching machine area in front of the converter must be safely isolated to prevent
accidents as automatic machines may start operating and move at any time. Access
gates to the punching platform area are equipped with safety switches. Opening a
gate disables the puncher’s MCR. With the MCR deenergized, the puncher is iso-
lated from all electrical power. Also, deenergizing the MCR automatically bleeds
all air pressure from the puncher. A reset and start-up procedure is required to reini-
tiate the punching process.
An alternative to the Gaspe puncher is the Kennecott 4Be5 system, which consists of
a pneumatic cylinder actuated punch rod contained in a housing bolted to each tuyere
body (Pasca et al., 2005).
Figure 8.6 Photograph showing buildup of accretion at the interior end of a PeirceeSmith converter
tuyere (Bustos et al., 1984). Left, tuyere is nearly blocked; right, the accretion has dislodged spontane-
ously. Bustos et al. (1988) report that accretion “tubes” are formed in front of the tuyeres. They also
indicate that tuyere blockage is discouraged by high matte temperature and oxygen-enrichment of
the blast. This is particularly important near the end of the slag blow and the start of the copper
blow. Clear tuyere conditions at the beginning of the copper blow often give free blowing conditions
(without punching) during most or all of the copper blow. (Photograph courtesy of Dr. Alejandro Bustos,
Air Liquide).

8.4.2 Offgas collection
PeirceeSmith converters offgas is collected by a steel hood (usually water cooled) which
ﬁts as snugly as possible over the converter mouth. This is shown as the primary hood in
Fig. 8.8 (Mori et al., 2009). The gas then passes through a waste heat boiler or water-spray
cooler, electrostatic precipitators, before being directed to a sulfuric acid plant. Peircee
Smith converter offgases contain w8 vol.-% SO2 (slag blow) to w10 vol.-% SO2 (copper
blow) after cooling and dust removal (Tables 8.1 and 8.2).
Also shown in Fig. 8.8 is the secondary hood and fugitive gas collection system. This
system collects dilute SO2 gas not captured by the primary hood. Primary and secondary
hood system designs vary considerably. Fig. 8.9 shows an example of a primary hood sys-
tem with water-cooled smooth panels (Br€annström & Hedlund, 2013). All Peircee
Smith converters have a primary gas capture system, with most of them having these
days also secondary gas capture systems.
The incorporation of effective secondary and sometimes even tertiary gas capture sys-
tems on PierceeSmith converters has been driven by the need to meet more strengthen

environmental regulations aimed to improve sulfur capture, and improve the working
conditions within the smelters. Examples of this trend have been the new regulations
imposed for operating smelters in Chile, that are required to capture over 95% of sulfur
(Ramirez, 2019), and for any new smelter to be erected in the country over 98%
(Libertad y Desarrollo, 2012). The state of Arizona, in USA, also imposed a new standard
in 2012, requiring copper smelters to reduce sulfur emissions during a 24-hour period.
Based on this new regulation, FMI Miami Smelter and Asarco Hayden Copper devel-
oped new solutions to improve their sulfur capture. Fig. 8.10 shows the new installed
PeirceeSmith converters and hoods at Asarco Hayden (Russell et al., 2016).

8.4.3 Temperature control
All heat required for maintaining the converter liquids at their speciﬁed temperatures re-
sults from Fe and S oxidation, i.e., from reactions like
FeS þ 1.5O2/FeO þ SO2 þ heat
(8.9)
Cu2S þ O2/2CuðlÞ þ SO2 þ heat
(8.10)
Converter temperature can be raised by oxygen enrichment, which reduces the rate
at which N2 coolant enters the converter and can be lowered by increasing the amount of
revert and scrap copper added.
8.4.4 Choice of temperature
Representative liquid temperatures during converting are 1200C for the input matte
and blister copper, and 1220C for the skimmed slag. The high temperature during
the middle of the cycle is designed to give rapid slag formation and ﬂuid slag with a min-
imum of entrained matte. It also discourages tuyere blockage (Bustos et al., 1987). An
upper limit of about 1250C is imposed to prevent excessive refractory wear.
8.4.5 Temperature measurement
Converter liquid temperature is measured by means of an optical pyrometer sighted
downwards through the converter mouth or a two-wavelength optical pyrometer peri-
scope sighted through a tuyere (Marinigh, 2009). The tuyere pyrometer (Fig. 8.11) is
preferred because it sights directly on the matte rather than through a dust-laden

atmosphere. RHI Magnesita has developed a continuous online temperature measure-
ment system based on the use of a digital ﬁber optic pyrometer, which is embedded in
a refractory housing (Vukovic et al., 2016).
8.4.6 Slag and ﬂux control
The main objective of creating a slag in the converter is to liquefy newly formed solid
FeO and Fe3O4 so they can be poured from the converter. SiO2-bearing ﬂux (e.g.,
quartz, quartzite, sand) is added for this purpose. Enough SiO2 ﬂux is added to produce
an SiO2/Fe ratio of w0.5. The selection of the SiO2/Fe ratio also deﬁnes the process
temperature at which the converter operates to keep a liquid slag with an adequate
amount of Fe3O4 to protect refractories (coating) without compromising copper recov-
ery due to excessive matte entrainment. Acceptable Fe3O4 levels are typically 12%e18%
(Eltringham, 1993). Thermodynamic and process modeling packages can support process
engineers selecting suitable process conditions for the slag blowing stage. Fig. 8.12 shows
the liquidus line for different Fe/SiO2 ratio as a function of the remaining Fe content in
matte and the temperature (Cardona et al., 2013).
Some smelters use Au- and Ag-bearing siliceous material as converter ﬂux. The Au
and Ag dissolve in the matte and proceed with copper to the electroreﬁnery where
they are proﬁtably recovered. These smelters tend to maximize ﬂux input. Most smelters,
however, use just enough ﬂux to obtain an appropriately ﬂuid slag. This minimizes ﬂux
cost, slag handling, and the expense of recovering Cu from the slag.
8.4.7 Slag formation rate
Flux is added through chutes above the converter mouth or via a high pressure air gun
(Garr Gun) at one end of the converter. It is added at a rate that matches the rate of Fe
oxidation (usually after an initial several-minute delay while the converter heats up). The
Figure 8.11 Tuyere pyrometer schematic (Heath and Sherwood, 2021).
Converting of copper matte

ﬂux is commonly crushed to 1e5 cm diameter. Sand (0.1 cm) is used in some smelters.
Rapid reaction between O2, matte, and ﬂux to form liquid slag is encouraged by
1. high operating temperature,
2. steady input of small and evenly sized ﬂux (Schonewille et al., 1993),
3. deep tuyere placement in the matte (to avoid overoxidation of the slag),
4. the vigorous mixing provided by the PeirceeSmith converter,
5. reactive ﬂux.
Casley et al. (1976) and Schonewille et al. (1993) report that the most reactive ﬂuxes
are those with a high percentage of quartz (rather than tridymite or feldspar).
8.4.8 End point determinations
8.4.8.1 Slag blow
The slag-forming stage is terminated, and slag is poured from the converter when there is
about 1% Fe left in the matte. Further blowing causes excessive Cu and solid magnetite in
slag. The blowing is terminated when
1. metallic copper begins to appear in matte samples or when X-ray ﬂuorescence shows
76%e79% Cu in matte (Mitarai et al., 1993)
2. the converter ﬂame turns green from Cu vapor in the converter offgas
3. PbS vapor (from Pb in the matte feed) concentration decreases and PbO vapor con-
centration increases (Persson et al., 1999).
8.4.8.2 Copper blow
The copper making stage is terminated the instant that copper oxide begins to appear in
copper samples. Copper oxide attacks converter refractory, so it is avoided as much as
Figure 8.12 Example of process calculation showing the impact of Fe content in matte and operating
temperature for different Fe/SiO2 ratios (Cardona et al., 2013). (Reprinted with permission of the Instituto
de Ingenieros de Minas de Chile (Chilean Institute of Mining Engineers), IIMCH).

possible. The copper blow is ended, and metallic copper is poured from the converter
when
1. copper oxide begins to appear in the samples
2. SO2 concentration in the offgas falls because S is nearly gone from the matte (Shook
et al., 1999)
3. PbO concentration in the offgas falls and CuOH concentration increases (H from
moisture in the air blast; Persson et al., 1999).
8.5 Batch converting of high matte grades
Low iron content copper mattes are produced in bath smelting reactors such as El
Teniente, Noranda, or the newly developed Chinese bottom blowing furnace. Due to
the low iron content, and the relatively high oxygen potential required to continue
the converting process, iron oxidation cannot be controlled in the same way as in a tradi-
tional slag blowing process, to allow a controlled slagging of iron and formation of fayalite
by the addition of silica.
Cardona et al. (2013) reported the efforts carried out at Atlantic Copper to control
iron removal during the converting of intermediate matte grades (Fig. 8.12). Using a
thermochemical modeling approach, they concluded that the ﬁrst slagging operation
should be ideally conducted at iron contents over 4% to minimize excess soluble cop-
per deportment to slags requiring further cleaning steps in electric furnaces. For the
second slag blowing they recommended Fe/SiO2 ratios under 1.9 to minimize spinel
concentration and therefore increased entrained and soluble copper losses. However,
in practice, this ﬁne adjustment can be challenging due to operational constraints and
unsuitable process control. In this case, the additional iron left in the matte will be
responsible for additional generation of “mushy” slag during copper blowing.
Table 8.7 compares some relevant metallurgical parameters for the traditional
two-stage batch converting process operated at Atlantic Copper and for single-
stage batch converting process as mainly conducted in Chilean smelters. The main
difference can be appreciated in the high-copper slag achieved in the conversion of
high matte grades.
Warczok et al. (2001) reported that batch converting of high-grade copper mattes in
the PierceeSmith converter faced difﬁculties with the proper slagging of iron oxides. To
overcome this operational challenge, smelters were overblown during a single copper
making converting stage (combination of slag and copper blowing), allowing the forma-
tion of a liquid slag. However, this combined single stage led to high content of copper
oxide in the converter slag that must be recycled to the smelting unit, creating new oper-
ational and environmental issues. They recommended a separate pyrometallurgical treat-
ment of the converter slag to increase the overall smelter recovery and decrease impurity
content in blister copper.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Henao and Moyano (2016, (Henao et al., 2019) also reported the operational copper
converting difﬁculties of Chilean copper smelters due to the processing of high-grade
copper mattes (68%e75% Cu), with the generation of a semisolid converting slag.
They recommended the addition of CaO to reduce the formation of FeeCu oxides.
In general, batch converting of high-grade copper mattes might be disadvantageous
due to generation of highly oxidized slags, and increased reverts, containing high amount
of copper oxide.
8.6 Oxygen enrichment of PeirceeSmith converter blast
Most smelters enrich their converter blast during part or all of the converting cycle. The
advantages of O2 enrichment are
1. oxidation rate is increased for a given blast input rate
2. SO2 concentration in offgas is increased, making gas handling and acid making
cheaper
3. the amount of N2 coolant entering the converter per kg of O2-in-blast is diminished.
The reduction of N2 is important because it permits (a) generation of high temper-
atures even with high-grade mattes, which have less FeS “fuel,” (b) rapid heating of
the converter and its contents, and (c) increased melting of valuable coolants such as
reverts and copper scrap.
The only disadvantages of high-O2 blast are the cost of the oxygen, and the high
reaction temperature that results at the tuyere tip. This leads to rapid refractory erosion
in the tuyere area. This erosion is discouraged by blowing at a high velocity, which

promotes tubular accretion formation and pushes the reaction zone away from the tuyere
tip (Bustos et al., 1988). However, use of high pressure can overcome this disadvantage.
On balance, the advantages of O2 enrichment outweigh the refractory erosion disad-
vantages, especially in smelters which wish to convert high mattes, maximize converting
rate, especially if converting is a production bottleneck, and maximize melting of solids
such as ﬂux, reverts, and scrap.
The present upper practical limit of oxygen enrichment seems to be about 29 vol.-%
O2. Above this level, refractory erosion becomes excessive. This is because strong tubular
accretions do not form in front of the tuyeres above 29 vol.-% O2, causing the O2-matte
reactions to take place ﬂush with the tuyere tip and refractory. Sonic high-pressure
blowing is expected to permit higher oxygen levels (Hills et al., 2007).
8.7 Maximizing converter productivity
The production rate of a converter is maximized by
1. charging high Cu grade (low FeS) matte to the converter (Fig. 8.13)
2. blowing the converter blast at its maximum rate (including avoidance of tuyere
blockages)
3. enriching the blast to its maximum feasible O2 level
4. maximizing O2 utilization efﬁciency (deep tuyere submergence)
5. minimizing idle time along with efﬁcient crane scheduling for material transfers
6. maximizing campaign life (Section 8.4.3)

208
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

High-grade matte contains little FeS, so it requires little O2 (and time) to convert
(Fig. 8.13). Rapid blowing of blast, a high %O2 in blast, and high O2 utilization efﬁciency
all lead to rapid oxidation. However, the blast rate should be maintained at a level that
prevents bath slopping, which leads to excessive wave motion on the surface and uncon-
trolled splashing (Kapusta, 2010). This splashing results in rapid accretion growth on the
converter mouth, ultimately decreasing availability. Efﬁcient scheduling, high crane
availability, and shortening the time for transferring matte, slag and blister copper through
optimizing ladle size also increases converter productivity (Mori et al., 2009).
8.7.1 Maximizing solids melting
An important service of the PeirceeSmith converter is melting of valuable solids using
the heat from the converting reactions. Typical solids include Cu-bearing revert mate-
rials, scrap copper, and Au- and Ag-bearing ﬂux. Cu concentrate is also melted in several
smelters. Melting of solids is maximized by (a) maximizing blast O2 enrichment and
(b) blowing the converter at a rapid rate with the tuyeres deep in the matte. This max-
imizes reaction rate, and thus heat production rate (at an approximately constant heat loss
rate from the converter).
The solids are added steadily to avoid excessive cooling of the converter liquids. This
is easily done with ﬂux and reverts, which can be crushed and added at controlled rates
from storage bins above the converter. Scrap copper, on the other hand, is often large and
uneven in shape. It is usually added in batches by crane with the converter in the charging
position. This has the disadvantages that blowing must be stopped and the large batch of
scrap may excessively cool the converter liquids.
Several converters have conveyor systems which feed large pieces of copper (scrap an-
odes and purchased blister copper) at a steady rate during blowing (Fukushima et al.,
1988; Maruyama et al., 1998). This avoids excessive cooling and maximizes the con-
verter’s scrap melting capability. Up to 30% of a converter’s blister copper product comes
from copper scrap (Fukushima et al., 1988; Pannell, 1987).
8.7.2 Smelting concentrates in the converter
Most smelters melt scrap copper and solid reverts in the PeirceeSmith converter. Several
smelters also smelt dried concentrates in their converters by injecting the concentrates
through the tuyeres (Kawai et al., 2005; Mast et al., 1999). The technology is well-
proven and has two advantages: (a) it can increase smelter capacity without major invest-
ment in a larger smelting furnace, and (b) it can lengthen the converting blow and
improve removal of impurities, especially bismuth and antimony.
8.7.3 Maximizing campaign life
Converters produce 50,000e90,000 tonnes of blister copper before they must be taken
out of service for tuyere refractory replacement. The replacement takes about 2 weeks
Converting of copper matte
209

and it is done many times before the converter must be completely relined (shelled). Cop-
per production per tuyere-refractory replacement period (campaign life) has continued to
increase due to
a. improved, higher quality refractories
b. higher-grade matte feeds (requiring less blowing per tonne of Cu)
c. better temperature measurement and control.
The most suitable refractories for the copper converting duties are ﬁred magnesiae
chromite bricks. Industrial evidence suggests that oxygen enrichment up to 25% O2 en-
hances converter productivity without shortening campaign life. This is especially true if
converter blowing rates are high (Verney, 1987). Enrichment above this level should be
tracked to determine the optimum from the points of view of converter productivity and
campaign life.
Suzuki et al. (2016) reported their efforts to extend the converter campaign life by
reducing oxygen enrichment during the slag blowing stage, managing bath levels to
reduce splashing to the waste heat boiler section and conducting a proactive management
of spring hammers in the waste heat boiler. Combination of these actions allowed Toyo
smelter to reach over 400 batches per campaign.
8.8 Recent improvements in PeirceeSmith converting
8.8.1 Shrouded sonic injection (Kapusta, 2019a)
Shrouded sonic injection has been of long-term interest to copper smelters; however,
despite its potential reported beneﬁts only a few smelters have adopted the technology
(Kapusta, 2010).
The previous edition of this book reported that the ALSI (Air Liquide Shrouded
Injector) technology was successfully demonstrated in the Thai Copper Smelter Peircee
Smith converters (Pagador et al., 2009). The process was able to
a. oxidize matte using 30%e60% O2 blast, thereby increasing converter productivity
and its ability to melt solids (Fig. 8.14)
b. eliminate the need to punch the converter (Section 8.4.1)
c. minimize refractory wear in the tuyere area.
The tuyere used to achieve these objectives consists of two concentric pipes: the inner
pipe for oxygen-enriched air blast (30%e60% O2) and the annulus for nitrogen. The
purpose of the nitrogen is (a) to cool the circumference of the tuyere tip and (b) to protect
the refractory around the tuyere by building up an accretion of solidiﬁed matte/slag.
The blast and nitrogen are blown in at high pressure, 4e8 bar gauge. This prevents
the accretion from bridging across the tuyere and eliminates the need for punching.
Following the implementation in Thai Copper, the ALSO technology was imple-
mented in the Copper Nickel Operations of Falconbridge, Canada, and Lonmin Plat-
inum in South Africa. In addition to the traditional copper and copperenickel matte
210
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

converting applications, Glencore Nickel developed a new process using sonic injection
by combining the slag-making and slag-cleaning processes, traditionally conducted in
separated vessels into a single vessel operation (Hybrid Vessel) (Kapusta, 2019a).
8.8.2 Scrap injection
Pneumatic injection of electronic scrap (<12 mm) at 1 tonne per hour into a converter
through a tuyere has been successfully implemented on a commercial scale (Coleman &
Money, 2009). This avoids charging through the mouth, allowing particulate (soot) and
dioxins to be captured by the primary gas handling system.
8.8.3 Converter shell design
The design of the steel converter shell has been improved through the use of curved disk
heads integrated with the shell (Chen et al., 2009). This design eliminates the gap
between the head and the shell, minimizing the risk of a molten metal leak.
8.8.4 Improvements to batch productivity
Katamata et al. (2016) reported the efforts at Saganoseki smelter to increase the batch pro-
ductivity by modifying the smelter operational strategy from 4 hotd2 blow to 3 hotd2
blow converters. This was achieved by extending the campaign life from 220 to 350
batches, increasing the blast rate and matte grade, modiﬁcations to the waste heat boiler
to increase energy recovery and improving the fugitive gas collection.
8.9 Alternatives to PeirceeSmith converting
PeirceeSmith converting has been used for over 100 years, and accounts for over 90% of
Cu matte converting. Around 250 converters are in operation worldwide in the com-
bined copper, nickel, and PGM industries (Price et al., 2009). This is due to its simplicity
and high chemical efﬁciency. PeirceeSmith converting has problems, however:
1. it leaks SO2-bearing gas into the workplace during charging and pouring
2. it leaks air into its offgas between its mouth and gas-collection hood, producing a rela-
tively weak SO2 gas
3. it operates batchwise, giving uneven ﬂow of SO2 offgas into the sulfuric acid plant.
These deﬁciencies are addressed by several different alternative converters:
1. The Hoboken or siphon converter, a PeirceeSmith converter with an improved gas-
collection system (four units operating, 2010)
2. Flash converting, which oxidizes solidiﬁed crushed matte in a small Outotec ﬂash
furnace (two units operating, 2010)
3. Noranda continuous converting, which uses submerged tuyeres to blow oxygen-
enriched air into matte in a Noranda-type furnace (one unit operating, 2020)
Converting of copper matte

4. The Mitsubishi top-blown converter, which blows oxygen-enriched blast onto the
molten matte surface via vertical lances (four units operating, 2020)
5. Metso Outotec Ausmelt TSL (top submerged lance) batch converting (two units
operating for matte converting, 2020)
6. ISASMELT (top submerged lance) batch converting (one unit operating for matte
converting, 2020)
7. ISACONVERT continuous converting (one unit operating for matte converting,
2020)
8. Bottom blowing converting (ﬁve units in operation in China)
9. Top Blown multilance converting (four units in operation in China)
In the 2011 edition, the CodelcoeChile Continuous Converting process was also
mentioned (Moyano et al., 2009). However, since then no new developments have
been reported.
8.9.1 Hoboken converter
The Hoboken converter collects its offgas through an axial ﬂue at one end of the con-
verter (Binegar & Tittes, 1993; Pasca et al., 2005). A gooseneck is provided to allow the
offgas (but not the liquids) to enter the ﬂue. The offgas is collected efﬁciently. Consider-
able care must be taken to prevent buildup of splash and dust in the gooseneck.
In 2020, four Hoboken converters were operating at the Freeport McMoRan smelter
in Miami, Arizona, and three Hoboken converters were operating in Caraiba Metais, in
Brazil. Three Hoboken converters were commissioned in 2004 at the Thai Copper In-
dustries smelter in Thailand (Pagador et al., 2009). The converter achieved design capac-
ities and were able to increase the consumption of reverts (Fig. 8.14) taking advantage of
the use of sonic injection. Unfortunately, the smelter has since shut down for other
reasons.

8.9.2 Flash converting (Fig. 8.15; Table 8.8)
Flash converting uses a small Outotec ﬂash furnace to convert solidiﬁed/crushed matte
(50 mm) to molten metallic copper (Davenport et al., 2001; Kojo et al., 2009). Flash con-
verting entails
1. tapping molten 70% Cu matte from a smelting furnace
2. granulating the molten matte to w0.5 mm granules in a water torrent
3. crushing the matte granules to 50 mm followed by drying
4. continuously feeding the dry crushed matte to the ﬂash converter with 80 vol.-% O2
blast and CaO ﬂux
5. continuously collecting offgas
6. periodically tapping molten blister copper and molten calcium ferrite slag.
The ﬁrst ﬂash converting furnace was commissioned in 1995 at Rio Tinto Kennecott
Utah Copper in Magna, UT, USA. Kennecott helped Outotec develop the process
known as KennecotteOutotec Flash Converting (Kojo et al., 2009). It is simply referred
to as ﬂash converting in this text. At 2020, ﬁve more ﬂash converting furnaces have been
commissioned in China, compared with 2010.
The uniqueness of the process is its use of particulate solid matte feed. Preparing this
feed involves extra processing, but it is the only way that a ﬂash furnace can be used for
converting.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

A beneﬁt of the solid matte feed is that it unlinks smelting and converting. A stockpile
of crushed matte can be built while the converting furnace is being repaired, and then
depleted while the smelting furnace is being repaired.
8.9.2.1 Chemistry

Exactly enough O2 is supplied to make metallic copper rather than Cu2S or Cu2O.
The products of the process are
1. molten copper (0.2% S, 0.3% O)
2. molten calcium ferrite slag (w16% CaO) containing w20% Cu
3. sulfated dust, w0.1 tonnes per tonne of matte feed
4. 30e40 vol-% SO2 offgas.
The molten copper is periodically tapped and sent forward to pyro- and electroreﬁn-
ing. The slag is periodically tapped, water-granulated, and sent back to the smelting
furnace. The offgas is collected continuously, cooled in a waste heat boiler, cleaned of
its dust, and sent to a sulfuric acid plant. The dust is recycled to the ﬂash converter
and ﬂash smelting furnace.
8.9.3 Choice of calcium ferrite slag
The ﬂash converter uses calcium ferrite slag. This slag is ﬂuid and shows little tendency to
foam (Chapter 5). It also absorbs some impurities (As, Bi, Sb, but not Pb) better than SiO2
slag. It is, however, somewhat corrosive and poorly amenable to controlled deposition of
solid magnetite on the converter walls and ﬂoor.
8.9.4 No matte layer
There is no matte layer in the ﬂash converter. This is shown by the 0.2% S content of its
blister copperdfar below the 1% S that would be in equilibrium with Cu2S matte. The
layer is avoided by adjusting the ratio of O2 input to matte feed rate to slightly favor
Cu2O formation rather than Cu2S formation. The matte layer is avoided to minimize
the possibility of SO2 formation (and slag foaming) by the reactions:

8.9.4.1 Productivity
Kennecott’s ﬂash converter treats w1700 tonnes of 70% Cu matte and produces w1300
tonnes of blister copper per day. It is roughly equivalent to three large PeirceeSmith
converters.
8.9.4.2 Flash converting summary
Flash converting is an extension of the successful Outotec ﬂash smelting process. It was
ﬁrst implemented at Kennecott Utah Copper in 1995. Campaign life has steadily
increased to around 5 years through improvements in the cooling systems and improved
process control (Janney et al., 2007; McKenna et al., 2010). Since the commissioning of
the second ﬂash converter in 2007 at the Yanggu Xiangguang copper smelter in China,
ﬁve additional ﬂash converters have been commissioned in China (Bin & Suping, 2019).
The process has the disadvantages that (a) it requires granulated and crushed matte,
which requires extra energy, and (b) it is not yet well adapted to melting scrap copper.
On the other hand, it has a simple, efﬁcient matte oxidation system and efﬁciently col-
lects offgas and dust.
8.9.5 Submerged tuyere Noranda continuous converting
Noranda continuous converting developed from Noranda submerged tuyere smelting. It
uses a rotary furnace (Fig. 8.16) with
1. a large mouth for charging molten matte and large pieces of scrap
2. an endwall slinger and hole for feeding ﬂux, reverts and coke
3. a second large mouth for drawing offgas into a hood and acid plant
4. tuyeres for injecting oxygen-enriched air into the molten matte
5. tapholes for separately tapping molten matte and slag
6. a rolling mechanism for correctly positioning the tuyere tips in the molten matte.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The converter operates continuously and always contains molten copper, molten
matte (mainly Cu2S), and molten slag. It blows oxygen-enriched air continuously
through its tuyeres and continuously collects w20% SO2 offgas. It taps copper and
slag intermittently. It presently operates at the Glencore Horne (formerly Noranda
Horne) smelter in Quebec (Table 8.9).

Converting of copper matte

8.9.5.1 Chemical reactions
The Noranda converting process is a continuous converting process with three molten
phases in equilibrium: copper saturated with sulfur, copper sulﬁde, and slag. The process
controls matte and O2 input rates to always have matte (mainly Cu2S) in the furnace. It is
this matte phase that is continuously oxidized by tuyere-injected O2.
The constant presence of this matte is conﬁrmed by the high S content (w1.3%) in
the molten copper product.
8.9.5.2 Reaction mechanisms
Reactions in the Noranda continuous converter are as follows:
1. a ladle of molten w70% Cu matte (5%e10% Fe, w22% S) is poured into the furnace,
mixing with the molten matte layer between copper and slag.
2. this matte is oxidized by O2 in the tuyere blast by the reactions

3. as the matte phase is continuously consumed, drops of molten slag rise and drops of
molten copper fall below the tuyeres to the molten copper layer.
4. the matte layer is replenished with Cu, Fe, and S by the next ladle of matte feed.
Slag, matte, gas, and copper are intimately mixed in emulsion form in the converter’s
tuyere zone, so the above reaction scheme is an oversimpliﬁcation. Nevertheless, the
concept of slag formation, copper formation, matte consumption, and intermittent matte
replenishment is probably correct.
8.9.5.3 Silicate slag
Noranda continuous converting uses SiO2 slag rather than the CaO slag used for Mitsu-
bishi and ﬂash converting. This is because (a) the Cu2S layer in the Noranda converter
tends to reduce magnetite so that magnetite solubility (in CaO-base slag) is not critical
and (b) SiO2 slag is cheaper, less corrosive, and more easily controlled than CaO slag.
8.9.5.4 Control
The critical control parameters in Noranda continuous converting are (a) matte temper-
ature and (b) matte layer position and thickness (to ensure that tuyere O2 blows into the
matte rather than the slag or copper).
218
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Matte temperature is measured continuously with a Noranda tuyere two-wavelength
optical pyrometer (Prevost et al., 1999). It is adjusted by increasing or decreasing the rate
at which solid coolants (solid matte, slag concentrate, reverts, etc.) are charged to the con-
verter. Natural gas combustion rate and coke addition rate are also used to control tem-
perature. Matte layer thickness is controlled by adjusting the ratio of O2 input to matte
feed rate. A high ratio decreases matte mass (hence matte layer thickness), a low ratio the
opposite. Matte layer position is controlled by adjusting the amount of copper below the
matte. It is altered by adjusting the frequency at which copper is tapped from the furnace.
Blowing of O2 into the slag is avoided. It tends to overoxidize the slag, precipitate
magnetite, and cause slag foaming. It is avoided by controlling copper and matte layer
thicknesses as described above.
8.9.5.5 Noranda converting summary
The Noranda continuous converter is a compact, highly productive, submerged tuyere
converting process. It charges its matte via ladle through a large mouth, which is also used
for charging large pieces of scrap copper. It produces 1.3% S molten copper which is sent
to a desulfurizing furnace prior to pyro- and electroreﬁning.
8.10 Top submerged lance converting
Top submerged lance converting technology options are
1. Metso Outotec Ausmelt (batch) and C3 continuous converting,
2. Glencore Technology: ISASMELT (batch converting) and ISACONVERT
continuous converting.
8.10.1 Metso Outotec Ausmelt converting (Wood & Hughes, 2016)
The Ausmelt process for matte conversion was initially developed for batch converting.
The batch process has similarities to the PeirceeSmith batch converting, as converting is
done in two stages. The process has the following characteristics:
•
Liquid and/or solid granulated copper matte is partially oxidized to remove iron,
•
After achieving a high matte grade, matte addition is stopped and slag is removed,
•
Oxygen-enriched air is injected in the proximity of the white metal layer to remove
sulfur and produce blister copper,
•
Once all copper sulﬁde has been converted to copper, the lance is removed from the
bath, to allow effective separation of copper and slag,
•
Copper is tapped, and the remaining slag can be used as a seed to start the blowing for
the next batch.
The Ausmelt batch converting technology was ﬁrstly implemented at Bindura smelter
to process high-grade leaching residues. Following this implementation, the process was
also implemented at Zhongtiaoshan in 1999, Birla Copper in 2003, and Yunnan Tin in
2012.

Following the development of the batch converting process, Metso Outotec
Ausmelt developed the Ausmelt C3 continuous copper converting process. This pro-
cess uses a FeOxeSiO2eCaO slag to continuously convert copper mattes. It was indus-
trially demonstrated at Zhongtiaoshan and Yunnan Tin copper smelters.
8.10.2 Glencore Technology ISASMELT batch converting and ISACONVERT
continuous converting
The batch ISASMELT converting process has been applied in two different ﬁelds
(Alvear et al., 2013). The ﬁrst application is as part of the Precious Metals and Base Metals
Operations ﬂowsheet of Umicore Hoboken plant. The process involved a smelting stage
in which the complex materials are smelted to form a copper matte. The silica-based
Pb-rich slag produced during smelting is tapped and the remaining copper matte is con-
verted to blister copper. All the precious minor elements are captured into the copper
phase. Fig. 8.17 shows a view of the Hoboken plant, with the ISASMELT building
standing in the center.
The second application of ISASMELT batch converting process is in the ﬁeld of
copper recycling as part of the Kayser Recycling System, developed by H€uttenwerke
Kayser (Now Aurubis AG) at their L€unen plant, in Germany. In this process, black cop-
per generated in a reductive smelting stage is converted to blister copper in the
ISASMELT furnace. The process run successfully from 2002 until 2011, when Aurubis
implemented a TBRC furnace to increase capacity.
The ISACONVERT process developed for the continuous converting of copper
and copperenickel mattes (Hunt & de Vries, 2019; Nikolic et al., 2009). The process in-
volves continuous feeding of solid matte from the furnace roof into a molten bath.

smelting and converting process, treating complex materials. (Photo courtesy of Umicore Precious
Metals).
220
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Enriched air is injected through the lance into the calcium ferrite slag phase. Copper and
slag are tapped on intermittent basis from a taphole located on the base of the furnace. A
view of the ﬁrst ISACONVERT plant, commissioned in 2019 at Kansanshi smelter,
Zambia is shown in Fig. 8.18.
8.11 Chinese continuous converting technologies
From 2013, Chinese technologists have been reporting the development of continuous con-
verting technologies in China. Although there are several works describing fundamental as-
pects as well as advantages and disadvantages of the developed process, still not enough
technical information is available to produce a sensible operational comparison with previous
technologies. The main process developments described in this section are
•
Bottom blowing continuous converting: technology developed using the bottom
blowing smelting principles. The process has some similarities to the Noranda contin-
uous copper converting and the El Teniente continuous copper converting (only
demonstrated but not installed)
•
Top-blown multilance continuous converting: Process has similarities to the Mitsu-
bishi converting process, using calcium ferrite slags but at a higher degree of oxidation
achieving lower sulfur contents in the blister.
In addition to the above two mentioned technologies, Dongying Fangyuan has
developed the Submerged Lance Converting Reﬁning process (SLCR). This process is
discussed in Chapter 9.
8.11.1 Bottom blowing converting
Bottom blowing continuous converting (BBC) was developed by China ENFI Engi-
neering Technology Co., Ltd. The BBC process main technical features are as follows:

•
Molten feed is fed via launder from the smelting reactor (additional cold matte might
be required to balance heart requirements)
•
Oxygen-enriched air is blown into the molten batch from furnace bottom via lances
•
The process has three molten layers in equilibrium (copper, white metal, and slag)
which deﬁnes the sulfur content in the blister (saturated with sulfur at the operating
temperature)
•
The use of enriched air and the continuous feeding reduces offgas volumes compared
with batch process
•
Blister and slag are intermittently tapped from the furnace
Fig. 8.19 shows a schematic layout of the Baotou Huading smelter. The furnace on
the left side of the ﬁgure is the smelting furnace connected via launder to the BBC
furnace (Hongfei et al., 2019). A bypass launder provides ﬂexibility to continue smelting
if the BBC is ofﬂine. The slag taphole and blister taphole are at opposite ends of the
reactor. The ﬁgure also shows the solid feed bins delivering required materials (ﬂux,
reverts, matte) to the furnace top via a common conveyor and feed ports.
Typical operating parameters for the BBC converting are shown in Tables 8.10 and
8.11 (Yan, 2016). According to Ling (Ling, 2019), there were ﬁve plants in China using
the BBC technology in 2019.
8.11.2 Top-blown multilance continuous converting technology
Top-blown multilance technology was developed by Jinfeng Company and Yunnan
Copper Chifeng. The process layout involves the continuous feeding of copper matte

from the side-blown smelting furnace. According to Bin et al. (Bin and Suping, 2019),
the process provides the following advantages:
•
Continuous feeding from the smelting unit,
•
Full utilization of the molten matte contained heat in the converting process,
•
Good refractory campaign,
•
High availability due to easing change of top lances,
•
Process can treat copper scrap,
•
High SO2 concentration in offgases.
Four plants currently using top-blown continuous converting technology in China
and Africa (Bin and Suping, 2019).

8.12 Summary
Converting is the second-half of the smelting/converting sequence by which most Cue
Feesulﬁde concentrates are made into metallic copper. The process oxidizes the Fe and S
from molten smelting furnace matte with oxygen-enriched air or air to produce molten
metallic copper. It is most often carried out in the cylindrical PeirceeSmith converter.
The products of the process are
1. molten blister copper (99% Cu, 0.02% S and 0.6% O), which is sent forward to ﬁre
reﬁning for ﬁnal S and O removal, then anode casting
2. molten Fe-silicate slag (4%e8% Cu) which is sent to Cu recovery, then discard
3. SO2-bearing offgas which is treated for heat, dust and SO2 capture.

CHAPTER 9
Continuous copper making processes
As indicated in Chapter 5, continuous and/or direct production of copper has been also
focusing of development in the copper making industry. In general, continuous copper
concentrate smelting and converting has several advantages:
(a) ability to smelt all concentrates, including CuFeS2 concentrates
(b) elimination of a batch converting process, improving process efﬁciencies, and
reducing SO2 collection and air inﬁltration difﬁculties
(c) continuous production of high SO2-strength offgas, albeit from two sources
(d) relatively simple Cu-from-slag recovery
(e) minimal materials handling, as liquid transfer in the converter aisle can be eliminated.
Continuous copper production can be achieved in a single, two, or three processing
stages. The main aspect to consider when selecting the appropriate number of stages is to
fully understand the properties of the material to be processed. This means
•
Knowing the full chemical and mineralogical composition of the materials
•
Understanding the heat that will be released at different oxygen and sulfur potential
conditions (matte or blister making conditions)
•
Understanding slag making components of the feed and ﬂuxing requirements
•
Considering appropriate requirements for copper recovery
The above-mentioned aspects are part of the fundamental metallurgical and process
design evaluation required to appropriate selection the most suitable conﬁguration.
Continuous copper making can be achieved by
•
Single-stage process
•
Two-stage process
•
Three-stage process
Single-stage direct to blister production has been successfully applied using ﬂash
smelting and converting principles with plant operating in Poland, Australia, and Zambia,
with the latest addition been the second production line at Glogow smelter in Poland
(Urbaniak et al., 2019).
The two-stage process is based on the continuous smelting of copper concentrate into
an ultra-high matte grade (above 72% Cu) in a smelting reactor, followed by the
convertingereﬁning stage in a single reactor. This process was developed by
Dongying-Fangyuan in China (Wang et al., 2017). Although the two-stage process
has the novelty of combining converting and reﬁning into a single process, from the
fundamental metallurgical thermodynamic point of view, the convertingereﬁning stage
can be considered as a batch process in which the oxygen potential is gradually increased.

A three-stage process consists in the combination of smelting, converting, and
reﬁning in a cascade type arrangement, where materials ﬂow from one furnace into
the next one, and each one of these furnaces operates at a deﬁned oxygen and sulfur po-
tential condition. The most know process at this stage is the Mitsubishi process. The Mit-
subishi process combines a three-stage continuous blister production process, in a cascade
arrangement, for smelting, slag cleaning, and converting, followed by the traditional
anode reﬁning (Shibasaki & Hayashi, 1991). Plants are currently in operation in Japan,
South Korea, India, and Indonesia.
In the same category of three-stage continuous copper production, Chinese technol-
ogists have echoed the Mitsubishi process principles, developing two new applications for
continuous copper production:
•
Double BottomeBlowing Continuous Copper Smelting Process with “Three
Connected Furnaces” arrangement (Yongcheng et al., 2019)
•
Combination of oxygen-enriched side blow smelting technology and horizontal
multilances top blow converting (Ling, 2019)
This chapter describes the above-mentioned continuous copper production
processes.
9.1 Single-stage process: direct to blister ﬂash process
The direct to blister route is generally restricted to concentrates which have chalcocite
(Cu2S) and bornite (Cu5FeS4) as primary minerals and relatively small amounts of pyrite
(FeS2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), and silica (SiO2). The combination of these materials al-
lows process design engineers to develop a single-stage process that will manage the heat
release in the furnace within the requirement of the overall process heat balance
(including heat losses) and the overall slag amount generation. Giving the operating con-
ditions required to produce copper in a single stage (high oxygen potential), a slag clean-
ing process is also required to recover the copper that is oxidized in the single-stage
copper making process.
There are four copper ﬂash smelters operations that operate direct to blister processes:
•
Olympic Dam, Australia (Ranasinghe et al., 2010);
•
Glogow II, Poland (Byszynski et al., 2010);
•
Chingola, Zambia (Taskinen & Kojo, 2009);
•
Glogow I, Poland (Urbaniak et al., 2019).
Fig. 9.1 shows the interior of the new Zambian direct-to-copper ﬂash furnace.
Figs. 9.2 and 9.3 show the ﬂowsheet for the Olympic Dam and Glogow direct-to-copper
ﬂash furnace smelters, respectively. The main difference between the two processes is the
additional process unit to process the CuePbeFe alloy produced in the electric furnace.
Multimetal recovery is also ensured as lead is recovered from the converter slag in the lead
plant.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

9.1.1 Advantages and disadvantages
The principal advantages of combining smelting and converting are
(a) Isolation of SO2 emission to a single, continuous, SO2-rich gas stream, ideal for
capturing sulfur in sulfuric acid;
(b) Minimization of energy consumption;
(c) Minimization of capital and operating costs.
The main disadvantage of the process is the requirement for an additional copper re-
covery process. The increase in oxygen potential required to produce copper in a single
stage also implies that about 25% of the copper contained in the copper concentrate will
be oxidized and dissolved in the slag phase. This also means that the single-stage produc-
tion process is restricted to low-Fe chalcocite and bornite concentrates, as these types of
concentrates will generate less slag and therefore less copper loss. An expansion to high-
Fe containing concentrates will dramatically increase the amount of slag and therefore the
overall copper recovery cost.
Tables 9.1aec describe the concentrates currently being smelted in direct-to-copper
furnaces.
9.1.2 The ideal direct-to-copper process
Fig. 9.4 is a sketch of the ideal direct-to-copper process. The principal inputs to the pro-
cess are concentrate, oxygen, air, ﬂux, and recycles. The principal outputs are molten
copper, low-Cu slag, and high-SO2 offgas.

shaft and the bottom tip of the concentrate burner. The diameter of the reaction shaft is w6 m.

Continuous copper making processes
233

The process is continuous and autothermal. With highly oxygen-enriched (low-N2)
blast, there is enough excess reaction heat to melt all the Cu-bearing recycle materials
from the smelter and adjacent reﬁnery, including scrap anodes. The remainder of this sec-
tion indicates how close the process has come to this ideality.
9.1.3 Industrial single furnace direct-to-copper smelting
In 2020, single furnace direct-to-copper smelting is done by only one process: Outotec
(formerly Outokumpu) ﬂash smelting (Fig. 9.1). For several years the Noranda
submergedetuyere process (Chapter 7) also produced copper directly. This plant now
produces high-grade (72%e74% Cu) matte. The change was made to avoid slag foaming
(Section 9.1.7) and to increase impurity elimination.

temperature in the smelting furnace is controlled by adjusting (a) the degree of oxygen
enrichment of the blast (which changes the amount of N2 coolant entering the furnace)
and (b) the rate at which fossil fuel is burnt in the furnace.

depending on the concentrate composition. Considerable fossil fuel is burnt in the reac-
tion shaft and in settler burners (Table 9.3).

Just enough O2 is supplied to produce metallic copper rather than Cu2S or Cu2O.
In practice, the ﬂash furnace reaction shaft product is a mixture of overoxidized (ox-
ide) and underoxidized (sulﬁde) materials. Individual particles may be overoxidized on
the outside and underoxidized on the inside. The over- and underoxidized components
react to give metallic copper, as shown in the reactions below:

Industrially, the overall extent of Reaction (9.1) is controlled by (a) monitoring the
Cu content of the product slag and the S content of the product copper and
(b) adjusting the ratio of oxygen in the blast to concentrate fed to the furnace, based
on these measured Cu-in-slag and S-in-copper values. An increasing Cu content in
the slag is reversed by decreasing the O2/concentrate ratio and vice versa. The copper
slag content is kept between 12% and 28%.
9.1.5 Effect of slag composition on %Cu in slag
Table 9.2 gives the compositions of direct-to-copper ﬂash furnace slags. The most
notable feature is that the concentration of Cu in Glogow slag is half that of Olympic
Dam slag. This is fortunate because Glogow produces about 2.5 tonnes of slag per tonne
of copper (Table 9.3), while Olympic Dam produces about 1.4 t slag per tonne of copper.
The net result is that both smelters send about 25% of the copper in the feed to slag.
The process at Glogow produces a lower copper slag because its composition is essen-
tially a CaeAleMgeKeNa silicate slag (Table 9.3), which has a relatively low solubility
for Cu oxide (Taskinen & Kojo, 2009).
Conventional smelting/converting smelters produce w2.5 t slag per tonne of copper
production, about the same as Glogow. However, the slags contain much less Cu
(1%e2% for smelting; 4%e8% for converting, some it entrained rather than dissolved).
Cu removal from these slags is quicker and cheaper than from the direct-to-copper smelt-
ing slags.
9.1.6 Industrial details
Operating details of two direct-to-copper ﬂash furnaces are given in Table 9.3. The fur-
naces are similar to conventional ﬂash furnaces. Differences are
(a) The hearths are deeply bowl-shaped to prevent molten copper from contacting the
furnace sidewalls
(b) The hearths are more radically arched and compressed to prevent their refractory
from being ﬂoated by the dense (7.8 t/m3) molten copper layer (Brillo & Egry,
2003; Hunt et al., 1999)
(c) The furnace walls are extensively water-cooled and the hearth extensively air-cooled
to prevent metallic copper from seeping too far into the refractories
240
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

(d) The bottom refractories are monolithic to prevent molten copper from seeping un-
der the bricks, solidifying, and lifting them
(e) The copper tapholes are designed to prevent the out-ﬂowing molten copper from
enlarging the taphole to the point where molten copper contacts cooling water
At Olympic Dam, molten copper passes through magnesiteechrome brick (inside)
and a silicon carbide insert and graphite insert (outside) (Hunt et al., 1999). The graphite
insert is replaced after w1200 t tapped copper and the silicon carbide insert is replaced
after w2400 t. Excessive copper ﬂow (the result of an excessive taphole diameter) initi-
ates earlier replacement.
9.1.7 Control
A direct to blister process is a full oxidation process in which compositions of the gener-
ated molten phases are controlled by adjusting the ratios of oxygen in the blast to concen-
trate feed rate and ﬂux/concentrate feed rate.
In order to control an adequate ﬂuidity of the molten products, process temperatures
(molten and gas phases) are controlled by adjusting the oxygen-enrichment level of the
blast (as represented by the N2/O2 ratio) and the rate at which fossil fuel is burnt in the
furnace.
A key aspect to ensure a safe and reliable process is to avoid the formation of a matte
layer in the reactor. This is achieved by ensuring having proper O2/concentrate ratios, in
other words, the right oxygen and sulfur potentials that will avoid the formation of a
Cu2S layer. This is also done to prevent the possibility of foaming slag out the top of
the furnace (Hunt et al., 1999). A molten Cu2S layer, once built up between the molten
copper and molten slag layers, has the potential to react with slag by reactions such as (9.2)
and (9.3), which can produce SO2 beneath the slag layer.
The foaming problem is avoided by ensuring that the O2/concentrate ratio is always
at or above its set point, never below. This may lead to high Cu-in-slag levels but it
avoids the potentially serious operational problems caused by foaming (Hunt et al.,
1999). S-in-copper below w1% S ensures that a Cu2S layer does not form.
An unfortunate side effect of the above no-matte-layer strategy is a high Cu content
in the slag, mainly as dissolved Cu2O. It arises because there is no permanent layer of
Cu2S in the furnace to reduce Cu2O to metallic copper, Reaction (9.2).
Simply stated, direct-to-copper smelting is operated in a slightly overoxidizing mode
to prevent the foaming. The downside of operating this way is that 12%e28% Cu reports
to the slag (Table 9.2).
The key process control aspect is therefore to deﬁne the right oxygenesulfur poten-
tial setup that will guarantee no Cu2S layer, acceptable copper content in slag and sub-
sequently minimum possible sulfur in the generated copper phase.

9.1.8 Electric furnace Cu-from-slag recovery
All direct-to-copper smelters recover Cu from their slag in an electric slagecleaning
furnace. The slag ﬂows from the direct-to-blister furnace directly into an electric furnace
where it is settled for about 10 h under a 0.25 m blanket of metallurgical coke (Czernecki
et al., 1999). The coke reduces the oxidized Cu from the slag by reactions such as
1300°C
Cu2O(ℓ)           +         C        →         2Cu°(ℓ)     +     CO(g) 
dissolved in slag    in metallurgical       impure
offgas
coke
molten copper
(9.4)
Magnetite (molten and solid) is also reduced
1300°C
Fe3O4(ℓ,s)          +          C          →          3 FeO(ℓ)      +      CO(g) 
dissolved in slag       in metallurgical      dissolved in slag       offgas
and solid
coke
(9.5)
and some FeO is inadvertently reduced to Fe by the reaction:
1300°C
FeO(ℓ)           +          C         →          Fe(ℓ)         +       CO(g) 
dissolved in slag     in metallurgical   dissolved in copper      offgas
coke
(9.6)
The resulting Fe joins the newly reduced copper.
9.1.8.1 Glogow
The Cu content of the Glogow direct-to-copper slag is lowered from w14% Cu
to w0.6% Cu in an 25000 kVA electric furnace. The molten product analyzes
70%e80% Cu, 5% Fe, and 15%e25% Pb, from Pb in the concentrate (Czernecki
et al., 2010).
The Pb and Fe are oxidized in a Hoboken converter (Chapter 8), upgrading the metal
to >98% Cu, 0.3% Pb. This product is sent to anode-making and electroreﬁning. The
PbO-rich slag is sent to a lead smelter (along with lead- and zinc-rich dusts).
9.1.8.2 Olympic Dam
Olympic Dam lowers its direct-to-copper slag from 24% to w4% Cu in its 15,000 kV A
electric furnace (Hunt et al., 1999). This Cu content could be lowered further by using
more coke and a longer residence time, but the copper product would then contain
242
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

excessive radioactive 216Pb and 210Po, from the original concentrate (Ranasinghe et al.,
2010). Instead, the slag is solidiﬁed and stored for future Cu recovery using solidiﬁcation,
comminution, and ﬂotation (Fig. 9.2).
9.1.9 Cu-in-slag limitation of direct-to-copper smelting
The principal advantage of direct-to-copper smelting is isolation of SO2 evolution to one
furnace. The principal disadvantage of the process is its large amount of Cu-in-slag.
Balancing these factors, it appears that direct-to-copper smelting is best suited to concen-
trates containing covellite (Cu2S) and bornite (Cu5FeS4). Processing these concentrates
produces little slag, so Cu recovery from slag is not too costly.
Direct-to-copper smelting will probably not be suitable for most chalcopyrite con-
centrates. These concentrates produce about 2.5 t slag per tonne of Cu, and the energy
and cost of recovering Cu from their slag is considerable. Only about 60% of new Cu in
the concentrate would report directly to copper; the other 40% would wind up in the
slag.
Davenport et al. (2010) afﬁrm this view. However, Outotec remains dedicated to
direct-to-blister ﬂash smelting for normal chalcopyrite concentrates, as well as for
high-grade chalcocite and bornite concentrates (Tuominen & Kojo, 2005).
9.1.10 Direct-to-copper impurities
The compositions of the anode copper produced by the direct-to-copper smelters are
given in Table 9.4. The impurity levels of the copper are within the normal range of elec-
troreﬁning anodes (Chapter 14). The impurity levels could be reduced further by avoid-
ing recycle of the ﬂash furnace dust.

Impurities do not seem, therefore, to be a problem in the three existing direct-to-
copper smelters. However, metallic copper is always present in the direct-to-copper
furnace, ready to absorb impurities. For this reason, concentrates destined for direct-
to-copper smelting should always be carefully tested in a pilot furnace before being
accepted by the smelter.
9.2 Two-stage process: Dongying-Fangyuan process
9.2.1 General process description (Wang, Cui, Wei, & Wang, 2017; Wang,
Zhixiang, Wang, Cui, & Huang, 2019)
The two-stage copper making process combines continuous smelting of copper concen-
trate into an ultra-high matte grade in a smelting reactor and the combined convertinge
reﬁning process in a second reactor. The process is continuous from the chemical reaction
point of view but batch from the tapping point of view, as the convertingereﬁning pro-
cess is gradually done by in a single reactor by managing the oxygenesulfur potential
with addition of aireoxygenenatural gas.
The main innovation of this process is the combination of the converting and reﬁning
duties in a single furnace. Two SLCRs work alternatively to guarantee the continuous
discharge of matte from the SLS. The combined convertingereﬁning process is done
by combining and adjusting ﬂows of nitrogen, natural gas, oxygen, and air through
the injection lances. Slag generated in the process is tapped before starting the end part
of the cycle. Gas ﬂows and volumes are controlled to meet the different requirements
of the converting and reﬁning processes.
Offgas generated in both processes are captured and processed in a dedicated acid
plant.
9.2.2 Dongying-Fangyuan process and plant technical description
A schematic view of the process, developed by Dongying-Fangyuan in China, and
commissioned in 2015, is shown in Fig. 9.5. The process uses similar principles as the
BBS process for smelting. The smelting furnace (SLS: Submerged Lance Smelting) is
continuously fed producing the ultra-high copper matte(>73%Cu) which is continu-
ously discharged from the smelting furnace via a syphon and directed via launders to
the SLCR convertingereﬁning vessel (Submerged Lance Converting Reﬁning). The
smelting slag is batch tapped and slow cooled for further copper recovery. Technical
speciﬁcations for the Dongying-Fangyuan SLS and SLCR reactors are shown in
Table 9.5.
9.2.2.1 SLS smelting furnace
Fig. 9.6 shows a schematic view of SLS furnace. The smelting furnace has a diameter of
5.5 m and length of 28.8 m. Blended materials are continuously fed into a single smelting
244
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

reactor from three feed ports located on top of the furnace shell. Level and bath temper-
ature can be measured from the top by inserting a dip bar and a temperature measuring
device.
Twenty-three oxygen lances, arranged in two rows, supply the required amount of
enriched air to the process. The lances are shrouded tubes. Oxygen is injected via the in-
ner layer and air via the outer layer. This conﬁguration of gases ensuring protecting the
lance as air will shield the oxygen main jet.
Additional lances are also located in the vicinity of the slag end wall. According to
Zjxiang (2018), the purpose of this extra lance row is to enhance fuming of volatile el-
ements from the slag layer.
Offgas is collected via an uptake located on top of the slag end of the reactor. The
copper matte is continuously discharged, via siphon, and directed into the SLCR furnace
via a connecting cover launder to minimize emissions. Slag is tapped from two tapholes
into ladle for slow cooling in pots.
9.2.2.2 SLCR convertingereﬁning furnace
Two convertingereﬁning vessels receive the ultra-high copper matte generated in the
SLS process. The furnaces are 4.8 m in diameter and 23 m length. Enriched air is injected
though 17 lances arranged in two rows.

Fangyuan. The smelter reactor (1) molten matte is continuously tapped via launders into the

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The molten ultra-high matte grade is fed through a feeding port located at the center
of the furnace end wall facing the SLS furnace. An additional feed port located on the top
of the shell allows the addition of cold materials into the furnace. Offgases are evacuated
from the furnace via an uptake located on the upper part of the shell close to matte feed
port. The slag taphole is located at the same end of the copper pouring end. The furnace
must rotate to tap the slag. Slag from the SLCR is recycled to the SLS furnace. Two
SLCR furnaces alternatively operating ensure continuous reception of molten matte
from the SLS furnace. The two following operating principles control the addition of
molten matte and slag tapping from the SLCR furnace:
•
Furnace will rotate to blowing position at a predeﬁned matte level,
•
When the slag reaches the required tapping level, the second SLCR will start its matte
reception cycle. First SLCR furnace will be ready for casting
9.2.3 SLS-SLCR process control
Targeted compositions of ultra-high matte grade and anode copper are controlled by
adjusting gas ﬂows through the lances. Oxygen, air, natural gas, and nitrogen ﬂows are
adjusting as required to achieve the deﬁned targets.
The SCLR cycle has the following steps:
•
Feeding stage: Ultra-high matte reception from the SLS furnace: during this stage,
converting starts
•
Copper making/slag tapping stage: This process overlaps with the feeding stage for
most of the cycle and only during the last part of the process, matte feeding is stopped,
and the ﬁnal blowing of copper is done. Slag is poured during this stage
•
Reduction stage: Copper composition is adjusted to anode quality requirements
•
Casting: Copper is ﬁnally tapped and casted into anodes. At the end of this stage, the
furnace is prepared for the next batch.
9.3 The Mitsubishi process: introduction (Mitsubishi Materials, 2020)
The Mitsubishi process operates continuously, using three connected furnaces to smelt,
settle, and convert copper concentrates. The development of the process started in 1959
in Naoshima Smelter, Japan, when trials were done to evaluate injection of materials into
molten bath Technology development continued, and a 6000 t/y Cu pilot plant was
commissioned in 1968 to further demonstrate the concept. The scale-up process
continued with a semicommercial plant in 1970 in Onahama (18,000 t/y Cu), and a
48,000 t/y Cu ﬁrst commercial installation in 1974 (Naoshima). Since then, the process
has been implemented in Canada, India, Korea, and Indonesia. Elements of the Mitsu-
bishi process have been also commercialized in combination with other processes. Exam-
ples of that are the Mitsubishi converting process in combination with the Noranda
Process in Port Kembla, Australia, and the Mitsubishi smelting process in combination
with a reverberatory furnace and PeirceeSmith converters in Onahama, Japan.
Continuous copper making processes
247

9.3.1 The Mitsubishi process
Fig. 9.7 shows the three furnaces of the Mitsubishi process (Ajima et al., 1999; Mitsubishi
Materials Corporation, 2004). The S (smelting) furnace blows oxygen-enriched air, dried
concentrates, SiO2 ﬂux and recycles into the furnace liquids via vertical lances. It oxidizes
the Fe and S of the concentrate to produce w68% Cu matte and Feesilicate slag. Its
matte and slag ﬂow together into the electric slag cleaning furnace.
The CL (slag-cleaning) furnace separates the smelting furnace’s matte and slag. Its
matte ﬂows continuously to the converting furnace. Its slag (0.7%e0.9% Cu) ﬂows
continuously to water granulation and sale or stockpile.
The C (converting) furnace blows oxygen-enriched air, CaCO3 ﬂux, and granulated
converter slag coolant into the matte via vertical lances. It oxidizes the Fe and S in the
matte to produce molten copper. The copper continuously exits the furnace into one
of two holding furnaces for subsequent ﬁre- and electroreﬁning. The slag (14% Cu) ﬂows
continuously into a water granulation system. The resulting slag granules are recycled to
the smelting furnace for Cu recovery and the converting furnace for temperature control.
A major advantage of the process is its effectiveness in capturing SO2. It produces two
continuous strong SO2 streams, which are combined to make excellent feed gas for sul-
furic acid or liquid SO2 manufacture. Also, the absence of crane-and-ladle transport of
molten material minimizes workplace emissions.

9.3.2 Smelting furnace details
Fig. 9.8 shows details of the Mitsubishi smelting furnace. Solid particulate feed and oxidizing
gas are introduced through nine vertical lances in two rows across the top of the furnace.
Each lance consists of two concentric pipes inserted through the furnace roof. The diameter
of the inside pipe is 5 cm; the diameter of the outside pipe, 10 cm. Dried feed is air-blown
from bins through the central pipe; oxygen-enriched air (55 vol.-% O2) is blown through
the annulus between the pipes. The outside pipes are continuously rotated (7e8 rpm)
to prevent them from sticking to their water-cooled roof collars.
The outside pipes extend downward to w0.7 m above the molten bath, the inside
pipes to the furnace roof or just above. The outside pipes are high chromium steel
(27% Cr); they burn back w0.4 m per day and are periodically slipped downward to
maintain their speciﬁed tip positions. New 3 m sections are welded to the top of the
shortened pipes to maintain continuous operation. The inside pipes are 304 stainless steel.
They do not wear back because their tips are high above the reaction zone.
Concentrate/ﬂux/recycle feed meets oxidizing gas at the exit of the inside pipe. The

The offgas (25e30 vol.-% SO2) from the oxidation reactions is drawn up a large up-

0.7 m distance between lance tip and melt surface are, therefore, on the order of 103 to
102 s. The temperature rise of the gas/solid jet during this time is calculated to
be w50C. This is not enough to cause ignition of the concentrate. Consequently,
melting and oxidation of concentrate particles occurs entirely after entry into the gase
slagematte foam/emulsion beneath the lances (Asaki et al., 2001).
Industrial evidence indicates that the smelting furnace contains mainly matte
(1.2e1.5 m deep) with a gas/slag/matte foam/emulsion beneath the lances (Shibasaki
& Hayashi, 1991). Away from the lances, SO2/N2 gas disengages from the foam and
the matte and slag begin to separate. Newly formed slag (w0.05 m thick and containing
some entrained matte) ﬂows toward the taphole where it overﬂows. Matte also contin-
uously overﬂows as new matte is made under the lances.
9.3.3 Electric slag cleaning furnace details
The electric slagecleaning furnace (3600 kW) is elliptical with three or six graphite elec-
trodes in one or two rows along the long axis. It accepts matte and slag from the smelting
furnace and separates them into two layersda bottom layer of matte 0.5e0.8 m thick, and
a top layer of slag w0.5 m thick. The residence times of the liquids are 1e2 h. These times
plus electromagnetic stirring in the furnace allow the slag and matte to approach equilib-
rium. Passage of electricity through the slag ensures that the slag is hot and ﬂuid. This, in
turn, creates conditions for efﬁcient settling of matte droplets from the slag.
The slag is the main route of Cu loss from the smelter. It is important, therefore, that
the total amount of Cu-in-slag be minimized. This is done by
(a) maximizing slag residence time in the electric furnace (to maximize matte settling)
(b) keeping the slag hot, ﬂuid, and quiescent
(c) minimizing slag mass (per tonne of Cu) by smelting high Cu grade concentrates and
minimizing ﬂuxing
(d) optimizing slag composition to minimize slag viscosity and density.
Matte continuously underﬂows from the bottom layer of the electric furnace to the
converting furnace. A siphon and launder system is used. Slag continuously overﬂows
through a taphole. It is granulated in ﬂowing water and sold or stockpiled.
The purpose of the electrodes and electrical power is to keep the slag hot and ﬂuid.
Heat is obtained by resistance to electric current ﬂow between the graphite electrodes in
the slag, selectively heating the slag to 1250C.
Only a tiny amount of offgas is generated in the electric furnace. It is collected from the
slag taphole hood, drawn through an electrostatic precipitator, and vented to atmosphere.
9.3.4 Converting furnace details
The converting furnace continuously receives matte from the electric slagecleaning
furnace. It blows oxygen-enriched air blast (30e35 vol-% O2), CaCO3 ﬂux, and con-
verter slag granules onto the surface of the matte. It also receives considerable copper
scrap, including scrap anodes.
It produces (a) molten copper (w0.7% S), (b) molten slag (14% Cu), and (c) SO2
bearing offgas, 25e30 vol-% SO2.
250
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The molten copper continuously departs the furnace through a siphon and launder
into one of two anode furnaces. The slag continuously overﬂows into a water-
granulation system. The offgas is drawn through a large uptake, waste heat boiler, elec-
trostatic precipitators, and a wet gas cleaning system before being pushed into a sulfuric
acid or liquid SO2 plant. The smelting and converting offgases are combined prior to
entering the electrostatic precipitators.
The oxygen-enriched air and solids are introduced into the furnace through 10 lances
like the smelting furnace lances, at a speed of w120 m/s. The tips of the outside pipes are
0.3e0.8 m above the bath; the inside pipe tips above or just through the roof. The outer
pipes are continuously rotated to prevent them from sticking to their roof collars. They
are also slowly slipped downwards as they burn back.
9.3.4.1 Converting furnace slag
A unique feature of Mitsubishi converting is its CaO-based calcium ferrite slag (see
Chapter 5). Early in the development of the process, it was found that blowing strong
O2 blast onto the surface of SiO2-based slag made a crust of solid magnetite. This
made further converting impossible. CaO, on the other hand, reacts with solid magne-
tite, molten Cu and O2 to form a liquid CaOeCu2OeFeOn slag. The slag typically con-
tains 12%e16% Cu (w60% as Cu2O, balance Cu), 40%e55% Fe (w70% as Fe3þ,
balance Fe2þ), and 15%e20% CaO. Its viscosity is w101 kg/m$s (Wright et al., 2000).
9.3.4.2 Converting furnace copper
Mitsubishi process blister copper contains more sulfur than PeirceeSmith converter cop-
per, w0.7% versus w0.02%. This is the result of operating with excess O2 addition to
avoid a permanent matte layer in the furnace. This prevents slag foaming. The only disad-
vantage of the higher S level is a longer oxidation period in the anode furnace. The S
content can be lowered in the Mitsubishi converter by supplying more O2, but this in-
creases the amount of Cu in slag.
9.3.5 Optimum matte grade
The Cu grade of the matte produced by the smelting furnace (and ﬂowing into the con-
verting furnace) is a balance between:
(a) the amount of Cu lost in the discard slag from the electric furnace;
(b) the amount of granulated high-Cu slag which must be recycled back from the con-
verting furnace to the smelting furnace; and
(c) the amount of coal which must be added to the smelting furnace and the amount of
coolant which must be added to the converting furnace.
The optimum matte grade for the Mitsubishi process is 68% Cu. With this matte
grade, the discard slag from the electric slag cleaning furnace contains 0.7%e0.9% Cu
and converter slag recycle is 0.1e0.3 tonnes per tonne of concentrate feed. Selected
design and operating parameters for two Mitsubishi plants are shown in Table 9.6 and
9.7 (Kaneda, 2020).

9.3.6 Process control in Mitsubishi smelting/converting (Goto & Hayashi, 1998)
Bath temperature is the most important control parameter in the Mitsubishi process.
Maintaining an optimum temperature ensures good slag and matte ﬂuidity while at
the same time minimizing refractory erosion. Typical operating temperatures at the
Naoshima smelter are shown in Table 9.8.
Table 9.8 shows that the electric slag cleaning furnace slag is operated hotter than the
smelting furnace matte/slag. This is done to avoid precipitation of solid Fe3O4 and/or
SiO2. Precipitation of Fe3O4 caused formation of a “muddy layer” between molten
matte and molten slag. This layer prevents good matte/slag separation, and results in
high matte entrainment in the discard slag, hence high Cu-in-slag losses. Precipitation
of SiO2 produces SiO2 rich “ﬂoating solids.” These solids (w10% Cu) do not settle
into the matte layer and also result in high Cu-in-slag losses.
Process control at Naoshima combines quantitative and qualitative process informa-
tion (Tables 9.9 and 9.10). The quantitative information is continuously inputted into an

expert type computer control system. The overall state of the process is best represented
by the following quantitative variables:
(a) smelting furnace matte/slag outlet temperature
(b) converting furnace slag temperature
(c) matte grade
(d) %SiO2 in electric slag cleaning furnace slag
(e) %CaO in electric slag cleaning furnace slag
(f) %Cu in converting furnace slag
(g) %CaO in converting furnace slag.
Table 9.9 shows how each parameter is controlled.
Control of the Mitsubishi process is a challenge for its operators. The difﬁculty lies in
the fact that (a) there are many process variables to control and (b) they all interact with
each other. When one variable goes out of control, the rest of the process is affected. For
example, the solution to the problem of high viscosity slags, ﬂoating solids, and muddy
layers has typically been to increase furnace temperature. Unfortunately, this increases re-
fractory erosion, ultimately decreasing smelter availability.
However, recent development of sophisticated continuous melt temperature devices
coupled with the use of an expert type computer control system has helped minimize
process excursions. This has greatly increased Mitsubishi process availability.
9.3.7 The Mitsubishi process since 2000
Improvements in the Mitsubishi Process since 2000 have focused on two concerns: re-
fractory life and process control. Refractory life is a challenge in the S furnace (due to
the turbulence created by the injection lances), and in the C furnace (due to turbulence
and the more corrosive nature of the calcium ferrite slag). Increasing the S-furnace lance
diameter from 0.060 to 0.069 m reduced penetration depth and improved refractory life
(Cho et al., 2006; Taniguchi et al., 2006), as did improved distribution control for the
solid feed to create even penetration depth. C-furnace refractory life has been extended
by adjusting the refractory in front of the water-cooled copper jacket at the bath line
(Goto et al., 2002).
One of the challenges to successful operation of C furnace is magnetite control. Some
magnetite is necessary to provide a protective coating for the refractories, but too much
causes accretions to build up in the furnace, eventually blocking the siphon through
molten blister copper is recovered (Hasegawa & Sato, 2003; Taniguchi et al., 2006).
As a result, careful control of the slag chemistry is needed (Tanaka et al., 2003). Increasing
the CaO content of the slag reduces accretions, but in turn requires better heat
removal through the water jacket at the slag line. Plant operations at Naoshima now
256
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

control the Fe/CaO ratio separately from the %Cu in the C-furnace slag; maintaining
2.2 < Fe/CaO < 2.45 seems to work best.
In terms on installations commissioned since 2000 the year, the Mitsubishi process
was installed a Hindalco Birla Copper in 2005 with a capacity of 250,000 t/y of copper
and also the S-furnace as standalone at Onahama, Japan, in 2007 with an initial capacity of
200,00 t/y (2012).
The Mitsubishi process has been also promoting the recycling business by combining
a pretreatment incinerationemelting plant in which copper containing recyclable mate-
rials are pretreated before adding them to the Mitsubishi process. The plant commis-
sioned in 2004 was able to double its recyclable processing capacity by 2012. The
combination of a pretreatment plant with the Mitsubishi process allowed a more efﬁcient
use of smelting capacity by reducing the e-scrap volume.
In 2016, Mitsubishi Materials also reported the completion of a second E-scrap center
at Naoshima smelter allowing Naoshima smelter to increase the recycling capacity to
100,000 t/y.
In a similar fashion, Onahama smelter has increased its recyclable materials processing
capacity (Nagata et al., 2019).
9.4 Other developments for continuous processing of copper
In addition to the Dongying-Fangyuan process described in Section 9.2, Chinese tech-
nologists have been working in the last 10 years in developing options to produce copper
in a continuous ﬂow of materials, arranging in cascade, smelting, and converting reactors.
The following advances have been reported in the last 5 years:
•
Double bottom bottomeblowing continuous smelting process (Yongcheng et al.,
2019)
•
Sideeblowing smelting technology combined with horizontal bottom blowing con-
verting (Ling, 2019)
9.4.1 Double bottom bottomeblowing continuous smelting process
(SKS-BCC) (Yongcheng et al., 2019)
The double bottomeblowing continuous smelting process applies bath smelting principles
using SKS type lances to inject oxygen into the molten bath. A simpliﬁed process ﬂowsheet
is shown in Fig. 9.9. A single smelting SKS furnace continuously smelts copper concentrate
reacting with enriched air injected via 11 oxygen lances located on the bottom of the
furnace shell. Molten matte and slag are tapped from tapholes located at opposite sides
of the furnace shell end walls. Heat from the offgases is recovered in a waste heat boiler
before dedusting (ESP) and cleaned prior to acid production in a Sulfuric Acid Plant.
Continuous copper making processes
257

Molten matte continuously ﬂows into the converting reactor (BCC). A bypass
launder is also part of the arrangement to cool part of the generated matte and used as
cold charge in the BCC for heat balance purposes.
The BCC furnace has seven oxygen lances and can be operated on a continuous
mode with the SKS furnace or stand-alone only with cold matte is the smelting reactor
is out of service. Generated blister and converter slag are tapped through dedicated tap-
holes. Offgases are processed in a similar fashion to the SKS smelting furnace. Converter
slag is tapped into ladles for slow cooling and recycling into the SKS-BBS furnace. Cop-
per is laundered into the anode furnaces for pyroreﬁning and anode production.
Table 9.11 shows the main design parameters of the SKS-BCC process, including
chemical compositions of raw materials, and generated blister copper. The ﬁrst SKS-
BCC process was commissioned in 2018 at SDIC Jincheng Metallurgical Co. According
to Yongcheng et al. (2019), the main features of the SKS-BCC process are
•
Material intake ﬂexibility: the process can treat a wide range of copper concentrate
from 14% to 25%
•
Faster rampeup to design capacity: SDIC Jifeng plant reached design capacity in
4 months
•
High energy efﬁciency: no cooling of copper matte
•
Low emissions

Information on the anode reﬁning process can be found in the cited reference for this
section. Yongcheng also reported that further efforts were required to improve produc-
tion stability, oxygen lance, and blister taphole performances.
9.4.2 Side-blowing smelting technology combined with horizontal bottom
blowing converting
This technology conﬁguration was implemented by Chifeng Yunnan Copper in 2015.
According to Tang (Tang & Yao, 2019), the technology has been applied to four plants
in China and Africa with a maximum smelting capacity of 200 t/h.
9.5 Summary
Continuous copper making processes can be achieved in a single, double, or three stages.
The selection of the process depends on the type of material to be processed and the
aimed ﬁnal product.
9.5.1 Single-stage copper production
Direct-to-copper smelting is the smelting of concentrate directly to molten copper in one
furnace. In 2011, it is practiced in three smelters: Olympic Dam (Australia), Glogow I and
II (Poland), and Chingola (Zambia). All of these plants use an Outotec ﬂash furnace.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The main advantage of the process is its restriction of SO2 evolution to a single,
continuous source of high SO2-strength gas. In principal, the energy, operating, and cap-
ital costs of producing metallic copper are also minimized by the single-furnace process.
Metallic copper is obtained in a ﬂash furnace by setting the ratio of oxygen input in
the blast to concentrate feed rate to the point where all the Fe and S in the input
concentrate are oxidized. The ratio must be precisely controlled to avoid the produc-
tion of Cu2S or Cu2O. Avoiding formation of a molten Cu2S layer in the furnace is
critical. Reactions between Cu2S layers and oxidizing slag may cause rapid SO2 evolu-
tion and slag foaming.
Direct-to-copper ﬂash smelting has proven effective for SO2 capture. However,
about 25% of the Cu in the input concentrate is oxidized, ending up as copper oxide dis-
solved in slag. This copper oxide must be reduced back to metallic copper, usually with
coke. The expense of recovering Cu from slag will probably restrict future direct-to-cop-
per smelting to concentrates which produce little slag. Processing of chalcopyrite concen-
trates are more suitable to be processed by multifurnace processes, either by conventional
smelting and converting or by continuous multifurnace processing.
9.5.2 Two-stage copper production
The two-stage copper production process was developed by Dongying-Fangyuan. The
process has been designed by continuous smelting (SLS) and the combination of the con-
verting and reﬁning duties in a single reactor (SLCR). The SLCR process can be deﬁned
a batch process in which gradual management of the oxygen potential, achieved by regu-
lation of air, oxygen, nitrogen, and natural gas, allows the production of anode quality
copper. The continuity of the process is achieved by arranging two SLCR furnaces oper-
ating in alternate cycles.
9.5.3 Three-stage copper production
The most known three-stage copper production process is the Mitsubishi process. The
Mitsubishi process also performs smelting and converting in a molten bath. It uses three
interconnected furnaces to continuously smelt copper concentrates, settle and separate
matte from discard slag, and convert the matte to blister copper. When performing prop-
erly, continuous processing solves many of the problems created by more traditional
copper smelting technology, most notably the elimination of ladle transfer of molten
matte, the fugitive emissions associated with PeirceeSmith converting, and the uneven
SO2 offgas content that results from batch processing of copper concentrates.
Continuous copper making processes
261

Chinese technologists have developed two alternatives to the Mitsubishi process
approach:
•
Double bottom bottomeblowing continuous smelting process (Yongcheng et al.,
2019)
•
Side-blowing smelting technology combined with horizontal bottom blowing con-
verting (Ling, 2019)
These processes have been recently commissioned. More process information will
become available to evaluate their operational performance.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

CHAPTER 10
Copper loss in slag
Pyrometallurgical production of molten copper generates two slags, smelting and con-
verting. Smelting furnace slag typically contains 1%e2% Cu (Table 4.2). The percentage
increases as matte grade increases (Font et al., 2013). Converter slag contains 4%e8% Cu
(Table 7.2). Its percentage increases as converting proceeds, and the grade of the remain-
ing matte increases.
Multiplying these percentages by the mass of each slag shows that a signiﬁcant fraction
of the Cu in the original concentrate is present in these slags. This fraction is increased by
the production of higher-grade mattes in the smelting furnace. Because of this, the value
of the copper in these slags is usually too high to justify the old practice of simply discard-
ing them.
This chapter discusses the nature of copper in smelting and converting slags. It also
describes strategies for minimizing the amount of copper lost from their disposal. The
main strategies include the following:
(a) minimizing the mass of slag generated
(b) minimizing the percentage of Cu in the slags
(c) processing the slags to recover as much Cu as possible.
Slag processing can be divided into two types. The ﬁrst is pyrometallurgical reduction
and settling, performed in an electric or fuel ﬁred slag cleaning furnace. The second is
minerals processing of solidiﬁed slag, including crushing, grinding, and froth ﬂotation,
to recover Cu from the slag.
10.1 Copper in slags
TheCuinsmeltingandconvertingslagsispresenteitheras(a)dissolvedCu,presentmostlyas
Cuþ ions, or as (b) entrained droplets of matte. The dissolved Cu is associated either with
O2 ions (i.e., Cu2O), or with S2 ions (Cu2S). Cu2O becomes the dominant form of
dissolved Cu at matte grades above 70% Cu (Acu~na & Sherrington, 2005; Barnett,
1979; Font et al., 2013), due to the increased activity of Cu2S in the matte. Higher
Cu2S activity pushes the reaction
Cu2S (matte) þ FeO (slag) / Cu2O (slag) þ FeS (matte)
(10.1)
to the right. The solubility of sulfur in slags is also lower in contact with higher-grade
mattes (Roghani et al., 2000). As a result, dissolved Cu in converter slags is present

mostly as Cu2O (Font et al., 2013). Conversely, the dissolved Cu in smelting slags is
present mostly as Cu2S. This is due to the lower matte grades and oxygen potentials
in the smelting furnace.
There are several sources of entrained matte in slags. The most obvious are droplets of
matte that did not settle completely through the slag layer during smelting. The
HadamardeRybczynski formula predicts the rate at which matte droplets will settle
through molten slag (Warczok et al., 2007a):
V ¼ ðrM  rSÞr2=3hs
(10.2)
In this expression, V is the settling rate of the matte droplets (m/s), g is the gravita-
tional constant (9.8 m/s2), rM is the matte density (3900e5200 kg/m3), rS is the slag
density (3300e3700 kg/m3), hS is the slag kinematic viscosity, and r is the radius
(m) of the settling matte droplet. The expression is most accurate for systems with Rey-
nolds numbers below 10 (i.e., droplet sizes below w1 mm). Larger matte droplets settle
at slower rates than predicted by Eq. (10.2). However, it is the settling rates of the smallest
droplets that are of greatest concern.
Table 10.1 (Ip & Toguri, 2000) shows just how long matte droplets can take to settle.
Besides droplet size, the biggest inﬂuences on settling rate are temperature and slag silica
content. Higher temperatures and lower silica levels decrease slag viscosities, increasing
settling rate (Zivkovic et al., 2020). A more reducing environment also encourages
settling, by decreasing the Fe3O4(s) content of the slag.
In addition, matte grade has an impact on settling rates. Low-grade mattes have lower
densities than high-grade mattes and therefore settle at slower rates (Fagerlund &
Jalkanen, 1999).
Matte droplets can become suspended in smelter slags by several other mechanisms.
Some are carried upward from the molten matte layer by gas bubbles generated by the
following reaction (Cheng et al., 2019; Zivkovic et al., 2020):
3 Fe3O4 (slag) þ FeS (matte) / 10 FeO (slag) þ SO2
(10.3)
Still others appear by precipitation from the slag in colder areas of the smelting furnace
(Barnett, 1979). Converter slag returned to a smelting furnace also contains suspended

matte droplets, which may not have time to completely settle (Cardona et al., 2011). As a
result, entrained matte can represent from 50% to 90% of the copper contained in smelter
slag (Acu~na & Sherrington, 2005; Imris et al., 2000). Fig. 10.1 shows the solubility of
oxidic and sulﬁdic copper in smelter slag, calculated using thermodynamic modeling
(Furuta et al., 2006) and compared with actual plant data. The difference between the
two is entrained matte.
10.2 Decreasing copper in slag I: minimizing slag generation
It seems logical to suggest that decreasing the amount of Cu lost in smelting and convert-
ing slags could be accomplished by decreasing slag production. However, methods to
decrease slag mass may do more harm than good. Possibilities include the following:
(a) maximizing concentrate grades. The less gangue in the concentrate, the less silica
required to ﬂux it, and the less overall slag generated. However, increasing concen-
trate grades may come at the expense of decreasing Cu recoveries in the
concentrator.
(b) adding less ﬂux. Adding less ﬂux would decrease slag mass (desirable) and decrease its
viscosity, making settling easier (also desirable). However, it would also increase the
activity of FeO in the slag, leading to more dissolved Cu2O by Reaction (10.1) (un-
desirable) and more magnetite (also undesirable; Mariscal & Herrera, 2009). The
precipitation of solid magnetite raises slag viscosities and leads to higher slag copper
contents as a result (Font et al., 2013; Kunze et al., 2003).

10.3 Decreasing copper in slag II: minimizing Cu concentration in
slag
The concentration of copper in smelting slag is minimized by the following:
(a) maximizing slag ﬂuidity, principally by avoiding excessive Fe3O4 (s) in the slag and
by keeping the slag hot (Zivkovic et al., 2020). Slag additions such as B2O3 and CaF2
also help (Cui, Wang, Bian, Wei, & Zhao, 2018).
(b) changing slag chemistry. Pizarro et al. (2013) showed that adding CaO to generate
olivine slags lowered dissolved copper levels.
(c) providing enough SiO2 to form distinct matte and slag phases. This is especially a
concern in high-alumina slags (Mariscal & Herrera, 2009; Sano et al., 2016).
(d) providing a large quiet zone in the smelting furnace.
(e) avoiding an excessively thick layer of slag (Zivkovic et al., 2020)
(f) avoiding tapping of matte with slag (Xia et al., 2005).
Metallurgical coke or coal may also be added to the smelting furnace to reduce Fe3O4
(s) to FeO (l) (Furuta et al., 2006).
10.4 Decreasing copper in slag III: pyrometallurgical slag settling/
reduction
Conditions that encourage suspended matte droplets to settle to a matte layer are low vis-
cosity slag, low turbulence, a long residence time, and a thin slag layer. These conditions
are often difﬁcult to obtain in a smelting vessel, particularly the necessary residence time.
As desired matte grades increase, the problem gets worse, because the increase in concen-
trate feed rate decreases settling time further (Furuta et al., 2006). As a result, Cu pro-
ducers have since the 1960s constructed separate furnaces speciﬁcally for cleaning
smelting and converting slags. These furnaces have two purposes: (a) allowing suspended
matte droplets to ﬁnish settling to the molten matte layer, and (b) facilitating the reduc-
tion of dissolved Cu oxide to suspended Cu sulﬁde drops.
Inputs to these furnaces vary considerably. Slag cleaning furnaces associated with
bath-smelting units like the Ausmelt/Isasmelt or Mitsubishi smelting furnace accept an
unseparated mixture of slag and matte and are required to do all the settling. Others
accept converter slag and plant reverts in addition to smelter slag, requiring more
emphasis on reduction (Moreno et al., 2003). Most commonly, these furnaces are fed
only smelting furnace slag and are used primarily as a ﬁnal settling furnace.
Fig. 10.2 illustrates a typical electric slag cleaning furnace (Barnett, 1979; Kennedy,
2012; Outotec, 2017). Heat is generated by passing electric current through the slag layer.
AC power is used, supplied through three carbon electrodes. This method of supplying
heat generates the least amount of turbulence, which improves settling rates. Most fur-
naces use self-baking Søderberg electrodes (Kunze et al., 2003) but a few use prebaked
electrodes to avoid the need for baking control (Furuta et al., 2006).
268
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The furnace sidewalls are typically cooled by external water jackets to minimize
refractory erosion (SMS Group, 2013). However, embedded cooling elements are
more effective, especially for slag cleaning furnaces processing high-copper slags (Kunze
et al., 2003; Tuominen et al., 2007).
Table 10.2 compares the operating characteristics of seven electric furnaces. The
choice of operating temperature represents a balance between the enhanced reaction ki-
netics of higher temperatures and the reduced refractory wear and lower copper losses of
lower temperatures. Required capacities are set by the size of the smelting operation and

the choice of input slags. Settling times are usually on the order of 1e5 hours. Typical
energy use is 15e70 kWh per tonne of slag, depending upon furnace inputs, target %
Cu, temperature, and residence time. Energy use is higher when the charge contains sig-
niﬁcant levels of reverts (Kunze et al., 2003). In addition to providing a reducing atmo-
sphere, adding coke helps reduce electrode loss.
While some electric slag cleaning furnaces process only smelting furnace slag, others
are fed a variety of materials. Several furnace operators input converter slag or solid reverts
in addition to smelting slag. When this is done, a reducing agent is often required to
reduce Cu oxide in the slag to Cu metal or Cu sulﬁde. Coal or coke is often added
for this reduction (Coursol et al., 2012). Pyrite may also be added if additional sulfur is
needed to form matte (Demetrio et al., 2000):
C þ Cu2O (slag) / CO þ 2 Cu (l )
(10.4)
C þ Cu2O þ FeS2 / Cu2S þ FeS þ CO
(10.5)
Carbon additions also reduce solid magnetite in the slag to liquid FeO:
C þ Fe3O4 (s) / CO þ 3 FeO (slag)
(10.6)
This decreases slag viscosity and improves settling rates (Furuta et al., 2006).
Ferrosilicon is occasionally used as a reducing agent (Shimpo & Toguri, 2000), espe-
cially in the Mitsubishi slag cleaning furnace. Recent initiatives in slag cleaning furnace
practice have involved lance injection of solid reductants or gaseous reducing agents
such as methane, to improve reduction kinetics (An et al., 1998; Sallee & Ushakov,
1999). Qu et al. (2020) recently demonstrated that hydrogen is also an effective alterna-
tive reducing agent.
Table 10.2 includes data for the electric slag cleaning furnace used by the direct-to-
blister smelter at Glogow. This furnace is unusual in several regards, including the pro-
duction of CuePbeFe alloy rather than matte, due to the lack of sulﬁde in the charged
slag (Pietrzyk & Palimaka, 2016). This operation is discussed in detail in Chapter 9.
Recent research at the University of Chile has highlighted a number of potential im-
provements to the design and operation of electric furnaces for slag cleaning (SMS
Group, 2013; Warczok et al., 2007a, 2007b). These include the following:
•
the use of rectangular rather than circular furnace shape, particularly advantageous for
continuous operation (SMS Group, 2013);
•
replacing AC furnace power supply with DC, coupled with a magnetic ﬁeld to
enhance stirring and reduction kinetics (König et al., 2013; SMS Group, 2013);
•
replacing coke with calcium carbide as a reductant, which improves kinetics and
requires less furnace energy (Bydalek et al., 2015)
272
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Using all of these innovations, it might be possible to reduce the copper content of
the cleaned slag below 0.4 wt.-% (SMS Group, 2013). However, in practice, the addi-
tional cost of power and equipment requires most furnace operators to settle for a higher
level.
Fuel-ﬁred slag cleaning furnaces are used at a few smelters (Table 10.3). The foremost
is the Teniente slag cleaning furnace, which is similar in design to a rotary ﬁre reﬁning
furnace (Chapter 12; Demetrio et al., 2000; Mackay et al., 2000). It features injection
of powdered coke and air into molten slag. In 2000, it began operating on a semicontin-
uous basis, generating slag with 0.75%e0.85% Cu. Semicontinuous operation improved

productivity by over 20%, while reducing coke consumption by half. The slag cleaning
furnaces used by bath smelters are usually electric, but fuel-ﬁred furnaces can be used for
this purpose as well (Mariscal & Herrera, 2009).
10.5 Decreasing copper in slag IV: slag minerals processing
Several options are available for recovering Cu from converter slags. Pyrometallurgical
cleaning in electric furnaces is quite common. Molten converter slag is also recycled
to reverberatory smelting furnaces and Inco ﬂash furnaces. Outotec and Teniente
smelting furnaces occasionally accept some molten converter slag (Queirolo et al.,
2016).
Cu is also removed from converter slags by slow solidiﬁcation, crushing/grinding,
and froth ﬂotation (Queirolo et al., 2016). It relies on the fact that as converter
slags cool, much of their dissolved Cu exsolves from solution by the following reaction
( Jalkanen et al., 2002):
Cu2O þ 3 FeO / 2 Cu (l) þ Fe3O4
(10.7)
Reaction (10.7) is increasingly favored at low temperatures and can decrease the
dissolved Cu content of converter slag to well below 0.5% (Imris et al., 2000). After
the slag has solidiﬁed, the exsolved copper and suspended matte particles respond
well to froth ﬂotation. As a result, converter slags have long been crushed, ground,
and concentrated in the same manner as sulﬁde ores (Demetrio et al., 2000). The
key to successful minerals processing of converter slags is ensuring that the precipitated
grains of matte and metallic Cu are large enough to be liberated by crushing and
grinding. This is accomplished by cooling the slag slowly to less than 1000 C, then
naturally to ambient temperature. Once this is done, the same minerals processing
equipment and reagents that are used to recover Cu from ore can be used to recover
Cu from slag (Table 10.4). Some smelting slags are also treated this way (Karimi
et al., 2013).
Slag ﬂotation is becoming less popular for processing smelter slags, for two reasons
(Acu~na & Sherrington, 2005). The ﬁrst is the trend toward production of higher grade
mattes. A higher fraction of the copper in these mattes is present as dissolved copper,
rather than entrained matte. This copper is not recovered by ﬂotation, but must be
recovered in a settling furnace. The second is the increased throughput at many mills.
This means that comminution and ﬂotation equipment is less likely to be available for
processing slags. A separate facility is required for slag mineral processing (Queirolo
et al., 2016).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

10.6 Summary
Cu smelters produce two slags: smelting furnace slag with one to 2% Cu and converter
slag with four to 8% Cu. Discard of these slags would waste considerable Cu, so they are
almost always treated for Cu recovery.
Cu is present in molten slags as (a) entrained droplets of matte or metal and (b) dis-
solved Cuþ. The entrained droplets are recovered by settling in a slag cleaning furnace,
usually electric. The dissolved Cuþ is recovered by hydrocarbon reduction and settling of
matte.
A second method of recovering this Cu from slag is slowecooling/solidiﬁcation,
crushing/grinding, and froth ﬂotation. Slowly cooled/solidiﬁed slag contains the
originally entrained matte and Cu droplets plus matte and Cu which precipitate during
cooling/solidiﬁcation. These Cu-bearing materials are efﬁciently recovered from the
solidiﬁed slag by ﬁne grinding and froth ﬂotation.
Electric furnace settling has the advantage that it can be used for recovering Cu from
reverts and miscellaneous materials around the smelter. Slag ﬂotation has the advantages
of more efﬁcient Cu recovery and the possibility of using existing crushing/grinding/
ﬂotation equipment.

CHAPTER 11
Capture and ﬁxation of sulfur
(King et al., 2013)
About 85% of the world’s primary copper originates in sulﬁde minerals. Sulfur is, there-
fore, evolved by most copper extraction processes. The most common form of evolved
sulfur is sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas from smelting and converting.
SO2 is harmful to fauna and ﬂora and is detrimental to the human respiratory system.
It must be prevented from reaching the environment. Regulations for ground level SO2
concentrations around copper smelters are presented in Table 11.1. Other regulations
such as maximum total SO2 emission (tonnes per year), percent SO2 capture, and
SO2-in-gas concentration at point of emission also apply in certain locations.
In the past, SO2 from smelting and converting was vented directly to the atmosphere.
This practice is unacceptable, so most smelters capture a large fraction of their SO2. It is
almost always made into sulfuric acid, occasionally liquid SO2 or gypsum. Copper
smelters typically produce 2.5e4.0 tonnes of sulfuric acid per tonne of product copper,
depending on the S/Cu ratio of their feed materials.
This chapter describes the following:
1. off-gases from smelting and converting
2. manufacture of sulfuric acid from smelter gases
3. recent and future developments in sulfur capture.
11.1 Off-gases from smelting and converting processes
Table 11.2 characterizes the off-gases from smelting and converting processes. SO2
strengths in smelting furnace gases vary from about 70 vol.-% in Inco ﬂash furnace gases
to 1 vol.-% in reverberatory furnace gases. The SO2 strengths in converter gases vary
from about 40% in ﬂash converter gases to 8%e12% in PeirceeSmith converter gases.
Off-gases from most smelting and converting furnaces are treated for SO2 removal in
sulfuric acid plants. The exception is off-gas from reverberatory furnaces. It is too dilute
in SO2 for economic sulfuric acid manufacture. This is the main reason reverberatory
furnaces continue to be shut down.
The off-gases from electric slag cleaning furnaces, anode furnaces, and secondary gas
collection hoods around the smelter are diluted in SO2, <0.1%. These gases are usually
vented to atmosphere. In densely populated areas, they may be scrubbed with basic
solutions before being vented (Jones et al., 2019; Roy & Sardar, 2015; Shibata &
Oda, 1990).

11.1.1 Sulfur capture efﬁciencies
Table 11.3 shows the typical sulfur capture efﬁciency of a modern smelter with an Out-
otec ﬂash furnace and PeirceeSmith converters. Gaseous emissions of sulfur compounds
are 1% of the sulfur entering the smelter.
11.2 Sulfuric acid manufacture
Nearly all sulfuric acid manufactured from smelter off-gas is by the conventional contact
type acid plant. Two copper smelters use Sulfacid to manufacture dilute sulfuric acid by
treating the tail gas from their acid plants. The traditional contact type acid plant is
described below. Sulfacid is described in Section 11.7.
Fig. 11.1 outlines the steps for producing sulfuric acid from SO2-bearing smelter
off-gas. The steps are as follows:
1. cooling and cleaning the gas
2. drying the gas with 93% sulfuric acid
3. catalytically oxidizing SO2 to SO3
4. absorbing this SO3 into 98.5% H2SO4 sulfuric acid.
The strengthened acid from step (4) is then blended with diluted acid from step (2)
and sent to market or used for leach operations.
Tail gases typically contain less than 0.5% of the sulfur entering the gas treatment sys-
tem. They are cleaned of their acid mist, usually by candle ﬁlters (Begg Cousland, 2018),
and discharged to the atmosphere. Several smelters scrub the remaining SO2, SO3, and
H2SO4 mist with Ca/Na carbonate hydroxide solutions before releasing the gas to atmo-
sphere (Jones et al., 2019; Kubo et al., 2007; Roy & Sardar, 2015; Shibata & Oda, 1990).
Basic aluminum sulfate solution is also used (Oshima et al., 1997).
The following sections describe the principal sulfuric acid production steps and their
purposes.
11.3 Smelter off-gas treatment
The key to high acid plant availability in any smelter is to efﬁciently operate and maintain
properly designed gas cooling and cleaning systems as described in the next few sections.

11.3.1 Gas cooling and heat recovery
The ﬁrst step in smelter off-gas treatment is cooling the gas in preparation for electrostatic
precipitation of its dust. Electrostatic precipitators operate at about 350C (Parker, 1997).
Above this temperature, their steel structures begin to weaken. Below this temperature,
there is a danger of corrosion by condensation of sulfuric acid from SO3 and water vapor
in the off-gas.
Gas cooling is usually done in waste heat boilers (Fig. 11.2), which not only cool the
gas but also recover the heat in a useful form as steam (Köster, 2010; Kuang et al., 2016;
Peippo et al., 1999). The boilers consist of the following:
1. a radiation section in which the heat in the gas is transferred to pressurized water
ﬂowing through 4 cm diameter tubes in the roof and walls of a large (e.g., 25 m
long  15 m high  5 m wide) rectangular chamber
2. a convection section (typically 20 m long  10 m high  3 m wide) in which heat is
transferred to pressurized water ﬂowing through 4 cm diameter steel tubes suspended
in the path of the gas.
The product of the boiler is a water/steam mixture (Clark et al., 2017). The water is
separated by gravity and recirculated to the boiler. The steam is often superheated above
its dew point and used for generating electricity. It is also used without superheating for
concentrate drying and for various heating duties around the smelter and reﬁnery.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Dust falls out of waste heat boiler gases due to its low velocity in the large boiler
chambers. It is collected and usually recycled to the smelting furnace for Cu recovery.
However, this pattern has begun to change as the level of impurities in copper
concentrates continues to grow. These impurities include volatile elements such as
arsenic, ﬂuorine, and mercury (Weidenbach et al., 2016), which wind up in the
off-gas and ultimately in the dusts collected during off-gas processing. To separate
the copper in the dust from these impurities, a leaching step is performed (Chen et al.,
2012; Rios et al., 2019). This avoids impurity recycle to the smelting furnace, but
produces a waste solid that smelters have to properly manage.
An alternative method of cooling smelter gas is to pass it through sprays of water.
Spray cooling (evaporative cooling) lowers the gas temperature to 300e350C and
avoids the investment in waste heat recovery equipment (Hasselwander, 2019; Ng’ambi
et al., 2016), but it wastes the heat in the gases. and increases the cooling duty in the
downstream gas cleaning plant (Section 11.3.3). Dry dust is recovered, since the gases
are not completely saturated. It is used primarily for Ausmelt, ISASMELT, Teniente,
Noranda, and sometimes PeirceeSmith gases.
Water quenching (Section 11.3.3) can also be used to cool the gases leaving the
furnace (Amiri & Alihosseinpour, 2015; Ng’ambi et al., 2016). All of the Cu-bearing
dust ends up in a weak acid solution and must be recovered hydrometallurgically. Water
quenching is used primarily for Inco and PeirceeSmith converter off-gases (Daum, 2000;
Liu, 2006).
11.3.2 Electrostatic precipitation of dust
After cooling, the furnace gases are passed through electrostatic precipitators (Conde
et al., 1999; Hasselwander, 2019; Parker, 1997) for more dust removal. The dust particles
are caught by
1. charging them in the corona of a high voltage electric ﬁeld
2. catching them on a charged plate or wire
3. collecting them by neutralizing the charge and shaking the wires or plates.
The precipitators remove 99þ% of the dust from the incoming gas (Conde et al.,
1999; Hasselwander, 2019). The dust consists primarily of oxide compounds (Okanigbe
et al., 2017), and is usually resmelted to recover its Cu. About 70% of the dust is recov-
ered in the cooling system and 30% in the electrostatic precipitators.
11.3.3 Water quenching, scrubbing, and cooling
After electrostatic precipitation, the gas is quenched with water and scrubbed to further
remove dust and impurities (Hasselwander, 2019). This quenching (a) removes much of
the remaining dust from the gas and (b) absorbs HCl, HF, SO3, and vapor impurities such
Capture and ﬁxation of sulfur
287

as As2O3. The gas is then further cooled to 35e40C by direct contact with cool water in
a packed tower or by indirect contact with cool water in a heat exchanger.
The gas leaves the cooling section through electrostatic mist precipitators to eliminate
ﬁne droplets of liquid remaining in the gas and remove the rest of the dust. This avoids
fouling of downstream acid plant catalyst (Hanekom, 2017; Hasselwander, 2019;
Kamino et al., 2016). Mist precipitators operate similarly to the electrostatic precipitators
described in Section 11.3.2. They must, however, be (a) constructed of acid-resistant
materials such as ﬁber-reinforced plastic, alloy steels, or lead and (b) periodically turned
off and ﬂushed with fresh water to remove collected solids.
11.3.4 Mercury removal
Smelters treating high-mercury concentrates often use the Boliden Norzink process to
remove mercury from the gas leaving the electrostatic mist precipitators (Hasselwander,
2019; Hultbom, 2003). In the Boliden Norzink process, the gas passes through a water-
based solution of dissolved mercuric chloride (HgCl2) circulating over a packed tower to
absorb gaseous elemental mercury and form solid Hg2Cl2 (calomel) by the following
reaction:
HgCl2(aq) þ Hg(g) ¼ Hg2Cl2(s)
(11.1)
About half of the scrubbing solution is withdrawn and regenerated with chlorine gas
by the following reaction:
Hg2Cl2(s) þ Cl2(g) ¼ 2 HgCl2(aq)
(11.2)
The overall reaction is the following:
2 Hg(g) þ Cl2(g) ¼ Hg2Cl2(s)
(11.3)
Mercury can be bled from the system as Hg2Cl2 (calomel) by solid/liquid separation
or as elemental mercury by electrowinning:
HgCl2(aq) þ 2 ee ¼ Hg(l) þ Cl2(g)
(11.4)
The Boliden Norzink process is efﬁcient, typically removing more than 99.95% of the
inlet mercury. This results in a product acid mercury concentration of 0.3e0.5 ppm. This
acid will meet most quality speciﬁcations. However, if further mercury removal is
required, then the gas can be passed through an additional ﬁlter that contains either
PbS-coated pumice (Dowa process) or Se (Hasselwander, 2009; Lossin & Windhager,
1999). Mercury reacts with the Se to form HgSe and with PbS to form HgS. Product
acid mercury concentrations below 0.1 ppm can be achieved with this additional step.
11.3.5 The quenching liquid, acid plant blowdown
The water from quenching and direct-contact cooling is passed through water-cooled
heat exchangers and used again for quenching/cooling. It becomes acidic (from SO3
288
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

absorption) and impure (from dust and vapor absorption). A bleed stream of this impure
solution (acid plant blowdown) is continuously withdrawn and replaced with fresh water.
The amount of bleed and water replacement is controlled to keep the corrosive H2SO4
content of the cooling water below about 10%. The quantity of bleed depends on the
amount of SO3 in the off-gas as it enters the water-quench system.
The acid plant blowdown stream is neutralized and either stored or treated for metal
recovery (Ante, 2010; Evans et al., 1998).
11.4 Gas drying
11.4.1 Drying tower (Hanekom, 2017)
The next step in off-gas treatment is gas dehydration (drying). It is done to prevent
unintentional H2SO4 formation and corrosion in downstream ducts, heat exchangers,
and catalyst beds. The H2O(g) is removed by contacting it with 93% (occasionally
96%) acid. H2O reacts strongly with H2SO4 to form hydrated acid molecules. The
contacting is done in a counter-current packed tower ﬁlled with 5e10 cm ceramic
saddles (Fig. 11.3). The sulfuric acid ﬂows down over the saddles. The gas is drawn up
by the main acid plant blower(s).
The liquid product of gas drying is slightly diluted 93% H2SO4 acid. It is strengthened
with the 98þ% acid produced by subsequent SO3 absorption (Section 11.5.2). Most of
the strengthened acid is recycled to the absorption tower. A portion is sent to storage and
then to market.
11.4.1.1 Optimum absorbing and composition
The gas product of the drying tower contains typically 50e100 mg H2O/Nm3 of
off-gas. It also contains small droplets of acid which it picked up during its passage up
the drying tower. These droplets are removed by passing the dry gas through stainless
steel or ﬁber mist eliminator pads or candles.
11.4.2 Main acid plant blowers
The dried gas is drawn into the main acid plant blowers, which push it on to SO2 / SO3
conversion and acidmaking (DKL, 2019; Louie, 2010; Ng’ambi et al., 2016). One
centrifugal blower is used (occasionally two in larger plants). The blower typically draws
1000e4000 kW each, and moves 150,000e380,00 Nm3 of gas per hour (L€udtke &
M€uller, 2003). The gas handling system is under a slight vacuum before the blowers
(typically <0.07 bar gauge at the smelting furnace) and under pressure (0.3e0.5 bar
gauge) after (Kamino et al., 2016).

11.5 Acid plant chemical reactions
11.5.1 Oxidation of SO2 to SO3
The SO2 in the off-gas is oxidized to SO3 in preparation for absorption in the water
component of 98.5% H2SO4 acid. The oxidation reaction is as follows:
SO2(g) þ 0.5 O2(g) / SO3(g)
(11.5)
This reaction is often referred to as SO2 conversion. It is very slow without a catalyst, so
the gas is always passed through V2O5eK2SO4 catalyst beds. The volumetric O2/SO2
ratio entering the catalyst beds is set at 1.0 or greater (by adding air, if necessary) to ensure
near complete conversion of SO2 to SO3.

“pad” is usually replaced with multiple candle type mist eliminators.

11.5.1.1 Catalyst reactions
Typical V2O5eK2SO4 based catalyst contains 5%e10% V2O5, 10%e20% K2SO4,
1%e5% Na2SO4, and 55%e70% SiO2. It may also contain 5%e15% cesium sulfate
(Cs2SO4) substituted for K2SO4. The active components of the catalyst are V2O5,
K2SO4, Na2SO4, and Cs2SO4 (if present). The inactive material is SiO2, which acts as
a support for the active components.
V2O5eK2SO4 catalyst is a supported liquid-phase catalyst (Revelli, 2019). At the
catalyst operation temperature, w400C, the active catalyst components (V2O5,
K2SO4, Na2SO4, and Cs2SO4) exist as a ﬁlm of molten salt solution on the solid inactive
SiO2 support. Oxidation of SO2 to SO3 in the presence of oxygen takes place by
homogeneous reactions in this liquid ﬁlm. Pores on the surface of the silica substrate
provide the large surface area necessary for rapid SO2 oxidation. The rate of catalytic
SO2 oxidation depends largely upon the rate of mass and heat transfer at the catalyst gase
liquid interface.
One of the most widely cited SO2 conversion reaction mechanisms is that proposed
by Mars and Maessen (1964, 1968). It is based on the experimental observation that
during SO2 conversion, the oxidation state of the vanadium ions in the catalyst changes
between the V4þ and V5þ. This observation suggests that the reaction involves the
following:
1. absorption of SO2, reduction of vanadium ions from V5þ to V4þ, and formation of
SO3 from SO2 and O2 ions, i.e.,:
SO2 þ 2 V5þ þ O2 / SO3 þ 2 V4þ
(11.6)
and
2. absorption of oxygen, reoxidation of the vanadium ions and formation of O2 ions:
0.5 O2 þ 2 V4þ / 2 V5þ þ O2
(11.7)
11.5.1.2 Industrial V2O5eK2SO4 catalysts (Fig. 11.4)
Catalyst is manufactured by mixing together the active components and substrate to form
a paste which is extruded and baked at w530C into solid shapes. Ring-shaped (or

ribbed ring) catalyst is the most commonly used shape because (a) it gives a small pressure
drop in a catalyst bed and (b) its catalytic activity is only slowly affected by dust in the acid
plant feed gas. A typical catalyst ring is 10 mm in diameter by 10 mm in length
(Fig. 11.4).
11.5.1.3 Catalyst ignition and degradation temperatures
The ignition temperature at which the SO2 conversion reaction begins with
V2O5eK2SO4 catalyst is w360C. The reaction rate is relatively slow at this ignition
temperature. Therefore, the gases entering the catalyst beds are heated to temperatures
in the range of 400e440C to ensure rapid SO2 conversion.
Above 650C, thermal deactivation of the catalyst begins. Two mechanisms for high
temperature thermal deactivation have been proposed:
1. Silica in the substrate partly dissolves in the catalytic melt. This causes the thickness of
the melt ﬁlm to increase, which in turn blocks the pore structure, preventing gas
access to the liquid phase inside the pores.
2. Sintering of the silica substrate closes pores, restricting gas access to liquid phase inside
the pores.
Thermal deactivation proceeds slowly. V2O5eK2SO4 catalyst can usually be
subjected to temperatures of 700e800C for short periods without causing signiﬁcant
deactivation. However, long times at these temperatures reduce catalyst activity and
decrease SO2 conversion rate.
11.5.1.4 Cs-promoted catalyst
Substituting Cs2SO4 for K2SO4 in the active liquid component of the catalyst lowers the
melting point of the liquid, providing higher reaction rates at lower temperatures. The
lower melting point of Cs-promoted catalyst allows V4þ to remain in solution at a lower
temperature, increasing its low temperature catalytic activity. Cs-promoted catalyst has
an ignition temperature of w320C. Its typical operating temperature range is
370e500C. Cs-promoted catalyst costs 2e2.5 times that of non-Cs-promoted catalyst.
Therefore, its use is typically optimized by installing it only in the top half of the ﬁrst and/
or last catalyst beds.
11.5.1.5 Dust accumulation in catalyst beds
Over time, dust, which inadvertently passes through the gas cleaning section, begins to
build up in the catalyst beds. It blocks gas ﬂow through the catalyst and increases the
pressure that must be applied to achieve the acid plant’s required gas ﬂowrate. When
the pressure drop in the catalyst beds becomes excessive, the acid plant must be shut
down and the catalyst screened to remove the accumulated dust. Keeping off-gas clean-
ing apparatus in optimum operating condition is critical to maintaining acid plant
availability.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

11.5.1.6 SO2 / SO3 conversion equilibrium curve
Oxidation of SO2 to SO3 proceeds further toward completion at lower temperatures.
Fig. 11.5 shows the equilibrium curve for a gas containing 12% SO2, 12% O2, and
balance N2 at a total pressure of 1.2 bar. The equilibrium curve on the graph represents
the maximum attainable conversion of SO2 to SO3 at a given temperature. This curve is
also shown in Fig. 11.8. with reaction heat-up paths for each catalyst bed.
11.5.1.7 Absorption of SO3 into H2SO4eH2O solution
The SO3 formed by the above-described catalytic oxidation of SO2 is absorbed into
98.5% H2SO4 acid. The process occurs in a packed tower of similar design to a drying
tower (Fig. 11.3). In absorption, SO3 laden gas and sulfuric acid ﬂow counter currently.
The overall absorption reaction is the following:
SO3(g) þ H2O(l) / H2SO4(l)
(11.8)
It is not possible to manufacture sulfuric acid by absorbing sulfur trioxide directly into
water. Sulfur trioxide reacts with water vapor to form H2SO4 vapor. This sulfuric acid
vapor condenses as a mist of ﬁne, submicron, droplets, which are practically impossible
to coalesce. However, the theoretical vapor pressure of water over 98.5% H2SO4 is
low (<210⁻⁵ bar at 80C), avoiding this water vapor problem. The most likely absorp-
tion reactions are as follows:
SO3(g) þ H2SO4(l) / H2S2O7(l)

at lower temperatures.

followed by the following:
H2O(l) þ H2S2O7(l) / 2 H2SO4(l)
(11.10)
Some SO3 is undoubtedly absorbed directly by water according to Eq. (11.8). How-
ever, the preponderance of H2SO4 molecules in the absorbent means that absorption by
Eqs. (11.9) and (11.10) probably predominates. SO3 absorption is exothermic, so that the
strengthened acid must be cooled before it is (a) recycled for further absorption or (b) sent
to storage.
11.5.1.8 Optimum absorbing acid composition
The optimum absorbing acid composition is 98%e99% H2SO4. This is the composition
at which the sum of the equilibrium partial pressures of H2O, SO3, and H2SO4 over sul-
furic acid is at its minimum.
Below this optimum, H2O vapor pressure increases and sulfuric acid mist may form
by the reaction of H2O(g) and SO3. This mist is difﬁcult to coalesce, so it tends to escape
the acid plant into the environment. Above this optimum, SO3 and H2SO4 partial pres-
sures increase. This also increases the release of sulfur compounds to the environment.
Acid plant ﬂow rates and compositions are controlled to keep the absorbing acid in
the 98%e99% range before and after SO3 absorption.
11.6 Industrial sulfuric acid manufacture (Tables 11.4e11.6)
Fig. 11.6 shows a typical ﬂowsheet for SO2 conversion and SO3 absorption. The acid
plant is a 3:1 double absorption plant; this means that the gases pass through three catalyst
beds before intermediate absorption, and then one catalyst bed before ﬁnal absorption.
Figs. 11.7 and 11.8 describe the process thermodynamically. The steps are as follows:
1. heating the incoming gas to the minimum continuous catalyst operating temperature
(w410C) by heat exchange with the hot gases from SO2 oxidation
2. passing the hot gas through a ﬁrst bed of catalyst where partial SO2 conversion takes
place and where the gases are heated by the heat of the SO2 reaction
3. cooling the gas down by heat exchange with cool incoming gas
4. passing the cooled gas through a second bed of catalyst where more SO2 conversion
takes place and where the gases again become hot
5. repeating steps (3) and (4) with a third catalyst bed.
The gas from the third catalyst bed is cooled and its SO3 absorbed into 98.5% H2SO4
acid. The exit gas from this absorption is then passed through a second set of heat
exchangers, a fourth catalyst bed, and a second absorption tower. In some plants, initial
absorption takes place after the gas passes through two catalyst beds and ﬁnal absorption
after the remaining two catalyst beds (2:2 conﬁguration). Plants requiring very low SO2
emissions sometimes have a ﬁfth catalyst bed (3:2 conﬁguration).
294
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The above description is for a double absorption plant which converts and absorbs
>99.7% of the SO2 entering the acid plant. Single absorption acid plants convert SO2
to SO3 in three or four catalyst beds followed by single absorption of SO3 (Table 11.6).
Their conversion of SO2 to SO3 is less complete with consequentially lower sulfur
capture efﬁciencies (96%e98%; Amiri & Alihosseinpour, 2015). About 10%e15% of
current sulﬁde smelter acid plants use single absorption design; the percentage is expected
to decline in the future as SO2 emission limits become tighter.

11.6.2 SO2 / SO3 conversion reaction paths
Figs. 11.8 and 11.9 show the schematic steady state %SO2 conversion/temperature
reaction path for a 12% SO2, 12% O2 gas ﬂowing through a double absorption 3:1
sulfuric acid plant. The gas enters the ﬁrst catalyst bed of the converter at about
410C. SO2 is oxidized to SO3 in the bed, heating the gas to about 630C. About
64% of the input SO2 is converted to SO3.
The gas from bed 1 is then cooled to 430C in a heat exchanger (Fig. 11.8) and is
passed through the second catalyst bed. There, a further 26% of the SO2 is converted
to SO3 (to a total of 90%) and the gas is heated to about 520C by the oxidation reaction.
This gas is then cooled to 435C in a heat exchanger and is passed through the third cata-
lyst bed. A further 6% of the initial SO2 is oxidized to SO3 (to 96% conversion), while the
temperature increases to about 456C.
At this point, the gas is cooled to w180C and sent to the intermediate absorption
tower, where virtually all (99.99%) of its SO3 is absorbed into 98.5% H2SO4 sulfuric acid.
After this absorption, the gas contains about 0.5% SO2. It is heated to 415C and
passed through the last catalyst bed in the converter (Fig. 11.9). Here, about 90% of
its remaining SO2 is converted to SO3, leaving only about 0.025% SO2 in the gas.
This gas is again cooled to w180C and sent to the ﬁnal SO3 absorption tower. Overall
conversion of SO2 is approximately 99.8%, and sometimes up to 99.95%.
11.6.3 Reaction path characteristics
Figs. 11.8 and 11.9 show some important aspects of SO2 conversion.
1. Conversion to SO3 is maximized by a low conversion temperature, consistent with
meeting the minimum continuous operating temperature requirement of the catalyst.

2. The maximum catalyst temperature is reached in the ﬁrst catalyst bed where most of
the SO2 conversion takes place. This is where a low ignition temperature Cs catalyst
can be useful. Catalyst bed temperature increases with increasing SO2 concentration
in the gas because SO2 conversion energy release has to heat less N2. Cs catalyst is
expensive, so it is only used when low temperature catalysis is clearly advantageous.
3. Conversion of SO2 to SO3 after intermediate absorption is very efﬁcient (Fig. 11.9).
This is because (a) the gas entering the catalyst contains no SO3 (driving Reaction
(11.4) to the right) and because (b) the temperature of the gas rises only slightly
due to the small amount of SO2 being oxidized to SO3.
4. Maximum cooling of the gases is required for the gases being sent to SO3 absorption
towers (w440e180C), hence the inclusion of air coolers in Fig. 11.6.
5. Maximum heating of the gases is required for initial heating and for heating after in-
termediate absorption, hence the passage through several heat exchangers in Fig. 11.6.
11.6.4 Absorption towers
Double absorption sulfuric acid plants absorb SO3 twice: after partial SO2 oxidation and
after ﬁnal oxidation. The absorption is done counter-currently in towers packed with
5e10 cm ceramic saddles which present a continuous descending ﬁlm of 98.5%
H2SO4 acid into which rising SO3 absorbs. Typical sulfuric acid irrigation rates, densities,
and operating temperatures for absorption towers are shown in Table 11.7.
The strengthened acid is cooled in water-cooled shell and tube type heat exchangers.
A portion of it is sent for blending with 93% H2SO4 from the gas drying tower to pro-
duce the grades of acid being sent to market. The remainder is diluted with blended acid
and recycled to the absorption towers. These cross-ﬂows of 98þ and 93% H2SO4 allow a
wide range of acid products to be marketed.
Figure 11.9 Equilibrium curve and fourth catalyst bed reaction heat-up path. Almost all of the SO3 in
the gas leaving the third catalyst bed has been absorbed into sulfuric acid in the intermediate absorp-
tion tower.

11.6.5 Gas to gas heat exchangers and acid coolers
Large gas-to-gas heat exchangers are used to transfer heat to and from gases entering and
exiting a catalytic converter. The latest heat exchanger designs are radial shell and tube.
Older designs were single or double segmental type. Acid plant gas-to-gas heat
exchangers typically transfer heat at 10,000e80,000 MJ/h. They must be sized to ensure
that a range of gas ﬂowrates and SO2 concentrations can be processed. This is especially
signiﬁcant for smelters treating off-gases generated by batch type PeirceeSmith
converters.
The hot acid from SO3 absorption and gas drying is typically cooled in indirect shell-
and-tube heat exchangers. The water ﬂows through the tubes of the heat exchanger and
the acid through the shell. The warm water leaving the heat exchanger is usually cooled
in an atmospheric cooling tower before being recycled for further acid cooling.
Anodic protection of the coolers is required to minimize corrosion by the hot sulfuric
acid (Halimi, 2020). Anodically protected coolers last 20e30 years. Recently, nonanodi-
cally protected acid coolers fabricated of high silicon stainless steel have been shown to
last 10e15 years (DKL Engineering, 2016).
11.6.6 Grades of product acid
Sulfuric acid is sold in grades of 93%e98% H2SO4 according to market demand. The
principal product in cold climates is 93% H2SO4 because of its low freezing
point, 35C (Veolia, 2020).
Oleum, H2SO4 into which SO3 is absorbed, is also sold by several smelters. It is
produced by diverting a stream of SO3-bearing gas and contacting it with 98þ H2SO4
in a small absorption tower.
11.7 Alternative sulfuric acid manufacturing methods
11.7.1 Haldor Topsøe WSA
The WSA (Wet gas Sulfuric Acid) process, developed and commercialized in the early
1980s by Haldor Topsøe (Christensen, 2016; Louie, 2010), is used to treat wet, low

concentration gases (0.2%e6.5% SO2), such as those produced by sulﬁde ore and
concentrate roasters. WSA treats the off-gas directly from upstream gas cleaning plants.
No further drying is required, since the humidity present in the off-gas is used to hydrate
the SO3 generated in the converter and produce concentrated (98%) sulfuric acid. The
heat generated during oxidation, hydration, and condensation is principally reused in
the process to preheat the off-gas to the required temperature level, and also to generate
high pressure superheated steam for process use (Fig. 11.10).
WSA plants can achieve greater than 99% SO2 conversion (Louie, 2010; Rosenberg,
2006). A newly developed WSAeDC (Double Conversion) process improves
conversion even more (Christensen, 2017) and allows autothermal operation in
off-gases with SO2 levels as low as 3%.
11.7.2 Sulfacid
Sulfacid is presently marketed by Carbon Process and Plant Engineering GmbH. About
20 installations worldwide produce weak sulfuric acid (10%e20% H2SO4) from very low
concentration gases (<1.0% SO2). The saturated gas is cleaned (<30 mg/dry Nm3)
Figure 11.10 Haldor Topsøe WSA Process ﬂow schematic. A molten salt mixture is used to transfer
heat from the catalyst beds to the cold feed gas entering the plant. Excess heat removed from the
catalyst beds is turned into useful steam in a small waste heat boiler. A direct ﬁred hydrocarbon
fuel burner can be used to supply additional heat to the catalyst beds.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

before entering an activated carbon catalytic reactor where SO2 reacts with O2 and H2O
at 30e80C (Kruger, 2004) to produce H2SO4 by the following reaction:
SO2(g) þ 0.5 O2(g) þ n H2O(l) / H2SO4$(n1)H2O(l)
(11.11)
The acid is intermittently washed from the catalyst, producing weak sulfuric acid. The
cleaned gas is discharged to the atmosphere. Sulfacid plants are most economical when
their dilute sulfuric acid product can be consumed in nearby operations, such as titanium
dioxide manufacture or fertilizer production.
11.8 Recent and future developments in sulfuric acid manufacture
11.8.1 Maximizing feed gas SO2 concentrations
Since the 1980s, smelting technology has shifted from reverberatory and electric furnace
smelting to ﬂash furnace and other intensive smelting processes. Oxygen enrichment of
furnace blasts also increased signiﬁcantly. An important (and desired) effect of these
changes has been increased SO2 strength in the gases that enter smelter sulfuric acid plants
(Dijkstra et al., 2017).
SO2 off-gases entering the drying tower now average 6%e18% SO2. The low con-
centrations come from smelters using PeirceeSmith converters. The high concentrations
come from direct-to-copper smelting and continuous smelting/converting smelters.
High SO2 concentration gases contain little N2. They heat up more than conven-
tional smelter gas during passage through catalyst beds. This can lead to overheating
and degradation of the V2O5eK2SO4 catalyst (650C) and to weakening of the steel
catalyst bed support structure (630C). These two items limit the maximum strength
of sulfuric acid plant feed gas in conventional acid plants to w13% SO2 (Daum, 2009;
Dijkstra et al., 2017). This means that the feed gas entering the acid plant must be diluted
with air, resulting in a larger gas volume to be treated and higher operating costs associ-
ated with the power required for the blower(s). Four approaches have been used to raise
permissible SO2 strength entering a sulfuric acid plant.
1. Installation of Cs-promoted catalyst in the ﬁrst pass catalyst bed (Daum, 2009). This
allows the bed inlet temperature to be operated at w380C, i.e., about 30C cooler
than conventional catalysts. This allows a larger temperature rise (and more SO2
conversion) in the ﬁrst bed without exceeding the bed outlet temperature limit.
2. Installation of a preconverter to lower the SO2 concentration entering the ﬁrst
catalyst bed of the main converter (Daum, 2009; Dijkstra et al., 2017; Hattori &
Sunamoto, 2016).
3. Recycle of SO3-laden gas from the outlet of the third catalyst bed to the ﬁrst catalyst
bed. This is the LUREC process (Daum, 2009). It was developed by Outotec and
installed in 2007 at the Yanggu Xiangguang Copper smelter acid plant in China
(Outotec, 2014). The use of LUREC allows treatment of 18% SO2 feed gas at the
inlet to the ﬁrst catalyst bed.
Capture and ﬁxation of sulfur
305

4. Originally developed by Bayer Technology Services (Hands & Connock, 2010),
what is now known as the CORE process is now offered by Chemetics, a division
of Worley (Dijkstra, 2017; Dijkstra et al., 2017). A CORE system is in operation
at a copper smelter in Europe and has been treating 15%e17% SO2 gas since
2017. CORE uses “active cooling” of a quasiisothermal reactor to remove the heat
of the conversion reaction as fast as it can be generated. The coolant is either air
for the original process or a recirculating molten salt for the larger-scale CORE-S
process. CORE can either be used as an add-on to an existing acid plant or as a
replacement facility. Fig. 11.11 shows the schematic for a CORE converter process-
ing high-strength off-gas from a high-intensity smelter, diluted with weaker off-gas
(e.g., from PeirceeSmith converters). CORE can process off-gas with up to 25%
SO2, and CORE-S up to 50% strength off-gas. Fig. 11.12 compares the methods
of handling high-strength off-gas; the movement to high-intensity smelting processes
will make this comparison increasingly important.
11.8.2 Maximizing heat recovery
Heat is generated during SO2 conversion. In almost all sulfur burning acid plants and in
some metallurgical acid plants, this heat is usually recovered into a useful formdsteam.
The hot gases exiting the catalyst beds are passed through boiler feed water economizers,
steam superheaters, and waste heat boilers (Hattori & Sunamoto, 2016; Kubo et al.,
2007). Many metallurgical acid plants capture SO2 conversion and SO3 absorption
heat, but others remove their excess heat in air coolers if it cannot be recovered in a
useable product stream (Louie, 2010). Some of the warm air produced by the air coolers
has been used as concentrate dryer (rotary kiln type) dilution air (Hoshi, 2010; Kamino
et al., 2016). This lowers kiln hydrocarbon fuel consumption.

cleaned off-gas (Dijkstra et al., 2017). Air or O2 is used to adjust the O2/SO2 ratio. Illustration supplied

306
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

SO3 absorption heat can be captured and used to generate steam or hot water using
HRS (Heat Recovery System, MECS; Jung et al., 2010), HEROS (Heat RecOvery
System; Outotec, 2014, 2016), or ALPHA (Dijkstra, 2019). HRS is the most common
with w90 installations worldwide. Low pressure steam (5e10 bar gauge, w0.4 t
steam/t H2SO4) is produced in a kettle tube boiler with hot, concentrated (w210C,
99.6% H2SO4) sulfuric acid ﬂowing through the tubes and the steam/water mixture
on the shell side. Acid concentration and temperature control are critical in ensuring
low corrosion rates in these systems. As a result, they are most suited for acid plants
that treat feed gas with a steady ﬂow and SO2 concentration, like those from a ﬂash fur-
nace þ ﬂash converter. In addition, the site must have a use for the low pressure steam.
11.9 Alternative sulfur products
The SO2 in Cu smelter gases is almost always captured as sulfuric acid. Other SO2 capture
products have been the following:
1. liquid SO2
2. gypsum (Tian et al., 2018)
3. elemental sulfur
The processes for making these products are described by King and Forzatti (2009).

11.10 Summary
Modern smelting processes collect most of their SO2 at sufﬁcient strength for economic
sulfuric acid manufacture. Most reverberatory smelting furnaces have been replaced.
PeirceeSmith converting remains a problem for SO2 collection, especially during
charging and skimming when gas leaks into the workplace and at ground level around
the smelter (Wu, 2019). Adoption of continuous converting processes such as Mitsubishi
and KennecotteOutotec ﬂash converting will alleviate this problem.
This chapter has shown that most copper is extracted from sulﬁde minerals so that sul-
fur, in some form, is a byproduct of most copper extraction processes. The usual byprod-
uct is sulfuric acid, made from the SO2 produced during smelting and converting.
Conventional sulfuric acid production entails the following:
1. cleaning and drying the furnace gases
2. catalytically oxidizing their SO2 to SO3 (with O2 in the gas itself or in added air)
3. absorbing the resulting SO3 into a 98.5% H2SO4eH2O sulfuric acid solution.
The process is autothermal when the input gases contain about four or more vol.-%
SO2. Double absorption acid plants recover >99.7% of the input SO2. SO2 recovery can
be increased even further by scrubbing the acid plant tail gas with basic solutions or by
adding more catalyst beds with Cs-promoted catalyst.
Some modern smelting processes produce extrastrong SO2 gases, 13þ% SO2. These
strong gases tend to overheat during SO2 oxidation, causing catalyst degradation and
inefﬁcient SO2 conversion. This problem is leading to the development of catalysts
which have low ignition temperatures and high degradation temperatures. Installation
of preconverters, LUREC, or CORE are also used to handle high SO2 strength feed gas.
The PeirceeSmith converter is the major environmental problem remaining in the
Cu smelter. It tends to spill SO2-bearing gas into the workplace and it produces gas
discontinuously for the acid plant. Adoption of replacement converting processes began
in the 1980s (Mitsubishi converter) and is continuing in the 2000s (KennecotteOutotec
ﬂash converter, Ausmelt/ISASMELT converter, and Noranda converter).

CHAPTER 12
Fire reﬁning (S and O removal) and
anode casting
Virtually, all the molten copper produced by smelting/converting is subsequently elec-
troreﬁned. It must, therefore, be suitable for casting into thin, strong, smooth anodes for
interleaving with cathodes in electroreﬁning cells (Fig. 13.3). This requires that the cop-
per be ﬁre reﬁned to remove most of its sulfur and oxygen.
The molten blister copper chemical quality will vary depending on the choice of
batch or continuous converting. A batch converting process such as PeirceeSmith pro-
duces molten blister copper containing w0.02% S and w0.3% O. On the other hand,
copper from single-step smelting and/or continuous converting produces molten blister
copper containing up to 1% S and 0.2%e0.4% O. At these oxygen and sulfur levels, the
elements would combine during solidiﬁcation to form bubbles (blisters) of SO2 in newly
cast anodes, making them weak and bumpy. In stoichiometric terms, 0.01% dissolved sul-
fur and 0.01 dissolved oxygen in molten copper would combine to produce about 2 cm3
of SO2 (1083C) per cm3 of solidiﬁed copper.
Fire reﬁning removes sulfur and oxygen from liquid blister copper by (a) air oxidation
removal of sulfur as SO2 down to w0.003% S, and (b) hydrocarbon reduction removal of
oxygen as CO and H2O down to w0.16% O. Sulfur and oxygen contents at the various
stages of ﬁre reﬁning are summarized in Table 12.1.
In addition to the contained sulfur and oxygen, molten blister copper also contains
minor elements such as arsenic, lead, antimony, bismuth, and precious metals. These el-
ements will be partially removed during the oxidation and reﬁning steps of the reﬁning
process and/or by the addition of suitable ﬂuxes to eliminate them as oxides (in most
cases) as part of a reﬁning slag. In some cases, use of molten ﬂuxes will be required to
reduce levels of elements such as arsenic, lead, and antimony (Alvear et al., 1999). The
degree of elimination of these elements will depend on the desired anode quality deﬁned
by the subsequent electroreﬁning process.
12.1 Industrial methods of ﬁre reﬁning
Fire reﬁning is mostly carried out in rotary reﬁning furnaces resembling PeirceeSmith
converters (Fig. 12.1), or less often in hearth furnaces or tilting furnaces (Fig. 12.2). It
is carried out at about 1200C, which provides enough superheat for subsequent casting
of anodes. The furnaces are heated by combusting hydrocarbon fuel throughout the pro-
cess. About 1100 MJ of fuel are consumed per tonne of copper (Coursol et al., 2010).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

An important aspect to enhance removal of oxygen, sulfur, and minor elements is the
degree of agitation that can be achieved within the molten bath. For this purpose, several
means are used, such as tuyeres and porous plugs. In some cases, the input of nitrogen to
enhance the desulfurization reaction and the overall desulfurization time has been suc-
cessfully tested (Enriquez et al., 2018; Mokola et al., 2019).
12.1.1 Rotary furnace reﬁning
Fig. 12.1 shows a rotary reﬁning furnace. Furnaces are typically sized to hold between
250 and 400 tonnes. Typical dimensions are 4.2 m in diameter and 10 m in length
with recent design increasing up to 4.9 m in diameter (GeorgeeKennedy & Mackey,
2019). Air and hydrocarbon ﬂowrates into reﬁning furnaces are slow, to provide precise
control of copper composition. Flows of injected air per tuyere will vary depending on
the use of pure air or a mixture of air and hydrocarbons for deoxidation. Only w2
tuyeres are used (Fig. 12.3, Table 12.2). Gas ﬂowrates are 6e13 Nm3/min per tuyere
at 4e5 bar pressure.
Figure 12.3 Detail of anode furnace tuyere. Note the two concentric pipes separated by castable
refractory which permit easy replacement of the inside pipe as it wears back. The inside pipe
protrudes into the molten copper to prevent seepage of gas back through the refractory wall of
the furnace. ((McKerrow and Pannell, 1972) Gaseous deoxidation of anode copper at the Noranda
smelter. Canadian Metallurgical Quarterly, 11, 629e633.)

For the removal of impurities, tuyeres are also used for ﬂux injection (Carrasco et al.,
2003). Typical sodium carbonate ﬂuxing requirements for removal of impurities have
been discussed by Alvear et al., 1999. While Coursol et al. (2013) evaluated using molten
calcium/sodium sulfates/arsenates salts for removal of arsenic. This last method was

authors given the importance of safely slag arsenic, minimizing slag generation and cop-

content in the molten copper to ensure proper As/(Sb þ As) molar rates for the electro-

Fire reﬁning (S and O removal) and anode casting
317

Reﬁning a 250 tonne charge of blister copper (0.03% S) takes up to 3 h: w1 h for air
injection (S removal) and w2 h for hydrocarbon injection (O removal). High sulfur
copper from direct-to-copper smelting and continuous converting takes up to 5 h to
reﬁne (Ramachandran et al., 2003). In the case of high sulfur blister copper, the reﬁning
process could take up to 24 h for a 400 tonne charge, including ﬁlling the furnace
(Shibazaki, Shimizu & Oguma, 1991). Recent developments for reducing this time
include innovative techniques such as coherent jet burners and use of agitation by porous
plugs (Enriquez et al., 2018; Vukovic & Gamweger, 2014).
A typical sequence in rotary furnace reﬁning is as follows:
(a) Molten copper is delivered by crane and ladle from converters to the anode furnace
until it is ﬁlled to its capacity (200e400 tonnes),
(b) The accumulated charge is then desulfurized to w0.003% S by blowing air into the
molten copper,
(c) Addition of ﬂuxes as required, depending on the targeted anode composition, fol-
lowed by skimming, and
(d) The copper is deoxidized by blowing gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons into the
molten copper bath.
Hydrocarbon blowing is terminated when the oxygen concentration has been lowered
tow0.16% O, as detected with disposable solid electrolyte probes (HeraeuseElectro-Nite,
2019) or by examination of copper test blocks. Copper with this oxygen content sets ﬂat
when it is cast into anodes.
12.1.2 Hearth furnace reﬁning (Alarcon, 2005)
Although the rotary furnace dominates copper ﬁre reﬁning in primary smelters, second-
ary (scrap) smelters tend to use hearth-reﬁning furnaces (Hanusch, 2010; Rinnhofer &
Zulehner, 2005). They are better for melting scrap and other solid inputs. Sulfur is
removed by reaction of the copper solids with an oxidizing ﬂame above the bath and
by injecting air through submerged tip steel lances and/or tuyeres. Deoxidation is also
done by injecting hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons plus steam using the same type of
injecting devices.
Some anode furnaces inject nitrogen into the molten copper through small holes in
porous ceramic plugs in the bottom of the furnace (Filzwieser et al., 2003). The injected
nitrogen stirs the molten copper and gives it uniform composition and temperature during
ﬁre reﬁning and anode casting. This homogenization (a) minimizes solid slag buildups in
otherwise cool parts of the anode furnace (Lee et al., 2003) and (b) produces uniform
anode composition throughout an entire cast of anodes. Beneﬁt (a) has been crucial in
several smelters. Fig. 12.1 shows a typical arrangement of porous plugs in an anode furnace.
12.2 Chemistry of ﬁre reﬁning
Two chemical systems are involved in ﬁre reﬁning: (a) the CueOeS system (sulfur
removal) and (b) the CueCeHeO system (oxygen removal).
318
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

12.2.1 Sulfur removal: the CueOeS system
The main reaction for removing sulfur from molten copper with air at 1200 C is as
follows:
[S] þ O2(g) / SO2(g)
(12.1)
while oxygen dissolves in the copper by the reaction:
O2 (g) / 2[O] (in molten copper, 1200C)
(12.2)
The equilibrium relationship between gaseous oxygen entering the molten copper
and S in the molten copper is from Eq. (12.1):
K ¼ pSO2=

%SO2  pSO2

(12.3)
where K is about 10⁶ at 1200C (Engh, 1992).
The large value of this equilibrium constant indicates that even at the end of desulfur-
ization (w0.003 %S; pO2 w0.21 bar), SO2 formation is strongly favored (i.e., pSO2 >
1 bar) and S is still being eliminated. Also, oxygen is still dissolving.
12.2.2 Oxygen removal: the CueCeHeO system
The oxygen concentration in the newly desulfurized molten copper is w0.3 mass % O.
Most of this dissolved O would precipitate as solid Cu2O inclusions during casting
(Brandes & Brook, 1998), so it must be removed to a low level.
Copper oxide precipitation is minimized by removing most of the oxygen from the
molten copper with injected gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons. Representative oxygen
removal reactions are the following:
H2C (s,l,g) þ 2[O] / H2O (g) þ CO (g)
(12.4)
CO (g) þ [O] / CO2 (g)
(12.5)
H2 (g) þ [O] / H2O (g)
(12.6)
where [O] denotes dissolved oxygen.
12.3 Choice of hydrocarbon for deoxidation
The universal choice for removing S from copper is air. Many different hydrocarbons are
used for O removal, but natural gas, oil, liquid petroleum gas, and propane/butane are
favored (Ramachandran et al., 2003).
Gas and liquid hydrocarbons are injected into the copper through the same tuyeres
used for air injection. Natural gas is blown in directly, sometimes with steam (Talvensaari,
2015). Liquid petroleum gas, propane, and butane are blown in after vaporization. Oil is
atomized and blown in with steam.
Fire reﬁning (S and O removal) and anode casting
319

Oxygen removal typically requires w5 kg of gas or liquid hydrocarbons per tonne of
copper (Ramachandran et al., 2003). This is about twice the stoichiometric requirement,
assuming that the products of the reaction are CO and H2O.
12.4 Minor metals removal
Chapters 4 through 9 indicate that signiﬁcant fractions of the impurities entering a
smelter end up in the metallic copper. The ﬁre reﬁning procedures described above
do not remove these impurities to a signiﬁcant extent. The impurities report mostly to
the anodes.
As long as impurity levels in the anodes are not excessive, electroreﬁning and electro-
lyte puriﬁcation keep the impurities in the cathode copper product at low levels. With
excessively impure blister copper, however, it can be advantageous to eliminate a portion
of the impurities during ﬁre reﬁning (Carrasco et al., 2003; Larouche et al., 2003). The
process entails adding appropriate ﬂuxes during the oxidation stage of ﬁre reﬁning. The
ﬂux may be blown into the copper through the reﬁning furnace tuyeres or it may be
added prior to charging the copper to the furnace.
Antimony and arsenic are removed from molten copper in the anode furnace by ﬂux-
ing with alkaline ﬂuxes such Na2CO3, CaCO3, and CaO (Alvear et al., 1999; Carrasco
et al., 2003; Larouche et al., 2003). Removals up to 90% are obtained. Lead, on the other
hand, is removed from molten anode furnace copper by adding a combination of SiO2
ﬂux and fayalite slag. This was practiced extensively by the Timmins smelter, now shut
(Newman et al., 1991), and Caletones (Carrasco et al., 2003). About 75% removal was
obtained.
12.4.1 Fundamentals of minor element removal
Most of the minor metals contained in molten copper have a high oxygen afﬁnity and
therefore are more stable in their oxide form during the oxidation process. Addition
of appropriate ﬂuxes allows the formation of complex oxides as part of molten slag struc-
tures. Removal of these molten slags is accomplished by skimming from the surface of the
molten bath.
The oxidation of an impurity X in molten copper can be represented by the
following chemical reaction:
Xðin copperÞ þ ðy=4ÞO2 ¼ XOy=2
(12.7)
The distribution ratio of X, LX, which is deﬁned by (%X in the slag)/[ %X in metal ],
can be evaluated from the following expression:
LX h ð%X in slagÞ
½%X in metalhK12:7$ðnTÞ$gX$pv=4
O2
½nT$gXOv=2
(12.8)
320
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

where K(12.7) is the equilibrium constant of the oxidation reaction of the impurity X,
deﬁned by Eq. (12.7), [nT] and (nT) are the molar amount of 100 g metal and slag,
respectively, gX is the Raoultian activity coefﬁcient of component i, and pO2 is the
standardized oxygen partial pressure at the slagemetal interface.
As discussed by (Fujisawa, Alvear Flores, Shimpo, & Yamauchi, 1997), to achieve a
high impurity removal, a high distribution ratio is required. Higher values of K(13.7),
pO2, and gX as well as lower values of gXOv=4 are, therefore, preferable.
The oxidizing reﬁning ability of minor elements can be deﬁned by the following
expression derived from the oxidation reaction of an element X in molten copper (Alvear
et al., 1999):
AX ¼ Kð13:7Þ$gX$pv=4
O2
(12.9)
where K(12.7) is the equilibrium constant of the oxidation reaction of the impurity X,
deﬁned by Eq. (12.7), gX is the Raoultian activity coefﬁcient of component X, and
pO2 is the standardized oxygen partial pressure at the slagemetal interface. Based on
Eq. (12.9), the reﬁning ability of minor metals was calculated under conditions of
oxygen saturation and is presented in Fig. 12.4. A large oxidizing reﬁning ability index
represents a more impurity oxide and therefore a smaller deportment of that particular
element to the molten copper phase.

321

12.5 Casting anodes
The ﬁnal product of ﬁre reﬁning is molten copper, w0.003% S, 0.16% O, 1200C, ready
for casting as anodes. Virtually, all copper anodes are cast in open anode shaped impres-
sions on the top of ﬂat copper molds. 16e32 such molds are placed on a large horizontal
rotating wheel (Fig. 12.5, Table 12.2). The wheel is rotated to bring a mold under the
copper stream from the anode furnace where it rests while the anode is being poured
(Figs. 12.5 and 12.6 and Fig 1.8 (Chapter 1)) . When the anode impression is full, the
Figure 12.5 Anode casting wheel. The molten copper is poured at 10 o’clock on the wheel. The so-
lidiﬁed anodes are lifted out of the molds at 7 o’clock on the wheel. The mass of copper in the ladles is
sensed by load cells. The sensors automatically control the mass of each copper pour without inter-
rupting copper ﬂow from the anode furnace. The anode molds are copper, usually cast at the smelter,
occasionally machined into a cast copper block. (Photograph courtesy of Miguel Palacios, Atlantic
Copper, Huelva, Spain.)

wheel is rotated to bring a new mold into casting position and so on. Spillage of copper
between the molds during rotation is avoided by placing one or two tiltable ladles be-
tween the reﬁning furnace and casting wheel. Most casting wheels operate automatically,
but with devoted human supervision.
The newly poured anodes are cooled by spraying water on the tops and bottoms of
the molds while the wheel rotates (Edens & Hannemann, 2005). They are stripped from
their molds (usually by an automatic raising pin and lifting machine) after a 3/4 rotation.
The empty molds are then sprayed with a barite water wash (30 vol.-% barite, 70% water)
to prevent sticking of the next anode (Wenzl et al., 2007b). Excessive levels of barite will
negatively impact the quality of the anode and the further processing of anode slimes
from the electroreﬁning process.
Casting rates are w50e100 tonnes of anodes per hour (Ramachandran et al., 2003).
The limitation is the rate at which heat can be extracted from the solidifying/cooling an-
odes. The ﬂow of copper from the reﬁning furnace is adjusted to match the casting rate
by rotating the taphole up or down (rotary furnace) or by blocking or opening a tapping
notch (hearth furnace). New anode casting installations cast their anodes in pairs to speed
up casting rates (Alarcon, 2005; Outotec, 2013).
12.5.1 Anode molds
The molds into which anodes are cast are always copper. They are usually made by
(a) casting molten anode copper (occasionally cathode copper; Wenzl et al., 2007b)
into large 1.2 m  1.2 m open molds, then (b) pressing an anode-shaped die into the sur-
face of the molten copper. The mold and die are both steel. The die is water cooled.
Several methods have been tested and reported to ensure large mold life (Edens &
Hannemann, 2005). According to the authors, a major step in increasing copper anode
mold life was the development of milled molds of continuous cast copper using phos-
phorus deoxidized copper.
Machining gives a smooth, crack-free surface to the anode shape, considerably
increasing the number of anodes that can be cast before the mold surface deteriorates.
In all cases, the anode molds shall be perfectly leveled on the casting wheel, to ensure
that the anode faces are exactly parallel.
12.5.2 Anode uniformity
The most important aspect of anode casting, besides ﬂat surfaces, is uniformity of thick-
ness. This uniformity ensures that all the anodes in an electroreﬁning cell reach the end of
their useful life at the same time. Automatic control of the mass of each pour of copper
(i.e., the mass and thickness of each anode) is now used in most plants (Moats et al., 2007).
Fire reﬁning (S and O removal) and anode casting
323

The usual practice is to sense the mass of metal poured from a tiltable ladle, using load
cells in the ladle supports as sensors. Anode mass is normally 360e410 kg. Anode-to-
anode mass variation in a smelter or reﬁnery is 2e4 kg with automatic weight control.
Recent anode designs have incorporated (a) knife-edged lugs which make the anode
hang vertically in the electrolytic cell and (b) thin tops where the anode is not submerged
(i.e., where it remains undissolved during reﬁning). The latter feature decreases the
amount of undissolved anode scrap which must be recycled when the anode is
electoreﬁned.
12.5.3 Anode preparation
Anode ﬂatness, uniformity, and verticality are critical in obtaining good electroreﬁnery
performance. For this reason, most reﬁneries treat their anodes in an automated anode
preparation machine to improve ﬂatness and verticality (Outotec, 2018). The machine
(a) weighs the anodes and directs underweight and overweight anodes to remelting
(b) straightens the lugs and machines a knife edge on each lug (for vertical hanging)
(c) presses the anodes ﬂat with a full body press
(d) loads the anodes in a spaced rack for dropping into an electroreﬁning cell.
Inclusion of these anode preparation steps has resulted in increased reﬁning rates,
improved cathode purities, and decreased electroreﬁning energy consumption.
12.6 Continuous anode casting (Hazelett, 2019)
A schematic view of the Hazelett continuous casting of anodes is shown in Fig. 12.7. The
technology is being used by several smelters/reﬁneries. The advantages of the Hazelett
system over mold-on-wheel casting are uniformity of anode product and a high degree
of mechanization/automation.
Fig. 12.8 shows the Hazelett process schematics. Copper is poured at a controlled rate
(30e100 tonnes per hour) from a ladle into the gap between two moving water-cooled
low-carbon steel belts. The product is an anode thickness continuous strip of copper
moving at 4e6 m/min (Fig. 12.8, Table 12.3). The thickness of the strip is controlled
by adjusting the gap between the belts. The width of the strip is determined by adjusting
the distance between bronze or stainless steel edge blocks which move at the same speed
as the steel belts.
Recent Hazelett Contilanod casting machines have periodic machined edge blocks
into which copper ﬂows to form anode support lugs (Fig. 12.7). The lug shape is
machined half anode thickness in the top of these specialized blocks. The blocks are
machined at a 5 degrees angle to give a knife-edge support lug. Identical positioning
of the lug blocks on opposite sides of the strip is obtained by heating or cooling the
dam blocks between the specialized lug blocks.

Hazelett and SMS group.)

Fire reﬁning (S and O removal) and anode casting
325

The caster produces a copper strip with regularly spaced anode lugs. Individual anodes
are produced from this strip by a traveling hydraulic shear. Details of the operation are
given by Hazelett (2019). Adoption of the process seems to have stopped, probably
because copper ﬁre reﬁning (hence anode casting) is not usually not completely
continuous.
12.7 New anodes from rejects and anode scrap
Smelters and reﬁneries reject 2%e3% of their new anodes because of physical defects or
incorrect masses. They also produce 12%e20% undissolved anode scrap after a
completed electroreﬁning cycle (Moats et al., 2007). These two materials are remelted
and cast into fresh anodes for feeding back to the electroreﬁnery. The postreﬁning scrap
is thoroughly washed before remelting.
The reject and scrap anodes are often melted in the smelter PeirceeSmith converters.
There is, however, an increasing tendency to melt them in Asarco-type shaft furnaces
(Chapter 19) in the electroreﬁnery itself. The Asarco shaft furnace is fast and energy efﬁ-
cient for this purpose. Sulfur and oxygen concentrations in the product copper are kept at
normal anode levels by using low sulfur fuel and by adjusting the O2/fuel ratio in the
Asarco furnace burners.
Antimony and arsenic are removed from molten copper in the anode furnace by ﬂux-
ing with alkaline ﬂuxes such Na2CO3, CaCO3, and CaO (Carrasco et al., 2003;
Larouche et al., 2003). Removals up to 90% are obtained. Lead, on the other hand, is
removed from molten anode furnace copper by adding SiO2 ﬂux. This was practiced
extensively by the Timmins smelter for anode production, now shut (Newman et al.,
1991). Caletones smelter also used this technique to produce pyroreﬁned copper
(Carrasco et al., 2003). About 75% removal was obtained.
12.8 Summary
The ﬁnal step in Cu pyrometallurgical processing is casting of ﬂat, thin anodes for electro-
reﬁning. The anodes must be strong and smooth surfaced for efﬁcient electroreﬁningd
bubbles or blisters of SO2 are unacceptable.
Blister formation is prevented by removing sulfur and oxygen from molten copper by
air oxidation then hydrocarbon reduction. The air and hydrocarbons are usually injected
into the molten copper via one or two submerged tuyeres in a rotary anode furnace. Mi-
nor elements can be removed to the required standards deﬁned by each particular tank
house operation, by the addition of appropriate ﬂuxes.
326
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Anodes are virtually always cast in open molds on a large horizontal rotating wheel.
Uniformity of anode mass is critical for efﬁcient electroreﬁning so most smelters automat-
ically weigh the amount of copper that is poured into each anode mold. The molds are
also carefully leveled on the wheel to give parallel anode faces.
The cast anodes are often straightened and ﬂattened in automated anode preparation
machines. Their lugs may also be machined to a knife edge. Uniform, straight, ﬂat, verti-
cally hung anodes give pure cathodes, high productivity, and efﬁcient energy use in the
electroreﬁnery.

CHAPTER 13
Electrolytic reﬁning
Almost all copper is treated by an electrolytic process during its production from ore. It is
either electroreﬁned from impure copper anodes or electrowon from leach/solvent
extraction (SX) solutions. Considerable copper scrap is also electroreﬁned. This chapter
describes electroreﬁning. Electrowinning is discussed in Chapter 16. Approximately 75%
of world cathode copper is produced by electroreﬁning (International Copper Study
Group, 2017).
Electroreﬁning entails
(a) electrochemically dissolving copper from impure copper anodes into an electrolyte
containing CuSO4 and H2SO4;
(b) selectively electroplating pure copper from this electrolyte without the anode impurities.
Electroreﬁning serves two purposes:
(a) it produces copper essentially free of impurities;
(b) it separates valuable impurities (e.g., gold and silver) from copper for recovery as
byproducts.
Copper anodes with a typical purity of 98.5%e99.5% Cu are electroreﬁned to pro-
duce cathodes with a purity of >99.997% Cu. Electroreﬁned copper, melted and cast,
contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) impurities; the oxygen content is controlled
at 0.018%e0.025%.
Table 13.1 presents industrial ranges of copper anode and cathode compositions and
the purity requirements for copper cathode to be sold as Grade A quality on the London
Metal Exchange and New York Mercantile Exchange (Comex) (LME, 2021). Figs. 13.1
and 13.2 show a typical ﬂow sheet and a modern industrial electroreﬁning plant,
respectively.
13.1 The electroreﬁning process
An electrical potential is applied between a copper anode and a metal cathode in an elec-
trolyte containing CuSO4 and H2SO4. The following processes occur:
(a) Copper is electrochemically dissolved from the anode into the electrolyte, producing
copper cations plus electrons:
Cu0
anode/Cu2þ þ 2e
E0 ¼ 0.34 V
(13.1)
(b) The electrons produced by Reaction (13.1) are conducted toward the cathode
through the external circuit and power supply.

(c) The Cu2þ cations in the electrolyte migrate to the cathode by convection and
diffusion.
(d) The electrons and Cu2þ ions recombine at the cathode surface to form copper metal
(without the anode impurities):
Cu2þ þ 2e/Cu0
cathode
E0 ¼ þ0.34 V
(13.2)
Overall copper electroreﬁning is the sum of Reactions (13.1) and (13.2):
Cu0
impure/Cu0
pure
E0 ¼ 0.0 V
(13.3)
In practice, resistance to current ﬂow must be overcome by applying a potential be-
tween the anode and cathode. Small overvoltages must also be applied to plate copper on
the cathode (w0.05 V) and dissolve copper from the anode (w0.1 V). There are also
ohmic drops
across
the
electrolyte
(0.11e0.13 V)
and the
electrical
contacts
(0.04e0.08 V) (Nicol, 2006). Applied industrial anodeecathode potentials are typically
about 0.3 V (Moats et al., 2019).
The impurities in the anodes do not dissolve or are not plated at the cathode, so the
purity of the copper plated onto the cathodes is much higher than that of the anode start-
ing material.

13.2 Chemistry of electroreﬁning and behavior of anode impurities
The principal impurities in copper anodes are Ag, As, Au, Bi, Co, Fe, Ni, O, Pb, S, Sb,
Se, and Te (Table 13.1) (Noguchi et al., 1992). As lower grade and more complex copper
ores are processed, the complexity of the anode composition also increases (Alvear Flores
et al., 2020). Similarly, reprocessing and recycling of copper scrap contribute to the
increasing variety and concentrations of impurity elements that can be present. These el-
ements must be prevented from entering the cathode copper. Their behavior is governed
by their position in the electrochemical series (Table 13.2). At the anode, elements with

less positive reduction potentials than Cu dissolve under the applied potential; elements
with more positive reduction potentials remain in solid form. At the cathode, elements
with more positive reduction potentials deposit preferentially, while elements with more
negative potentials will remain in solution. The relative deportments of the various im-
purity elements present in the anode are shown in Table 13.3.
13.2.1 Au, Ag, and platinum-group metals
Gold and the platinum-group metals (PGMs: Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, Ru, Os) do not dissolve in
sulfate electrolyte, so they cannot plate at the cathode. They form solid slimes that adhere
to the anode surface or fall to the bottom of the electrolytic cell. These slimes are peri-
odically collected and processed for byproduct recovery (Chen & Dutrizac, 2004; Chen
& Dutrizac, 2007; Hait et al., 2009).
Silver is often present with Cu in recycled electronic scrap, so increasing amounts are
present in cast anodes. Ag dissolves to a small extent in the electrolyte and is more noble
than Cu (Table 13.2), so any Agþ present in solution will be reduced and codeposited at
the cathode. Cathode copper typically contains 8e10 ppm (g/t) silver. Fortunately, silver
is a rather benign impurity in copper.
13.2.2 Se and Te
Selenium and tellurium are present in anodes mainly as compounds with copper and sil-
ver and do not dissolve in CuSO4eH2SO4 electrolyte. They enter the slimes in these
bound forms, e.g., Cu2(Se,Te), Ag2(Se,Te), CuAg(Se,Te) (Artzer et al., 2018; Chen &
Dutrizac, 2003; Chen & Dutrizac, 2007; Ramírez, Ríos, & Martín, 2007).

13.2.3 Pb and Sn
Lead and tin are present in electronic solder, so are increasingly present in copper anodes
as a consequence of increased recycling of electronic scrap. Lead is present in the anode in
solid solution with copper and as a secondary complex oxide phase along grain bound-
aries. Most lead dissolves from the anode and forms PbSO4 by precipitation. Tin
forms SnO2 on the anode. Both of these compounds are sparingly soluble and report
to the slimes.
13.2.4 As, Bi, Co, Fe, Ni, S, and Sb
As, Bi, Co, Fe, Ni, S, and Sb dissolve extensively in the electrolyte; however, Cu plates at
a lower applied potential than these elements (Table 13.2) so they remain in the electro-
lyte. Their presence in cathode copper is due to entrapment of electrolyte or slime par-
ticles (Atenas & Mu~noz, 2007; Beauchemin et al., 2008; Chen & Dutrizac, 2000; Möller,
Friedrich, & Bayanmunkh, 2010; Rodrigues Bravo, 2007; Santos Moraes, 2007). To
avoid excessive buildup of these elements in the electrolyte and contamination of the
cathodes, they are continuously removed from a bleed of the electrolyte stream
(Fig. 13.1).
Of particular importance are As, Sb, and Bi. These elements affect anode passivation
and cathode quality (see Section 13.6.3, Moats et al., 2016; Wesstrom, 2014). The
presence of arsenic in the anode inhibits passivation and prevents the formation of
ﬂoating slimes. Sb and Bi are precipitated into the slimes layer by maintaining high
levels of As in the electrolyte. Most reﬁneries intentionally keep the As levels high,
sometimes employing anode doping to add As to the anode, to maintain a molar ratio
of As/(Sb þ Bi) > 2 in the anode to assist in controlling Sb and Bi (Moats et al.,
2019). As can also be added directly to the electrolyte (Xiao et al., 2012). Doping of
Pb into the anode to maintain a Pb/As ratio >1.5 assists in agglomerating anode slimes,
causing them to sink to the bottom of the cells and preventing cathode contamination
(Zeng et al., 2016).
Ni at concentrations greater than 2000 ppm can form nickel oxide particles within
the anode. Ni can also form an oxide phase called kupferglimmer (Cu3Ni2xSbO6x,
where x ¼ 0.1e0.2) at high concentrations and in the presence of Sb and/or Sn. NiO
and kupferglimmer do not dissolve rapidly and report to the slimes. High concentrations
of Ni in the electrolyte cause passivation and detrimental affect current efﬁciency (Sado,
Ueno, Watanabe, & Takebayashi, 2019; Tetsuka & Okamoto, 2019).
13.2.5 O
Oxygen occurs in the anode as various oxides, with Cu2O being the most prevalent.
Cu2O dissolves chemically (not electrochemically) due to the high acidity of the electro-
lyte. The dissolution rate of an anode is therefore greater than would be predicted from
Faraday’s Law (see Section 16.3). This results in a buildup of copper in the electrolyte and
requires a bleed of electrolyte for decopperization in liberator cells (Section 13.9).
336
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

13.2.6 Slimes
The impurity elements that do not dissolve in the electrolyte, along with w2% of dis-
solved copper that does not plate, form anode slimes that drop to the bottom of the
cell. The quantity, morphology, pore structure, and adhesion properties of the slimes
can affect mass-transfer processes at the anodeeelectrolyte interface by retarding diffusion
of Cu2þ ions near the anode surface (Moats & Hiskey, 2010). This can cause precipitation
of CuSO4$5H2O on the anode surface and its passivation. Cathode copper becomes
contaminated by entrapment of slime particles in the depositing copper as the deposit
grows. Recovery of slimes from the cells and their treatment for recovery of precious
metals and other specialty metals (such as Bi, Te, and Se) can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
the proﬁtability of a reﬁnery (Section 13.10).
13.3 Equipment
Industrial electroreﬁning uses large (w1  1 m) thin (40e50 mm) anodes and thin
(1e10 mm) cathodes interleaved approximately 50 mm apart in a cell ﬁlled with electro-
lyte (Fig. 13.3). The anodes in the cell are all at the same potential; the cathodes are all at a
lower potential. Power is provided by a rectiﬁer. Anodes and cathodes are evenly spaced
along the cell to ensure an even distribution of current to all electrodes.
The process is continuous until electrodes are loaded or unloaded from the cells. Elec-
trolyte containing CuSO4 and H2SO4 continuously enters at the bottom end of each cell.
It leaves the cells (slightly less pure) by continuously overﬂowing the opposite end of the
cell into an electrolyte collection system. Anodes continuously dissolve and pure copper
continuously plates on the cathodes.
13.3.1 Anodes
The impure copper anodes are cast at a smelter or at the reﬁnery itself (Fig. 13.4A), as
described in Chapter 12. They are typically 4e5 cm thick, with a mass of 300e400 kg
(Fig. 13.4B). The starting masses of the anodes should be very similar so that they all
dissolve at the same rate. The anodes slowly become thinner as the copper dissolves
into the electrolyte. Once they reach 15%e20% of their original mass (after a typical elec-
troreﬁning time of 21 days), they are removed before they break up and fall into the cell.
This anode scrap is washed free of slimes, dried, remelted, and cast into new anodes.
Anode casting and preparation are critical to ensuring that they dissolve evenly and
that cathodes of optimum purity are produced. Anode preparation machines are now
widely used in the industry. These allow cast anodes to be weighed, straightened, and
the lugs machined automatically to ensure good electrical contact with the busbars.
Electrolytic reﬁning
337

13.3.2 Cathodes
Modern reﬁneries use stainless-steel blanks as the starting cathode. This is a stainless steel
sheet welded to copper support bars (Fig. 13.4C). Copper is electrodeposited onto these
cathodes for 7e10 days. The copper-plated cathodes are then removed from the cell and
replaced with fresh steel blanks.
The copper-plated cathodes are washed with hot water to remove electrolyte. The
copper deposits (30e80 kg on each side of the blank) are machine-stripped from the
stainless steel. These are packed, strapped, and sent to market (Fig. 13.5) or melted
and cast into wire, rod, or other ﬁnal product. The stripped blanks are washed and
returned to the reﬁning cells. It may be necessary to polish the stainless steel surface to
maintain its smoothness and avoid plated copper sticking onto rough patches.
The blanks are usually ﬂat, cold- and bright-rolled 316L stainless steel, w3 mm thick.
Electrodeposited copper attaches quite ﬁrmly to this surface so that it does not accidently
detach during reﬁning. The vertical edges of the blanks are covered with tight-ﬁtting

polymer edge strips (see Fig. 13.4C) that prevent copper from depositing completely
around the cathode and allow removal of the electroreﬁned copper plates from the stain-
less steel. The base of the blank is machined to a sharp-edged V groove to allow for easy
detachment of the plated copper.
Older reﬁneries use thin copper “starter sheet” cathodes, hung by starter-sheet loops on
copper support bars. These are thin sheets of copper that have been plated onto titanium
or stainless steel, stripped, ﬂattened, and then hanger bars are attached (Fig. 13.4D). These
cathodes have higher mechanical stresses than stainless-steel blanks and have a tendency
to warp. They are often embossed to improve rigidity (Nicol, 2006). They need to be
removed after about 2 days of plating to be straightened in presses and then returned
to the cells. Use of these cathodes therefore makes reﬁnery management more
difﬁcult. They also have a tendency to more frequent short-circuiting, which reduces
cathode quality.
Many reﬁneries (especially in Europe, North America, and Asia where labor costs are
high) have switched from this older technology to stainless-steel blanks. In 2019, approx-
imately 70% of reﬁneries used permanent cathode technology (Moats et al., 2019): Glencore
Technology (the IsaKidd process) and Multotec Outotec supply this reﬁnery tankhouse
technology (Pranowo, Aslin, Eriksson, & Heferen, 2019). A lower average labor require-
ment per tonne of cathode is reported for tankhouses using permanent cathode technol-
ogy, compared with those that use starter sheets (Moats et al., 2019). This technology also
allows use of higher current densities (w320 A/m2, compared with about 280 A/m2 for
starter sheets), higher current efﬁciency (96.2% vs. 95.3%) (Moats et al., 2019), as well as
better cathode quality, higher productivity, and lower operational costs.
13.3.3 Cells
Industrial reﬁning cells are typically about 6 m long. They are wide and deep enough
(w1.1  1.3 m) to accommodate the anodes and cathodes with 0.1e0.2 m underneath.
Modern cells are designed with adequate height between the bottom of the electrodes
and the cell ﬂoor to minimize contamination of the cathode from slimes that fall to
the base of the cell. Each cell typically contains about 60 anodeecathode pairs connected
in parallel.
Modern cells are made of precast polymer concrete. These are usually cast with built-
in structural supports, electrolyte distributors, and drains, which are advantageous for
ﬁtting them into the tankhouse infrastructure.
13.3.4 Electrical components
The cells are connected electrically in series to form sections of 20e40 cells. Each section
can be electrically isolated for inserting and removing anodes and cathodes and for clean-
ing and maintenance. The number of cells in each section is chosen to maximize the ef-
ﬁciency of these operations.
340
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The electrical connection between cells is made by connecting the cathodes of one
cell to the anodes of the adjacent cell. The connection is made by seating the cathodes
of one cell and the anodes of the next cell on a common copper distributor bar or busbar
(Fig. 13.3). Good contacts between the anodes, cathodes, and distributor bar are essential
to minimize energy loss and ensure uniform current distribution to all electrodes.
Electroreﬁning requires direct voltage and current. These are obtained by converting
commercial alternating current to direct current at the reﬁnery. Silicon-controlled recti-
ﬁers are used.
13.4 Typical reﬁning cycle
Production electroreﬁning begins by installing anodes and cathodes into the empty cells
of a freshly cleaned section of the reﬁnery. They are precisely spaced in a rack and
brought to each cell by crane. This process is usually completely automated. The cells
are then ﬁlled with electrolyte and connected to the power supply. Electrolyte ﬂows
continuously in and out of the cells. The anodes begin to dissolve and pure copper begins
to plate on the cathodes.
Each anode is electroreﬁned until about 80%e85% of the mass has dissolved. Two or
three cathode plating cycles are produced from a single anode. Each copper cathode typi-
cally weighs 50e160 kg. This multicathode plating cycle ensures that cathodes do not
grow too close to the slime-covered anodes and become contaminated. Copper-
loaded cathodes are removed from the cells after 7e10 days of plating and a new rack
of stainless-steel blanks is inserted.
The copper-plated cathodes are removed and washed to remove electrolyte and
slimes. The plated copper is then machine-stripped from the stainless-steel blanks,
sampled, and stacked for shipping, typically in batches of 2.5 t. Cathodes produced
from starter sheets are handled similarly but do not require stripping. A robotic stripping
machine in a modern reﬁnery is shown in Fig. 13.6.

Electrolytic reﬁning
341

Electrolyte is then drained from the cell (through an elevated standpipe), the anodes
and cell walls are hosed down with water, and the slimes are drained from the bottom of
the cell. The drained electrolyte is sent to ﬁltration and storage prior to being returned to
the cells for the next anode reﬁning cycle. The slimes are sent to a Cu and byproduct
metal recovery plant (Section 13.10).
The cells are inspected regularly during reﬁning to locate short-circuited anodee
cathode pairs. The inspection is done using infrared scanners, gauss meters, and cell
voltageemonitoring systems to locate “hot” electrodes.
Short circuits are caused by nonvertical electrodes, bent cathodes, or nodular cathode
growths between anodes and cathodes. Shorts waste electrical current and lead to impure
copper, due to settling of slimes on nodules and nonvertical cathode surfaces. Shorts are
eliminated by straightening the electrodes and removing the nodules (see Section 13.7).
13.5 Electrolyte
Copper reﬁning electrolytes typically contain 40e50 g/L Cu, 170e200 g/L H2SO4,
10e20 g/L Ni, up to 20 g/L As, and various impurities (Table 13.4). The nature and
concentration of the impurities can vary quite widely, depending on the anode compo-
sition, which, in turn, depends on the feed to the smelter (Table 13.1).
Conductivity of the electrolyte increases with increasing H2SO4 concentration, but
decreases with increasing Cu and Ni concentrations (Price & Davenport, 1981). High
conductivity improves energy efﬁciency, but higher acid concentration also increases
corrosion in the tankhouse. Too high a Cu concentration may lead to passivation of
the anodes (see Section 13.6.3) and increase viscosity of the electrolyte. This, in turn,
can increase the solids in suspension and consequently reduce cathode purity due to
incorporation of impurity particles into the copper cathode as it plates.
Table 13.4 Compositions of copper reﬁning electrolytes (Moats et al., 2019). Impurity levels
can be removed to lower levels than shown, but at extra cost. Each reﬁnery chooses its
impurity levels to give high-purity marketable cathode copper at minimum cost.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The incoming electrolyte is heated by steam to 60e65C to improve conductivity
and mass transfer: it leaves the cell about 2C cooler (Moats et al., 2019). Electrolyte is
circulated through each cell at w1.2 m3/h. At this ﬂowrate, the electrolyte in
each cell is completely replaced within a few hours. A steady electrolyte circulation is
essential to:
(a) bring warm puriﬁed electrolyte into the cell;
(b) ensure uniform concentrations of Cu2þ and leveling and grain-reﬁning agents across
all cathode surfaces;
(c) remove dissolved impurities from the cell.
Modern developments in electrolyte ﬂow arrangements ensure that the above require-
ments are met, even when employing high current densities, by minimizing the diffusion
boundary layer at the electrode surfaces. Operation above 400 A/m2 without loss of cath-
ode quality or current efﬁciency is now routinely achieved (Wenzl, Filzwieser, Filzwieser,
& Anzinger, 2010).
13.5.1 Electrolyte additives
Electroreﬁning practice is trending to increasingly higher current densities (Section 13.8)
to maximize production from existing reﬁneries; however, as current density is increased,
the cathode deposits become rougher with plating time and uneven surfaces are created.
Impurities from the electrolyte and slimes produced at the anode adsorb onto the deposit
and become encapsulated in the deposit as it grows. Under these conditions, passivation
of the anodes is promoted (see Section 13.6.3).
To counteract these effects, deposition of smooth, dense, pure copper is promoted by
adding leveling and grain-reﬁning agents to the electrolyte (De Maere & Winand, 1995;
Hiskey, 2019; Wang & O’Keefe, 1984). Without these, the cathode deposits would be
dendritic and soft, and have lower purity.
13.5.1.1 Leveling agents
The principal leveling agents are protein colloid “bone glues” (Fig. 13.7A). All copper
reﬁneries use these glues, added at a concentration of 50e140 g per tonne of cathode copper
(Moats et al., 2019). The glues consist of large protein molecules (MW 10 000e30 000)
Figure 13.7 (a) Structure of glue molecules, comprising a series of amino acids linked together into a
large protein structure, and (b) mechanism of action of glue as a leveling agent.
Electrolytic reﬁning
343

that form large cations in the electrolyte. The glue exerts its leveling action by electrodepo-
siting large protein molecules at the negatively charged tips of rapidly growing copper grains
(Fig. 13.7B). This creates an electrically resistant barrier at the tips of the protruding crystals
and encourages further copper deposition sideways and in the “valleys” between the
protrusions. The net result is dense and level growth of the copper crystals on the cathode
surface.
A practical issue associated with tankhouse management is that glue decomposes
within 1.5e2 h at high temperatures and high acidity, and its degradation is catalyzed
by H2SO4. It is therefore essential to constantly monitor the glue concentration in the
electrolyte and ensure that it is maintained at optimum levels. Excess glue leads to rough,
striated, and brittle deposits; too low a glue concentration causes nodulation (Fig. 13.8).
The CollaMat system is widely used for measuring glue concentrations (Stantke, 2002).
13.5.1.2 Grain-reﬁning agents
The principal grain-reﬁning agents are thiourea and chloride. Avitone, a sulfonated petro-
leum liquid, is sometimes used with thiourea as a grain reﬁner.
Thiourea ((NH2)2C ¼ S) acts as a grain reﬁner by promoting the formation of new
copper nuclei and inhibiting the growth of existing crystals. Thiourea molecules adsorb
on the cathode surface and prevent crystal growth. The mechanism of action of thiourea
is believed to occur via the reduction of Cu2þ to Cuþ at the cathode surface. Thiourea
forms a cationic complex with Cuþ on the cathode surface. This promotes copper
growth with ﬁne-grained crystal morphology (Fig. 13.9). Thiourea is added to the elec-
trolyte at 60e80 g/t cathode copper. If the concentration is too high, its adsorption on
the cathode surface can lead to sulfur contamination of the cathode. Thiourea concen-
trations can be measured using the Reatrol system (Conard et al., 1990).

344
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Chloride (20e50 mg/L in electrolyte or 70e100 g/t Cu, added as HCl or NaCl) im-
proves and brightens cathode deposits when combined with organic additives. It is
believed to coadsorb with thiourea (Nakano, Oue, Fukushima, & Kobayashi, 2010;
Tantavichet et al., 2009). Chloride also acts as a grain-reﬁning agent. Too high a Cl
concentration (>50 mg/L) will promote pitting corrosion of the stainless-steel cathode
blanks.
Avitone is a proprietary hydrocarbon-based sodium sulfonate surfactant. It is used in
combination with glue at 10e30 g/t Cu to give a dense, smooth deposit on the cathode.
It also acts as a detergent, wetting oily patches on the anodes and cathodes. Too little Avi-
tone can cause slimes to adhere to the surface of the cathode, leading to entrapment of
slimes and contamination of the cathode.

rough surface created at high current density without the use of grain reﬁners and (b) the desired,

tesy of T. A. Muhlare, University of Pretoria.)

13.5.2 Electrolyte temperature
Electrolyte is heated to w65C using steam. The beneﬁcial effects of heating include
(a) increasing the solubility of CuSO4,5H2O, preventing it from crystallizing on the
anode (see Section 13.6.2);
(b) lowering the electrolyte density and viscosity (Price & Davenport, 1981), which re-
duces migration of slimes in the cell;
(c) increasing the rate of the electrochemical reactions (Eqs. 13.1 and 13.2).
Too high a temperature leads to excessive evaporation and energy consumption, and
can increase the degradation rate of organic additives.
13.5.3 Electrolyte ﬁltration
Insoluble solid particles present in the electrolyte can cause problems in electroreﬁning.
Solids can originate from breakdown of the anodes, from anode slimes, or from the mold
coating used when casting the anodes (see Chapter 20). At high viscosity, insoluble par-
ticles are suspended in the electrolyte. Solids that come into contact with the growing
crystal surface can serve as substrates for nucleation. This enhances the local growth
rate and grain roughening starts, which can initiate the growth of dendrites. Adequate
ﬁltration of the recirculating electrolyte is critical.
13.6 Maximizing cathode copper purity
The principal technical objective of electroreﬁning is to produce high-purity cathode
copper. The main factors inﬂuencing the purity of cathode copper and minimizing
contamination by impurities are
(a) chemical conditions, particularly electrolyte composition, clarity, leveling and grain-
reﬁning agent concentrations, temperature, and circulation rate;
(b) the physical arrangement of the anodes and cathodes in the electrolytic cells;
(c) electrical conditions, particularly current density;
(d) thorough washing of cathodes after electroreﬁning and their removal from the cells;
(e) controlling the impurity levels in the electrolyte by bleeding electrolyte from the
reﬁnery and removing the impurities (see Section 13.9).
13.6.1 Physical factors affecting cathode purity
Slimes particles, with their high concentrations of impurities, are kept away from the
cathodes by ensuring a smooth ﬂow of electrolyte so that slimes are not transported
from the anodes and cell bottoms to the cathodes: turbulence in the electrolyte should
be avoided. Contamination is also avoided by ﬁltering the electrolyte (especially that
from cell cleaning) before it is recycled to electroreﬁning (see Fig. 13.1).

13.6.2 Chemical factors affecting cathode purity
The chemical conditions that lead to highest-purity cathode copper are
(a) constant availability of high Cu2þ electrolyte at the cathode surface;
(b) constant availability of appropriate concentrations of leveling and grain-reﬁning
agents;
(c) uniform 65C electrolyte temperature;
(d) absence of slimes particles in the electrolyte at the cathode faces;
(e) controlled concentrations of dissolved impurities in the electrolyte;
(f) enough As in the electrolyte to prevent the formation of ﬂoating slimes and promote
precipitation of Sb and Bi in the slimes layer.
A high Cu2þ concentration (40e50 g/L) in the electrolyte and steady recirculation of
the electrolyte through the cells ensures constant availability of Cu2þ ions over the cath-
ode faces. This allows a constant rate of plating, which gives uniformity of crystal grain
size in the cathode. This is helped by maintaining constant concentrations of leveling and
grain-reﬁning agents in the electrolyte (Section 13.5.1).
13.6.3 Electrical factors affecting cathode purity
The main electrical factor affecting cathode purity is cathode current density, i.e., the rate
at which electricity is passed through the cathodes, measured in amperes per square meter
of cathode area (A/m2).
High current densities give rapid copper plating, but can cause growth of nodules and
protrusions. These can entrap slimes in the cathodes, lowering cathode purity, and can
lead to short circuiting. Excessive current density may cause anodes to passivate by pro-
ducing Cu2þ ions at the anode surface faster than they can convect away. The net result is
a high concentration of Cu2þ at the anode surface and precipitation of a coherent
CuSO4,5H2O layer on the anode (Chen & Dutrizac, 1991; Moats & Hiskey, 2010).
This CuSO4,5H2O layer isolates and electrically insulates the anode from the electrolyte
and blocks further oxidation of Cu to Cu2þ. The likelihood of passivation increases with
increasing Cu2þ, acid, and sulfate concentrations in the electrolyte (Moats & Hiskey,
2007). High levels of nickel in the anode can also cause passivation through the formation
of a similar NiSO4.mH2O layer (Doucet & Staﬁej, 2007). The problem is exacerbated if
the impurities in the anode form a coherent slimes layer (Moats & Hiskey, 2006). It is
well known that anodes that have high levels of Sb, Sn, and Pb are also readily passivated
(Atenas & Mu~noz, 2007; Mubarok et al., 2007a,b), while electrolyte additives can also
play some role (Moats & Hiskey, 2000; Nakano, Oue, Fukushima, & Kobayashi,
2010; Tantavichet et al., 2009). Arsenic is the only element known to inhibit passivation
(Moats & Hiskey, 2006).
Passivation can usually be avoided by operating at current densities below 300 A/m2,
depending on the impurities in the anode, and by maintaining the As concentration
Electrolytic reﬁning
347

above 300 ppm in the anode. Increasing the chloride content of the electrolyte can also
be helpful (Moats & Hiskey, 2000). Warm electrolyte (with its higher CuSO4,5H2O sol-
ubility) also helps. Automatic temperature control in each cell is now widely practiced
(Rantala, Larinkari, & Menese, 2009). Each reﬁnery must balance these competing eco-
nomic factors.
13.7 Minimizing energy consumption and maximizing current
efﬁciency
Cathode current efﬁciencies in modern copper electroreﬁneries range from w93%
to >98%. The unused current is wasted as anode-to-cathode short-circuits (w3%), stray
current to ground (w1%), and reoxidation of cathode copper by O2 and Fe3þ (w1%).
Short-circuiting is caused by a cathode touching an anode. This is avoided by precise,
vertical electrode placement and controlled additions of leveling and grain-reﬁning
agents to the electrolyte. Its effect is minimized by locating and immediately breaking
cathodeeanode contacts whenever they occur.
Stray current loss is largely due to current ﬂow to ground via spilled electrolyte. It is
minimized by good housekeeping around the reﬁnery.
Copper plated on the cathode can be reoxidised back into the electrolyte by the pres-
ence of oxidizing agents, such as oxygen or Fe(III). The reactions are (see Table 13.2)
Cu0 þ O2 þ 2Hþ þ 2e/Cu2þ þ H2O
(13.4)
Cu0 þ 2Fe3þ/Cu2þ þ 2Fe2þ
(13.5)
This current wastage can be avoided by minimizing oxygen absorption in the elec-
trolyte, by avoiding electrolyte turbulence, and keeping electrolyte ﬂow as smooth
and quiet as possible, while still maintaining adequate hydrodynamics for mass transfer.
The presence of Fe in the electrolyte should be avoided where possible.
Other housekeeping factors that can have a signiﬁcant impact on current efﬁciency
include
(a) ensuring even distribution of current to all electrodes;
(b) ensuring that electrical contacts are clean;
(c) ensuring that electrodes are equally spaced and hanging vertically.
The electrical power consumption of an electroreﬁnery, deﬁned as
P ¼ Total electrical energy consumed in the refinery ðkWhÞ
Total mass of cathode copper produced ðtÞ
(13.6)
is 300e400 kWh/t Cu. Power consumption is minimized by maximizing current
efﬁciency and by maintaining good electrical connections throughout the reﬁnery.
Hydrocarbon fuel is also used in an electroreﬁnerydmainly for heating electrolyte
and melting anode scrap. Electrolyte heating energy is minimized by insulating the cells,
tanks, and pipes and by covering the cells with canvas or plastic sheeting to avoid
348
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

evaporation and heat loss. Anode scrap melting energy is minimized by minimizing scrap
production, i.e., by casting thick, equal mass anodes, and by equalizing current between
all anodes and cathodes. Employing an energy-efﬁcient melting furnace will also assist in
limiting overall power consumption.
13.8 Treatment of electrolyte bleed
Reﬁneries are increasingly producing saleable and valuable byproducts from the treat-
ment of their bleed streams and anode slimes (Wesstrom, Olave, & Ramirez, 2019).
Soluble anode impurities continuously dissolve into the electrolyte (Section 13.2). To
prevent their accumulation, these are continuously removed from an electrolyte bleed
stream. As, Bi, Co, Fe, Ni, and Sb are the main impurities removed this way. Some
1%e2% of the Cu that dissolves from the anodes is not plated on the cathodes (see
Section 13.2.6) and is also removed from the electrolyte bleed stream. About
0.1e0.2 m3 of electrolyte is bled and puriﬁed per tonne of product copper.
The impurities and Cu are usually removed in three sequential steps (Hoffman, 2004;
Ríos, Ramírez, & Arbizu, 2010; Stantke & Leuprecht, 2010; Stoyanova, Nedeleva,
Sraev, Gerov, & Stoyanova, 2016):
(a) Copper is electrowon using PbeSneCa anodes and stainless steel cathodes in a series
of liberator cells, in which Cu in the electrolyte is sequentially reduced from w45 g/L
to < 1 g/L;
(b) Water is evaporated from the Cu-depleted electrolyte and NiSO4 crystals are precip-
itated from the concentrated solution. In some operations, CuSO4 may also be
recovered by evaporation and crystallization of hydrated CuSO4. Vacuum and
centrifuge technologies may be employed;
(c) As, Bi, and Sb are electrowon from the Cu-depleted electrolyte into an impure Cue
AseBieSb cathode deposit or sludge that can be sent for toll reﬁning for recovery of
the contained value.
The remaining concentrated acid (w100 g/L H2SO4) is returned to electrolyte stor-
age to maintain the acid balance in the reﬁnery. A small portion is neutralized or sold to
prevent a gradual buildup of Ca, K, Mg, and Na ions in the electrolyte.
More sophisticated and speciﬁc technologies are now used for individual and bulk re-
covery of impurities, such as As, Bi, Co, and Sb, as well as for recovery of Cu, Ni, and
H2SO4. Solvent extraction (Agrawal et al, 2008, 2009; Nagai, 1997; Stevens & Gottlieb-
sen, 2000; Szymanowski, 1998), ion exchange (Arroyo et al., 2017; Nagai, 1997; Sado,
Ueno, Watanabe, & Takebayashi, 2019; Shaw, 2019; Sole et al., 2017), molecular recog-
nition technology (MRT) (Sharma et al., 2019), crystallization (Sado, Ueno, Watanabe,
& Takebayashi, 2019), and electrowinning (Agrawal, Bagchi, et al., 2007; Agrawal,
Kumari, et al., 2007; Jin et al., 2015; Lundström et al., 2019) are reported.

13.9 Treatment of slimes
Treatment of anode slimes, particularly to recover precious and specialty metals for addi-
tional revenue, is receiving increasing attention as a reﬁnery process (Mahmoudi et al.,
2020; Xing et al., 2020). Treatment of more complex ores and a greater tonnage and
variety of copper-containing scrap in recent years has resulted in greater amounts and var-
ied compositions of anode contaminants.
The recovery process depends on the chemical and mineralogical composition of the
slimes. Base metals are typically removed ﬁrst in a pretreatment process. In pyrometallur-
gical pretreatment, elements such as Ni, Sn, and Zn form alloys with precious metals at
w 1000C and can be separated from the slag (Safarzadeh et al., 2018). Hydrometallurgical
methods involve an upfront leaching step to dissolve the base metals and species such as Te
and Se. The precious metal-enriched material is then typically leached under oxidizing
conditions to dissolve the contained Au, Ag, and PGMs using lixiviants such as cyanide,
thiourea, thiosulfate, and halide systems. The precious metals are recovered from solution
using conventional technologies, such as solvent extraction, ion exchange, adsorption, and
electrowinning (Elkayar & Kryst, 2019; Komori, Ito, Okada, & Iwahori, 2010; Nagai et al.,
2017; Wang & Kim, 2018; Xing et al., 2020; Xing & Lee, 2019).
13.10 Industrial electroreﬁning
Table 13.5 describes the operating conditions of seven modern electroreﬁneries (Moats et
al., 2019). These reﬁneries have been selected to show the diversity of operating
conditions, from one of the largest in the world (Jinlong Copper, China: 450,000 t/a
production) to one of the oldest reﬁneries in the world that is still operating (the Pan
Paciﬁc Copper reﬁnery at Saganoseki, Japan: commissioned in 1916). A relatively
new reﬁnery is Onsan #1 in South Korea (commissioned in 2017). Xianguang #2 tank-
house (China) uses the highest current density (420 A/m2), while Aurubis L€unen (Ger-
many) treats one of the lowest-quality feedstocks to produce high-purity cathode. More
detailed information about these and other major reﬁneries is provided by Moats et al.,
2019.
13.11 Recent developments and emerging trends in copper
electroreﬁning
Developments and trends in electroreﬁning relate to maximizing production, safety, and
product purity by upgrading of existing infrastructure and equipment, while minimizing
energy consumption and ensuring sustainability of the industry. Artiﬁcial intelligence
and machine learning are increasingly employed for managing and interrogating data,
assisting in decision-making, and improving process control. There is increasing

mechanization and automation throughout reﬁneries, including the use of robots, sophis-
ticated crane electrode-handling systems, anode preparation machines, and cathode
handling machines (Larinkari, Nord, & Schmidt, 2019; Morris & Madariaga, 2019).
To lower the carbon footprint of an operation, there is a drive to reduced speciﬁc en-
ergy consumption by lowering voltage drop across the electrolyte, such as by reducing
anodeecathode spacing by increasing anode thickness (mass) or changing the anode
shape. A related trend to increase production from an existing infrastructure is the use
of a greater proportion of the anode in each cycle and steadily increasing current densities.
Many tankhouses now routinely operate at 350 A/m2 (Moats et al., 2019; Takenaka,
Yoneyama, Matsubara, Yamaguchi, & Takebayashi, 2019). Sophisticated electrolyte-
ﬂow technologies and acid-mist management systems allow operation at current density
as high as 420 A/m2 (the highest in the industry in 2019) without compromising current
efﬁciency, cathode quality, or operator health (Filzwieser, Hanel, & Filzwieser, 2019;
Penna, Villaseca, & Villarroel, 2019).
Other trends in operational practice include (Moats et al., 2019)
•
continued adoption of permanent cathode technology;
•
better control of anode casting to improve uniformity in size and mass;
•
increasing implementation of polymer concrete cells;
•
parallel electrolyte ﬂow (METTOP-BRX technology; Filzwieser, Hanel, &
Filzwieser, 2019) to allow operation above 400 A/m2;
•
increasing use of short-circuit detection systems and voltage control monitoring;
•
use of section switches to electrically isolate cells for harvesting and maintenance.
Treatment of increasingly complex smelter feeds (both ores and secondary materials)
is increasing the variety and concentrations of impurity elements deporting to the anodes
and the need to recover valuable components from the anode slimes and spent electro-
lyte. Many of these impurities are considered critical elements (Sb, Se, Te) or are a source
of environmental concern (As, Bi, Pb, Cd). These need to be recovered for sale and reuse
or disposed of in a stable and sustainable manner.
Increasingly sophisticated chemistry and technologies continue to evolve to ensure
high-quality cathode.
13.12 Summary
This chapter has shown that electrolytic reﬁning is the principal method of mass-
producing high purity (>99.97%) copper. The other is electrowinning (Chapter 16).
Copper from electroreﬁning, after melting and casting, contains less than 20 ppm impu-
rities, plus oxygen, which is controlled at 0.018%e0.025%.
Electroreﬁning entails electrochemically dissolving copper from impure copper an-
odes into an electrolyte containing CuSO4 and H2SO4, and then electrochemically
354
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

depositing pure copper from the electrolyte onto stainless steel or copper cathodes. The
process is continuous.
Insoluble impurities in the anode adhere to the anode or fall to the bottom of the
reﬁning cell. They are removed and processed for byproduct recovery. Soluble impurities
leave the cell in continuously ﬂowing electrolyte. These are removed from an electrolyte
bleed stream.
Production of high-purity cathode copper is achieved by precise control of chemical,
physical, and electrical tankhouse parameters. These include
(a) evenly spaced, ﬂat, vertical anodes and cathodes;
(b) precise control of temperature, electrolyte composition, supply of leveling and
grain-reﬁning agents constant, and ﬂow distribution throughout each cell;
(c) provision of constant controlled current and current distribution to all electrodes and
management of short-circuits and other current losses.
Important modern trends are to treat anodes with more complex impurity suites at
higher current density, while maximizing cathode purity, productivity, and operator
safety and minimizing power consumption, waste production, and environmental
damage.

CHAPTER 14
Hydrometallurgical copper extraction:
introduction and leaching
Previous chapters describe the processes of concentration, pyrometallurgy, and electro-
reﬁning that convert copper sulﬁde ores and concentrates into high-purity electroreﬁned
copper. These processes account for about 80% of primary copper production.
The remaining 20% of primary copper production comes from hydrometallurgical pro-
cessing of mainly copper oxide and chalcocite ores. This copper is recovered by leaching
(this chapter), followed by solvent extraction (SX) (Chapter 15) and electrowinning
(EW) (Chapter 16). The ﬁnal product is electrowon cathode copper, which is equal to
or often greater in purity than electroreﬁned copper.
In 2020, about 4.2 million tonnes per year of cathode copper were produced using
hydrometallurgical processes.
14.1 Copper recovery by hydrometallurgical ﬂowsheets
Modern hydrometallurgical ﬂowsheets all comprise three essential steps for the recovery
of copper: leaching, followed by SX and EW.
Leaching involves dissolving Cu2þ (or Cuþ) from copper-containing minerals into an
aqueous H2SO4 solution, known as the lixiviant, to produce a pregnant leach solution (PLS).
In addition to copper, the PLS will also contain other impurity species, such as Fe, Al, Co,
Mn, Zn, Mg, and Ca that may be present in the ore and are leached with the copper. The
leach residue (solids remaining after leaching) contains gangue or “waste” minerals, such as
alumina, silica, and insoluble iron oxides/hydroxides/sulfates. The gangue is disposed of
in tailings dams or dumps. The PLS is fed to the SX circuit.
SX treats the impure PLS to purify and upgrade the solution to produce a high-purity
copper electrolyte suitable for EW of copper metal. In the extraction step, copper is selec-
tively loaded into an organic solvent. This contains an extractant that reacts selectively
with copper over other metal cations present in the PLS. The copper-barren aqueous raf-
ﬁnate leaving the extraction circuit is higher in acid and is returned to the leach circuit as
the lixiviant. In the strip step, copper is stripped from the loaded organic solvent into the
advance electrolyte from which copper is electrowon. The stripped organic solvent is recycled
to the extraction step.

In electrowinning, Cu2þ in the puriﬁed advance electrolyte from SX is reduced to
copper metal at the cathode by the application of a DC electrical current. Sulfuric
acid, produced at the anode of the EW cell, is returned to the SX circuit in the
copper-depleted spent electrolyte to strip more copper from the loaded organic solvent.
The integration of these three hydrometallurgical process steps is illustrated in
Fig. 14.1.
14.2 Chemistry of the leaching of copper minerals
Leaching involves solubilizing the valuable components of an ore in an aqueous solution.
In the case of copper minerals, sulfuric acid is almost always used as the leaching medium.
Oxide copper minerals dissolve readily in acid; some sulﬁdes, such as chalcocite and
covellite, also dissolve under atmospheric conditions. More refractory sulﬁdes (chalcopy-
rite and bornite) usually require high temperatures and pressures to break down the crys-
tal lattices to release copper from the minerals into solution.
14.2.1 Leaching of copper oxide minerals
Fig. 14.2 shows the Pourbaix (potential pH) diagram for the CueOeS system. Copper
can be dissolved as Cu2þ under mildly acidic conditions (<pH 5). Examples of some cop-
per minerals that leach in this manner are as follows:
Tenorite: CuO þ H2SO4 / Cu2þ þ SO2

þ H2O
(14.1)
Azurite: 2CuCO3$CuðOHÞ2 þ 3H2SO4/3Cu2þ þ 3SO2

(14.2)

solvent extraction, and electrowinning (Sole, 2008). The leaching reaction is shown for malachite,
but similar reactions can be written for other minerals. RH is the organic extractant used in solvent
extraction. Solvent extraction and electrowinning are described in Chapters 15 and 16, respectively.

14.2.2 Leaching of copper sulﬁde minerals
Elemental copper and copper sulﬁde minerals require the use of acid and an oxidizing
agent to break the mineral lattice and release Cu2þ into solution.
Elemental copper found in nature can be leached by either oxygen or ferric ion:

All copper sulﬁdes require the presence of Fe3þ and O2 as oxidizing agents for leach-
ing to occur. The copper sulﬁde is oxidized by Fe3þ. The resulting Fe2þ is reoxidized to
Fe3þ by O2. The Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple acts in a catalytic manner in these reactions

A Pourbaix diagram for the CueFeeOeS system is given in Fig. 14.3. Very refrac-
tory minerals, such as chalcopyrite, require high temperatures and pressures to enable
leaching to take place at economically viable rates (Section 14.8). The leaching
reactions are complex and vary depending on the speciﬁc experimental conditions,
including the sample mineralogy, gangue minerals, temperature, acid concentration,
oxidationereduction potential, and the presence of ligands (Asselin, 2019; Hiskey,
1993; Lazarro & Nicol, 2003; Nicol & Lazarro, 2003; Yue & Asselin, 2014). One typical

14.3 Leaching methods
The main methods employed for the leaching of copper minerals are as follows:
•
percolation leaching processes, which include heap, dump, and vat leaching;
•
agitation leaching, which takes place in a series of stirred tanks at close to ambient tem-
perature and pressure;
364
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

•
pressure oxidation (POx) leaching, which uses high temperatures and pressures; and
•
in situ leaching (ISL), in which the minerals are leached as they naturally occur in the
Earth’s crust, i.e., without the need to mine the ore.

[S] ¼ 0.1 M (Hayes, 1993, pp. 235e251; Peters, 1976). Most minerals require the application of
both an acidic environment and an oxidizing agent to leach copper as Cu2þ.
Hydrometallurgical copper extraction: introduction and leaching
365

The choice of leaching method depends on the copper grade of the ore, the miner-
alogy of the copper-bearing ore, and the particle size to which is it reduced (Fig. 14.4).
The topography of the mine site, geographical location of the ore body, climatic condi-
tions, and prevailing economic conditions also inﬂuence this decision.
14.4 Heap leaching
Heap leaching is the most important method of hydrometallurgical copper extraction.
Heap leaching is used for treating oxide and lower-grade secondary sulﬁde ores that
contain up to w2% Cu. The ore is crushed to a uniform particle size (typically
12e50 mm), often agglomerated, and then stacked on large ﬂat-topped heaps in a
controlled manner. Heaps are typically w7 m high and have a surface area of
0.01e1 km2. The heap has an impermeable pad at the base. The heap is irrigated with
a sulfuric acid solution under normal atmospheric conditions. The solution is distributed
evenly over the surface of the ore mass. It trickles through the ore under the inﬂuence of
gravity and copper dissolves into solution by Reactions (14.1) through (14.8). The
copper-containing PLS is collected on a sloped impermeable liner at the base of the
heap and directed to a PLS storage pond. Copper is recovered from the PLS by SX
(Chapter 15) and EW (Chapter 16) to produce metallic copper. The acid-rich rafﬁnate
from SX is returned to the heap for further leaching. A recirculating intermediate leach so-
lution (ILS) system is employed to manage the copper concentration of the PLS that is fed
forward to SX. Fig. 14.5 shows the ﬂow conﬁguration and solution compositions for a
typical heap-leach ﬂowsheet.

14.4.1 Chemistry of heap leaching
The oxide ores listed in Table 14.1 and secondary sulﬁdes, such as chalcocite, are readily
leached. Bornite, covellite, and native copper are also leached under biological oxidizing
conditions. Chalcopyrite is not leached to any signiﬁcant extent under the relatively mild
conditions of heap leaching (Section 14.8).
As discussed in Section 14.2, nonsulﬁde copper minerals are leached directly by
H2SO4 according to reactions such as follows:
CuO þ H2SO4/Cu2þ þ SO2
4
þ H2O
(14.1b)
Leaching of sulﬁde minerals requires an oxidizing agent as well as H2SO4. The
oxidizing agent is usually dissolved O2 from air, such as follows:
Cu2S þ 1
=
2O2 þ H2SO4/CuS þ CuSO4 þ H2O
(14.7d)
Heap leaching of sulﬁdes is assisted by microorganisms. Bacteria, which occur natu-
rally in the ore, act as a catalyst for the leaching reaction. The bacterial action increases the
reaction rate so that the time frame required for leaching of these minerals becomes eco-
nomic (Section 14.4.1.2).

Carbonates, oxides, hydroxychlorides, hydroxysilicates, and sulfates are generally referred to as “oxide” ores. They
leach quickly. Chalcocite also leaches reasonably rapidly, while bornite and covellite leach slowly. Chalcopyrite is not
easily leached.
368
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

14.4.1.1 Oxidation by Fe3þ
Reaction (14.7c) represents the overall sulﬁde leaching reaction; however, the ferric ion,
Fe3þ, is necessary for rapid leaching. Iron-containing minerals in the ore, such as pyrite
(FeS2), are oxidized by Fe3þ ions in the presence of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, releasing Fe2þ
ions. The Fe2þ ions are rapidly reoxidized to Fe3þ by oxygen and catalyzed by ferrous-
oxidizing bacteria on the surface of the pyrite to maintain a high redox potential. Pyrite
is not only a source of Fe3þ, but is also an important source of acid (Eq. 14.11a). Copper
sulﬁdes (and native copper) are leached by Fe3þ, also assisted by direct bacterial action:
2FeS2 þ 7O2 þ 2H2O/2Fe2þ þ 2SO2
4
þ 2H2SO4
(14.11a)

4
þ 4H2O/2Cu2þ þ 10Fe2þ þ 12SO2
4
þ 4H2SO4
(14.11c)
The Fe2þ ions produced by Reaction (14.11c) are then reoxidized by Reaction
(14.11b) and the process becomes cyclic. Some direct oxidation (Eq. 14.7c) may also
occur. PLS from heap leaching typically contains 1e5 g/L Fe.
14.4.1.2 Bacterial action
The above reactions can proceed without bacterial action, but they are accelerated by
orders of magnitude by the enzyme catalysts produced by bacteria. The catalytic
actions are most commonly attributed to Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, Leptospirillum ferri-
philumooxidans, and Acidothiobacillus thiooxidans. At moderate temperatures (40e45C),
Acidothiobacillus caldus prevails, while at elevated temperature (>60C), Sulfolobus metalli-
cus and Metallosphaera spp are the dominant bioleaching strains (Brierley, 2016; Brierley &
Brierley, 2013; Guezennec, 2019; Watling, 2006). The bacteria are rod shaped,
0.5 mm  2 mm long, or spherical and w1 mm diameter (Fig. 14.6).
Bacteria are indigenous to both oxide and sulﬁde ores and their surrounding aqueous
environment. They are present in leach heaps in the order of 1012 bacteria per tonne of
ore (Brierley & Brierley, 2019). Like all bacteria, they adapt readily to changes in their
environment.
The following conditions promote optimum activity of the bacteria:
(a) lixiviant pH between 1.5 and 6 (optimum w pH 2);
(b) temperature between 5 and 45C (optimum w30C; heat is often generated in
leach heaps and dumps by exothermic sulﬁde oxidation reactions);
(c) an adequate O2 supply, often obtained by gently blowing air through perforated
pipes beneath sulﬁde ore leach heaps (Connelly, 2019, 2020);
(d) no organics in lixiviant or heap, so adequate removal of organic entrainment from
the SX rafﬁnate is essential (Chapter 15).
Hydrometallurgical copper extraction: introduction and leaching
369

Bacteria may also need small amounts of minor nutrients, such as NH4
þ and PO4
3, for
cell growth (Brierley & Brierley, 2019). Once leaching has started, the bacteria adapt so
that the nutrients they need are provided by minerals in the ore: nitrogen is generally
sourced from blasting chemicals used in the mine and phosphorus from the leaching
of phosphates in the ore. If the ore is phosphorus-deﬁcient, phosphate may be added
to the leach solution.
Bacteria are sensitive to the presence of chloride, nitrate, and total dissolved solids
(TDS) in the leach solution. Where possible, it is preferable to use high-quality water
for make-up of the lixiviant, because this enhances the rate of leaching. Bacteria are, how-
ever, very adaptable: some Chilean operations have chloride contents up to 40 g/L; some
Australian operations have up to 10 g/L TDS in the make-up water; and it is not unusual
to have 200 g/L total sulfate content in heap leach solutions.
14.4.1.3 Effect of chloride
Chloride can occur in heap-leach solutions, either by dissolution of chloride-containing
minerals, such as atacamite (Cu2Cl(OH)3), or by addition of NaCl in the agglomeration
step. Chloride ions form stable complexes with both Cuþ and Cu2þ. The Cu(I)/Cu(II)
couple can act as a more favorable redox catalyst than the Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple
in the leaching of sulﬁde minerals (Nicol and Akilan, 2016; Nicol & Basson, 2017;
Nicol et al., 2010; Velasquez-Yevenes, Nicol, & Miki, 2010; Velasquez-Yevenes, &
Miki, & Nicol, 2010). Regeneration of Cuþ by dissolved oxygen occurs rapidly at
ambient temperature (Petersen & van Staden, 2019):
4Cuþ þ O2 þ 4Hþ/4Cu2þ þ 2H2O
(14.12)
This concept is applied to heap leaching of sulﬁde materials at selected sites in Chile.

14.4.1.4 Rate of leaching
Oxide minerals leach relatively rapidly under heap leach conditions, achieving copper re-
coveries of 75%e95% within 30e100 days (Petersen & van Staden, 2019). Leaching of
secondary sulﬁdes is much slower (Dixon & Liu, 2019). Depending on the mineralogy
of a heap, leach times may vary from w90 days to 3 years to yield copper recoveries
of 70%e90% (Ghorbani et al., 2016). Chalcopyrite hardly reacts at all in heap leaching.
Heap leaching is diffusion controlled. Long leach times are due to geotechnical char-
acteristics of the ore, especially the presence of clays and micas (Miller, 2003). Kinetics are
also inﬂuenced by porosity of the heap and access of the lixiviant and oxygen (Petersen &
van Staden, 2019).
14.4.2 Industrial heap leaching
Table 14.2 provides details of selected heap leach operations in different locations.
14.4.2.1 Construction of a heap
Leach heaps can be either multilift permanent heaps (Fig. 14.7A) or on/off (dynamic) heaps
(Fig. 14.7B). Multilift heaps consist of an initial lift built on an impermeable surface. After
this lift has been leached, subsequent lifts are built on top of the ﬁrst lift. Each lift is 5e8 m
high; the total heap height can be up to 200 m (Connelly & West, 2009). Dynamic heaps
consist of a single lift (7e8 m high) built on an impermeable surface. The leached mate-
rial is removed after leaching and replaced by a new lift of fresh ore. Dynamic pads are the
most economic installation for large-tonnage operations (5e7 million t/a). When the ore
contains clay and will not support equipment to stack over the leached lift, a dynamic pad
is required.
Multilift heaps have the advantages that (Breitenbach, 2005; Iasillo & Schlitt, 1999;
Scheffel, 2002) (i) the ore needs to be moved only once (onto the heap) and (ii) lixiviant
can ﬂow through all the lifts until leaching is moved to another area, permitting addi-
tional recovery of copper from slower-leaching minerals in the lower lifts (More often,
however, an intermediate liner is placed on top of the leached ore to limit the acid
consumed by the gangue in the lower lift). The disadvantages of a multilift heap are
that construction of a heap, which may ultimately become 200 m high, requires a strong
impermeable base and versatile heap-building equipment. The initial base area must be
large enough to hold all of the ore that will be mined and leached during the life of the
operation. There can be signiﬁcant copper inventory locked up in the heap for extended
periods of time. Control of the internal solution head and geotechnical stability of the
heap can also be challenging (Miller, 2003).
Dynamic heaps have the advantages that they are simple to construct, it is easier to con-
trol the leaching at optimum conditions (Section 14.4.2.7), their base need not be as
strong as those needed for multilift heaps, and the aeration and pipework can be main-
tained when ore is emptied from the pad. The ability to regularly remove tailings samples

also means that metal accounting is more reliable (Pyper et al., 2019). Their main disad-
vantages are that the ore must be moved twice (on and off the pad) and the associated
costs of residue disposal. Dynamic heaps are usually the preferred choice for ore grades
above 1% Cu (Scheffel, 2002).
14.4.2.2 Impermeable base
Leach heaps are built on an impermeable base. This permits complete collection of the
leached Cu2þ in the PLS and prevents solution penetration into the underlying environ-
ment and potential contamination of ground water.
The base typically consists of a synthetic plastic liner or geomembrane sheet (such as
high- or low-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, or chlorinated polyvinyl chlo-
ride), 1e2 mm thick, with a layer of rolled clay or earth (0.1e0.5 m thick) beneath,
and a 0.5 m layer of ﬁnely crushed and screened rock (<2 cm diameter) above it. Perfo-
rated PLS collection pipes and aeration pipes are placed on top of this layer (Fig. 14.7C
and D). The base is sloped to direct the PLS to a collection pond. The slope should be less
than 5% (5 m drop in 100 m horizontal) to avoid slippage of the heap on the plastic liner
(Breitenbach, 2005). Considerable care is taken to avoid puncturing the plastic liner
during construction to avoid loss of copper-containing PLS and environmental
contamination.
14.4.2.3 Pretreatment of the ore
The simplest method of leaching involves placement of run-of-mine (ROM) ore directly
onto the leach pad. This is the cheapest method, but it gives the slowest and least-efﬁcient
recovery of copper to the PLS.
More often, ROM ore is placed on the heap and then pretreated by trickling strong
H2SO4 solution through the heap. This acid cure rapidly dissolves Cu2þ from readily sol-
uble oxide minerals and acidiﬁes the heap, thereby preventing precipitation of ferric sul-
fate during subsequent leaching. Typically, 10e20 kg H2SO4 per tonne of ore is applied
to the heap over a period of w10 days (Iasillo & Schlitt, 1999).
The rate of copper extraction and overall copper recovery decreases with decreasing
particle size of the ore because the local saturation increases (Miller, 2008). Many heap
leach operations crush their ROM ore to 1e5 cm pieces: crushing to less than 1 cm
does not further improve extraction, while crushing to below 0.5 cm can adversely
decrease heap permeability.
In most modern heap leach operations, agglomeration is used as an intermediate step
between crushing and stacking (Bouffard, 2005, 2008; Velarde, 2005). The crushed
ore (10e50 mm particle size) is agglomerated with concentrated H2SO4 and SX rafﬁnate
in revolving drums (typically 3 m diameter, 9 m long, sloped at w6 degrees) (Fig. 14.8).
Hydrometallurgical copper extraction: introduction and leaching
377

Agglomeration allows uniform application of acid to all surfaces of the mineral particles to
cure the ore and improve the leach kinetics. The ﬁnes created during crushing are aggre-
gated into larger particles so that they do not reduce the permeability of the heap.
When secondary sulﬁdes are present in the mineralogy, a ferric cure may be used in
conjunction with the acid cure. An acid-containing solution with >3 g/L Fe3þ may
be added either directly to the heap or during the agglomeration process. An appropriate
bacterial culture and its nutrients or chloride may also be added to the agglomeration
process.
The agglomerated material is then placed on the leach heaps.

before stacking into heaps for leaching. (b) Agglomerated ore on heap.

14.4.2.4 Stacking of ore on heap
Heaps of ore to be leached are stacked on the impermeable base by dumping from trucks
or by stacking with a wheel loader or mobile conveyor. Trucks have the advantage of
simplicity, but they tend to compact the heap as they run over it. This reduces perme-
ability, slows leach kinetics, and limits oxygen circulation in the heap. Mobile conveyors
avoid this problem and are now widely used (Figs. 14.9 and 14.10).
The heap height is a compromise to maximize copper recovery at the lowest cost
(Connelly, 2020). A lower heap height can require greater capital due to the greater
area under leach, increased pumping requirements from more irrigation, extra drainage
piping, and a lower PLS grade. In contrast, a lower heap height can produce better overall
copper recovery, may not require forced aeration, and is unlikely to suffer permeability
problems from compaction at the base of the heap.
14.4.2.5 Aeration of heap
As discussed in Section 14.2, the leaching of sulﬁdes requires the presence of oxygen (re-
actions 14.7e14.10). Oxygen also enhances bacterial activity (Watling, 2006). Oxygen is
introduced to a heap by placing perforated plastic pipes about 1 m above the heap base
and blowing air gently and uniformly upward through the heap (Lupo, 2010). Forced air
supply is also used when pyrite oxidation is the main source of solution heating in colder
climates.
The additional cost of providing oxygen to the heap is more than offset by the result-
ing increase in copper recovery and enhanced kinetics when used for leachable copper
grades above 1%. Smaller and lower-grade heaps rely on natural air convection for ox-
ygen supply.

Unloading of a heap on completion of leaching is undertaken using bucket-wheel reclaimer.

14.4.2.6 Irrigation of heap
The lixiviant is typically the copper-depleted rafﬁnate returning from SX (Fig. 14.5).
This has a typical composition of 0.5 g/L Cu and 5e10 g/L H2SO4. Additional sulfuric
acid may be added to the rafﬁnate before it is recycled to the heap. Acid in excess of the
stoichiometric requirement is required due to the leaching of gangue minerals, such as
those containing Fe, Co, Mn, Al, Ca, Mg, Na, K, P, and carbonates (Salgado, Perez,
& Alvayai, 2009; Seyedbagheri, van Staden, & McLaren, 2009). Water may be added
to replace evaporative and ore hold-up losses.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The lixiviant is added via an equi-spaced network of plastic pipes laid on top of the
heap (Fig. 14.7E). Sprinklers, wobblers, and drip emitters are used to distribute the lixiviant
(Dixon et al., 2012). Sprinklers and wobblers distribute solution evenly over large areas.
Drip emitters require more maintenance to avoid blockages, but they avoid excessive
evaporation and cooling losses.
The lixiviant addition rate typically ranges from about 8 to 12 L/h per m2 of heap
surface, but can be as high as 20 L/h/m2 (Pyper et al., 2019). This rate prevents accumu-
lation of lixiviant on the heap surface and allows free movement of air in the heap.
The optimum irrigation rate can be determined from air and water conductivity tests
that are available for use in heap design (Guzman, Scheffel, & Flaherty, 2008, Guzman,
Scheffel, Ahlborn, Ramos, & Flaherty, 2007; Petersen & van Staden, 2019).
The lixiviant is generally at ambient temperature. In cold regions, it may be heated
to enhance the kinetics of Cu extraction (Saario & Riekkola-Vanhanen, 2011). The
leaching reactions are exothermic, so the heap will increase marginally in temperature
as the leach liquor percolates through the heap; however, signiﬁcant heat is lost by evap-
oration from wetted surfaces and in the air ﬂow though the heap. The acid concentration
and ﬂowrate of the lixiviant and the rate of aeration of the heap all need to be balanced to
ensure that the heap does not get too hot (which will cause the bacteria to die) or too cold
(which slows down the rate of leaching) (Dixon, 2000; Schlitt, 2006).
14.4.2.7 Optimum leaching conditions
The following conditions promote optimum leaching of oxide and sulﬁde material in
heaps:
(a) uniform heaps of optimally sized, cured, and agglomerated ore that maintain perme-
ability throughout their life;
(b) leach conditions that maximize bacterial activity (30C, pH 1.5e2.0, 5e10 g/L
H2SO4);
(c) uniform lixiviant application (w10 L/h/m2) onto the heap surface without pooling;
(d) well-designed impervious heap base, sloping less than 5%, with an efﬁcient solution
collection system;
(e) adequate heap temperature, provided in cold regions by heating rafﬁnate, insulating
pipes, and covering heaps with plastic mesh or sheet;
(f) a controlled, uniform air supply (w10 L/min/m2 of heap surface), if used, blown in
from perforated pipes beneath the heap;
(g) heap height that is appropriate to the geomechanical characteristics and mineralogy
of the ore, to ensure unsaturated conditions and that sufﬁcient oxygen and acid are
available throughout the active leaching region.

381

14.4.2.8 Collection of PLS
The PLS exiting the base of a heap typically contains 1e6 g/L Cu2þ. The solution ﬂows
by gravity down plastic drainpipes (w10 cm diameter) on the sloping heap base to a
collection trench (Fig. 14.7D). The pipes have slits 2 mm wide, 20 mm long through
which the PLS enters. The pipes are spaced 2e4 m apart, at about 45 degrees across
the slope. High-grade PLS ﬂows to a PLS pond, from where it is sent to the SX circuit
by gravity or pumping. Low-grade ILS is reacidiﬁed and recycled back to the heap for
further copper leaching and PLS grade management (Fig. 14.5).
14.5 Dump leaching
Dump leaching is very similar to heap leaching: the main differences between these two
leaching methods are the copper grade and particle size of the ore. Dump leaching is
used for treating low-grade ROM ore, typically 0.1%e0.4% Cu oxide or sulﬁde mate-
rials. It is practiced mainly in North America and Chile. It is an inexpensive method of
treating mined material that would otherwise be considered as waste. Industrial details of
a Chilean dump leach operation are presented in Table 14.3.

ROM ore is piled into dumps that may be as high as 200 m (Fig. 14.11). The material
is not crushed or agglomerated: rock sizes range up to w500 mm. Leaching, using acid-
iﬁed rafﬁnate, can take several years. The eventual copper recovery can vary from 30% to
75%, depending on the mineralogy and the hydraulic and geomechanical characteristics
of the ore.
14.6 Vat leaching
Vat leaching is carried out in large reaction vessels (vats). It is employed for low-grade
(0.5%e1% Cu) oxide and carbonate minerals where the leach kinetics are fast and a rela-
tively short contact time with the leach liquor is required (Schlitt & Johnston, 2010). Sul-
ﬁdes cannot be leached because of the lack of aeration in the vats. Table 14.4 illustrates
typical commercial vat leaching operating conditions.
The ore is crushed to 5e10 mm. After acid curing, 4000e13,000 t ore is loaded into
large square vats (20e30 m sides, 5e8 m deep) (Fig. 14.12). Vats are ﬁlled with ore from
conveyer trolleys that run on rails along the length of the train of vats. The vats are typi-
cally constructed of lined, reinforced concrete with a raised, slatted ﬂoor, supported by
concrete foundations, through which lixiviant is introduced.

Rafﬁnate from SX is used as the lixiviant. The lixiviant is fed upﬂow into each vat
until solution starts to overﬂow from the top of the vat. Vat leaching is operated in
ﬂooded fashion, using a ﬂowrate of about 375 L/h/m2. This keeps ﬁne particles in sus-
pension and prevents them from compacting and plugging at the bottom of the vat. The
leach liquor moves from one vat to the next in a countercurrent manner so that fresh

lixiviant (which contains the highest acid concentration) is contacted with ore that has
been leaching the longest (i.e., only the most refractory minerals remain unleached). Af-
ter an extended period of time (4e20 days) of recirculating the lixiviant through the ore
in the vat, the copper-containing PLS is drained from the vats and sent for copper
recovery.
To avoid soluble copper losses, the wet leached solids are water washed several times.
The copper-containing spent wash water is combined with the PLS. The solids are
removed from the vat using a bucket wheel or clam shell excavator that moves on a
gantry adjacent to the vat train, loaded onto trucks, and sent to the tailings’ disposal area.
Because of the high ore:lixiviant ratio in the vats, it is possible to achieve very high
copper concentration in the PLS (w50 g/L Cu). The PLS from vat leaching will usually
be blended with PLS from other leaching processes to provide a more dilute feed to SX.
Alternatively, the high-grade solution can be fed to a direct EW circuit (see Section
16.9.1).
Vat leaching can also be conﬁgured as a continuous process (Mackie & Trask, 2009).
Flowrates up to 30,000 L/h/m2 enable good bed ﬂuidization and rapid kinetics of leach-
ing. For readily leached ores, the residence time on a heap leach is 120e500 days; this can
be reduced to 24e72 h in a continuous vat operation.
14.7 Agitation leaching
Agitation leaching is used for minerals that have rapid leach kinetics. Leaching is carried out
in a series of stirred tanks. Copper recovery can approach 100% within a few hours.
Figure 14.12 Vat leaching at Mantos Blancos, Chile (closed 2020). Approximately 40,000 t/a Cu were
produced from leaching in 12 vats. Mina Justa, Peru, commissioned a vat leaching operation in 2021,
which is the only site in the world to use this leaching technology. (Courtesy of Anglo American.)

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

14.7.1 Oxide minerals
Agitation leaching is used for oxide minerals that have rapid leach kinetics, such as car-
bonates, and reasonable grade (0.8%e5% Cu). It can be applied to ores or to milled tail-
ings from other leach circuits. This method is widely used in the African Copperbelt
(Reolon, Gazis, & Amos, 2009; Roux, van Rooyen, Minnaar, Robles, & Cronje, 2010).
Following crushing and milling, the material is leached in stirred tanks. Finely ground
ore is kept in suspension in the lixiviant by agitating the slurry mechanically or pneumat-
ically. The ﬁne particle size offers a large surface area that exposures more of the mineral
to the leach solution, leading to fast kinetics and high copper recoveries. The slurry re-
ports to solideliquid separation, usually a countercurrent decantation (CCD) circuit, in
which some further leaching can take place. The recovery of acid-soluble copper is usu-
ally above 98%, generating a PLS that contains 3e12 g/L Cu, although can range as high
as 40 g/L (Sole & Tinkler, 2016). Ores high in chrysocolla need longer leach times
because this mineral has slower leach kinetics.
The single largest copper loss in many of these plants is due to low recovery of PLS
from the leach residue due to poor washing. Efﬁcient operation of the CCD circuits is
essential to maximize copper recovery and maintain the water balance in the circuit.
These circuits can also have high operating costs due to the need for ﬁne milling and
increased acid requirements for the ﬁne ore, followed by the subsequent need to
neutralize the tailings for disposal. Various ﬂowsheet conﬁgurations have been proposed
to minimize these disadvantages (Roux, van Rooyen, Minnaar, Robles, & Cronje,
2010).
14.7.2 Sulﬁde minerals
Secondary sulﬁdes of reasonable grade (>6% Cu) can also be treated using agitation
leaching. The method is similar to that described for oxide leaching, but elevated tem-
perature and an oxidizing agent are required (see Section 14.2.2). Most operations use
air (oxygen), but plants in Australia, Laos, and Spain use Fe3þ as the oxidizing agent
(Fleury, Delgado, & Collao, 2010).
The PLS generated from sulﬁde leaching is usually more concentrated than that of
oxide leaching, typically 12e25 g/L Cu. Copper recovery varies from 95% to 98%; leach
times range from less than 24 h to several days.
The Albion process is the ﬁrst commercial atmospheric leaching process that is able to
treat chalcopyrite (Stieper, 2018; Voigt, Stieper, & Hourn, 2019). The chalcopyrite
concentrate is very ﬁnely ground to <10 mm. The reaction is accelerated by sparging
of hypersonic oxygen into the leach tanks and operating above 90C. The leach time
is about 24 h.

Table 14.5 shows typical operating data for several plants where agitation leaching is
practiced.
The main advantages of heap or dump leaching compared with milling of the ore fol-
lowed by agitation leaching are as follows (Pyper et al., 2019):
•
lower capital costs;
•
lower operating costs;
•
no need for a subsequent solid/liquid step;
•
no tailings disposal.
In contrast, the advantages of agitation leaching include the following:
•
higher metal recovery;
•
much shorter process time;
•
rapid response to process changes;
•
opportunity for byproducts recovery, such as cobalt or gold (Sole et al., 2018).
14.8 Pressure oxidation leaching
POx leaching uses high temperatures and pressures to promote the leaching of refractory
minerals, such as chalcopyrite. When the chalcopyrite copper grade is too low or too var-
iable for a pyrometallurgical process, pressure leaching can be used to treat the concen-
trate product from ﬂotation (in contrast to the other leaching methods that process whole
ore) (Frischmuth et al., 2019).
Temperature affects both the thermodynamics and kinetics of leaching. An increase in
temperature and pressure promotes leaching because it permits a much higher concen-
tration of oxygen to be dissolved in solution and allows faster kinetics for reactions
that are slow or thermodynamically unfavorable at atmospheric conditions.
Elevated temperatureepressure leaching is carried out in an autoclave. The pressure
inside the leaching vessel is increased by pressurizing the autoclave using oxygen; the
temperature is typically increased by steam injection on start-up. The autoclave is usually
horizontal, with a series of compartments though which the lixiviant and solids move in a
cocurrent manner (Fig. 14.13). The material to be leached is ground to a ﬁne particle size
(typically w10 mm) to allow maximum exposure of the lixiviant to the mineral surfaces.
Medium-temperature medium-pressure and high-temperature high-pressure pro-
cesses have been developed to commercial scale.
14.8.1 High-temperature high-pressure oxidation leaching
In high-temperature and -pressure leaching (200e230C, w3000 kPa), leaching is rapid
and >99% of the copper is typically dissolved. All of the sulﬁde sulfur in the concentrate
is converted to H2SO4, which consumes oxygen. Unless the resulting acid can be used
for heap or agitation leaching in other parts of the ﬂowsheet, this acid needs to be neutral-
ized ahead of downstream processing. Iron in the concentrate reports to the leach residue

as hematite (Fe2O3), which is environmentally stable and easily ﬁlterable. In the presence
of sufﬁcient dissolved oxygen, the leach reaction can be represented as follows (Green
et al., 2018; McDonald & Muir, 2007a):
4CuFeS2 þ 17O2 þ 4H2O/4Cu2þ þ 4SO2

þ 2Fe2O3 þ 4H2SO4

High-temperature and -pressure of copper concentrates was practiced at a demonstra-
tion scale at Bagdad, Arizona (16,000 t/a Cu cathode) (Green et al., 2018). Commercial
pressure leach facilities operate at Kansanshi, Zambia (30,000 t/a Cu) and for the treat-
ment of a copper-containing pyrite concentrate at Sepon, Laos (80,000 t/a Cu) (Bell,
Hoey, & Lui, 2010; Keokhounsy, Moore, & Liu, 2006; Sherrit, Pavlides, & Keekes,
2005). Details of these plants are given in Table 14.6.

14.8.2 Medium-temperature medium-pressure oxidation leaching
Medium-temperature and -pressure processes (140e165C, 1000e1200 kPa) require
ﬁne grinding of the feed material (80%10 mm or ﬁner) and often rely on the addition
of chloride to attain reasonable kinetics of leaching (for example, see McDonald & Muir,
2007b; Nicol et al., 2010; Senanayake, 2009; Velasquez-Yevenes, Nicol, & Miki, 2010;
Yoo et al., 2010). Sulﬁdes are converted to a mixture of H2SO4 and elemental sulfur:
4CuFeS2 þ 5O2 þ 4H2SO4/4Cu2þ þ 4SO2
4
þ 2Fe2O3 þ 8S þ 4H2O
(14.13)
4CuFeS2 þ 17O2 þ 2H2SO4/4Cu2þ þ 10SO2
4
þ 4Fe3þ þ 2H2O
(14.14)
The melting point of sulfur is 119C, so it is critical to avoid coating of the surface of
the chalcopyrite particles by molten sulfur and to avoid agglomeration of the ﬁnely
ground solids. Surfactants, such as calcium lignosulfate, and other additives are used
(Steyl, 2004).
Depending on the temperature and free acid present in solution, iron will be rejected
as basic ferric sulfate (Fe(OH)SO4) or jarosite (Fe3(OH)6(SO4)2$2H2O); hematite can
form at higher temperatures. It is desirable to produce an insoluble iron product because
residual Fe3þ in solution can be transferred through SX and negatively affect current ef-
ﬁciency in EW (Chapter 16).

Kansanshi and Morenci leach chalcopyrite concentrate directly. Sepon used pressure leaching primarily to produce
ferric ion, which was then used to leach chalcocite (the plant is now converted for gold production). The Morenci
plant was converted from a medium-temperature pressure leach process in 2015 (Green et al., 2018).
Hydrometallurgical copper extraction: introduction and leaching
395

Medium-temperature and -pressure processes have been proven at a demonstration
scale at Bagdad, Arizona (14,000 t/a Cu) (Marsden et al., 2007c) and at UHC Carajas,
Brazil (10,000 t/a Cu) (Defreyne et al., 2008; Hayton, Defreyne, & Murray, 2009; Jones,
Xavier, Gonçalves, Costa, & Torres, 2006; Omena et al., 2007). The ﬁrst commercial
implementation of this technology ran at Morenci, Arizona (67,000 t/a Cu) from
2007 to 2014 (Freeport McMoRan, 2008; Marsden et al., 2007d).
14.9 In situ leaching
A less-common technology is ISL, also known as solution mining. ISL of copper was
reportedly practiced by the Romans and in China prior to 200 AD (Hiskey et al.,
2019; Kuhn & Alley, 2019). Oxide minerals are most suited to ISL because their leaching
does not require the presence of an oxidant. Sulﬁde ores can be leached by adding ferric
sulfate or oxygen to the leach solution; naturally occurring sulﬁde-reducing bacteria can
assist the leaching kinetics.
ISL is typically applied to a rock mass that is still “in place,” i.e., as it occurs in nature
in its undisturbed geological setting. ISL can also be used to recover copper from
old mine workings, such as pit slopes, block caving subsidence zones, and underground
stopes (Hiskey et al., 2019). The sulfuric acid lixiviant is introduced through injection
wells, percolates through the ore, and dissolves readily soluble minerals. The PLS
is pumped out and processed on the surface for copper recovery (Gunnison
Copper, 2021).
Because the leach liquors are acidic, there are environmental concerns for potential
contamination of groundwater and aquifers, so great care must be taken to ensure appro-
priate geological conditions for this type of leaching.
14.10 Hydrometallurgical processing of chalcopyrite concentrates
Chalcopyrite is essentially unleached under the mild oxidizing conditions of heap
leaching (very slow leach kinetics). It can, however, be leached under oxidizing condi-
tions at elevated temperatures (Section 14.8). This has led to extensive study of leaching
of chalcopyrite concentrates as an alternative to smelting for copper recovery. Some eco-
nomic and process drivers for treating chalcopyrite concentrates hydrometallurgically,
rather than by smelting, include the following (Baxter, 2016; Dreisinger, 2019; Green
et al., 2018):
(a) the relatively high and cyclically variable cost of external smelting and reﬁning
charges;
(b) limited availability of smelting capacity in some locations;
396
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

(c) high capital cost of installing new smelting capacity;
(d) increasingly stringent environmental legislation, particularly avoiding the generation
of gaseous efﬂuents such as SO2;
(e) the ability to treat high-impurity concentrates, particularly those that contain ele-
ments that are deleterious in electroreﬁning, such as As, Sb, and F;
(f) recovery of valuable byproducts, such as cobalt and precious metals;
(g) the ability to treat lower-grade concentrates on site and increasing overall recovery
from the ore body;
(h) the construction of small leach plants at mine sites, rather than shipping concentrate
to large distant smelters, thereby eliminating freight and transport costs;
(i) cost-effective generation of sulfuric acid at mine sites for use in heap and agitation
leaching;
(j) overall lower cost production of copper (if credit can be obtained for the acid
production).
A variety of approaches have been taken to ﬁnding an economically viable process
for the hydrometallurgical treatment of refractory copper sulﬁdes (Baxter, 2019;
Dreisinger, 2019). Sulfate-based processes include bacterially assisted processes (Batty &
Rorke, 2006; Gericke et al., 2010; Pradhan et al., 2008; Watling, 2015) and low-, me-
dium-, and high-temperature pressure leaching (Marsden et al., 2007aed; Evans & John-
son, 1999; Defreyne et al., 2008; Dixon, Baxter, & Sylwestrzak, 2007; Hayton, Defreyne,
& Murray, 2009; Marsden et al., 2007aed; Miller, Sylwestrzak, & Baxter, 2008). Halide-
(Hyv€arinen & H€am€al€ainen, 2005; Miura et al., 2016; Moyes, Sammut, & Houllis, 2002),
ammonia- (Arbiter & McNulty, 1999; Duyvesteyn & Sabacky, 1995; Moyo & Petersen,
2019), and nitrate-based (Anderson, Fayran, & Twidwell, 2010) processes have also
received attention.
14.11 Future developments
Heap leaching of copper ores is widely practiced, particularly in North and South Amer-
ica, for the leaching of acid-soluble oxide minerals and secondary sulﬁdes, such as chal-
cocite. The contribution to hydrometallurgical copper production by heap leaching is
expected to continue, because this technology is relatively simple, robust, ﬂexible, and
low cost.
Improvements in heap leaching efﬁciency continue through optimization of crush-
ing, acid curing, agglomeration, understanding solution and air conductivities, heap
construction, aeration, lixiviant composition and application rate, bacterial activity,
Hydrometallurgical copper extraction: introduction and leaching

and temperature. Signiﬁcant advances in materials-handling equipment that can assist in
rapidly and uniformly stacking and reclaiming oneoff heaps and minimize labor
requirements continue to be brought to the industry (see, for example, Terra Nova
Technologies, 2021). Continuous improvement in heap leaching aims to maximize
the rate of leaching and overall copper recovery. Advances in heap leaching of second-
ary sulﬁdes focus on the use of forced aeration to supply adequate oxygen requirements
throughout the heap, addition of chloride to catalyze the leach kinetics, and bio-
augmentation of sulfur-reducing bacteria.
Development of commercially viable technologies for the hydrometallurgical
processing of chalcopyrite remains of continuing research interest. Considerable efforts
continue to seek better understanding of the chemistry and mechanisms of leaching and
the behavior of reaction products and byproducts (see, for example, Cordoba et al.,
2008a-d; Hiroyoshi et al., 2001, 2004, 2008; Klauber, 2008; Nicol et al., 2010,
2016, 2017; Watling, 2013). Heap leaching of primary sulﬁdes is becoming a reality.
El Abra (Chile) has implemented the Sulfolix process to treat high-bornite material
by heap leaching augmented by addition of biomass and aeration: sulfur-reducing bac-
teria are generated in bioreactors and the biomass solution is supplied directly to the
heaps. A small-scale atmospheric leaching plant to treat chalcopyrite concentrate has
been commercialized in Zambia using the Albion process (Stieper, 2018; Voigt, Stieper,
& Hourn, 2019). The Rapid Oxidative Leach process offers potential for atmospheric
leaching of chalcopyrite using mechanicalechemical activation of the ore (Chaiko,
Baczek, Rocks, Walters, & Klepper, 2015; Chaiko et al., 2015; Mulligan et al., 2018).
POx leaching of refractory sulﬁdes has not achieved wide commercial acceptance and
has only been applied at a few operations. This technology may in future offer niche po-
tential for treating high-impurity concentrates that cannot be processed using pyromet-
allurgical techniques (Baxter, 2016).
ISL may, in future, offer a relatively low-cost option for the recovery of copper under
appropriate geotechnical and mineralogical conditions (Seaman, Vollert, & O’Callaghan,
2019; Sinclair & Thompson, 2015).
14.12 Summary
Hydrometallurgical extraction accounts for about 4.5 million tonnes of cathode copper
per year (about 20% of total primary copper production). Most of this is produced by
heap leaching.
398
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Heap leaching consists of trickling H2SO4-containing lixiviant uniformly through
ﬂat-surfaced heaps of crushed ore, agglomerated, or ROM ore. Oxide ores are leached
by H2SO4 without the need for oxidation. Chalcocite and covellite need the presence of
oxygen and Fe3þ to be oxidized and leached by H2SO4-containing solutions.
Leaching of sulﬁde ores at economic rates is made possible by indigenous bacteria that
increase the mineral leaching kinetics by several orders of magnitude. The rate-
determining kinetics is diffusion in the saturated zones of the ore. Bacterial activity is
maximized at pH 1.5e2, a temperature of w30C, and with an adequate O2 supply.
Heap leaching generates a PLS containing 1e6 g/L Cu2þ. The PLS is collected on a
sloping impervious plastic liner beneath the leach heaps and sent to SX and EW for cop-
per production (Chapters 15 and 16). The Cu2þ-depleted rafﬁnate from SX is recycled to
leaching, with the acid strength usually increased by the addition of concentrated H2SO4.
The rate of leaching and the overall copper recovery are maximized by optimizing the
conditions for diffusion control: crush size, acid curing, agglomeration, heap perme-
ability, lixiviant composition, aeration, and bacterial activity.
Low-grade ores are treated by dump leaching, while vat leaching can be used to treat
higher-grade oxide ore. Agitation leaching in stirred tanks is applied to both oxide and
sulﬁde materials: the PLS concentrations can be up to 25 g/L Cu. Agitation leaching is
a more expensive technology but can give very high copper recoveries. It is mainly
applied on the African Copperbelt.
Most copper minerals are amenable to leaching under atmospheric conditions. A crit-
ical exception is chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), which does not dissolve under percolation leach
conditions. It can be leached under oxidizing conditions at elevated temperatures, either
using the assistance of thermophilic microbes or high temperatures and pressures. Several
process routes for the hydrometallurgical treatment of chalcopyrite have been proposed
and are the topics of ongoing research, but few have yet been successfully commercial-
ized. Total POx (220C, 3000 kPa) circuits to treat chalcopyrite-containing concentrates
operate in Laos, Zambia, and the United States of America.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

CHAPTER 15
Solvent extraction
Solvent extraction (SX) serves the purpose of purifying and upgrading the pregnant leach
solution (PLS) produced by the leaching operation (Chapter 14) to give an electrolyte
from which high-quality copper cathode can be electrowon (Chapter 16).
Most leach liquors, irrespective of the leaching process by which they are produced,
are too dilute in copper (1e10 g/L Cu), too impure (containing 1e20 g/L Fe, as well as
other deleterious species, such as Mn, chlorides, or nitrates), and not sufﬁciently conduc-
tive (generally having a low acid content of 10 g/L H2SO4 to pH 2.5) for direct electro-
deposition of high-purity cathode copper. Electrowinning (EW) from these solutions
would give soft, powdery, and impure copper deposits.
Industrial EW requires pure copper-rich electrolytes (45e55 g/L Cu) with high con-
ductivity. This high concentration of copper ensures that (i) Cu2þ ions are always avail-
able for plating at the cathode surface at current densities that allow economical rates of
plating, being readily renewed by mass transfer and (ii) gives smooth, dense, high-purity,
readily marketable cathode copper. The high conductivity of the electrolyte is provided
by a high acid concentration, typically 175e190 g/L H2SO4.
SX provides the means for producing pure, concentrated Cu electrolytes from dilute,
impure leach liquors. It is a crucial step in the production of w4.64 million tonnes of
copper cathode per year (International Copper Study Group, 2018). The combined
technology of SXEW is important in enabling lower-grade materials to be economically
treated for recovery of copper by hydrometallurgical techniques.
15.1 The solvent extraction process
SX ﬂowsheets used in purifying of copper leach liquors comprise two essential contin-
uous processesdextraction and stripping (Fig. 15.1):
(a) In the extraction process, the PLS (feed to the SX process) (containing 1e20 g/L
Cu2þ, 0.5e15 g/L H2SO4) is contacted with an organic phase containing an organic
extractant that reacts selectively with Cu. The extractant complexes with Cu2þ,
resulting in transfer of the metal ion from the aqueous phase into the organic phase,
leaving all other impurity species present in the PLS in the aqueous phase.
(b) The organic phase, now containing Cu (known as the loaded organic phase), and the
aqueous phase, now depleted of Cu (known as the rafﬁnate), are separated by gravity.
(c) The rafﬁnate is recycled back to the leach circuit where the acid generated in the
extraction process can be used (see Section 15.2).

(d) In the stripping process, the Cu-loaded organic phase is contacted with a strong acid
spent (or lean, barren, weak) electrolyte (175e190 g/L H2SO4) from the EW circuit,
which strips Cu from the organic into the electrolyte.
(e) The Cu-depleted organic phase (known as the stripped or barren organic) and the Cu-
enriched aqueous phase (known as the advance, rich, loaded, or pregnant electrolyte) are
separated by gravity.
(f) The stripped organic phase is recycled back to the extraction circuit for renewed
contact with fresh PLS.
(g) The advance electrolyte is sent to EW where Cu2þ is reduced and electrodeposited
on the cathode as pure metallic copper.
15.2 Chemistry of copper solvent extraction
The organic extractant removes Cu2þ from the PLS by the following extraction reaction:

(15.1)
where RH represents the extractant (see Section 15.3).
From the Law of Mass Action (Le Chatelier’s Principle), loading of the extractant
with Cu2þ is favored by a low acid (Hþ) concentration in the aqueous phase. The dilute
H2SO4 concentration of the PLS (pH 1.5e2.5) permits extraction of Cu2þ from the
aqueous phase into the organic phase. Two protons (Hþ) are generated for each Cu2þ
that is extracted, so the extraction reaction produces acid.
The organic and aqueous phases are then separated by gravity. The rafﬁnate, which is
depleted in Cu2þ but enriched in Hþ, is returned to the leach circuit to dissolve more
copper. The copper-loaded organic phase is sent forward to the strip circuit where copper

Aqueous streams are shown as solids lines; organic ﬂows are indicated by dotted lines. The extraction
and strip circuits may each contain several stages, through which the aqueous and organic streams
ﬂow in counter-current directions (see Section 15.5). The PLS can contain a wide range of Cu concen-
trations; the SX output, however, delivers a consistent electrolyte composition to the EW circuit. Values

The equilibrium of the strip reaction is pushed to the right by the high acid concen-
tration of the spent electrolyte. Cu is stripped from the organic extractant, which regen-
erates the extractant for recycle back to the extraction circuit. The electrolyte is enriched
to the required high Cu2þ concentration necessary for EW.
SX is a reversible equilibrium-controlled process, which operates on a “pH swing.”
Extraction is favored by low aqueous-phase acidity and stripping is favored when the
aqueous phase contains a high acid concentration.
15.3 Composition of the organic phase
The organic phase comprises two essential components:
(a) the extractant is the active molecule that complexes with Cu2þ, enabling it to be
transferred from the aqueous to the organic phase;
(b) the diluent is an inert hydrocarbon carrier for the extractant that is added to reduce
the viscosity of the organic phase (so that it can be easily mixed with the aqueous
phases to allow mass transfer to occur) and the density of the organic phase (to allow
for gravity separation of the two phases).
The organic phase should be immiscible with CuSO4eH2SO4 solutions and ﬂuid
enough (viscosity of 2e10 cP) for pumping, continuous mixing, and gravity separation.
15.3.1 Extractants
Modern copper extractants are based on the oxime functionality. These molecules com-
plex with the Cu2þ ion in a process known as chelation (“chelate” coming from the
Greek word for “claw”) (Fig. 15.2). It is the nature of this chelating reaction that allows
these extractants to react very selectively with Cu, rejecting other species in the PLS to
the rafﬁnate.
There are four main classes of modern copper extractants (Table 15.1): ketoximes,
modiﬁed aldoximes, modiﬁed aldoximeeketoxime mixtures, and aldoximeeketoxime mixtures.
The selection of the extractant that is most appropriate for a given application depends
on the properties of the PLS (including the pH, Cu tenor, and nature of impurities),

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

the characteristics of the advance electrolyte required, the number of extraction and strip
stages available, and, often, on the prevailing economic conditions (which may inﬂuence
whether a particular plant is trying to achieve maximum copper recovery from the PLS or
maximum copper throughput) (Kordosky, 2008). Extractants are typically employed at
concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 vol.% in the diluent. The extractant concentration
chosen depends on the copper tenor of the PLS (see Section 15.7).
Ketoximes are relatively weak, low-selectivity extractants, but have high chemical
stability. They are therefore seldom used on their own, but are favored for niche appli-
cations, such as the treatment of leach solutions that contain species like nitrates (common
at some plants in the Atacama Desert of Chile), which are strong oxidizing agents and
would otherwise rapidly degrade the extractant (Hurtado-Guzman & Menacho, 2003;
Virnig, Eyzaguirre, Jo, & Calderon, 2003).
Aldoximes are considered strong extractants because they are able to extract copper
from high-tenor and low pH solutions; however, they can only be stripped by very
high acid concentrations (þ225 g/L H2SO4). Such high acid degrades the extractant
and is too corrosive for industrial EW. Aldoximes are therefore used in mixtures with
ketoximes and/or modiﬁers, such as highly branched alcohols or esters (Maes, Tinkler,
Moore, & Mejías, 2003). Modiﬁed aldoximes can be stripped at an acid strength compat-
ible with that of copper EW electrolytes and can be tailored to the desired extractant
strength. They exhibit better selectivity for Cu over Fe than aldoximeeketoxime mix-
tures and are often favored when the PLS has a high iron content. Aldoximeeketoxime
mixtures allow lower acid concentrations to be used for stripping and are appropriate
when PLS Cu tenors are lower and there is a low concentration of Fe in the PLS. Mix-
tures of modiﬁed aldoximes and ketoximes have properties intermediate between modi-
ﬁed aldoximes and aldoximeeketoxime mixtures.
15.3.2 Diluents
The selection of the diluent in which the extractant is dissolved depends on local avail-
ability, the concentration of extractant employed, and safety, health, and environmental
considerations. Diluents are moderately reﬁned, high-ﬂashpoint petroleum distillation
byproducts (puriﬁed kerosene) from the petrochemical industry. They range in aroma-
ticity from aliphatic (fully saturated hydrocarbon chains) to partially aromatic (containing
unsaturated ring structures). Some of the advantages and disadvantages of choosing an
aliphatic over partially aromatic diluent for Cu SX are given in Table 15.2.
Modern copper plants are concerned with minimizing their environmental impact
and carbon footprint, and ensuring safe working conditions for their operators (Hopkins,
2005; Miller, 2005; Smith, 2009). For these reasons, a diluent with the lowest possible
aromaticity that still gives favorable chemical and physical behavior is usually selected.
Diluents with <20% aromatic content are typically preferred, because these provide
Solvent extraction
411

the best compromise of properties: good solvation of the coppereextractant complex in
the organic phase, good phase separation from the aqueous phases, and acceptable health
and safety characteristics.
15.4 Equipment
Copper SX is carried out in mixer-settlers (Fig. 15.3). While details of the equipment
design vary (see, for example, Currie & Miller, 2018; Hursi & Saario, 2018; Mallory,
Kehn, Iniguez, & Filgueras, 2016; Taylor, 2007), the essential functions always consist
of the following steps:
Table 15.2 Comparative properties of aliphatic and partially aromatic diluents.
Advantages of aliphatic diluents
• higher ﬂash point assists in minimizing ﬁre risk
• lower volatility reduces evaporation losses and improves operator environment
• lower rate of oxidative degradation
• lower carbon footprint
Disadvantages of aliphatic diluents
• increased viscosity, especially at lower temperatures
• can reduce solubilization of complexes, especially at high extractant concentrations
• reduced solubility of impurities, which may increase crud formation
• less selective for Fe transfer by diluent
• slower rate of phase separation
• higher organic-in-aqueous entrainment, leading to higher extractant and diluent
consumptions
• May have poorer crud management

large settler, and the organic overﬂow/aqueous underﬂow system. Flow is distributed evenly across
the settler by passing the emulsion from the mixer ﬁrst through a chevron (not shown) and then
through one or more picket fences.
412
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

(a) the aqueous and organic phases are pumped into a mixer at predetermined rates;
(b) the two phases are mixed with an impeller in two or three mixing stages;
(c) the aqueouseorganic mixture overﬂows from the mixer through ﬂow distributors
into a ﬂat settler where the phases separate by gravity as they move along the length
of the settler based on the difference in their speciﬁc gravities (organic and aqueous
phases have speciﬁc gravities of approximately 0.85 and 1.1, respectively);
(d) the organic phase overﬂows and the aqueous phase underﬂows a weir at the far end
of the settler, leading to separation of the two phases.
Flowrates of aqueous and organic phases through mixer-settlers can range from 2 to
4000 m3/h.
15.4.1 Mixer designs
The mixer is designed to create a well-mixed aqueouseorganic dispersion to ensure good
mass transfer for the extraction and stripping reactions. The drop-size distribution should
be as narrow as possible, with minimum air entrainment, which can stabilize crud (see
Section 15.8.3), and without forming a stable emulsion (which inhibits subsequent phase
separation).
Modern mixers consist of two or three mixing chambers. The smaller ﬁrst chamber
employs a pumping impeller (w0.02 kWh/m3) because it is required to pump the two
phases into the mixer from an adjacent mixer-settler or a holding tank. Subsequent
mixers are larger and operate more gently (w0.01 kWh/m3), serving to maximize mass
transfer. The extraction and stripping kinetics of copper SX systems are relatively slow:
mixer aqueouseorganic contact times of 120e180 s are required for the chemistry to
approach equilibrium. Entrainment of very ﬁne droplets is avoided by using low tip-
speed (<350 m/min) impellers. Modern mixer designs, illustrated in Fig. 15.4, enable
good mass transfer while minimizing the formation of ﬁne drops (Hursi & Saario,
2018; Kokotov et al., 2010).

Figure 15.4 Modern mixer designs. The pumping and mixing functions are separated in Metso Out-
otec technology, using ﬁrst (a) a dispersion overﬂow pump (DOP) mixer, able to pump large ﬂow vol-
umes into the mixer, which achieves high mass-transfer efﬁciency while controlling the size of
droplets formed, followed by (b) Spirok mixers which allow gentle mixing of the emulsion and mini-
mize crud formation (Pekkala, Laitala, Nyman, Ekma, & Weatherseed, 2007). In the Tenova turbulent
settling design (c), homogeneous mixing with a narrow drop size distribution enhances the subse-
quent settling step and minimizes entrainment and crud losses (Kokotov et al., 2010).

15.4.2 Settler designs
The settler is designed to separate the dispersion into separate aqueous and organic layers.
When the aqueouseorganic dispersion overﬂows from the mixer, it passes through one
or more ﬂow distributors to give smooth, uniform forward ﬂow that allows the aqueous
and organic phases to separate across the full width of the settler (Taylor, 2007)
Large modern settlers are often square in plan and can vary in length up to 30 m,
depending on the PLS ﬂowrate. Settlers are usually wide to minimize linear velocity
at low organic depths and to minimize the crest height of the organic phase overﬂowing
the weirs. Settlers have a typical depth of 1 m. The aqueous phase is w0.5 m deep, while
the organic phase is w0.3 m deep. The vertical position of the aqueouseorganic inter-
face is controlled by an adjustable weir. Conventional copper SX settlers are usually
designed for a settling rate of 4e5 m3/m2h and a maximum linear velocity of each phase
of 0.06 m/s. This means that residence times of each phase in the settlers are 10e20 min,
which is sufﬁcient to achieve complete phase separation.
The main function of the settler is to ensure smooth horizontal ﬂow and clean sep-
aration (no entrainment) of the two phases, so considerable effort has gone into various
designs to promote coalescence and phase disengagement. The most common of these
are ﬂow distributors, known as chevrons or picket fences, which can be installed at various
positions along the length of the settler (Fig. 15.5A). They assist in slowing down the ve-
locity of the emulsion, which backs up behind the installation and the emulsion itself acts
as a coalescence medium. Construction using a hydrophobic or hydrophilic material can
assist with coalescence of the dispersed phase. Picket fences can be prone to mechanical
blockages if solids enter the settler or precipitation occurs.
Alternative conﬁgurations include the use of reverseeﬂow settlers (Fig. 15.5C), in which
the mixer overﬂow emulsion is directed into a launder running along the side of a settler,
before passing through an angled chevron and then settling in a direction back toward the
mixer (Tenova Advanced Technologies, 2018). The deep dispersion gate (DDG) and vertical
smooth flow (VSFX) are other patented designs that promote smooth ﬂow in the settler,
allowing additional time for the coalescence process (Fig. 15.5D, (Hursi, Saario, &
Weatherseed, 2018; Metso Outotec, 2020).
15.5 Circuit conﬁgurations
15.5.1 Series circuit
The simplest Cu SX circuit typically has two extraction stages in series, with counter-
current ﬂow of the aqueous and organic phases, and a single strip stage (Fig. 15.6A).
The two extraction stages typically transfer w90% of Cu present in the PLS onto the
extractant: the remaining Cu in the rafﬁnate is not lostdit merely circulates around
the leach circuit. The single strip stage strips 50%e65% of the Cu from the loaded organic
into the advance electrolyte (depending on the extractant and operating conditions): the
414
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

remainder circulates around the SX circuit. This 2Ee1S conﬁguration tends to predom-
inate in the industry, although 2Ee2S circuits are common in Chile and 3Ee2S circuits
are widely found in Africa.
The efﬁciency of Cu transfer can be increased by adding extraction and strip stages to
the circuit, increasing the extractant concentration, or changing the relative ﬂowrates
of the organic and aqueous ﬂowrates (the O/A ratio). Depending on the characteristics
of the PLS (pH, Cu tenor, and impurities), up to three extraction stages and two strip
stages may be employed.
In plants that have very large PLS ﬂowrates, the PLS may be split into several trains.
Each train is processed in an identical SX circuit, capable of treating 500e4000 m3/h.
Each train may transfer 20e380 t Cu from PLS to electrolyte per day, depending on
the Cu content and ﬂowrate of the PLS. Modern engineering practice often chooses
this ﬂow arrangement because it allows for minimizing production losses that may occur
should one circuit become nonfunctional in case of ﬁre or other damage because addi-
tional ﬂow can then be routed through the remaining trains (Hopkins, 2005).

15.5.2 Parallel and serieseparallel circuits
To increase copper production, a parallel or serieseparallel ﬂow arrangement may be used
instead of series ﬂow in the extraction circuit. In the example shown in Fig. 15.6B, PLS is
fed in parallel into the mixers of both extraction stages, while the ﬂow of the organic
phase remains the same as in the series circuit.
This arrangement allows the same circuit to process double the PLS ﬂowrate, pro-
vided that the extractant concentration is increased to transfer the additional copper.
The overall rate of copper transfer from the PLS to the EW circuit can therefore be
increased. Introducing a parallel ﬂow in a circuit is a low-cost way of increasing the pro-
ductivity of an existing series plant. A plant will often be converted from a series to

Figure 15.6 Plan views of (a) series and (b) parallel SX circuits with two extraction mixer-settlers and

ﬂow distances. This is also the reason that most plants are arranged in a “head-to-tail” arrangement,
as shown. Note the increased copper production that can result from a serieseparallel arrangement,
albeit with a higher rafﬁnate concentration (lower overall copper recovery from PLS). Details of the
ﬂowrates and Cu concentrations are given in Tables 15.3 and 15.4.

parallel or serieseparallel ﬂow conﬁguration toward the end of the plant life. When the
ore grades are reduced, the Cu concentration in the leach liquor decreases but the leach
volumes remain the same, so copper production can be maintained by increasing the PLS
throughout (Nisbett et al., 2008, Nisbett, Peabody, & Crane, 2009).
The disadvantage of this circuit is that overall copper recoveries are reduced (i.e., raf-
ﬁnate Cu tenors increase) due to lower efﬁciency of extracting Cu from the PLS into the
organic than using a series circuit. This is because (i) the parallel portion of the PLS goes
through only one extraction mixer-settler (rather than two) before returning to leach and
(ii) the series portion of the PLS is contacted with organic phase that is already partially
loaded with Cu in the second extraction stage, so extraction efﬁciency in the ﬁrst extrac-
tion stage is reduced.
15.5.3 Inclusion of a wash stage
In some circuits, a wash stage is included is included between the extraction and strip cir-
cuits. The purpose of this circuit is to “wash out” impurities that are physically entrained in
the loaded organic phase to avoid these being transferred to the electrolyte. The wash
liquor is typically dilute H2SO4 (pH 2). The spent wash liquor is returned to the extrac-
tion circuit to ensure that no copper is lost.
Examples of impurities that may be carried across are chlorides and nitrates (anionic
species that are not chemically complexed by the extractant), as well as Fe, Mn, and Co
that may be present in the PLS (Bednarski & McCallum, 2016). Many plants in the Ata-
cama Desert of Chile, where the PLS contains signiﬁcant quantities of chlorides and ni-
trates, use a wash stage (Hein, 2005).
15.6 Quantitative design of a series circuit
This section describes how a preliminary design of a series SX circuit is carried out. It is
based on the design criteria in Table 15.3 and the circuit illustrated in Fig. 15.6A.

15.6.1 Determination of extractant concentration required
As a starting point, one “rule of thumb” used in the industry is that for each 1 g/L Cu
extraction required, the concentration of extractant required will be approximately 4
vol.%. Therefore, for a PLS containing 4 g/L Cu, an extractant concentration of 16
vol.% is required. The SX plant requires 1000 m3/h of 16 vol.% extractant diluted in
an appropriate diluent (see Section 15.3.2) to be pumped into the extraction circuit.
This calculation is the ﬁrst step in selecting the composition of the organic phase for a
proposed SX circuit. The chosen organic must then be tested with actual leach and EW
solutions to ensure suitability for the proposed operation.
15.6.2 Determination of extraction and stripping isotherms
Experimental laboratory test work is carried out to determine the equilibrium loading
and stripping characteristics of the selected organic phase with the PLS and electrolyte
compositions. An extraction isotherm is measured by contacting the PLS and stripped
organic phase batchwise at different O/A ratios, allowing each system to reach equilib-
rium. The Cu concentrations in each phase are analyzed. By plotting the Cu in the
aqueous phase against the Cu in the organic phase, the maximum loading of Cu into
that particular organic phase can be determined (Fig. 15.7A). Stripping isotherms can
be similarly determined using loaded organic and spent electrolyte as the input streams.
15.6.3 Determination of extraction efﬁciency
Using the experimental extraction isotherm and the speciﬁed extraction O/A, a
McCabeeThiele construction can be employed to determine the rafﬁnate concentration
that will be produced from two stages of counter-current contact of PLS and stripped
organic. The graphical output is seen in Fig. 15.7A. This shows that, for the operating
conditions speciﬁed in Table 15.3, the rafﬁnate will contain 0.2 g/L Cu, which corre-
sponds to an extraction efﬁciency of 94.8%. This calculation also shows that the
maximum loading of the extractant is 7.5 g/L Cu under these conditions.
15.6.4 Determination of equilibrium stripped organic Cu concentration
The high H2SO4 concentration in spent electrolyte (180 g/L) strips Cu from the loaded
organic into the electrolyte (Eq. 15.2). From the strip isotherm (Fig. 15.7A), it is deter-
mined that the 50 g/L Cu electrolyte speciﬁed for return to the EW tankhouse will be at
equilibrium with w3.8 g/L Cu in the stripped organic phase.
15.6.5 Transfer of Cu extraction into organic phase
The overall mass ﬂow rate for the extraction of Cu into the organic phase is given by the
following mass balance:
Cu extraction ðkg=h CuÞ ¼ PLS flowrate

m3=h

ðCu in PLS  Cu in raffinateÞðg=LÞ
(15.3)
418
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

In this case (and converting to appropriate units)
Cu extraction ðkg=h CuÞ
¼ 1000 m3=h PLS  ð4.0 g=L Cu in PLS  0.2 g=L Cu in raffinateÞ ¼ 3800 kg=h Cu.
This is also the overall mass ﬂow rate at which metallic copper will have to be plated
in the EW tankhouse. This allows the design engineer to calculate the cathode area and
current density required for the proposed EW plant (see Chapter 16).
15.6.6 Determination of electrolyte ﬂowrate required to strip Cu transferred
Section 15.6.5 indicates that the EW plant must plate 3800 kg/h metallic copper. For the
strip circuit, this means that 3800 kg/h Cu must be transferred from the loaded organic
phase to the electrolyte. By mass balance and using the speciﬁed compositions of spent

In other words, the O/A in the strip circuit will be 1000 m3/h (organic ﬂowrate)/
253 m3/h (aqueous ﬂowrate) ¼ 4.

speciﬁed (O/A ratio) and the extraction efﬁciency that could be achieved using these
operating parameters was calculated from the McCabeeThiele construction. An alterna-
tive approach to the circuit design is to specify the extraction efﬁciency required, say 97%,
and then calculate what O/A is required to achieve this value. It may be necessary to add
a third extraction stage to achieve the speciﬁed extraction efﬁciency. Alternatively, by
using two strip stages (instead of one), the stripping will be more efﬁcient, so the Cu con-
centration on the loaded organic phase will be lower and greater transfer of Cu will be
possible.
Sophisticated software is today available that is able to quickly and accurately model
such scenarios. This allows a circuit to be designed and tested for robustness using a com-
puter model, thereby minimizing the experimental work that is required to optimize a
circuit design for a particular project (Du Preez & Taute, 2015; BASF, 2020; Solvay,
2020).

seriesparallel circuit (Fig. 15.6B). All parameters remain the same as indicated in
Table 15.3: the only difference is that PLS is fed to both extraction stages.
The extraction and stripping isotherms are shown in Fig. 15.7B and the performance
results are shown in Table 15.4. The seriesparallel circuit allows a higher rate of Cu

throughput (i.e., increases overall Cu production), but at the expense of lower overall Cu
recovery from the PLS. A series circuit will usually be converted to a seriesparallel cir-
cuit when the Cu tenor of the PLS drops signiﬁcantly (see Section 15.5.2).
15.8 Minimizing impurity transfer and maximizing electrolyte purity
To produce high-purity copper cathode in EW (Chapter 16), the advance electrolyte
produced by the SX step must minimize contamination from impurities. An efﬁcient
extractant must therefore transfer Cu from the PLS to the electrolyte while not transfer-
ring impurities, particularly Fe, Mn, and Cl.
There are three mechanisms by which impurities can be carried forward to the
electrolyte:
(a) chemical transfer, in which cationic impurity species are coextracted by the extractant
along with Cu2þ;
(b) physical transfer, in which ﬁnely divided droplets of aqueous phase are not completely
separated from the organic phase after mixing and are transferred to the strip circuit
in the loaded organic phase;
(c) crud formation, in which unwanted solids move through the circuit and can transfer
adsorbed impurities.
15.8.1 Coextraction of impurities
Modern oxime extractants, particularly modiﬁed aldoximes, are very selective for Cu
over other cations (see Fig. 15.8). Fe(III) is the only cation typically present in a leach
solution that can complex to a limited extent with the extractant. Coextraction of Fe
can be minimized by appropriate control of pH and by operating at a high loading of
the extractant by Cu, which means that Fe is “pushed off” the organic phase due to
lack of capacity (Tinkler, Cronje, Soto, Delvallee, & Hangoma, 2009). It should be

noted, however, that the presence of up to 2 g/L Fe in the electrolyte is beneﬁcial to the
EW process (see Section 16.5.2.3).
15.8.2 Transfer of impurities to electrolyte by entrainment
Both cationic and anionic impurities can be transferred from the PLS to the advance elec-
trolyte as dispersed droplets in the loaded organic phase. This is known as aqueous-in-
organic entrainment. This can cause both beneﬁcial and deleterious elements to deport
to the electrolyte (Cole et al., 2016).
Anions present in the PLS are not chemically complexed by the cation exchanger
employed as the extractant, but can be transferred through the SX circuit by entrainment.
Chloride can have very detrimental effects in EW (see Section 16.5.2.6), causing pitting
corrosion of stainless-steel cathode blanks and the evolution of corrosive Cl2 gas. Nitrates
are a strong oxidizing agent that can degrade the SX organic phase and cause the depo-
sition of nodules in EW. Mn(II) that reports to EW can be oxidized to higher valence
states, where it can cause loss of current efﬁciency and degradation of the organic phase
in SX (Bednarksi, Soderstrom, & Wiggett, 2011).
Transfer of Fe from the PLS to the electrolyte is beneﬁcial in small amounts (see
Section 16.5.2.3) and particularly if high concentrations of Mn are present (Abbey &
Moats, 2018; Miller, 2011). Deportment of Co from the leach liquor to EW is also help-
ful in reducing operating costs, because CoSO4 needs to be added to the electrolyte to
reduce anode oxidation (see Section 16.4.6.2).
In many of the African Copper belt operations, silica is present in high quantities
in the ores and deports to the PLS, where it creates signiﬁcant operating problems in
SX (Sole & Tinkler, 2016). It can transfer through the circuit in colloidal form,
cause crud formation, and cause severe difﬁculties in holding phase continuity and
achieving phase separation. Approaches to dealing with silica include use of an upfront
diluent wash (Alexander, van der Merwe, Lumbule, & Kgomo, 2018), changing phase
continuity (see Section 15.13.2, Kashala et al., 2018), and use of various additives

(Bender, Catling, Milligan, & Delgado, 2018; Brown et al., 2018; Sole, Crundwell,
Dlamini, & Kruger, 2018).
Physical entrainment of the dispersed phase in the continuous phase and its transfer
through the SX circuit can be minimized by the following:
(a) appropriate choice of diluent to promote acceptable phase disengagement and to
minimize transfer of neutral species by solvation by the diluent;
(b) choice of a low-density, low-viscosity extractant, particularly for circuits in which a
high extractant concentration is required;
(c) avoiding overmixing and air entrainment into the mixing boxes (see Section 15.4.1);
(d) installing picket fences or other features in the settler to promote phase disengage-
ment (see Section 15.4.2);
(e) ensuring adequate residence time for phase disengagement in the settlers;
(f) contacting the loaded organic phase in a holding tank with a hydrophobic media
(such as polymer scrap) that will assist coalescence of the aqueous droplets;
(g) “washing out” droplets of PLS from the loaded organic in a wash stage (see
Section 15.5.3).
15.8.3 Crud
Almost all SX circuits experience a phenomenon known as crud formation. Crud is a
solid-stabilized emulsion that is formed from various contaminants in the SX circuit.
These can include solids in the PLS (colloidal silica from dust or from silica present in
the PLS), vegetation, mold, organic degradation precipitates, carryover of organic con-
stituents from up- and down-stream operations, and air entrainment (Mbao et al.,
2018; Sole, 2008).
Crud usually forms a layer at the aqueouseorganic interface of the settler or ﬂoats on
the surface of the organic phase. Small amounts of interfacial crud can be beneﬁcial to
phase separation, by acting as a coalescence medium. Large amounts can occupy a signif-
icant volume of the settler and may cause deterioration of the rate of phase separation.
Floating crud is more harmful, because this can move from one stage to another with
the organic phase, thereby transferring adsorbed and entrained impurities through the
circuit to the electrolyte.
Crud formation is minimized by minimizing the amount of solids entering the SX
circuit in the PLS. This is done by allowing the PLS to settle in ponds and by directing
rain runoff away from PLS collection areas. Agitation and pressure leaching solutions can
be processed through clariﬁcation equipment, such as countercurrent decantation
thickeners followed by pinned-bed clariﬁers, ahead of the SX circuit. Minimizing air
entrainment to the mixers and dust egress to the circuit (by installed roofs over the SX
mixer-settlers) and careful selection of extractant and diluent for a particular application
can be helpful in mitigating the detrimental effects of crud (Sole, 2008). Additives that
reduce crud formation can also be employed (Mbao et al., 2018).
Solvent extraction
423

Crud is removed from the settler by regular vacuum pumping (Fig. 15.9, Megaw,
Muzadi, Kashala, & Sanchez, 2016). In extreme cases, it may be necessary to periodically
empty the settler and pump the crud from the settler ﬂoor. Crud is usually separated from
its host organic by ﬁltering on a plate-and-frame or vacuum-drum ﬁlter. A centrifuge can
also be used (Hartmann, Horbach, & Kramer, 2010; Mukutuma, Mbao, Schwartz,
Chisakuta, & Feather, 2007). The liquid portion can be washed out with diluent, organic,
or water in a reslurry tank. The crud solids are usually sent to the leach heaps and the
organic component is returned to the SX circuit after clay treatment (see Section
15.9.1, Cole, Zambra, Bednarski, Thomas, & Soderstrom, 2015).
15.9 Operational considerations
15.9.1 Stability of operation
Industrial SX circuits are easily controlled and forgiving, allowing a consistent electrolyte
composition to be transferred to EW.
Consider, for example, how the circuit examined in Section 15.6 responds to an in-
crease in Cu concentration in PLS (which would happen if more easily leached ore is
encountered in the mine). Suppose that the PLS tenor increases from the 4 g/L Cu in
Fig. 15.6A to 4.4 g/L Cu. Using the extraction isotherm of Fig. 15.7A with the new
PLS composition, it can be shown that (Fig. 15.10A)
(a) the rafﬁnate will now contain 0.3 g/L Cu rather than 0.2 g/L Cu;
(b) the overall extraction efﬁciency decreases from 95% to 93%;
(b) but 4090 kg/h Cu will be transferred to the loaded organic phase instead of 3800 kg
Cu.
The resulting ﬂows and Cu concentrations are shown in Fig. 15.7B. Of course, the
rate at which copper is plated in EW will also have to increase to 4090 kg/h Cu. This
can be done by increasing current density and/or by bringing unused cells into operation.

aqueous and organic layers in an operating plant. (b) Vacuuming of crud from the bottom of the

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

15.9.2 Phase continuity
When two phases are mixed, the emulsion that forms will be either aqueous continuous,
containing organic droplets (the dispersed phase) in an aqueous matrix (the continuous
phase), or it may be organic continuous, with aqueous droplets dispersed in an organic phase
(Sole, 2008).
Copper SX plants usually operate with organic-continuous mixing. The rate of phase
separation is usually faster from an organic-continuous emulsion. Organic continuity also
ensures compact crud formation and minimizes crud movement through the circuit.

match the rate at which Cu is being transferred from PLS to electrolyte. (a) Modiﬁed McCabeeThiele

trations and solution ﬂows for the new PLS. Note that the only operating variable that has to be

Solvent extraction
425

As shown in Fig. 15.11 (Cramer & Tinkler, 2019), the aqueous phase that settles out after
organic-continuous mixing should contain no organic droplets, so losses to aqueous
phases that leave the circuit (rafﬁnate and advance electrolyte) are minimized. In certain
instances, however, it may be more appropriate to operate speciﬁc stages in aqueous
continuity.
15.9.3 Organic health, losses, and recovery
Ensuring ongoing health of the organic phase is critical to successful SX operation. The
conditions of the organic phase affect both physical and metallurgical performance: poor
organic quality can compromise overall copper recovery, decrease extraction and strip
kinetics and Cu/Fe selectivity, increase phase disengagement times and entrainment,
and cause crud problems (Cole, Zambra, Bednarski, Thomas, & Soderstrom, 2015).
These issues will have detrimental effects on operating costs, reagent consumption, elec-
trolyte purity, and the quality of the copper cathode.
One of the main operating costs of an SX plant is the replacement of extractant and
diluent. The main cause of diluent loss is evaporation. Both extractant and diluent are
lost to crud (Section 15.8.3) and by entrainment in the rafﬁnate and advance electrolyte
(Section 15.8.2). Both extractant and diluent can be destroyed by hydrolysis and chemical
degradation. Appropriate choice of diluent and a roof over settlers can minimize evapo-
rative losses (Bishop et al., 1999). Losses to crud can be prevented by minimizing crud
formation in the circuit and recovering the contained organic phase (Section 15.9.3).
Organic entrainment losses can be minimized or recovered by passing the aqueous stream
through an aftersettler, or through a coalescer, ﬂotation cell, activated carbon column, or
dual media or CoMatrix ﬁlter. These types of equipment all allow additional settling time
and promote coalescence, so that the organic phase can be recovered and returned to the
SX circuit (Greene & Rubio, 2010).

sues and troubleshooting. In B. Wassink, & E. Asselin (Eds.), Copper hydrometallurgy: Principles and

426
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The host organic is regenerated by mixing it with acid-activated bentonite clay or
zeolite then ﬁltering (Cole, Zambra, Bednarski, Thomas, & Soderstrom, 2015;
Quilodran, Soderstrom, & Zambra, 2015). This process also removes degradation prod-
ucts (formed by oxidative degradation of the extractant and diluent) from the organic
phase, which can also be harmful to phase separation and extraction kinetics. The organic
is then returned to the SX circuit.
15.10 Industrial solvent extraction plants
SX plants are designed to match the production rate at which Cu is leached in the preced-
ing leach operation. They vary in capacity from 5 to 400 kt Cu per year (Table 2.7).
Table 15.5 gives operational details of ﬁve SX plants. These include plants in which the
leach liquors are generated by dump and run-of-mine leaching, heap leaching, and pres-
sure leaching. The range of operating conditions is evident, demonstrating the versatility of
this technology. Further details are given in Sole, Taute, Tinkler, Steeples, & Zarate, 2019.
15.11 Safety in solvent extraction plants
SX plants contain large volumes of combustible organic components, so the risk of a cata-
strophic ﬁre is always present. Extreme care must be taken in both the design and oper-
ation of SX circuits to minimize and mitigate this hazard (Hopkins, 2005; Miller, 2005;
Smith, 2009). In particular, the potential for the formation and occurrence of organic
aerosols and mist droplets must be paid particular attention, because these can create con-
ditions for static electricity.
Some design issues to consider include the following:
•
Splitting the PLS into parallel trains that are spaced sufﬁciently far apart to avoid loss of
the entire SX circuit in the event of an incident;
•
Use conductive piping and vessels, minimize pipe velocities and pipe lengths, and
ensure that pipes always run full;
•
Minimize the energy input by use of low-turbulence mixer designs and low-pressure
organic pump;
•
All tanks should have bottom entry.
Operational good practices include the following:
•
Avoiding potential for static electricity occurrence;
•
Avoiding aerosol formation, particularly “waterfall” effects in launders and overﬂows;
•
SX area should be fenced and access restricted;
•
Only intrinsically safe radios, tools, and instrumentation should be used and hot-work
permits required;
•
Control spillage and regularly remove organic from aqueous tanks and ponds;
•
Ensure that safe crud-removal procedures are in place;
•
Use appropriate personal protective equipment to ensure that operators are always
electrically grounded to earth.

15.12 Current and future developments
15.12.1 Extractants
With the development of ﬂowsheets that are able to treat sulﬁde materials using hydro-
metallurgical techniques, the use of pressure oxidation for leaching is increasing. The
need to process these high-temperature liquors has led to the recent introduction of
an SX reagent that does not employ oxime functionality and is stable at elevated temper-
atures (Bender, Ya~nez, Copp, & McDonald, 2018).
Another application in which reagent degradation must be avoided is the processing
of high-nitrate (up to 40 g/L) liquors, such as in some Chilean operations (Virnig,
Eyzaguirre, Jo, & Calderon, 2003). Nitration-resistant extractant formulations are
available for use at such sites (Ya~nez, Soto, Soderstrom, & Bednarski, 2009). At sites
that contain high levels of Mn in the leach liquor, oxidation-resistant formulations
can be used to reduce the risk of degradation that could result from permanganate for-
mation in EW owing to entrainment of PLS (Cramer & Tinkler, 2019).
15.12.2 Equipment
The enormous capital cost of building a new plant can be offset to an extent by short-
ening the project timeline from conception to installation. Many new plants are today
being built in countries or locations that are difﬁcult to access and/or have poor local en-
gineering infrastructure. For these reasons, it is desirable to carry out as much of the
manufacturing as possible prior to delivery of the equipment to site. This has been
very successfully achieved by modularizing the design of mixer-settlers, so that they
can be readily transported in standard container sizes (Fig. 15.12). Almost all equipment
construction can be done in the country of origin under the direct supervision of the
manufacturer and the ﬁnal product can be readily installed on site in a very short time.
This approach leads to lower engineering and construction costs, faster project delivery,

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

15.13 Summary
Impure leach solutions containing relatively low concentrations of copper are processed
to high copper concentration, pure EW electrolytes by SX. It is a crucial step in produc-
ing high-purity electrowon copper from leached ores.
The SX process consists of extracting Cu2þ from aqueous PLS into a copper-speciﬁc
organic extractant, separating the aqueous and organic phases by gravity, and then strip-
ping Cu2þ from the organic extractant into high-H2SO4 electrolyte returned from the
EW circuit. The process is continuous and is carried out in large mixer-settlers.
The SX process is equilibrium-controlled. Loading of Cu into the organic extractant
is favored by the low acid concentration (0.5e5 g/L H2SO4) of the PLS. Stripping of Cu
from the organic extractant is favored by the high acid concentration (180e190 g/L
H2SO4) of the electrolyte.
The copper-speciﬁc organic extractants used in the copper industry are modiﬁed
aldoximes, ketoximes, and modiﬁed aldoximeeketoxime and aldoximeeketoxime mix-
tures. The relative strength of the extractant can be tailored for the particular application.
The extractant is dissolved in a kerosene-type diluent to a concentration appropriate to
the Cu tenor of the PLS (typically 5e40 vol.%).
About 4.64 million tonnes of Cu per year are treated by SX followed by EW. Copper
production by SXEW continues to grow as increasing volumes of ore and concentrates
are processed by leaching technologies.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

CHAPTER 16
Electrowinning
Chapters 14 and 15 show how leaching followed by solvent extraction (SX) produces a
high-purity CuSO4eH2SO4 electrolyte containing w45 g/L Cu2þ. This chapter ex-
plains how the Cu2þ ions in this electrolyte are reduced and electrowon as pure metallic
copper in the form of cathodes.
The purity speciﬁcations of the copper cathode are dictated by the various interna-
tional metal exchanges. Table 13.1 shows the purity requirements for copper cathode
sold to the London Metal Exchange (LME) and New York Mercantile Exchange
(Comex) (LME, 2020).
16.1 The electrowinning process
The electrowinning (EW) process entails the following:
(a) immersing metal cathodes and inert (but conductive) anodes into a puriﬁed electrolyte
containing CuSO4 and H2SO4;
(b) applying an electrical current from an external source, such as a rectiﬁer, which
causes current to ﬂow through the electrolyte between the cathodes and anodes;
(c) plating pure metallic copper from the electrolyte onto the cathodes using the energy
provided by the electrical current to drive the reduction of the Cu2þ ions to Cu0
metal.
The cathodes are usually stainless-steel blanks. The anodes are usually rolled Pb alloy
sheets; titanium with a precious metal oxide coating is also used in some modern oper-
ations. Copper is electroplated onto the cathodes for 4e7 days, after which the plated
copper is machine-stripped from the stainless-steel cathode blanks, washed, packaged,
and sold.
Almost 4 million tonnes of copper are electrowon per year (International Copper
Study Group, 2019). Almost all of this is produced by leacheSXeEW, although a small
proportion is by direct EW from a leach solution.
16.2 Chemistry of copper electrowinning
The EW cathode reaction is the same as for electroreﬁning, i.e.:
Cu2þ þ 2e/Cu0
E0 ¼ þ0.34 V
(16.1)
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Sixth Edition

The anode reaction is, however, completely different. Water is decomposed at the
inert anode to form oxygen gas and release protons:
H2O / Hþ þ OH/1
=
2O2 þ 2Hþ þ 2e
E0 ¼ 1.23 V
(16.2)
The overall EW reaction is the sum of Reactions (16.1) and (16.2) plus sulfate ions:
Cu2þ þ SO2
4
þ H2O/Cu0 þ 1
=
2O2 þ 2Hþ þ SO2
4
E0 ¼ 0.89 V
(16.3)
The EW products are as follows:
(a) pure copper metal at the cathode;
(b) oxygen gas at the anode;
(c) regenerated sulfuric acid in the electrolyte.
The copper is stripped from the cathode blank, washed, packed, and strapped into
bundles weighing 1e3 t, and sent to market. The oxygen bubbles burst at the surface
of the electrolyte and are released to the atmosphere. The acid is returned to SX in
Cu-depleted spent electrolyte where the free Hþ ions are used to strip Cu from the
loaded organic phase into the advance electrolyte (Eq. 15.2).
16.3 Electrical requirements
The electrical potential or cell voltage needed for EW is w2.0 V, compared with w0.3 V
for electroreﬁning (Chapter 13). As illustrated in Fig. 16.1 (Nicol, 2006), the voltage com-
ponents comprise the following:
Figure 16.1 Current and voltage contributions to power consumption in a copper electrowinning cell
(see text for symbols). Although the theoretical power requirement is w750 kWh/t Cu (dark-shaded
area), the actual power requirement is approximately 2000 kWh/t (dark- þ light-shaded areas), which
represents an energy efﬁciency of about 30%. It is therefore extremely important to minimize the en-
ergy inﬂuences of side reactions, shorts, and stray currents. (From Nicol, M. (2006). Electrowinning and
electroreﬁning of metals. Short course. Murdoch University, Perth.)

•
current inefﬁciencies due to shorts, CIs

The power consumption, P, is the product of current and voltage (Eq. 16.4), which is
given by the total area under the graph in Fig. 16.1:
P ¼ VI:
(16.4)
The rate of plating of Cu from solution is given by Faraday’s Law:
m ¼ MItx=nF;
(16.5)
where m is the mass of Cu plated (g);
M is the molar mass of Cu (63.54 g/mol);
I is the current passed (A);
t is the time for which the current is passed (s);
x is the current efﬁciency (i.e., the fraction of the total current used in producing Cu)
(see Section 16.7);
n is the number of electrons involved in the plating of Cu (equal to 2 from Eq. 16.1);
F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C/mol ¼ 96 485 As/mol).
The theoretical power consumption for plating 1 t of copper is therefore
P ¼ ð1.23  0.34Þ V  2=mol  96 485 As
63.54 g=mol
¼ 2703 Ws=g ¼ 754 kWh=t Cu
In practice, the energy requirement for copper EW is w2000 kWh/t. This is consid-
erably greater than that for copper electroreﬁning (200e300 kWh/t Cu). This difference
is due to the large voltage requirements for EW, as well as current losses. The energy
efﬁciency of Cu EW is therefore only about 30%.
16.4 Equipment
16.4.1 Cathodes
Most copper EW tankhouses employ reuseable 316L stainless-steel cathode blanks,
which are virtually identical to electroreﬁning cathodes. LDX duplex and superior grades
of stainless steels are also used for cathode blanks. Using a blank material onto which
Electrowinning
439

copper is plated in the EW process is known as permanent cathode technology (Fig. 16.2).
The selection of cathode material is based on a trade-off between cost, lifetime, conduc-
tivity (a higher conductivity provides lower resistance), better weldability to copper
header bars, and the need for high corrosion resistance (such as in tankhouses that operate
with a high-chloride electrolyte) (Glencore Technology, 2019, 2020a; Pranowo, Aslin,
Eriksson, & Heferen, 2019). A few older EW tankhouses use copper starter sheets as the
cathodes. The starter sheets are obtained from an electroreﬁnery or are made in a separate
section of the EW tankhouse itself using stainless steel or titanium as starter cathode
blanks.
The size of the cathodes is determined by industry standards (to ﬁt efﬁciently into
shipping containers) and by the openings in the furnaces in which the copper will be
remelted (see Chapter 21). The standard size is 1.2 m  1 m; jumbo cathodes with a
length up to 1.4 m are sometimes produced, but these can be more difﬁcult to handle.

permanent cathodes. Copper sheets are (c) stripped from the blank by an (d) automatic or (e) robotic
stripping machine, (f) corrugated or (g) clinched, packed, and (h) strapped for shipping. The corruga-
tions or clinches are introduced so that the cathode stack melts more easily when the cathodes are
melted and cast (see Chapter 21). (Photographs (c) Courtesy of M. Nicol, Murdoch University; (d), (e), and

440
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Plastic edge strips are used on the sides of the blanks to avoid plating around the sides
of the cathode. The bottoms of the blanks are either wax dipped or have a V groove to
allow for easy removal of the plated copper.
Cathode blanks are attached to a hanger bar that provides the electrical contact be-
tween the cathode and the electrical circuit. The material of the two points of contact
is copper, owing to its high conductivity. The method of attachment of the cathode
blank to the hanger bar is important in ensuring that the acidic electrolyte or generated
acid mist (see Section 16.5.4) does not damage the cathode.
Automated cathode stripping machines are widely used today, particularly using ro-
bots. These enable stripping rates of up to 600 cathodes/h (Aslin, Eriksson, Heferen, &
Sue Yek, 2010; Larinkari, Nord, & Schmidt, 2016, 2019). Automation enables rapid and
repeatable removal of the copper from the blank, while maximizing the physical quality
of the copper and minimizing damage to the blanks.
16.4.2 Anodes
16.4.2.1 Lead alloy anodes
Most modern copper EW tankhouses use anodes comprising cold-rolled lead (Pb)
alloyed with 1.35% Sn and 0.07%e0.08% Ca. Sn provides strength, corrosion resistance,
and corrosion layer conductivity; Ca improves the mechanical properties and decreases
the anode potential; cold rolling adds strength (Mirza et al., 2016; Prengaman, Ellis, &
Mirza, 2010). A few older plants still use PbeSn or PbeSb alloys, but these are being
gradually replaced with PbeSneCa anodes.
A PbeSneCa alloy slab is soldered onto a slotted copper hanger bars for support in
the EW cells (Fig. 16.3A). Lead is then electrodeposited around the joints to protect them
from corrosion. The anode size is slightly smaller than the cathode size (about 30 mm on
Figure 16.3 (a) Pb alloy anodes. (b) Coated titanium anode installed at Kristiansand, Norway. ((a)

the width and height) to modify the electric ﬁeld lines to ensure that Cu plating does not
occur around the sides of the cathode.
Anodes are ﬁtted with several polymer spacer insulators, buttons, or straps that pre-
vent contact with the cathode to avoid short circuiting and minimize lead corrosion
product carryover from anodes to electrodepositing copper.
The life expectancy of a lead anode is typically 6e9 years (Beukes & Badenhorst,
2009; Sole, Moats, Sandoval, Robinson, & Davenport, 2019). The anodes slowly
corrode in the sulfuric acid electrolyte, forming an adherent, inert, insoluble PbO2 layer
on the surface (Cifuentes et al., 2005; Mirza et al., 2016; Nikoloski, Nicol, & Stuart,
2010). This minimizes Pb contamination of the cathode copper and extends anode
life. The components of the anode either dissolve in the electrolyte or fall to the bottom
of the EW cell as insoluble lead sludge. This is periodically removed from the cells and
sent to a recycling facility for the recovery of lead.
16.4.2.2 Coated titanium anodes
Titanium-based anodes are now increasingly installing in new tankhouses (Åkre &
Rosseland, 2019; Zhang et al., 2017, Zhang, 2018). These comprise a titanium mesh
or sheet with a precious metal coating, usually an oxide of Ir or Ru (see Fig. 16.3B)
(Morimitsu, Oshiumi, & Wada, 2010). These anodes are therefore also known as mixed
metal oxide or dimensionally stable anodes.
Use of these anodes minimizes Pb contamination, there is no need for cell cleaning,
and operator exposure to heavy metals is reduced due to the elimination of lead sludge
(Sandoval, Clayton, Dominguez, Unger, & Robinson, 2010; Sandoval, Garcia, Neff, &
Schnebly, 2013). There is no need for Co2þ addition to the electrolyte (see Section
16.5.3.2). These anodes offer a 0.3e0.4 V decrease in oxygen overpotential (see Section
16.3), which lowers energy consumption by about 15%. The oxygen bubble size gener-
ated by these anodes is also smaller, so acid mist control requirements are reduced (see
Section 16.5.4). These anodes are expensive owing to their precious metals content
and titanium structure. They require careful handling to avoid damaging the oxide sur-
face layer. They are not suitable for operation in electrolytes containing signiﬁcant
amounts of Mn.
16.4.3 Cell design
A typical cell design is shown in Fig. 16.4. EW cells, anodes, and cathodes are somewhat
larger than those used for electroreﬁning:
cells: up to 9.4 m long  1.2 m wide  1.5 m deep
anodes: 1.1 m long  0.9 m wide  0.006 m thick
cathodes: 1.2 m long  1.0 m wide  0.003 m thick.
Most modern cells are constructed of polymer concrete (Currie & Miller, 2018;
Moats & Free, 2019; Robinson et al., 2012). Some designs use reinforced concrete
with a chemically resistant lining, such as welded or spray-coated polyvinyl chloride.
Older tankhouses have cell linings of rubber, lead, or an epoxy resin coating. The length
442

of the cell depends on the spacing between the electrodes. Modern designs tend to
reduce the anodeecathode spacing to accommodate more plating capacity for a given
ﬂoor area, with up to 90 cathodes per cell (Forner et al., 2018). Typical anodeecathode
spacing is 45e50 mm.
The anodes and cathodes are interleaved as in electroreﬁning (Fig. 16.5). All anodes in
a cell are held at a single potential; the cathodes are at a lower potential. The electrodes
within a cell are connected in parallel, but the cells of a tankhouse are connected in series.
Current is carried between electrodes and between cells using copper busbars. To mini-
mize heat losses through the busbars, the current is limited to 1e1.2 A/m2. Where par-
allel busbars are run, a gap between them allows for cooling.
16.5 Operational practice
16.5.1 Current density
Cathode current density in modern plants varies from 200 to above 450 A/m2 (Flores,
Mu~noz, & Zarate, 2010; Sole, Moats, Sandoval, Robinson, & Davenport, 2019). This
gives a plating rate of 0.4e1.0 kg/h of copper on each cathode.

occurrence of poor contacts of electrodes with the busbar. The plastic beads on the surface of the
electrolyte minimize the effects of acid mist (see Section 16.5.4). (Photographs courtesy of Multotec

Electrical contact is via busbars. An electrolyte input manifold for uniformly distributing electrolyte
over all the cathode faces is shown. Single multiholed horizontal pipes on the cell ﬂoor are also used.
Electrowinning

Cathodes are plated to a thickness of 5e8 mm (typically 50e55 kg Cu on each side of
a stainless-steel blank), which means that the cathodes are harvested every 4e7 days,
depending on the applied current density. In a modern tankhouse using an overhead
crane, every second or third cathode is harvested from a particular cell at a time, leaving
the remaining cathodes available to continue plating (Fig. 16.6). The cathodes remaining
in the cell will temporarily experience a considerably higher current density, so it is
important to minimize the time required for cathode change-outs. This procedure main-
tains an adherent corrosion product layer on the anodes and minimizes lead contamina-
tion of the electrodepositing copper. The longer plating is continued, the greater is the
likelihood of shorts occurring due to the growth of nodules or dendrites on the cathodes.
If starter sheets are used, these are often pulled out after 2 days of plating, straightened
in a press, and then reinstalled to continue the plating cycle. This minimizes growth of
nodules or dendrites due to bent cathodes and avoids short circuiting.
The rate of copper plating increases with increasing current density (see Eq. 16.5);
however, excessive current density can promote rough, nodular cathode deposits and
decrease copper purity if not properly managed. The use of air sparging of the electrolyte
can help to minimize inhomogeneity in the electrolyte composition throughout each cell
and permits high-quality copper to be plated at increasingly higher current densities.
16.5.2 Electrolyte
To produce high-quality copper at all cathode positions in a cell, the electrolyte compo-
sition should be essentially the same throughout the cell. The advance electrolyte from SX
typically contains 45 g/L Cu2þ and 170 g/L H2SO4. This is combined with a bleed of
spent electrolyte leaving the EW cells to give the recirculating electrolyte that is the feed to
the EW cells. The spent electrolyte contains 2e5 g/L Cu2þ less than the recirculating
Figure 16.6 Harvesting of plated cathodes by crane. Note that only every third cathode is removed
from the cell each time. This allows the cell to continue plating without having to stop the current
supply to that cell. (Photograph courtesy of K. Voogt, Anglo American.)
444
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

electrolyte, i.e., a single pass through an EW cell takes a “bite” or DCu of 2e5 g/L Cu2þ
from the electrolyte.
Depleted spent electrolyte is replenished with Cu2þ by sending it back to SX where the
acid that it contains is used to strip Cu2þ from the loaded organic extractant (Chapter 15).
About 25%e50% of the spent electrolyte is sent to SX. The remainder is sent to an active
storage tank where it is mixed with Cu-enriched advance electrolyte returning from SX. A
typical ﬂow conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 16.7.
Electrolyte ﬂows continuously from an active storage tank into one end of each cell
through a manifold that is usually situated at the bottom of the cell (Fig. 16.4). Electro-
lyte overﬂows at the other end of the cell into a collection system. Electrolyte is
added at w15 m3/h into each cell. This gives constant availability of high Cu2þ
electrolyte over the surfaces of all the cathodes. The speciﬁc ﬂowrate of electrolyte
past the face of the cathode (the face velocity) is typically designed at 0.08 m3/h per
m2 of cathode area (Beukes & Badenhorst, 2009).
Efﬁcient circulation of the electrolyte to all cathodes in a cell is critical to good cath-
ode quality. As electrode-spacing distances decrease and current densities increase, this
becomes even more important. Modern cell designs may introduce the electrolyte at
several places into the cell, including at multiple points from a manifold at the base of
the cell or just beneath the level of the electrolyte, or from feed points at the side or
end of a cell.
16.5.2.1 Organic contamination
The advance electrolyte from SX often contains small amounts of organic phase that is
carried over by entrainment or incomplete phase separation (see Section 15.8.2). The
presence of organics is detrimental to copper EW because the cathodes may become dis-
colored at the electrolyteeair interface (so-called organic burn), which decreases the value
of the copper on the commercial market. The presence of organic on the surface of the
electrolyte also represents a ﬁre risk owing to the high currents employed in the tank-
house. Organic components of the advance electrolyte are ﬁltered by passing it through
activated carbon columns and/or ﬂotation cells before it reenters the EW tankhouse.

mately constant electrolyte composition throughout the cells. AE, advance electrolyte; RE, recirculat-
ing electrolyte; SE, spent electrolyte.

In certain operations, particularly where a high extractant concentration is employed,
organic carryover can be considerable, even with the installation of mitigating equip-
ment. In such tankhouses, the electrolyte ﬁrst enters so-called scavenger cells. The copper
plated in these cells is below LME standard and receives a lower value on sale; however,
these cells serve to “clean up” the electrolyte and most of the organic component is
retained within these cells. The treated electrolyte then goes forward to the main tank-
house for production of high-quality cathode.
16.5.2.2 Conductivity
Conductivity of the electrolyte is an important consideration in minimizing power con-
sumption (see Section 16.3) (Tozawa et al., 2003). A temperature of 45e55C is opti-
mum for maximizing electrolyte conductivity; however, the spent electrolyte
returning to SX needs to be kept below 40C to avoid degradation of the organic phase.
The incoming advance electrolyte is heated to 45e50C by heat exchange using outgo-
ing spent electrolyte that has been resistively heated in the EW cell.
Higher acidity can improve electrolyte conductivity, but too high an acidity can cause
hydrolytic degradation of the organic phase in SX (see Section 15.9.3). For this reason,
the spent electrolyte acid concentration is generally limited to 190e200 g/L. Higher
acidities also increase the corrosion effects of acid mist in the tankhouse and decrease
anode lifetime. A higher Cu concentration in the electrolyte will improve cathode qual-
ity, but can lead to CuSO4 crystallization. The effects of Cu, H2SO4, and temperature
variation on electrolyte conductivity, s, are given empirically by Eq. (16.6) (Price &
Davenport, 1980):
s S

½
 þ 0.249½H2SO4 þ 0:426T;
(16.6)
where the concentrations are in g/L and temperature is in C.
16.5.2.3 Effect of iron
Iron is often present in electrolytes. This is attributed to transfer of iron from the leach
liquor through the SX circuit by both chemical complexation with the extractant and
physical entrainment (see Chapter 15). Iron in the electrolyte offers both positive and
negative effects.
Reduction of Fe3þ at the cathode and the corresponding oxidation of Fe2þ at the
anode

(16.7)
compete with the Cu EW reactions (Eq. 16.3). Consumption of current by these cycling
reactions lowers the current efﬁciency for plating of copper by w2.5% for each 1 g/L Fe.
For example, 5 g/L Fe3þ in the electrolyte can drop the current efﬁciency to as low as
446
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

80% (Khouraibchia & Moats, 2009). However, the presence of 1e2 g/L Fe in the
electrolyte improves the physical quality of the copper cathodes.
16.5.2.4 Effect of manganese
Manganese is often present in electrolytes, particularly in South America and the African
Copper belt. This contributes to the formation of MnO2 on the anode, which can redis-
solve when power is lost, contributing to entrapment of Pb and Mn in the cathode and
sludge formation at the bottom of the cell (Tjandrawan & Nicol, 2010). Anodes need to
be periodically cleaned with high-pressure water to remove this layer.
Mn(II) is also problematic in SXeEW circuits because it can be oxidized to Mn(III),
Mn(IV), or Mn(VII) at the anodes (Cheng et al., 2000). To avoid the formation of the
permanganate ion (MnOe
4 ) at the anodeda highly oxidizing species that can have very
detrimental effects on degradation of the SX organic-phase componentsda ratio of Fe:
Mn in the electrolyte of approximately 10:1 is recommended (Miller, 2010, 2011).
16.5.2.5 Effects of other metal contaminants
The behavior of other metal species present in the electrolyte can be understood with
reference to their position in the electrochemical series (Table 16.1). Those species
with a more positive reduction potential than Cu can plate at the cathode, while those
with a more negative potential will remain in solution.

16.5.2.6 Effect of chloride
The presence of chloride ion in the electrolyte can have both positive or negative effects,
depending on its concentration. Chloride ions are naturally present in the electrolyte
(particularly in Chilean operations that treat ores with chloride-containing minerals) or
can be added as HCl. Low levels of chloride ions promote the growth of dense, ﬁne-
grained, low-impurity copper deposits on the cathode; higher concentrations negatively
affect the growth of copper crystals, and can lead to a powdery deposit in extreme cases.
Chloride is necessary to achieve polarization when polyacrylamides or glue are used as
the smoothing agent (see Section 16.5.3.1). When using permanent cathode technology
(stainless-steel cathode blanks), the chloride concentration must be kept below 30 mg/L
to avoid pitting corrosion of the steel blade at the electrolyteeair interface, which causes the
depositing copper to stick to the blank and resist detachment.
16.5.2.7 Control of impurities
The buildup of impurities in the electrolyte is controlled by bleeding a small stream from
the tankhouse (see Fig. 16.7). In addition to impurities that need to be removed from the
circuit, the electrolyte also contains signiﬁcant quantities of copper and acid, so this is
typically returned to the leach, where the acid is used for leaching, or to the SX circuit
for recovery of the copper. In some operations, the bleed is treated by precipitation or ion
exchange to remove contaminants (Shaw et al., 2019; Sole et al., 2017).
16.5.3 Electrolyte additives
16.5.3.1 Smoothing agents and grain reﬁners
All copper EW plants add smoothing agents to their electrolytes to promote the plating of
dense, smooth copper deposits with minimum entrapment of electrolyte impurities. In
the past, guar gum (150e400 g/t of cathode), a natural product, was widely used
(Fig. 16.8). This behaves much as glue in electroreﬁning (Chapter 13), but guar is
Figure 16.8 The effect on the morphology of copper cathode plated in the (a) absence and
(b) presence of guar. Guar, added at concentrations of 150e400 g/t cathode, acts as a smoothing
agent, allowing reﬁnement of the copper crystal grains as they are plated. This gives the cathode a
smooth morphology and avoids the growth of dendrites and nodules that could short circuit the cur-
rent between anode and cathode. (Courtesy of M. Nicol, Murdoch University.)
448
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

compatible with SX organics. Smoothing agents originating from natural products tend
to break down above current densities of about 300 A/m2, so the modern trend is toward
the use of synthetic products that have more consistent and predictable compositions and
performance (Flores, Mu~noz, & Zarate, 2010). Modiﬁed starches (polysaccharides) and
polyacrylamides (typically added at 200e700 g/t cathode) are widely used (Chibwe &
Tadie, 2021; Luyima et al., 2016; Moats et al., 2016). These products are compatible
with the sensitivity of SX organics to surface-active additives. The oligosaccharide prod-
uct, DXG-F7, is in widespread use in Chile and various other global operations, and has
particular beneﬁts in reducing sulfur contamination of the cathode (Cifuentes, Bravo, &
Schwarz, 2015; Maldonado, 2010). Recent advances in the development of synthetic
smoothing agents allow high-quality plating at current densities well above 400 A/m2.
16.5.3.2 Cobalt sulfate
When using lead-based anodes, it is necessary to maintain a cobalt concentration in the
electrolyte of 100e200 mg/L Co2þ to promote the O2 evolution reaction at the anode
(Eq. 16.2), rather than Pb oxidation (Nikolosi & Nicol, 2008). This stabilizes the PbO2
layer on the anode surface, minimizes Pb contamination of the depositing copper, and
extends anode life (Mirza et al., 2016). The addition of 350 mg/L Co halves the rate
of anode corrosion. As the current density increases, the required Co concentration typi-
cally increases (Sole, Moats, Sandoval, Robinson, & Davenport, 2019).
The presence of cobalt also decreases the anode overpotential (see Fig. 16.1), which
results in a lower cell voltage (V ) and improves power consumption. The empirical rela-
tionship is given by the following (Miller, 2011):

where the cobalt concentration is given in g/L. A more comprehensive relationship for
the anode overpotential, which includes the effects of Mn and Fe, is given by the
following (Abbey & Moats, 2018):

(16.9)
Most operations add cobalt to the electrolyte as the cobalt sulfate salt. Many mines on
the African Copper belt contain signiﬁcant cobalt mineralization in association with the
copper ores, so cobalt deports to the leach liquor with copper and adequate concentra-
tions are transferred to the advance electrolyte by entrainment through the SX circuit.
A signiﬁcant advantage of coated titanium anodes (see Section 16.4.2.2) is that no co-
balt addition to the electrolyte is required.
16.5.4 Acid mist suppression
Oxygen bubbles that are produced at the anodes (Eq. 16.2) rise to the top of the electro-
lyte where they burst into the atmosphere, carrying tiny droplets of sulfuric acid with
Electrowinning

them. This acid mist can create a corrosive, unpleasant, and unhealthy environment in the
tankhouse. Acid mist is a known human carcinogen and may cause health problems for
operators if adequate personal protection equipment is not employed. To minimize
tankhouse footprint and capital costs, modern tankhouse design is tending toward the
use of higher current densities (Sole, Moats, Sandoval, Robinson, & Davenport,
2019). As indicated by Eq. (16.3), the more copper that is plated per unit time, the
more O2 is produced, which gives rise to increased acid mist production. The intensity
and detrimental effects of acid mist increase with increasing current density. Combina-
tions of various measures are employed to minimize its detrimental effects (McGinnity
& Nicol, 2014; Mohanarangam, Yang, Rajasingam, Tadesse, & Robinson, 2019;
Robinson, White, & Grassi, 2013).
Good ventilation of the tankhouse is essential, particularly incorporating cross-ﬂow or
draft effects. In some plants, the mist is cleared from the workplace by large blowers or
extraction fans on the sides of the tankhouse building or, where the climate permits, the
sides of the building may be open. Modern tankhouse designs include hoods over the
cells. The acid mist is captured and sent to a scrubber; an added advantage is a reduction
in evaporation of the electrolyte (Fig. 16.9) (Vainio & Weatherseed, 2009).
Hollow polyethylene balls (w2 cm diameter) are usually ﬂoated, 5e10 cm deep, on
the electrolyte (Fig. 16.5). Polypropylene beads (3 mm diameter) are sometimes used. It
is essential that at least three layers of balls or beads are used on the electrolyte surface to
Figure 16.9 Tankhouse equipment to avoid and mitigate the effects of acid mist. (a) Older tankhouses
use extraction fans and ventilation across the cells, and (b) polypropylene balls on the surface of the
electrolyte. (c) Modern tankhouses use hoods to cover the cells, which are lifted for harvesting of cath-
odes (d), requiring very accurate positioning, so computer control of the crane movements is essen-
tial. (e) Acid mist is captured and scrubbed to avoid releasing corrosive gases to the environment.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

provide effective acid mist mitigation. Owing to their mechanical and operating difﬁ-
culties, balls and beads are now being replaced by anode brushes for acid mist control
(Åkre & Rosseland, 2019).
In addition to physical mitigation approaches, chemical acid mist suppression agents
are employed. These are typically a foaming agent or surfactant, which modiﬁes the sur-
face characteristics of the electrolyte such that the energy of the bursting bubbles is
reduced on their release (Bender, 2010).
Natural products, such as Quillaja saponaria, can be used at low current density (San
Martin et al., 2005). Other synthetic surfactants, added at levels of 10e20 mg/L of
electrolyte, are effective at higher current densities. It is extremely important that mist
suppressants that have surfactant character do not detrimentally affect phase separation
when returned in the spent electrolyte to the SX circuit.
16.6 Maximizing copper quality
The demands of a modern EW tankhouse are to produce copper of increasingly higher
purity, using higher current densities, while minimizing power consumption (Marsden,
2008; Nieminen, Virtanen, Ekman, Palmu, & Tuuppa, 2010). Copper quality is deter-
mined by both the purity and physical appearance of the cathode product.
16.6.1 Copper purity
From a thermodynamic point of view, only metals that have a higher electrochemical
potential will codeposit with Cu (Table 16.1). Because Cu is relatively noble, it is easily
plated with high purity. Impurities typically arise from poor tankhouse housekeeping and
poor deposit morphology.
The three main impurities in electrowon cathode copper are as follows:
•
Pb (1e2 ppm), resulting from physical entrapment of anode corrosion products (if
lead alloy anodes are used);
•
S (w5 ppm), resulting from incorporation of PbSO4 anode corrosion product (when
using lead-based anodes) and electrolyte in the deposit;
•
Fe (1e2 ppm), resulting from electrolyte entrapment.
Cathode purity is therefore enhanced by minimizing (or containing) anode corrosion
and avoiding entrapment of the electrolyte within a growing copper deposit.
Factors that enhance cathode purity include the following:
•
maintaining straight, vertical, equi-spaced cathodes and anodes with no anodeecathode
contact, which promotes a uniform current distribution throughout the tankhouse;
•
immediate thorough washing of harvested copper cathodes with water at 70e80C,
to remove electrolyte from the surface and avoiding surface S contamination;
•
using rolled PbeSneCa anodes, which give adherent corrosion products (Mirza
et al., 2016; Nikoloski, Nicol, & Stuart, 2010);
Electrowinning
451

•
frequent removal of anode corrosion products (lead sludge) from the bottom of the
EW cells, to avoid suspension of ﬁne particles in the circulating electrolyte and their
incorporation into growing deposits;
•
addition of Co2þ to the electrolyte to minimize Pb corrosion;
•
minimizing the Mn2þ concentration in the electrolyte to avoid rapid Pb corrosion
and the formation of ﬂaky corrosion products (Miller, 2010);
•
maintaining a steady electrical current at all times to maintain an adherent anode
corrosion layer;
•
controlled resumption of current after power outages to minimize anode corrosion
(Castle Lead Works, 2020; Glencore Technology, 2020b);
•
keeping the electrolyte free of solids and SX organics;
•
ensuring a steady uniform ﬂow of puriﬁed Cu2þ electrolyte at appropriate Cu and
acid concentrations across all cathode faces;
•
an electrolyte temperature of 45e50C to give pure ﬁne-grained copper deposits;
•
use of smoothing agents and chloride addition agents to give dense, smooth copper
deposits (but with Cle < 30 mg/L in the electrolyte) (Section 16.5.2.6);
•
maintaining Fe in electrolyte to < 2 g/L to minimize Fe deporting to cathode copper
and reduce losses in current efﬁciency (Section 16.5.2.3).
16.6.2 Physical appearance
The physical appearance of the cathodes is also important in determining their commer-
cial value.
Cathodes should be of uniform thickness. This can be achieved by the following:
•
ensuring vertical and horizontal alignment in cells;
•
even spacing between electrodes;
•
uniform solution ﬂow in the cells;
•
consistent current density and plating time throughout the tankhouse and plating
cycles.
Cathodes should have a smooth surface appearance and good color. This is promoted
by the following:
•
preventing organic from SX from entering the cells;
•
ensuring appropriate conditions for ordered crystal growth;
•
use of correct concentration of smoothing agents;
•
matching the current density to the electrolyte composition, ﬂowrate, and cell
agitation;
•
avoiding shorts and dendrite formation;
•
maintaining a good surface ﬁnish of the cathode blanks (Larinkari, Nord, & Schmidt,
2016);
•
avoiding a plating cycle that is too long and leads to dendrite formation.
452
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

16.7 Maximizing energy efﬁciency
Energy consumption in EW is determined by the following:
(i) the cell voltage;
(ii) the applied current (or current density); and
(iii) the current efﬁciency.
As shown in Fig. 16.1, cell voltage depends largely on the cell design, electrode
materials, and the reactions occurring at the anode and cathode. The applied current is
usually determined by the production rate required. Tankhouse operators can, however,
inﬂuence and manage energy consumption by understanding how to maximize current
efﬁciency (Moats, 2012, 2018).
The theoretical mass of Cu that can be plated for a given current is given by Faraday’s
Law (Eq. 16.5). The ratio of the actual mass of Cu plated, compared with this theoretical
value, is deﬁned as the current efﬁciency, x:
xð%Þ ¼ measured mass of Cu plated  100
theoretical mass of Cu plated
(16.10)
Current efﬁciencies in modern Cu EW plants range from 85% to 95% (Sole, Moats,
Sandoval, Robinson, & Davenport, 2019). Current that is not available for plating of
copper is consumed by the following (Moats, 2012; Nicol, 2006):
•
anode-to-cathode short circuits;
•
stray currents to ground;
•
reduction of Fe3þ or dissolved oxygen at the cathode;
•
oxidation of Fe2þ at the anode;
•
redissolution/oxidation of the deposited metal (particularly in the case of power
failures);
•
poor-quality deposited metal that falls off the cathode and cannot be harvested.
High current efﬁciency is important because it maximizes copper plating rate and
minimizes electrical energy consumption per tonne of copper produced.
Strict attention to good housekeeping practices is an important criterion in maxi-
mizing cathode purity and energy efﬁciency (Joy et al., 2010). Electrolyte spills should
be avoided and cleaned up immediately if they occur. Anodeecathode short circuits
are detected by frequent infrared and gauss meter inspections and by individual voltage
measurements on cells. Shorts are minimized by ensuring that the electrodes are evenly
spaced, straight, and vertical (Aylwin, Lagos, & Melani, 2013; Blackett & Nicol, 2010).
Bending of stainless-steel blanks during copper stripping must be avoided. Regular pol-
ishing and bufﬁng of cathode blanks assists in minimizing difﬁculties in removing depos-
ited cathode plates (Larinkari, Nord, & Schmidt, 2016). Automation and advanced
instrumentation in modern tankhouses can assist greatly in maintaining good electrode
arrangements, uniformity of current distribution, and rapid short detection (Fraser et
al., 2014).
Electrowinning
453

Control of electrolyte purity is essential. Current consumption by cycling of the
Fe3þ 4 Fe2þ redox reaction is minimized by controlling the Fe concentration in
the electrolyte to <2 g/L (Section 16.5.2.3). This is done by preventing leach solution
carryover to electrolyte from the SX circuit and by regularly bleeding a small portion of
Fe-bearing electrolyte from the tankhouse.
Current efﬁciency generally increases with increasing Cu and acid concentrations in
the electrolyte and with current density ( j), but decreases with increasing Fe3þ concen-
tration and temperature (Zhang et al., 2018). A useful practical correlation that can be
used to optimize current efﬁciency on a daily basis in a tankhouse has been provided
by Khouraibchia & Moats (2010) for operation at 40C:

16.8 Modern industrial electrowinning plants
Differences between EW and electroreﬁning are summarized in Table 16.2. EW differs
from electroreﬁning mainly in the following:
(a) the use of inert Pb alloy or coated titanium anodes instead of soluble copper anodes;
(b) the higher applied voltage.
The use of inert anodes means that (i) the anodes remain in the cells for 5þ years, (ii)
there is little anode scrap, and (iii) no precious metal slimes (although lead sludge accu-
mulates at the bottom of the EW cells and needs to be periodically removed). In the case
of coated titanium anodes, there is no lead sludge, but residual precious metal oxides from
the coatings can accumulate at the base of the cells.
Table 16.3 shows the operating conditions and equipment in ﬁve EW tankhouses that
process electrolyte from an SX circuit (Sole, Moats, Sandoval, Robinson, & Davenport,
2019). San Francisco currently operates with the highest current density (498 A/m2) in
the world; Mantoverde and San Francisco have among the highest current efﬁciencies
(>92%). Morenci is one of the largest tankhouses in the world (350 kt/a). Tenke Fun-
gurume represents typical operating conditions in the African Copper belt, while Sepon
is a typical Asian operation. Further information regarding these and other EW plants is
available from T. Robinson, White, & Grassi, 2013; T.G. Robinson et al., 2013b and
Sole, Moats, Sandoval, Robinson, & Davenport, 2019.

16.9 Direct electrowinning from agitated leach solutions
16.9.1 From ore leach solutions
A few operations, mainly in African and Asian countries, treat leach solutions directly by
EW for Cu recovery. The liquors, obtained by agitation leaching of high-grade oxides and
roasted sulﬁde concentrates or mattes, contain 30e40 g/L Cu. These leach liquors can be
puriﬁed or upgraded by SX, but are also processed by direct EW to produce Cu cathode.
Direct EW electrolytes are not as pure as those obtained using SX, so (i) the purity of
the copper cathode is lower and (ii) current and energy efﬁciencies tend to be lower,

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

mainly because of the high Fe content of the electrolytes. There is no recycle of the spent
electrolyte to SX in direct EW, so it is necessary to electrowin Cu from the electrolyte to
much lower concentrations. This is usually carried out in a two-step EW process: the ﬁrst
EW circuit will reduce the Cu from w40 to w20 g/L (a bit lower than SXeEW con-
centrations) and the second circuit, known as liberator cells, will reduce the Cu to as low as
5 g/L. The quality of the cathodes produced in liberator cells is very poor: this material is
usually sent for melting and electroreﬁning. The spent electrolyte is very high in acid and
is returned directly to the leach circuit.
16.9.2 From concentrate or matte leach solutions
Leaching of sulﬁde-containing materials, as is practiced in several base metal reﬁneries,
can produce a leach liquor that contains much higher levels of copper than leaching of
an ore: up to w70 g/L Cu. Such solutions can be treated by direct EW and produce
LME grade copper. The new Kristiansand copper EW circuit represents current state-
of-the-art technology (Holmin et al., 2019; Åkre & Rosseland, 2019). This reﬁnery
uses coated titanium anodes, anode brushes, current tracking software, and extensive
automation to achieve high-purity cathode copper without the need for an upstream
SX circuit.
16.10 Copper electrowinning in EMEW cells
As discussed in Section 16.5.2.7, most plants are required to bleed a portion of the elec-
trolyte to control the levels of Fe, Mn, or Cl. Associated with this bleed is loss of copper.
EMEW technology employs a cylindrical cathode with a central anode, and the electro-
lyte is tangentially injected into the cell at high velocity. This conﬁguration is capable of
producing high-purity LME Grade A copper from an electrolyte containing as low as
3 g/L Cu, thereby enabling mitigation of such losses (Dixon et al., 2003). Fig. 16.10
shows a single cathode and a modular arrangement of EMEW cells.

16.11 Safety in electrowinning tankhouses
An EW tankhouse operates with high acid concentrations, a conductive electrolyte, the
presence of acid mist, high electrical currents, and routine mechanical handling of heavy
items. Stray current (see Fig. 16.1) can create conditions for a shock hazard and potential
injury to an operator. Recommended housekeeping and electrical practice for safe oper-
ation include the following (adapted from Sandoval, 2018 and Domingues, Gebrehiwot,
Richardson, & Sandoval, 2019):
•
Repair cell leaks timeously to avoid creating a path for current to ground;
•
Remove accumulations of crystallized copper sulfate salts around cells and connec-
tions by regularly washing down the tankhouse using water;
•
Ensure that all spillage is cleaned up and avoid accumulation of electrolyte in walk-
ways and beneath cells;
•
Regularly inspect the integrity of concrete foundations;
•
Use insulated hand tools and avoid any connections of tools to ground;
•
Metal pipe ﬁttings in contact with electrolyte should be insulated;
•
Railings and electrical guards can prevent operator contact;
•
Careful design and insulation of crane components to avoid shocks;
•
Personal protective equipment, such as boots and gloves, should be insulating.
16.12 Future developments
New developments in EW are dominated by (i) improving energy efﬁciency and (ii) pro-
ducing high-purity copper at higher current densities (Marsden, 2008; Nieminen,
Virtanen, Ekman, Palmu, & Tuuppa, 2010). One of the most signiﬁcant advances is
the increasing adoption of new anode materials that minimize voltage requirements.
In particular, titanium mesh and sheet anodes coated with precious metal oxides are
becoming more widely used. The commercial application of alternative anodes (nonlead
anodes) in the United States (Sandoval, Clayton, Dominguez, Unger, & Robinson,
2010, Sandoval, Garcia, Neff, & Schnebly, 2013), Europe (Åkre & Rosseland, 2019),
and South America is a signiﬁcant advance.
Considerable development work has been carried out using an alternative electrolyte
composition in which the anode reaction is the Fe(II) / Fe(III) conversion (Sandoval,
Cook, Morales, & Robinson, 2010). This enables a reduction in energy consumption of
up to 50% and there is no generation of acid mist. Although this process is not
yet commercialized, it is receiving increasing interest as a potential “green” technology
(Iacopetti, Calderara, Perrone, Perego, & Furusawa, 2019; Protech, 2020).
Maintaining cleanliness of the electrolyte is essential for the production of high purity
copper. Electrolyte ﬁlters and the use of anode brushes to remove loose corrosion mate-
rial from anodes have been introduced.
Developments in hardware, software, automation, and robotic control promote
improved tankhouse management and operator safety, reduce labor requirements, and
460
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

enable consistent production of high quality copper (Larinkari, Nord, & Schmidt, 2019;
Åkre & Rosseland, 2019). Crane automation facilitates the use of hoods over cells for acid
mist mitigation, allows accurate positioning of electrodes, and minimizes the need for
operator activities in the tankhouse. Online monitoring of cell temperatures and voltages
and wireless interfaces enable rapid detection of shorts (Fraser et al., 2014). Alternating of
direct current with alternating current can improve the smoothness of the deposit and
minimize electrolyte entrapment when operating at high current density (Hecker et
al., 2010). Advanced process control and the use of artiﬁcial intelligence are also being
increasingly adopted in many tankhouses. All of these developments improve current ef-
ﬁciency, productivity, and operator health and safety.
16.13 Summary
EW produces pure metallic copper from leach/SX electrolytes. In 2019, about four
million tonnes of pure copper were electrowon, which represents 18% of world cathode
production.
In the EW process, an electrical potential is applied between an inert Pb alloy or
coated Ti anode and stainless-steel cathode in CuSO4eH2SO4 electrolyte. Pure copper
electroplates on the cathode; O2 and H2SO4 are generated at the anode.
Copper is stripped from the cathode and sold. The O2 is evolved to the atmosphere
and is usually captured to a scrubber to contain the acid mist that it carries. The Cu2þ-
depleted electrolyte is returned to SX as the spent electrolyte, where the contained acid is
used for stripping Cu2þ from the loaded organic phase and Cu2þ is replenished in the
advance electrolyte.
Electrowon copper is as pure as or purer than electroreﬁned copper. Its only signif-
icant impurities are S (w5 ppm) and Pb and Fe (1e2 ppm each). Careful control and
attention to detail in housekeeping and tankhouse management can decrease these im-
purity concentrations to the low ends of these ranges.
Modern trends in copper EW include the following:
(a) increasing current densities above 450 A/m2;
(b) reducing energy consumption;
(c) improved acid mist management;
(d) increasing automation and robotic control and monitoring of the process.

CHAPTER 17
Collection and processing of recycled
copper
Previous chapters describe production of primary copperdextraction of copper from ore.
This chapter and the next describe production of secondary copperdrecovery of copper
from scrap. About half the copper reaching the marketplace has been scrap at least once,
so scrap recycle is of the utmost importance.
This chapter describes scrap recycling in general, major sources and types of scrap, and
physical beneﬁciation techniques for isolating copper from its coatings and other
contaminants.
Chapter 18 describes the chemical aspects of secondary copper production and reﬁning.
17.1 The materials cycle
Fig. 17.1 shows the materials cycle ﬂowsheet. It is valid for any material not consumed
during use. Its key components are as follows:
(a) raw materialsdores from which primary copper is produced
(b) primary production dprocesses described in previous chapters of this book
(c) engineering materialsdthe ﬁnal products of smelting/reﬁning, mainly cast copper
and predraw copper rod, ready for manufacturing
(d) manufacturingdproduction of goods to be sold to consumers
(e) obsolete productsdproducts that have been discarded or otherwise taken out of use
(f) discarddsending of obsolete products to a discard site, usually a landﬁll.
Obsolete copper products are increasingly being recycled rather than sent to landﬁlls.
This is encouraged by the value of their copper and the increasing cost and decreasing
availability of landﬁll sites.
17.1.1 Home scrap
The arrow marked (1) in Fig. 17.1 shows the ﬁrst category of recycled copper, known as
home or run-around scrap. This is copper that primary producers cannot further process or
sell. Off-speciﬁcation anodes, cathodes, bar, and rod are examples of this type of scrap.
Anode scrap is another example.
The arrow shows that this material is reprocessed directly by the primary producer,
usually by running it through a previous step in the process. Off-speciﬁcation copper
is usually put back into a converter or anode furnace, then electroreﬁned. Defective
rod and bar are remelted in the vertical shaft furnace and recast.

The annual amount of home scrap production is not known because it is not re-
ported. However, industrial producers try to minimize its production to avoid recycle
expense.
17.1.2 New scrap
The arrows marked (2), (2a), and (20) in Fig. 17.1 denote new, prompt industrial, or internal
arising scrap. This is scrap that is generated during manufacturing. The primary differ-
ence between this and home scrap is that it may have been adulterated during process-
ing by alloying or by applying coatings and coverings. Examples of new scrap are as
numerous as the products made with copper, since no manufacturing process is
100% efﬁcient.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The pathway taken by new scrap depends on its chemical composition and the degree
to which it has become entwined with other materials. The simplest approach is to
recycle it internally (2a). This is common practice with gatings and risers from castings.
They are simply remelted and cast again. Direct recycling has the advantages of
(a) retaining the value of added alloying elements such as zinc or tin which would be
lost if the alloy were sent to a smelter and (b) eliminating the cost of removing the alloy-
ing elements, which would be required if the metal were reprocessed at a smelter.
Similar reprocessing is done for scrap copper tube and uncoated copper wire. Path
(2a) is the most common recycling route for new scrap. As much as 90% of new U.S.
copper scrap is recycled along this path (Edelstein, 1999).
If the new scrap has coatings or attachments that cannot easily be removed, or if the
manufacturing facility cannot directly reuse its new scrap (e.g., a wire-drawing plant
without its own melting facilities), then paths (2) and (20) are followed.
The secondary materials industries described in Fig. 17.1 ﬁll the role that mining and
ore beneﬁciation facilities ﬁll for primary copper production. In many cases, they simply
remove the coatings, insulation, or attachments from the scrap to make it suitable for
reuse by the manufacturing facility. If puriﬁcation or reﬁning is needed, the cleaned-
up scrap is sent to a primary or secondary smelter/reﬁnery (Forsen et al., 2017). Since
these facilities produce cathode grade copper, alloying elements present in the scrap
are lost.
Speciﬁc activities of secondary materials industries are described later in this chapter.
17.1.3 Old scrap
The ﬁnal category of copper scrap (paths (3), (3a), and (30)) is termed old, obsolete, postcon-
sumer, or external arising scrap. It is obtained from products that have ended their useful
life. Old scrap is a huge potential source of recyclable copper. It is also more difﬁcult
to process. The challenges for processing old scrap include the following:
(a) low Cu gradesdold copper scrap is often mixed with other materials and must be
separated from this waste
(b) unpredictabilityddeliveries of materials and objects vary from day to day, making
processing difﬁcult
(c) locationdold scrap is scattered about the landscape rather than being concentrated
in a speciﬁc location like primary ore or new scrap.
The sources of old scrap have been divided into six classes (Bertram et al., 2002;
Ruhrberg, 2006):
End-of-life vehicles (ELVs) include cars, trucks, and buses, but not planes, ships, or
trains. The copper in ELV consists primarily of wiring, in particular electric motors
and the wiring harness that connects the lights and motors (McGlothlin, 2018). The
coverall copper content of ELV is about 0.8%.
Collection and processing of recycled copper

Construction and demolition (C&D) waste includes copper from the wiring of buildings,
pipes and ﬁttings from the plumbing, and brass from door handles and frames, among
other items (Wildnauer, 2019). C&D debris as a whole contains about 0.30% copper,
or 0.05e0.24 kg/m3 (Koutamanis, 2018). The current high price of copper encourages
copper recovery from buildings; unfortunately, this often occurs as theft from job sites or
vandalism.
Waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is the largest source of old copper
scrap (Glöser et al., 2013). WEEE has three subcategories (European Copper Institute,
2007): white goods (domestic electrical appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators,
dishwashers, etc.), brown goods (audiovisual appliances such as televisions and DVD
players), and gray goods (computers and telecommunication appliances). The estimated
copper content of WEEE ranges from 3% to 21% (Barnwal et al., 2018).
Industrial electrical equipment waste (IEW) includes power cables (underground and sur-
face), transformers, and other electrical equipment. The relative amount of this material is
small, but its copper content is high (5%e80%).
Industrial nonelectrical equipment waste (INEW, sometimes grouped with IEW) includes
large transportation equipment (planes, ships, and trains), spent ammunition and ordi-
nance, and other machinery. Although no formal estimates of its copper content exist,
the percentage is likely to be small (Ruhrberg, 2006).
Municipal solid waste (MSW) is the hardest waste stream to process, and contains very
little copper (0.05%e0.20%). Loose coins in MSW contain much of its copper, and small
appliances contain much of the rest.
Recovery of old copper scrap from waste streams depends on the type of waste, the
location of the waste stream, and the price of copper (Vexler et al., 2004). High-grade
streams such as IEW are proﬁtable to process and recycle, so most of the copper from
this waste is recovered (Glöser et al., 2013). Although few statistics are kept, the same
is likely true for INEW. The presence of infrastructure for dismantling and processing
ELV means that recovery of copper from this stream is higher in the developed world
than in less-developed areas. Recovery of copper from MSW is always low. Recovery
of copper from WEEE has also been low, but is increasing as a result of government man-
dates to process it.
17.2 Secondary copper grades and deﬁnitions
The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI, 2019) currently recognizes 45 grades
of copper-base scrap. However, most of these are for alloy scrap, which is much less avail-
able than “pure” copper scrap. Alloy scrap is also more likely to be directly recycled than
copper scrap. As a result, ISRI designations are not always important to copper recyclers.
Table 17.1 describes the most signiﬁcant grades of nonalloy copper scrap, including ISRI
and trade names (Fig. 17.2).

The most signiﬁcant recent changes have been replacement of electronic scrap grades
“Dallas” and “Depot” with grade EM3, which describes printed circuit boards (PCBs)
recovered from e-waste. In addition, Grade “Zeyde” (shredded insulated copper wire)
has been added.
Copper recycling also includes the treatment of process wastes. The deﬁnition of this
word is a matter of debate in industrialized countries, because the sale and transportation
of materials designated as waste is more heavily regulated than that of materials designated
as scrap. In fact, material graded as copper-bearing scrap is deﬁned in many countries as
waste, despite the fact that it can be recycled proﬁtably. Wastes generally have a low cop-
per content, low economic value, and a high processing cost per kg of contained copper.
As a result, recyclers sometimes charge a fee for processing these materials (Hagel€uken,
2006). Examples of process wastes include the sludge generated from copper plating,
reﬁning slags from foundries, and the residue from leaching of anode slimes.
17.3 Scrap processing and beneﬁciation
17.3.1 Wire and cable processing
Wire and cable are by far the most common forms of old scrap. It is these forms for which
the most advanced reprocessing technology exists. Nijkerk and Dalmijn (1998) divide
scrap wire and cable into three types:
(a) Above-ground, mostly high-tension power cable. These cables are high grade (mainly
copper, little insulation) and fairly consistent in construction. They are easy to
recycle.
(b) On-the-ground, with a variety of coverings and sizes. These are usually thin wires, so
the cost of processing per kg of recovered copper is higher than that for cable. Wire is
also more likely to be mixed with other waste, requiring additional separation. Auto-
motive harnesses and appliance wire are examples.
(c) Below-ground, which feature complex construction and many coverings. These cables
often contain lead sheathing, bitumen, grease, and mastic. This means that fairly
complex processing schemes are required to recover their copper without creating
safety and environmental hazards.

Copper recovery from scrap cable by shredding (also known as chopping or granu-
lating) has its origins in World War II when it was developed to recover rubber coatings
(Sullivan, 1985). Shredding has since become the dominant technology for scrap wire
and cable processing (Nijkerk & Dalmijn, 1998).
Fig. 17.3 shows a typical cable-chopping ﬂowsheet. Before going to the ﬁrst granu-
lator, the scrap cable is sheared into lengths of 36 inches or less (Nijkerk & Dalmijn,
1998; Sullivan, 1985). This is especially important for larger cables. The ﬁrst granulator,
or “prechopper,” is typically a rotary knife shear with one rotating shaft. The knives on
this shaft cut against a second set of stationary knives. Rotation speed is about 120 rpm,
and a screen is provided to return oversize product to the feed stream. Its primary task is
size reduction rather than separation of the wire from its insulation. Depending on the
type of material fed to the prechopper, the length of the product pieces is
10e100 mm (Reid, 2003).
The primary granulator also liberates any pieces of steel that may be attached to the
scrap cable. These are removed from the product by a magnetic separator (Reid, 2003).

ternational, 18(11), 36e50.)

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The partially chopped cable is then fed to a second granulator (Sullivan, 1985). The
second granulator is similar to the ﬁrst, but operates at much higher speeds (400 rpm) and
has more knives and smaller blade clearances (as small as 0.05 mm). It chops the cable to
lengths of 6 mm or smaller, mostly liberating the copper from its insulation. Again, a
screen is used to return oversize material. The recent trend is to operate the second gran-
ulator at lower speeds, which reduces metal losses to the plastics fraction (Reid, 2003).
The ﬁnal unit process in scrap cable and wire processing is separation of copper from
insulation. This is normally accomplished using the difference between the speciﬁc grav-
ity of the copper (8.96) and that of the insulating plastic and rubber (1.3e1.4). Fig. 17.3
shows a speciﬁc gravity separator, which typically produces three fractions:
(a) a “pure” plastic fraction
(b) copper chops meeting Number 1 or Number 2 scrap purity speciﬁcations
(Table 17.1).
(c) a middlings fraction which is returned to the second granulator for reprocessing.
The separator is most commonly an air table (Sullivan, 1985) which ultimately re-
covers 80%e90% of the input copper. Compact units that include the granulator and
air separator in one unit are increasingly popular for smaller processors (Fowler, 2008).
In larger chopping operations, elutriation or electrostatic separation are sometimes
used as “cleaner” steps to recover the last bit of copper from the plastic fraction (Pita
and Castilho, 2018; Reid, 2003). A signiﬁcant difference between copper chops and
plastic is particle shapedthe copper chops are longer than the plastic. Efforts have
been made to develop separation processes based on this characteristic (Koyanaka
et al., 1997). Results from Pita and Castillo suggest that elutriation is the most effective
of these techniques.
Underground cable processing is complicated by the complexity of its construction,
the ﬂammability of its coverings, and the presence of aluminum or lead in the shredding
product. Nijkerk and Dalmijn (1998) describe the use of cable stripping for larger cables.
This follows shearing and involves slicing open the cable and removing the copper wire
by hand. Smaller underground cables (<5 cm) can be successfully chopped without prior
stripping (Reid, 2003). Attempts have been made to introduce cryogenic shredding to
reduce the ﬂammability hazard. Eddy-current separators can be used following shredding
to separate lead and aluminum from copper (Steinert, 2020).
17.3.2 Automotive copper recovery (ELV)
Fig. 17.4 shows a ﬂowsheet for recovering materials from junked automobiles (Suzuki
et al., 1995). About 90% of the copper in an ELV is found in the various wire harnesses
(McGlothlin, 2018; Sprovieri, 2014); lesser amounts are found in the entertainment
system, motors, alternator, sensors, and transmission. As a result, the dismantling step
produces very little copper for recycle.

Most of the copper from ELVs is in the nonferrous metal scrap stream remaining after
the vehicle has been shredded and its iron and steel have been magnetically removed. Three
metals dominate this stream: aluminum, copper, and zinc. The copper consists mostly of
wire from the electrical circuits (McGlothlin, 2018). Several techniques are used to separate
the metals in this fraction (Dalmijn & De Jong, 2007; Steinert, 2020). Eddy-current sepa-
ration (ECS) uses the different electrical conductivity of the metallic and nonmetallic par-
ticles in the shredded material to remove most of the nonmetallics. Heavy-media separation
removes the lower-density aluminum and magnesium from the metallic fraction. What re-
mains is Zebra (see Table 17.1), a mixture of mostly zinc, brass, and copper.
Two methods can be used to upgrade Zebra, both based on the difference in color of
the copper, brass, zinc, and other metals in it (Pretz & Mutz, 2006). The ﬁrst is hand sort-
ing, which is widely practiced in China and India but may become less viable as labor
costs there increase over time. The second is automated sorting, which has been
commercially practiced for over 10 years (Steinert, 2020).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Better efforts have been made over the past 10 years to recover copper from the
ferrous scrap stream produced by ELV shredding. This stream contains copper in the
form of meatballs (Fig. 17.5), the intermingled remains of electric motors (Kiser, 2007;
McGlothlin, 2018). The copper is a signiﬁcant contaminant in the production of steel,
and can be smelted to produce secondary copper if the meatballs are collected (see
next chapter). Induction sorters have been developed that can sense the differing electri-
cal conductivity of copper-containing scrap, and separate this from the rest of the ferrous
material (Sicon, 2019; Steinert, 2020).
The ﬁnal potential source of copper in Fig. 17.4 is the auto shredder residue (ASR)
which remains after the metals have been removed. This residue consists primarily of dust
and organic matterdplastic from the dashboard and steering wheel, ﬂuff from the seat
cushions, and pieces of carpet and fabric. ASR also contains about 1% copper and has
some fuel value (Khodier et al., 2018). Current practice is to landﬁll this material, but
this practice is increasingly unacceptable. As a result, extensive research efforts have
been made over the past decade to ﬁnd a means of processing it to recover valuables.
Commercial facilities now operate speciﬁcally for processing ASR, including copper
recovery (Jody et al., 2010). ASR can also be directly charged to smelting furnaces
(Nishiwaki & Hayashi, 2005).
17.3.3 Electronic scrap treatment
Although it consists of a variety of items, the overall composition of electronic scrap can
be divided into three categories: (a) plastic (w30% in 1991); (b) refractory oxides
(w30%); and (c) metals (w40%). About half of the metal content is copper. It also con-
tains signiﬁcant amounts of gold and silver. Copper smelting/reﬁning is already set up to
recover gold and silver, so it is a logical destination for treating electronic scrap.

A potential problem with smelting electronic scrap is incomplete combustion of its
plastic fraction and consequent evolution of organic compounds. However, high tem-
perature oxygen smelting completely avoids this problem.
A more serious problem is the declining metal content of electronic scrap. The pro-
ducers of circuit boards and other assemblies have learned over time to reduce the
amount of metal needed in their products (Zhang & Forssberg, 1999). This makes
the scrap increasingly difﬁcult to proﬁtably recycle. The result has been development
of “minerals processing” strategies for isolating the metals in electronic scrap. The
approach is similar to that used for automobiles (Chen, 2009; Cui & Forssberg, 2003;
Kaya, 2016):
(a) disassembly to recover large items
(b) shredding to reduce the size of the remaining material and liberate the metal
(c) separation of metals based on differences in density and electrical conductivity.
Shredding is typically done using low-speed, high-torque knife shredders (Anon,
2004). A primary shredding step generates relatively large particles (4 cm  4 cm),
from which copper is recovered by air tabling, screening, or hand-picking (Burat &
€Ozer, 2018). Secondary shredding generates a ﬁner material with better liberation. Cop-
per recovery from this stream is accomplished using ECS or electrostatic separation (Cui
& Forssberg, 2003; Huang et al., 2009; Kaya, 2016).
However, shredding does not liberate metal that has been plated onto surfaces, such as
PCBs. In addition to copper, precious metals such as gold and silver also remain behind in
this fraction, and this makes it worth recovering. As a result, the plastic residue from PCB
processing is also frequently treated as a raw material. There are two general approaches
for processing it, the formal and nonformal.
The nonformal approach for metals recovery from PCB board surfaces is a hydromet-
allurgical process commonly used in the Third World, particularly China and India
(Chatterjee & Kumar, 2009; Huang et al., 2009; Kaya, 2016). This process replaces me-
chanical processing with burning in open air to liberate pieces of copper. Two acid treat-
ments follow, the ﬁrst to dissolve solder and the second to dissolve copper. The solution is
then boiled away to recover copper sulfate. This process is simple to operate, especially on
a small scale. It is also environmentally destructive, and increasingly unacceptable to local
governments and international bodies.
The formal approach uses mechanical processing, and sends the residues to secondary
smelters which use it as feed in their process (Kaya, 2016). The gold and silver report to
the impure copper metal (along with any copper) and are recovered using the same ﬂow-
sheet used for gold and silver recovery from primary concentrates (Hagel€uken, 2006).
This will be described in more detail in the next chapter.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

17.4 Summary
About half the copper reaching the market today has been scrap at least once. Scrap is
generated at all stages in the life span of a copper product, including production
(home scrap), manufacturing (new scrap), and postconsumer disposal (old scrap).
The purest copper scrap is simply remelted and recast in preparation for manufacture
and use. Less pure copper scrap is resmelted and rereﬁned. Alloy scrap is usually recycled
directly to make new alloy.
Considerable scrap must be physically treated to isolate its copper from its other com-
ponents. An important example of this is recovery of copper from wire and cable. It is
done by the following:
(a) chopping the wire and cable into small pieces to liberate its copper
(b) physically isolating its copper by means of a speciﬁc gravity separation (air table).
Copper recovery from used automobiles and electronic devices follows a similar
pattern, i.e.,
(a) liberation by size reduction (shredding)
(b) isolation of copper by magnetic, speciﬁc gravity, and eddy-current separation.
The copper from these processes is then resmelted and rereﬁned.
Old (obsolete) scrap is often discarded in landﬁlls. There is, however, an increasing
tendency to recycle this material due mainly to the increased cost and decreased availabil-
ity of landﬁll sites.

CHAPTER 18
Chemical metallurgy of copper
recycling
About one-third of the copper currently produced in the world is derived from secondary
materialsdthe copper scrap and waste described in the previous chapter. Secondary
material is recycled in numerous ways. New scrap is often recycled directly back to the
melting furnace where it was produced in the ﬁrst place (Wood et al., 2011). Old scrap
and waste streams (and some new scrap) travel a more complex path. They can either
be added to one of the furnaces used to produce primary copperdthe smelters, converters,
and anode furnace described in previous chapters. They can also be reprocessed by second-
ary smelters speciﬁcally designed to handle such material. This chapter looks at the different
methods used to turn old scrap and waste back into new copper metal.
18.1 Characteristics of secondary copper
Several factors determine what happens to copper-containing scrap and waste. These
include the following:
•
The condition of the scrap. The different types of №1 scrap (see Table 17.1) contain very
small levels of oxidation or impurities, and need to only be remelted in a nonoxi-
dizing environment. As a result, this scrap commands a higher price, and is more likely
to be charged to furnaces requiring a purer grade of input material. №2 scrap is more
oxidized, and will require reﬁning. Heavily oxidized waste materials like plating
sludges require remelting in a reducing environment to avoid copper loss.
•
Location. Copper scrap is often collected at locations which are very far from primary
smelters. The cost of transporting it determines where it winds up.
•
Alloying elements. Impurity elements in secondary copper often have sufﬁcient value to
be recovered in their own right. This includes the gold and silver content of electronic
scrap, the lead in copper drosses, and the lead, tin, and zinc in brass and bronze scrap.
Recovering these elements often dictates recycling strategy.
•
Government regulations. Some governments place export tariffs on copper-containing
scrap to encourage recycling at home. Restrictions on the exporting of some elec-
tronic scrap have also encouraged local reprocessing efforts. Restrictions on air emis-
sions from processing plants have had an impact on processing strategy (Tang, 2016).
The recent decision by the Chinese government to restrict imports of outside scrap
material (including copper) has created ongoing turmoil that impacts processing
decisions (Home, 2019).

18.2 Scrap processing in primary copper smelters
Secondary copper can be added at three locations in the primary copper making process.
The most common is the converting furnace, but additions are also made in the smelter
and anode furnace.
18.2.1 Scrap use in smelting furnaces
Because secondary copper has no sulfur in it, adding it to a furnace is a net energy con-
sumer. This makes it difﬁcult to add to matte smelting furnaces, which already require
some fuel use. Making the size of scrap or waste particles small enough to use in ﬂash
furnace concentrate burners is also difﬁcult. As a result, the extensive use of waste mate-
rials in the ﬂash furnace at Kosaka (Watanabe & Nakagawara, 2003) is rare. However,
small-size shredded scrap can be added in limited quantities to ﬂash furnaces (Maeda
et al., 2000). In fact, the smelting furnace is preferred to the converter for feeding
electronic scrap, due to its plastic content. There are two reasons for this:
(a) the plastic has fuel value which provides heat for smelting (Tang, 2016)
(b) when burned intermittently, plastic often gives off smoke and other particulates
which might escape through the mouth of a PeirceeSmith converter, adversely
affecting workplace hygiene (Yamashita et al., 2016). Burned in a sealed ﬂash
furnace, these particulates are efﬁciently captured by dust collection devices.
Feeding scrap and waste to other types of primary smelting furnace is easier, and both
the Noranda and Mitsubishi smelting processes have been adapted to include scrap in the
feed (Huitu, 2003). Fig. 18.1 illustrates the ﬂowsheet for scrap usage in the Mitsubishi
process at Naoshima (Ariizumi et al., 2016; Oshima et al., 1998). Particulate scrap is
mixed with concentrate and blown into the smelting furnace through its rotating lances.
Larger scrap pieces are charged to the smelting and converting furnaces through roof and
wall chutes. Mitsubishi converting is particularly exothermic, allowing large amounts of
scrap to be melted in the converting furnace. The Onahama smelter in Japan has for some
time used reverberatory furnaces to add automotive shredder residue (ASR) to sulﬁde
matte. The enthalpy of combustion of the organic matter in the residue helps offset
the extra fuel required for this (Kikumoto et al., 2000).
18.2.2 Scrap additions to converters and anode furnaces
In contrast to smelting furnaces, scrap is usually needed in copper converters, to use the
excess heat created by the converting reaction. Depending on matte grades, oxygen
enrichment, and scrap quality, the fraction of scrap used in converter charges can range
from 0% to 35% or higher.
A higher quality of scrap is needed for primary converters: low-alloy scrap, №1 and
№2 scrap if available, along with compressed turnings and anode scrap. Low-grade ma-
terial and plant reverts may also be fed if their plastic content is not too large (Oshima
et al., 1998).
484
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Scrap can also be added to anode furnaces, although the most common addition is
directly recycled scrap anodes, rather than externally purchased scrap. Because anode fur-
naces were designed to handle molten blister copper, scrap melting can be slow (Potesser
et al., 2007; Suping & Qinghua, 2013). New furnace and burner designs can make anode
furnaces better for melting scrap (Deneys & Enriquez, 2009).
18.3 The secondary copper smelter
Although each secondary copper smelter is unique, they can be divided into two groups.
The ﬁrst type are metal smelters, which treat only higher-grade metallic scrap. Many of
these smelters are located in China (Risopatron, 2007; Tang, 2016). The second are black
copper smelters, who process low-grade scrap and waste along with higher-value scrap
(Shuva et al., 2017). Hoboken in Belgium and Brixlegg in Austria are examples of this
type of smelter (Hageluken, 2006; Messner et al., 2005).
18.3.1 High-grade secondary smelting
Rinnhofer and Zulehner (2005) described the typical process for scrap remelting in tilt-
able reverberatory furnaces. The furnaces typically have a small capacity (5e30 tonnes)
and a fairly long cycle time (up to 24 h tap-to-tap; Risopatron, 2007). They have the

advantage of ﬂexibility, and can be used for both oxidation of impurities and deoxidation
afterward. Side tuyeres are used both for injection of air during oxidation and natural gas
during reduction (Tang, 2016).
While reverbs are effective furnaces for reﬁning operations, their efﬁciency as scrap
melters is low (Potesser et al., 2007), and this has created incentive for more effective
furnace design. Recent designs have added a reverb to a shaft furnace (see next chapter),
which delivers molten copper to the reverb at a much quicker rate (Air Products, 2007;
Properzi & Djukic, 2008; Tang, 2016). The reﬁning capability of the reverb allows the
use of more scrap in casting facilities than normal.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The feed to these furnaces is low grade and highly oxidized. It requires reduction to
metallic copper. Major metallic impurities are lead and tin (from bronze scrap, solder, and
decopperizing dross), zinc (from scrap brass), iron (from automotive scrap), and nickel
(from scrap monel and other alloys). These elements are often present as mixtures of
metal and oxide.
Heat and CO reductant are supplied to this type of furnace by combusting metallur-
gical coke or natural gas, e.g.,
C (coke) þ 1/2 O2 / CO þ heat
(18.1)
The carbon monoxide in turn reduces the oxides of the feed to metal or a lower
oxide, i.e.,
CO þ Cu2O / CO2 þ 2Cu(l)
(18.2)
CO þ ZnO / CO2 þ Zn(g)
(18.3)
CO þ PbO / CO2 þ Pb(l,g)

CO þ NiO / CO2 þ Ni(l)
(18.5)
CO þ SnO2 / CO2 þ SnO(l,g)
(18.6)
CO þ SnO / CO2 þ Sn(l)
(18.7)
Metallic iron in the scrap also performs some reduction, especially of easily reduced
oxides like Cu2O:
Fe þ Cu2O / FeO(l) þ Cu(l)
(18.8)
As a result of these reactions, secondary copper reducing furnaces generate three
products. They are as follows:
(a) molten black copper, 74%e80% Cu, 6%e8% Sn, 5%e6% Pb, 1%e3% Zn, 1%e3%
Ni, and 5%e8% Fe (Ayhan, 2000)
(b) molten slag containing FeO, CaO, Al2O3, and SiO2 along with 0.6%e1.0% Cu (as
Cu2O), 0.5%e0.8% Sn (as SnO), 3.5%e4.5% Zn (as ZnO), and small amounts of
PbO and NiO
(c) off-gas containing CO, CO2, H2O, and N2, plus metal and metal oxide vapors.
Cooling and ﬁltering of off-gas (c) recovers oxide dust containing 1%e2% Cu,
1%e3% Sn, 20%e30% Pb, and 30%e45% Zn (Suping & Qinghua, 2013). The dust
also contains chlorine from chlorinated plastics in the feed. It is always reprocessed to
recover its metal content (Hanusch & Bussmann, 1995).
Traditionally, a blast furnace was used as the vessel for initial melting and reducing
secondary copper. However, this furnace has all but disappeared in recent years
Chemical metallurgy of copper recycling

(Tang, 2016), due to its thermal inefﬁciency and the need for expensive metallurgical
coke. The blast furnaces at Brixlegg in Austria and Kovohuty in Slovakia are among
the few remaining examples (Pesl, 2010). Two other types of furnace have become
more prominent for this purpose.
The ﬁrst is a Kaldo furnace (Outotec, 2018; Tang, 2016). This is an upgraded version
of the well-known top-blown rotary converter (TBRC). The Kaldo furnace is a batch
processor, which burns natural gas or oil. The use of oxygen or enriched air reduces
heat losses, and the oxygen/fuel ratio can be adjusted to produce a reducing or oxidizing
atmosphere. The furnace rotates during operation, which improves kinetics, and the
overall fuel usage is less than that of a blast furnace. Because they rotate, they are generally
preferred for smaller operations. Kaldo furnaces are currently in use for secondary copper
processing in Belgium, China, India, and Sweden (Pesl, 2010; Tang, 2016; Zhu & Liu,
2000). A Chinese variation of the technology has also been put into service.
The second type of commonly used furnace for secondary copper melting and reduc-
tion is the top submerged lance furnace that is increasingly prevalent for sulﬁde matte
smelting and converting (Edwards & Alvear, 2007; Hughes, Jåfs, Johto, Stål, & Karonen,
2019; Wood et al., 2011). Like the Kaldo furnace, Ausmelt and Isasmelt furnaces accept a
wide variety of feeds, and can process almost anything with copper in it (Ayhan, 2000;
Alvear, Nikolic & Mackey, 2014). As stationary furnaces, they can burn coal or coke ﬁnes
as a fuel, along with fuel oil and natural gas. They can also use the plastic in electronic
scrap and auto shredder residue as a fuel (Brusselaers et al., 2006). They can change
from a reducing to an oxidizing environment like a Kaldo furnace, which allows them
to remove the impurities from black copper without needing another furnace. Isasmelt
furnaces are being used for secondary copper production in Belgium and Germany,
and three Ausmelt furnaces are in service in Asia.
Tang (2016) lists other types of furnace developed in recent years in China. These
include a horizontal rotary furnace, which operates using a pure O2 environment
(Suping & Qinghua, 2013); a tilting stationary furnace; and a top-blown furnace, used
at one Chinese smelter ( Jinchuan).
18.3.3 Converting black copper
The impurities in black copper can be divided into two groupsdthose that are more
easily oxidized than copper (Fe, Pb, Sn, and Zn) and those that are difﬁcult or impossible
to remove by oxidation (Ni, Ag, Au, and platinum group metals). These impurities are
removed sequentially by a strategy similar to that for purifying primary copper.
The ﬁrst step in reﬁning black copper is oxidation. The black copper produced by
blast furnaces or Kaldo units is typically oxidized in a PeirceeSmith converter (Lennart-
son et al., 2018). Black copper produced in a TSL furnace is reﬁned as a second stage of
operation in that furnace (Wood et al., 2011). In either case, air is blown into the molten
488
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

black copper, oxidizing Fe, Pb, Sn, and Zn along with some Ni and Cu. Alloyed copper
scrap (the light copper described in Section 18.2) is also added to the converter. Most of
its impurities are also oxidized.
This oxidation generates slag containing 10%e30% Cu, 5%e15% Sn, 5%e15% Pb,
3%e6% Zn, and 1%e5% Ni, depending on the composition of the converter feed
(Ayhan, 2000). The slag can be returned to the blast furnace to recover the copper
and nickel (Messner et al., 2005; Pesl, 2010), or processed ﬁrst to recover the lead and
tin (Hageluken, 2006). Lead, tin, and zinc will ultimately be recovered from slag or
dust generated by one of the furnaces, but several trips through the circuit may be
required before these elements wind up in a separate phase.
An off-gas is also generated which, when cooled and ﬁltered, yields dust analyzing
0.5%e1.5% Cu (as Cu2O), 0.5%e1.5% Sn (as SnO), 10%e15% Pb (as Pb and PbO),
and 45%e55% Zn (as ZnO). This dust is usually reduced to recover its Pb and Sn as sol-
der (Ayhan, 2000).
Oxidation of black copper provides little heat to the converter (unlike oxidation of
matte, Chapter 9). Heat for the converting process must, therefore, be provided by
burning hydrocarbon fuel.
18.3.4 Fire reﬁning and electroreﬁning
The main product of the converter is molten rough copper, 95%e97% Cu. It is added to an
anode furnace for ﬁnal, controlled oxidation before casting it as anodes. №1 scrap (Table
17.1) is also often added to the anode furnace for melting and casting as anodes. Plant
practice is similar to that for ﬁre reﬁning of primary copper (Chapter 12 and Chapter 13).
The rough copper in Fig. 18.2 usually contains nickel or tin, which is not completely
removed by oxidation converting. It may also contain appreciable amounts of gold, sil-
ver, and platinum group metals from the original scrap. Recovery of these metals is
important to the proﬁtability of a recycling facility. As a result, the anode furnace product
is almost always cast as anodes for electroreﬁning. The impurity level in secondary anodes
is higher than that in most anodes from primary smelting operations. As a result, electro-
lyte puriﬁcation facilities need to be larger. Otherwise, plant practice is similar to that
described in Chapter 14.
The principal electroreﬁning products are high-purity cathode copper, nickel sulfate
from electrolyte puriﬁcation, and anode slimes. Processing of anode slimes is described in
Chapter 21.
18.4 Summary
Copper scrap is smelted in primary (concentrate) and secondary (scrap) smelters. Primary
smelters mainly smelt concentrate. Some, however, are well adapted to smelting all
Chemical metallurgy of copper recycling
489

grades of scrap. Smelters with Isasmelt, Mitsubishi, Noranda, reverberatory, and TBRC
smelting furnaces are particularly effective.
Scrap is also extensively recycled to the converters in primary smelters. The heat from
the converter’s exothermic Fe and S oxidation reactions is particularly useful for melting
scrap, especially if considerable oxygen is used for the oxidation reactions.
Secondary scrap smelters primarily use TSL furnaces and TBRCs for smelting low-Cu
grade scrap. The main smelting product is molten black copper (80% Cu), which is con-
verted to rough copper (96% Cu) then ﬁre reﬁned and cast into anodes (98.5% Cu).
These processes do not completely remove Ni and Sn from Cu, so the reﬁning
furnace product must be electroreﬁned. Electroreﬁning also recovers Ag, Au, and Pt
group metals.
Secondary copper reﬁning is similar to primary copper reﬁning. However, scrap may
contain more impurities than concentrates so larger electrolyte puriﬁcation and slimes
treatment facilities may be required.

CHAPTER 19
Melting and casting
About 95% of the copper currently produced in the United States has existed as cathode
copper at some time during its processing (Edelstein, 2000). The cathodes are produced
by electroreﬁning pyrometallurgical anodes (from ore and scrap) and by electrowinning
copper leached from oxide and chalcocite ores. To make it useful, this copper must be
melted, alloyed as needed, cast, and fabricated.
Much of the fabrication process for copper and its alloys is beyond the scope of this
book; see Joseph (1999) and Davis (2001, p. 15) for more information. However, melting
and casting are often the last steps in a copper smelter or reﬁnery. A discussion of these
processes is therefore in order.
19.1 Product grades and quality
The choice of melting and casting technology is deﬁned by (a) the quality of the input
copper, (b) the required chemistry of the desired product, and (c) the type of ﬁnal prod-
uct, e.g., wire or tube. Table 19.1 lists the copper cathode impurity limits speciﬁed by
various national standards (ASTM, 2010; Camurri et al., 2012; London Metals Exchange,
2018). Customers usually require purer copper than these speciﬁcations (Nairn, 2001).
The adoption of stainless steel cathodes for electroreﬁning and electrowinning has
improved cathode purity to match these customer requirements.
The tightest impurity limits in copper cathode are for selenium, tellurium, and bis-
muth. All three of these elements are nearly insoluble in solid copper. They form distinct
grain boundary phases upon casting and solidiﬁcation. Selenium and tellurium form
Cu2Se and Cu2Te, while bismuth exists as pure Bi (Zaheer, 1995). These phases are brit-
tle and cause rod cracking and poor drawability (Nairn, 2001). Fig. 20.1 in the previous
edition of this book illustrates the effect of impurities on the resistivity of solid copper.
Several of the impurities in Table 19.1 have a signiﬁcant impact (Camurri et al.,
2012), which is why they are included in the speciﬁcations.
The Uniﬁed Numbering System currently recognizes 45 grades of wrought coppers
(99.3% Cu or better) and 6 grades of cast coppers (Davis, 2001, p. 15). Several of these
coppers are alloyed with small amounts of phosphorus to combine with oxygen when
they are being welded.
Unalloyed coppers can be divided into two general classes. The ﬁrst is tough pitch cop-
per (ETP), which purposefully contains 100e650 ppm dissolved oxygen (Table 19.2;
Davis, 2001, p. 15; Nairn, 2001). Dissolving oxygen in molten copper accomplishes

two goals. The ﬁrst is removal of inadvertently adsorbed hydrogen during melting by the
reaction (Cochrane & Yeoman, 2006; Pops, 2008):
[O] þ 2 [H] / H2O (g)
(19.1)
This reduces the amount of porosity created by water vapor formation during casting
and welding.
The second is reaction of the oxygen with metallic impurities, precipitating them as
oxides at grain boundaries during solidiﬁcation (Cochrane & Yeoman, 2006; Pops,
2008). These oxide precipitates have a smaller adverse effect on drawability than the
compounds that would form if oxygen were not present. Removing the impurities
from solution also reduces their impact on conductivity.
Most copper is cast and fabricated as electrolytic tough pitch (ETP), chemically reﬁned tough
pitch, or ﬁre-reﬁned high conductivity. The chemical speciﬁcations for these grades (which are
identical) are shown in Table 19.2 (ASTM, 2003; ASTM International, 1998, ASTM
International, 2010; Davis, 2001, p. 15; Davis, 2001; Nairn, 2001; Ningbo, 2010).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The second class of pure coppers are the oxygen-free (oxygen-free copper [OFC] or
oxygen-free high conductivity copper [OFHC]) grades. The amount of oxygen in these
grades is so low that no visible amount of Cu2O is present in the solid copper microstruc-
ture. The maximum permissible oxygen level in OFC Grade 2 is 10 ppm. In the best
grade (oxygen-free electronic, OFE Grade 1), it is only 5 ppm (ASTM, 2010; Davis,
2001, p. 15).
Because no Cu2O is generated in the grain boundaries, the electrical conductivity of
OFC is higher than that of tough pitch copper. As a result, OFC is primarily used for
demanding electrical applications, such as bus tube and wave guides (Joseph, 1999).
The lack of Cu2O precipitates also reduces the chance of wire breakage during ﬁne
wire drawing. As a result, magnet wire is often produced with OFC (Nairn, 2001),
although ETP copper can be used if the impurity levels in the melted cathode are low
enough (Cochrane & Yeoman, 2006; Southwire, 2010). The fraction of wire rod copper
produced as OFC appears to be growing; data presented by Keung (2009) suggest that it
may be as high as 18%.

19.2 Melting technology
19.2.1 Furnace types
According to CRU International (Keung, 2009), about 50% of world copper production
in 2006e07 was used for wire rod manufacture. Another 25% is also unalloyed copper. It
is mostly fabricated into pipe and tube. As a result, most current melting and casting tech-
nology produces (a) copper rod for drawing into wire or (b) billets for extrusion to pipe
and tube. The vast majority of this copper is tough pitch.
Most tough pitch copper is produced from cathode in shaft furnaces (Hugens, 2013),
shown in Fig. 19.1. The furnace operates counter-currently, with rising hot hydrocarbon
combustion gas heating and melting descending copper cathodes. High-quality scrap can
also be melted. Natural gas is the usual fuel; propane, butane, naphtha, and LPG are also
used (Kamath, 2003; Montgomery, 2008). Avoiding high-sulfur fuels prevents sulfur
pickup in the metal (Meseha & Meseha, 2005). Oxygen enrichment is also practiced
in some of these furnaces. The melting process is continuous.
An important feature of the furnace is its burners. Each burner uses a high-velocity
premix ﬂame in a burner tile. This eliminates the need for an external manifold (Amato,
2009; Ware, 2007). This design reduces accretions, shortens downtime for cleaning, and
allows individual control of each burner. The burners are frequently mounted in two or
more rows. Firing the upper row at a higher rate may improve fuel efﬁciency (Spence &
Hugens, 2005).
Automatic burner control using CO or hydrogen analysis of the off-gas is a common
feature of these furnaces (Kamath, 2003; Montgomery, 2008; Ware, 2007; Takazawa et al.,
2016). A ﬂame with a moderately reducing atmosphere is produced, resulting in molten
metal with about 60e90 ppm oxygen and 0.3e0.4 ppm hydrogen (Amato, 2009). Other
impurity concentrations are largely unaffected. The reducing conditions allow the use of
silicon carbide refractories, usually silicon nitride bonded (Hugens & Spadaccia, 2016; Yur-
kov, Malakho & Avdeev, 2017). These refractories are more wear resistant than oxide re-
fractories, reducing the number of inclusions in the product metal. The recent use of b
Si3N4 as the bonding phase instead of the a modiﬁcation has improved the life of these
refractories (Hugens, 2013).
Three types of shaft furnace are currently in use. The most common is the Asarco
furnace, of which more than 100 are currently operating (Montgomery, 2008). Approxi-
mately 70 Southwire shaft furnaces are in operation (Ware, 2007). The third type is a Prop-
erzi/Luxi furnace, which is less common. The basic principle of the three furnaces is similar.
Asarco furnaces have individual fuel and air mixing points for each burner, while Southwire
furnaces use multiple premix manifolds. As a result, Asarco furnaces can be adjusted more
easily for changing conditions, while Southwire furnaces are simpler to operate.
Efforts to improve the shaft furnace center around increasing thermal efﬁciency,
which is currently about 50% (Spence & Hugens, 2005). Heat transfer from the hot
496

combustion gases to the charge is a current limitation of the furnace. Recent develop-
ments include increasing the height of the furnace, which increases contact time
(Kamath, 2003). A new cyclonic burner has been developed, which enhances circulation
in the middle of the furnace (Amato, 2009). Spacing the cathodes and keeping them in a
vertical position during charging also seems to help. With sufﬁcient improvement, ther-
mal efﬁciencies of 80% might be possible.
Lower-quality scrap is less suitable for shaft furnaces, which have no reﬁning ability. As
a result, some producers have combined reverberatory furnaces with a shaft furnace (Air
Products, 2007; Arderiu & Properzi, 1996). Metal charged to these furnaces can be ﬁre
reﬁned. This allows the furnaces to melt lower grade cathode and better grades of scrap.
Another melting option is the induction furnace, either the channel or coreless type
(Bebber & Phillipps, 2001; Eklin, 2005; Induga, 2011; Nairn, 2008). Induction furnaces
are usually used to melt oxygen-free or phosphorus-deoxidized grades, since the absence
of a combustion atmosphere prevents oxygen and hydrogen from being absorbed into the
molten copper. Feed to induction furnaces which produce OFC is limited to high-quality
cathode and scrap. Melting capacities are small, typically 10,000e20,000 tonnes per year.
Electric resistance heating using graphite elements is also used (Cochrane & Yeoman, 2006;
Nairn, 2015). The use of graphite crucibles rather than oxide refractory linings in resistance
furnaces reduces the number of inclusions that end up in the metal.
Molten copper tapped from melting furnaces ﬂows into a holding furnace before being
directed to continuous casting. This ensures a steady supply of molten copper to the casting
machines. It also creates more consistent metal temperature and composition. Holding fur-
naces vary considerably in size and type, but are usually induction heated to minimize
hydrogen pickup from combustion gases. The copper may also be covered with charcoal
to minimize oxygen pickup (Bebber & Phillipps, 2001; Eklin, 2005; Nairn, 2008). Auto-
mation of the holding furnace to produce a steady ﬂow of metal at constant temperature is
an important part of casting operations (Meseha & Meseha, 2005; Ware, 2007).
Although slag production during melting is minimal, the desire to eliminate inclu-
sions from the cast rod has made its removal increasingly important. As a result, a deslag-
ging vessel is now placed between the shaft furnace and the holding furnace (Bebber &
Phillipps, 2001; Ware, 2007). Ceramic ﬁlters are also increasingly used to remove inclu-
sions caused by erosion of the furnace system refractories or precipitation of solid impu-
rities from the molten copper (Kamath, 2003; Zaheer, 1995). These inclusions are a
leading cause of wire breaks (Joseph, 1999; Meseha & Meseha, 2005).
Multichamber induction furnaces are increasingly popular (Brey, 2005). The ‘storage’
chambers in these furnaces eliminate the need for multiple holding furnaces.

19.2.2 Hydrogen and oxygen measurement/control
As previously mentioned, control of hydrogen and oxygen in molten copper is critical.
Oxygen is monitored in one of two ways. The ﬁrst is Leco infrared absorbance, which
measures the amount of CO2 generated when the oxygen in a heated sample of copper
reacts with admixed carbon black. This method requires external sample preparation, and
so does not offer an immediate turnaround.
The second approach is an oxygen sensor, which is applied directly to the molten
copper (Richerson, 2005). The electrode potential of the dissolved oxygen in the copper
is measured against a reference electrode in the sensor. This relative potential is converted
to an equivalent oxygen content in the metal at the measurement temperature. Dion
et al. (1995) have shown that the two methods yield similar results. The amount of ox-
ygen in the molten copper is controlled by adjusting burner ﬂames and by injecting com-
pressed air into the copper.
Hydrogen is more difﬁcult to monitor and control. Analysis of solid samples is the
usual practice (Strand et al., 1994), but efforts have been made to adapt aluminum indus-
try technology to on-line measurement of hydrogen in molten copper (Hugens, 1994).
Japanese investigators have had success using aealumina as a solid electrolyte for a
hydrogen sensor (Okuyama et al., 2009).
19.3 Casting machines
Casting machines are usually one of three main types:
(a) billet (“log”) casting, for extrusion and drawing to tube (Fig. 19.2)
(b) bar casting, for rolling to rod and drawing to wire (Figs. 19.3 and 19.4, Table 19.3)
(c) strip casting, for rolling to sheet and forming of welded tube.
19.3.1 Billet casting
Billet casting is usually performed in vertical direct-chill casters, such as that shown in
Fig. 19.2 (SMS Meer, 2015). Graphite-lined copper or graphiteeceramic molds are
used. Diameters up to 30 cm are cast (Hugens & DeBord, 1995). Oscillation of the
water-cooled molds (60e360 min1) improves surface quality and prevents sticking in
the mold.
Billets are often cast from phosphorus-deoxidized grades of copper (DHP), rather
than tough pitch (Induga, 2007). The ﬁrst reason is that tough pitch often performs
poorly when extruded from billet. The second reason is the use of graphite molds.
The dissolved oxygen in tough pitch copper reacts with the graphite to form carbon
monoxide, which corrodes the mold.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Over the past decade, horizontal casters have begun to replace vertical billet casters,
due to their lower cost (M€uller & Schneider, 2005). Horizontal continuous casting of
hollow billets has become an attractive alternative for smaller operations (Induga,
2007; Schwarze, 2007). These billets are rolled directly to tube, eliminating the need
for extrusion and piercing.
19.3.2 Bar and rod casting
Copper bar is mostly cast in continuous wheel-and-band and twin-band casting machines
(Table 19.3; Figs. 19.2 and 13.6). Fig. 19.3 shows a Southwire wheel-and-band caster. Its
key features are (a) a rotating copperezirconium alloy rimmed wheel with a mold shape
machined into its circumference and (b) a cold-rolled steel band which moves in the same
direction and at the same speed as the wheel circumference.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Molten copper is poured from a pour pot into the mold just as the steel band joins the
wheel to form the fourth side of the mold (Ware, 2007). The wheel and band move
together through water sprays as the copper solidiﬁes. After 180e250 degrees of rotation,
the band moves off to an idler wheel and the solidiﬁed copper bar is drawn away (under
minimum tension) to a rolling mill. Pouring to bar separation takes about 15 s. The cast
bar is removed at about 0.25 m/s. The Properzi casting machine is similar, but uses indi-
vidually controlled zones for spray cooling the solidifying bar (Meseha & Meseha, 2005).
The Hazelett twin-band caster is shown in Fig. 13.6 in its role as an anode-casting
machine. Molten copper is fed from a pour pot into the space between two sloped mov-
ing steel bands (von Gal, 2007). The bands are held apart by moving alloyed copper dam
blocks on each side, creating a mold cavity ranging between 6 and 13 cm in width and
3.5e7.5 cm in thickness (for bar casting). Both separations are adjustable, allowing var-
iable product size. Solidiﬁcation times are similar to those of the Southwire and Properzi
machines (Strand et al., 1994).
The three types of moving band casting devices have several features in common. All
require lubrication of the bands and mold wheel or dam blocks, using silicone oil or acet-
ylene soot (Kamath, 2003; Meseha & Meseha, 2005). Leftover soot is removed from the
bands after each revolution, and then reapplied. This ensures an even lubricant thickness
and a constant heat transfer rate. The casters all use similar input metal temperatures,
1110e1130 C (Table 19.3). All require smooth, low-turbulence metal feed into the
mold cavity, to reduce defects in the solidiﬁed cast bar. Lastly, all require steady metal
levels in the pour pot and mold.
Control of mold metal level is done automatically (Fig. 19.4). Metal level in the mold
cavity is measured with a laser pool level sensor (Hazelett Corp, 2020a, 2020b) or with a
television camera (Southwire). It is controlled with a stainless-steel or ceramic metering
pin in the pour pot. Metal level in the pour pot is determined using a bubble tube or
radar sensor. It is controlled by changing the tilt of the holding furnace which feeds it
(Ware, 2007). The temperature of the solidiﬁed copper departing the machine is
controlled to 940e1015 C by varying casting machine cooling water ﬂow rate.
Copper cast in the Hazelett, Properzi, and Southwire machines is usually fed directly
to a rolling machine for continuous production of copper rod. Southwire Continuous
Rod and Hazelett Contirod are prominent (Bebber & Phillipps, 2001; Hazelett,
2020a, 2020b; Ware, 2007; Zaheer, 1995). Both systems produce up to 60 tonnes of
8e22 mm diameter rod per hour (Table 19.3) (Table 19.4).
19.3.3 Oxygen-free copper casting
The low oxygen and hydrogen content of OFC minimizes porosity when these grades
are cast. As a result, the rolling step which is used to turn tough pitch copper bar into rod
is not necessary. This has led to the development of processes for direct casting of OFC

include Rautomead and Conticast (Fig. 19.5; Cochrane & Yeoman, 2006; Eklin, 2005;
Nairn, 2015). Numerous Chinese vertical casting machines are also in use (Keung, 2009).
Upward vertical casting machines use a vacuum to draw metal into water-cooled
graphite-lined dies partially submerged in the molten copper. As it freezes, the rod is

mechanically drawn upward and coiled (Nairn, 2015). It is about the same size as rolled
rod. Vertical casting machines produce 3e12 rod strands simultaneously, and have a ca-
pacity of 500e700 kg/h. These are integrated with a single electrically heated furnace
which is used for both melting and casting (Cochrane & Yeoman, 2006). Newer ma-
chines have separate furnaces for melting and casting, and produce up to 56 strands. Their
production capacity is as high as 40,000 tonnes per year (Eklin, 2005).
19.3.4 Strip casting
The development of strip casting for copper and copper alloys parallels developments in
the steel industry, in that continuous processes are favored. The newer the technology,
the less rolling is required. One approach taken by small-volume producers is to roll strip
from the bar produced by a Hazelett caster (Roller et al., 1999). This can be combined
with continuous tube rolling/welding to make optimum use of the casting machine for a
mix of products.
However, direct strip casting which avoids rolling is the goal. Current horizontal
casters can produce thick strip (15e20 mm), which requires some rolling (Roller &
Reichelt, 1994). Development efforts are being made to develop thin-strip (5e12 mm)
casting to avoid rolling completely. Hazelett Strip-Casting (2010) recently put into ser-
vice the ﬁrst continuous strip caster/in-line rolling facility in Hettstedt, Germany.
19.4 Summary
The last step in copper extraction is melting and casting of electroreﬁned and electrowon
cathodes. The main products of this melting and casting are as follows:
(a) continuous rectangular bar for rolling to rod and drawing to wire
(b) round billets (“logs”) for extrusion and drawing to tube
(c) ﬂat strip for rolling to sheet and forming into welded tube.
The copper in these products is mostly “tough pitch” copper, i.e., cathode copper
into which 100e500 ppm oxygen has been dissolved during melting/casting. The
remainder of unalloyed copper production is in the form of OFHC with 5e10 ppm dis-
solved oxygen. It accounts for up to 18% of wire rod production.
These pure copper products account for about 70% of copper use. The remainder is
used in the form of copper alloy, mainly brass and bronze.
The principal melting tool for cathodes is the shaft furnace. It is thermally efﬁcient and
provides good oxygen-in-copper control. Its molten copper is mainly cast as rectangular
bar in continuous wheel-and-band and twin-band casters, or as round billets (“logs”) in
horizontal and vertical direct chill casters.
The quality of cathode copper is tested severely by its performance during casting,
rolling, and drawing to ﬁne wire. Copper for this use must have high electrical conduc-
tivity, good drawability, and good annealability. These properties are all favored by
maximum cathode purity.

CHAPTER 20
Byproduct and waste streams
20.1 Molybdenite recovery and processing
Many porphyry Cu deposits contain economic concentrations of Mo, virtually all of it
as molybdenite, MoS2. Table 20.1 shows the Cu and Mo contents of several porphyry
CueMo ores.
Molybdenite ﬂoats with chalcopyrite, chalcocite, and other CueS and CueFeeS
minerals. It can then be separated from the resulting CueMo bulk concentrate by
depressing the Cu minerals with sodium hydrosulﬁde (NaHS), Nokes reagent, or sodium
cyanide, while reﬂoating the MoS2 in a Mo/Cu separator plant (Amelunxen et al., 2019;
Yin et al., 2017). Mo/Cu separator ﬂotation plants are much smaller than their preceding
bulk ﬂotation plant because their feed (bulk CueMo concentrate) mass is only 2% or 3%
of the initial ore feed.
Typical CueMo bulk concentrates and their equivalent Mo/Cu separator molybde-
nite and Cu concentrates are given in Table 20.2. A representative ﬂowsheet is presented
in Fig. 20.1.
20.1.1 Flotation reagents
The principal collector for molybdenite is diesel fuel or similar oil, w0.01 kg per tonne of
ore (Amelunxen et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2017). It is added to the bulk concentrator ore
slurry feed to maximize molybdenite recovery from ore. Its effect carries over to ﬂotation
of molybdenite in the Mo/Cu separator ﬂotation plant. Some Mo/Cu separation plants
add more in the Mo/Cu separator plant.
The most common CueFeeS mineral depressant is NaHS (Table 20.2). It is added to
the Mo/Cu separator plant bulk concentrate slurry feed, 4e10 kg per tonne of bulk
concentrate. However, toxicity concerns with NaHS and other current depressants
have spurred extensive research in the past decade for new options. Amelunxen et al.
(2019) review a long list of candidates. Thermal pretreatment to oxidize chalcopyrite
surfaces and make them hydrophilic is another possibility (Tang et al., 2019).
Molybdenite ﬂotation frothers are conventional mixed alcohols. In recent years,
MIBC and X-133 have become popular (Amelunxen et al., 2019). The pH is raised
with CaO and lowered with sulfuric acid, occasionally CO2. The pH requirement varies
from ore to ore.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

20.1.2 Operation
Flow through the Mo/Cu separator plant is continuous. Depressant and frother
(sometimes oily collector) are continuously added where needed. Product Mo froth
and Cu underﬂow continuously depart the plant for dewatering and subsequent transport
to production of metal and chemical products. Flows and Mo and Cu concentrations are
continuously measured and applied to process optimization.
Mo/Cu separator ﬂotation plants often contain regrind mills (Lin et al., 2017). Their
objective is to liberate molybdenite grains from CueFeeS mineral particles (Amelunxen
et al., 2019). However, too small a particle size can be a depressant for MoS2.
20.1.3 Optimization
The objectives of a MoeCu bulk concentrator are (a) maximum Cu and Mo recovery to
the bulk concentrate and (b) maximum rejection of non-Cu, non-Mo minerals to the
tailings. The objectives of a Mo/Cu separation ﬂotation plant are (a) maximum recovery

of molybdenite to the Mo concentrate and (b) minimum recovery of CueFeeS minerals
to the Mo concentrate. The bulk concentrator objectives are met by adequate grinding,
efﬁcient rougher scavenger ﬂotation, and quiescent concentrate cleaning in column cells.
The Mo/Cu separator plant objectives are obtained by
(a) efﬁcient collection of molybdenite and efﬁcient depression of CueFeeS minerals in
the rougher (mechanical) cells with adequate concentrations of oily collector and
depressant
(b) efﬁcient cleaning of molybdenite concentrate in w5 column ﬂotation cells in series
(Amelunxen et al., 2019)
(c) use of N2 in the ﬂotation cells
(d) adequate washing of cleaner froth with fresh water.
Molybdenite concentrates often contain 3%e4% Cu. This presents a problem, since
iron and steel production consumes much of the molybdenum produced, and copper is
not a desired input to steelmaking processes. To remove the copper, a ferric chloride
leaching step is commonly performed (Amelunxen et al., 2019). The ferric ion oxidizes
the copper, and the chloride content dissolves any lead present in the concentrate.
However, the solution is corrosive, and this has led to research on alternatives (Padilla,
Letelier & Ruiz, 2013).
20.2 Anode slimes
20.2.1 Anode slime composition
Table 20.3, taken largely from the review by Moats et al. (2007), tabulates the compo-
sition of several anode slimes from electrolytic reﬁneries around the world. These
compositions reﬂect the composition of the raw materials input to the copper making
process. Concentrates with high levels of gold and silver will produce anode slimes
with high levels of these elements; the same is true for other impurities. Secondary
smelters use little or no concentrate in their feed, and so produce slimes with little or
no sulfur, selenium, or tellurium. However, anode slimes from secondary smelters often
contain alloying elements from the scrap and waste streams fed to the furnace. This means
higher levels of lead than those in anode slimes from primary smelters, and signiﬁcant
levels of elements such as tin and nickel. The production of higher matte grades in
smelters has led to increased levels of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth in anode slimes
over recent decades (Hoffmann, 2008). The reason for this is the reduced amount of
converter slag produced when higher matte grades are used.
The mineralogy of anodes slimes varies with content, but is essentially a mixture of
oxide and chalcogenide solid solutions (Chen & Dutrizac, 2005; Chen et al., 2015;
Hait et al., 2009). Lead is found mostly as insoluble PbSO4, and silver and gold occur
mostly as selenide and telluride phases. Antimony, arsenic, and bismuth are found as a
series of multiple oxides. Copper occurs in many phases.

The treatment of slimes is an important aspect of a reﬁnery’s operation. A signiﬁcant
fraction of the world’s supply of gold, silver, selenium, and tellurium are obtained from
these slimes, and the value of the recovered gold and silver is a signiﬁcant part of a copper
producer’s proﬁtability. In fact, there have been times in the past when the price of
copper was so low that only the production of gold and silver justiﬁed continued
operation of a smelting and reﬁning plant.
20.2.2 The slime treatment ﬂowsheet
There are a number of commercial processing schemes for processing anode slimes,
depending on the composition and workplace hygiene concerns. Fig. 20.2 illustrates
the slimes treatment process used by CCR in Canada (Hait et al., 2009), which is typical
of several current facilities. The ﬁrst step is decoppering, which was previously done by

leaching under atmospheric conditions in return electrolyte from the electroreﬁning cells
(Hoffmann, 2008). The use of oxygen pressure leaching at 125e150C improves both
process kinetics and overall copper recovery from the slime. However, it also dissolves
much of the tellurium in the slimes. This is followed by roasting with sulfuric acid at
w300C, which converts most of the selenium in the slime to a vapor:
Se þ 2 H2SO4 / SeO2 (g) þ 2 SO2 þ 2 H2O
(20.1)
An alternative is to eliminate the leaching step and roast at 600e800C (Chen et al.,
2015), which converts to copper to soluble copper sulfate while oxidizing all of the
selenium as well.
In Fig. 20.2 the remaining slime is smelted to produce a slag containing the arsenic,
antimony, bismuth, and tellurium, along with a metal phase called Dore bullion contain-
ing the gold, silver, lead, and remaining copper (Chen et al., 2015; Hait et al., 2009;
Hoffmann, 2008; Tanisaki et al., 2016). Some of the precious metal content winds up
in the slag, which is treated using ﬂotation to recover the silver and gold or returned
to the smelter. Dore smelting has traditionally been performed in a small reverberatory
furnace, but top-blown rotary converters such as the Kaldo furnace are more popular
(Vartiainen, 2015). The Dore bullion is reﬁned electrolytically.
A change in recent decades has been the development of hydrometallurgical processes
for anode slime. Several different processes are in use; the best known (Fig. 20.3) is the
wet chlorination process (Chen et al., 2015; Nexhip, 2015; Vartiainen, 2015), which
leaches the slime with chlorine gas bubbled into a pulp of as-received slime. This pro-
duces leach liquor containing gold, selenium, tellurium, and some of the copper, and
a residue containing silver chloride and the rest of the copper. Solvent extraction recovers
the gold from the leach liquor, and precipitation with SO2 sequentially recovers the
Se and Te. The slime is sometimes decopperized before leaching, and hydrogen peroxide
and hydrochloric acid are a less expensive alternative to chlorine gas (Hait et al., 2009;
Furuzono et al., 2018).
20.3 Dust treatment
Chapter 7 brieﬂy described the formation of dust during matte converting operations.
Dusts are generated during all stages of pyrometallurgical processing of copper concen-
trates, and the mass of dust can be as much as 10% of the mass of input concentrate
(Xu et al., 2020). These dusts are collected by electrostatic precipitator or baghouse
(see Chapter 11). Common practice has been to recycle these dusts to the smelter to
recover the copper content. However, this approach also recycles impurities such as
arsenic, antimony, bismuth, and lead. As the levels of these impurities build up, their
Byproduct and waste streams
517

concentration in the matte increases as well, and this eventually means high impurity
levels in the blister copper (Montenegro et al., 2010). This in turn makes electrolytic
reﬁning more difﬁcult. The recycle of dust also decreases furnace capacity, which hurts
productivity (Parra & Parada, 2008). As impurity levels in concentrates increase, the need
to ﬁnd a way of treating smelter dust to separate the copper from the impurities has
increased.
Table 20.4, taken from data published by Samuelsson and Carlsson (2001), provides
typical compositions of dust from various locations in the copper making process at the
Rönnsk€ar smelter of Boliden. Dusts from concentrate roasting and smelting feature high
copper and sulfur levels, the result of concentrate particles reporting directly to the dust
stream. Dusts from converting and slag cleaning have lower copper levels and higher
levels of lead, antimony, and arsenic. As a result, direct recycle of the roaster and smelter
dusts is more feasible, and the incentive to treat converter and slag cleaning dusts to
remove impurities is higher.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

Numerous hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes have been developed
to treat copper making dusts (Xu et al., 2020). The biggest concern with these processes is
recovering the arsenic in a stable form for disposal. An example is the process for treating
Teniente furnace dust described by Ichimura et al. (2007). The ﬂowsheet (Fig. 20.4) is
designed to generate a copper electrolyte solution that can be sent to the electroreﬁning
circuit, a copper sulﬁde concentrate that is returned to the smelter, puriﬁed zinc sulfate
for sale, and crystalline ferric arsenate suitable for disposal.
20.4 Use or disposal of slag (Gorai et al., 2003)
Chapter 10 described the processing of smelting slags to recover the copper content.
These processes leave behind a substantial amount of material to be disposed of or other-
wise used. About 25 million tonnes of slag are generated per year worldwide (Gorai et al.,
2003). Over the years, several applications for smelting slag have been found. These
include the following:
•
Cement and concrete (Pavez, Rojas, Palacios, & Sanchez, 2004; Shi et al., 2008). The
iron content of copper slag makes it a useful replacement for iron powder in cement
clinker production. Copper slag has also been used as a partial substitute for Portland
cement in concrete, with mixed effects on properties. The most beneﬁcial aspect of
using copper slag as a replacement is the reduction in energy use required to produce
the concrete.
•
Abrasive grit (Flynn & Susi, 2004; Pavez, Rojas, Palacios, & Sanchez, 2004). Copper
slag is a common abrasive for blasting operations. Its advantages include higher hard-
ness and density than other abrasives, and a lack of free silica (a workplace hygiene
hazard). The biggest disadvantage is the presence of hazardous metal content, which
can potentially contaminate job sites.
•
Land reclamation (Lim & Chu, 2006). Copper slag is denser than the sand normally
used for ﬁll, and has a better particle-size distribution. The friction angle is higher
as well, enhancing slope and foundation stability.

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

•
Iron ore (Cao et al., 2009). The iron content of smelter slag is 40%e60% (Shi et al.,
2008), which is higher than that of many iron ores. However, the iron is largely pre-
sent as fayalite, which is difﬁcult to concentrate. Experiments with reverse magnetic
ﬂotation have upgraded the iron content to a level which might be suitable for some
ironmaking processes. Gonzalez et al. (2004) smelted copper slag with carbon to
generate a molten Fee1.9 Cue5 C alloy, but this has too much copper to be of value
to steelmakers.
•
Ceramic tile (Marghussian & Maghsoodipoor, 1999). The use of copper slag in tile
production improves the product strength and acid resistance. However, the sulfur
content results in SO2 emission and bloating during ﬁring, limiting the amount
that can be used.
Other potential uses of copper slag include rooﬁng granules, hot-mix asphalt, and
cutting tools (Gorai et al., 2003). However, all of the applications described here are
cost sensitive, and the cost of transporting slag from a remote location to a manufacturing
facility often makes its use uncompetitive. As a result, most slag is still landﬁlled after
processing.
20.5 Summary
MoS2 occurs in economic quantities in many porphyry Cu deposits. It is recovered to
MoS2 ﬂotation concentrates by (a) ﬂoating MoS2 and CueFeeS minerals together in
a bulk CueMo concentrate, then (b) depressing CueFeeS minerals and ﬂoating
MoS2 in a MoeCu ﬂotation separator plant. Typical Mo recovery to ﬁnal MoS2 concen-
trate is w70% (80% to the bulk concentrate and 90% of that to the ﬁnal MoS2 concen-
trate). Other byproducts from copper production include the slime from electroreﬁning,
dust recovered from baghouses and electrostatic precipitators, and smelting slag. All of
these can be treated to recover their copper content, and the remaining material is also
valuable. The slime in particular contains signiﬁcant levels of gold, silver, selenium,
and tellurium. The recovery of these metals has a signiﬁcant impact on the proﬁtability
of copper production facilities.

CHAPTER 21
Costs of copper production
This chapter
(a) describes the investment and production costs of producing copper metal from ore
(b) discusses how these costs are affected by such factors as ore grade, process route, and
inﬂation
(c) indicates where cost savings might be made in the future.
The discussion centers on mine, concentrator, smelter and reﬁnery costs. Costs of
producing copper by leach/solvent extraction/electrowinning and from scrap are also
discussed.
The cost data have been obtained from published information and personal contacts
in the copper industry. They were obtained during 2019 and are expressed in 2019 U.S.
dollars. The data are directly applicable to plants in South and North America. Costs
elsewhere may vary considerably, due to ﬂuctuations in exchange rates and raw materials
costs (Boulamanti & Moya, 2016).
Investment and operating costs are signiﬁcantly affected by inﬂation. Fortunately,
inﬂation has been small since the previous edition of this book. Inﬂation in the chemical
processing industry is represented by the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index
(Fig. 21.1). The basic equation for using this index for identical equipment is the
following:

The investment and operating costs in this chapter are at the study estimate level, which
is equivalent to an accuracy of 30%. Data with this accuracy can be used to examine the
economic feasibility of a project before spending signiﬁcant funds for piloting, market
studies, land surveys, and property acquisitions (Christensen & Dysert, 2005).
21.1 Overall investment costs: mine through reﬁnery
Table 21.1 lists study estimate investment costs for a mine/concentrator/smelter/reﬁnery
complex designed to produce electroreﬁned cathodes from 0.5% Cu ore. These costs are
for a greenﬁeld (new) complex starting on a virgin site with construction beginning July 1,
2019. It should be noted that construction of completely integrated complexes is now
rare. Typically, new mines and concentrators are built in South America and new
smelters/reﬁneries are built in coastal Asia. The investment costs are expressed in terms
of investment cost per annual tonne of product copper. This is deﬁned by the following
equation:
Plant cost ¼ investment cost per annual tonne of copper
 plant capacity; tonnes of copper per year
(21.2)
This equation shows, for example, that the investment in a concentrator which
(a) costs $10,000 per annual tonne of copper and (b) produces 200,000 tonnes of Cue
ineconcentrate per year will be $2000  106 ($2 billion).
Table 21.1 indicates that the ﬁxed capital investment for a complex which produces
electroreﬁned copper from 0.5% Cu ore is w$30,000 per annual tonne of copper. To
this must be added working capital to cover the initial operating expenses of the complex

(about 10% of ﬁxed capital investment; Peters & Timmerhaus, 1968). It means that a new
mine/mill/smelter/reﬁnery complex which is to produce 200,000 tonnes of copper per
year will cost w$6.5 billion ($33,000  200,000).
21.1.1 Variation in investment costs
Mine investment costs vary considerably between mining operations. This is due to
(a) differences in ore grades, mine sizes, mining method, topography, and ground con-
dition and (b) infrastructure requirements for electric power and water. Underground
mine development costs considerably more than open pit mine development, per annual
tonne of mined ore. This and the high cost of operating underground explain why
underground ore bodies must contain (a) higher ore grade than open pit ore bodies
and/or (b) valuable byproducts such as Ag, Au, Co, Mo, and Ni.
Ore grade has a direct effect on mine investment costs. Consider (for example) two
identical ore bodies, one containing 0.5% Cu ore and the other 1% Cu ore. Achievement
of an identical annual production of Cu requires that the 0.5% Cu ore be mined at twice
the rate of the 1% Cu ore. This, in turn, requires about (a) twice as much plant and equip-
ment (e.g., trucks) and (b) twice as much investment. The same is true for concentrators
and heap leach pads; they will have to treat 0.5% Cu ore twice as fast as 1% Cu ore to
achieve the same annual production of Cu. This will require about twice the amount
of equipment and twice the investment.
A signiﬁcant investment cost for new concentrators is electric energy and water
production/distribution. This is particularly true in South America, where virtually all
new Cu mines are in high, dry desert locations.
Smelter investment costs, per annual tonne of copper production, are inﬂuenced by
concentrate grade rather than by ore grade. The higher the % Cu in the concentrate, the
smaller the smelter (and smelter investment) for a given annual production of copper.
High-grade concentrates also minimize smelter operating costs (such as materials
handling costs, fuel consumption costs, and gas handling costs) per tonne of copper.
Reﬁnery investment costs are not affected by mine/concentrator/smelter character-
istics. This is because copper reﬁneries treat 99.5% Cu anodes, irrespective of the preced-
ing processes.
21.1.2 Economic sizes of plants
Mines can be economic at any size, depending upon the Cu grade of their ore. Thus,
copper mines operate at production rates between 10,000 tonnes of ore per day (a
high-grade operation) and 250,000 tonnes per day (a large open pit operation; ICSG,
2018).
Concentrators vary similarly. A new large concentrator unit typically consists of a
semiautogenous grinding mill, high pressure grinding rolls, two ball mills, and a ﬂotation
Costs of copper production
527

circuit. It can treat up to 170,000 tonnes of ore per day (Sartain, 2010). Larger concen-
trators consist of multiples of this basic concentrating unit.
Smelters are almost always large because their minimum economic output is that of a
single, fully used high intensity smelting furnace. These furnaces typically smelt up to
4000 tonnes of concentrate per day.
Copper reﬁneries are usually sized to match the anode output of an adjacent smelter.
The advantage of having a smelter and reﬁnery at the same site is the presence of shared
site facilities, particularly for anode casting and anode scrap remelting. A few reﬁneries
treat the anodes from several smelters. The largest electroreﬁneries produce up to
2500 tonnes of copper cathodes per day (ICSG, 2018).
21.2 Overall direct operating costs: mine through reﬁnery
Direct operating (cash) costs (excluding depreciation, capital repayment, and income
taxes) for mining/concentrating/smelting/electroreﬁning are given in Table 21.2. The
table shows that direct operating costs for the major steps are, in descending order, con-
centration, open pit mining, smelting, and electroreﬁning. Overall direct operating costs
for extraction are w$2 per kg of copper.
21.2.1 Variations in direct operating costs
The operating costs which vary most are those for mining and concentrating. The
amounts of ore which must be handled by these operations, per tonne of Cu, vary
directly with ore gradedand this signiﬁcantly affects operating costs. Underground
mining can also cost up to ﬁve times as much as open pit mining, which must be offset
by (a) higher ore grade and (b) the presence of byproduct metals in underground ore.

21.3 Total production costs, selling prices, proﬁtability
The total cost of producing copper from ore is made up of (a) direct operating costs and
(b) ﬁnance (indirect) costs, including interest and capital recovery. A reasonable estimate
for (b) is 12% of the total capital investment per year. Based on a ﬁxed capital investment
of $33,000 (including 10% working capital) per annual tonne of copper, this is equivalent
to $4000 per tonne of copper ($4/kg). Thus, the direct ($2) plus indirect ($4) operating
costs of producing electroreﬁned copper in a new operation total approximately $6 per
kg. For a new operation to be proﬁtable, the selling price of copper must exceed these
costs.
Mines and plants that have been in operation for many years may have repaid much of
their original capital investment. In this case, direct operating costs (plus refurbishing)
are the main cost component. This type of operation will be proﬁtable at selling
prices of w$3 per kg of copper.
In summary, the priceeproﬁt situation is
(a) At copper selling prices above $6 per kg, copper extraction is proﬁtable and expan-
sion of the industry is encouraged. Underground ore bodies containing about 1.5%
Cu are viable, as are open pit ore bodies containing about 0.5% Cu.
(b) At selling prices below about w$3 per kg, some mines and plants are unproﬁtable.
Some operations begin to shut down.
These costs and prices all refer to July 1, 2019. They will increase at about the same
rate as the cost index in Fig. 21.1. The 2019 selling price of copper has been about $6 per
kg so that operating þ ﬁnance costs were met in most cases.
21.3.1 Byproduct credits
Many Cu ore bodies contain Au and Ag (Chadwick, 2010; Kendrick et al., 2003;
Supomo et al., 2008). These metals follow Cu during concentration, smelting, and
reﬁning. They are recovered during electroreﬁning (with some additional treatment;
see Chapter 20) and sold. Other ore bodies contain MoS2 (Section 20.1) which is recov-
ered in the concentrator and usually sold. The credits (sales minus extra costs for recovery)
for these byproducts should be included in all project evaluations (FreeporteMcMoRan
Copper and Gold, 2011). Sulfuric acid is also often a valuable byproduct, especially when
the smelter is near leach/solvent extraction/electrowinning operations.
21.4 Concentrating costs
The investment costs of constructing a Cu concentrator are of the order of $10,000 per
annual tonne of copper (Table 21.1). This means that a concentrator producing 200,000
tonnes of copper-in-concentrate will cost w$2 billion (Section 21.1).
Costs of copper production
529

Table 21.3 breaks concentrator investment costs into major cost components,
expressed as a percentage of total investment cost. The largest cost for this concentrator
is water acquisition, which indicates that it is in a desert region. Grinding is second.
Concentrator direct operating costs (Tables 21.4 and 21.5) are of the order of $4.8/
tonne of ore, which is equivalent to about $1.1/kg of Cu (assuming 0.5% Cu ore and
90% Cu recovery). Grinding is by far the largest operating cost, followed by ﬂotation.
Grinding and ﬂotation costs vary markedly for different ores. Grinding costs are high
for hard primary ores and low for secondary (altered) ores. Flotation costs are low for sim-
ple Cu sulﬁde ores. They increase with increasing ore complexity.
21.5 Smelting costs
The investment cost of a new Outotec ﬂash furnace/ﬂash converter smelter is w$9000
per annual tonne of copper (Table 21.1). A smelter designed to produce 200,000 tonnes
of new anode copper per year will cost, therefore, about $1800  106dabout $2 billion.

Table 21.6 breaks this investment cost into its major components. About 70% of the
investment goes into concentrate handling/smelting/converting/anode casting and
about 30% into gas handling/sulfuric acid manufacture.
In 2020, there are three major intensive smelting processes available for installing in
new smelters or for modernizing old smeltersdOutotec ﬂash, Isasmelt, and Ausmelt.
Each has been installed extensively since 2005. Each appears to be competitive for
new and replacement smelting units.
Table 21.7 shows the direct costs of operating an oxygen-enriched Outotec ﬂash
smelting/ﬂash converting smelter. The total is about $80 per tonne of concentrate after
sulfuric acid and energy credits. For a 30% Cu concentrate, this is equivalent to about
$0.3 per kg of new copper anodes. Table 21.8 breaks down these direct operating costs

dent on smelter capacity (Castillo & Cantallopts, 2016).

21.6 Electroreﬁning costs
The investment cost of a new electroreﬁnery using stainless steel cathode technology
is w$1000 per annual tonne of electroreﬁned cathodes. This means that a reﬁnery
producing 200,000 tonnes per year of cathodes will cost of the order of $200  106.
The relative investment costs of various sections of a reﬁnery are shown in Table 21.9.
The production electroreﬁning section (including stainless steel blanks) is by far the
largest investment cost component of the reﬁnery.
The direct cost of producing electroreﬁned cathodes in an electrolytic reﬁnery
is w$0.12 per kg of cathode copper, Table 21.10. The largest component of that cost
is energy, Table 21.11.
21.7 Production of copper from scrap
Chapter 18 shows that copper scrap varies in grade from 99.5þ% Cu (manufacturing
wastes) to 5% Cu (recycled mixed-metal scrap). The high-grade manufacturing wastes
require only reclamation, melting, casting, and marketing, which costs about $0.2/kg
of copper. Low-grade scrap, on the other hand, requires reclamation, sorting, smelting,
reﬁning, and marketing, which costs about $0.6 per kg of copper. Intermediate grade
scrap treatment lies between these two extremes.

For scrap recovery to be proﬁtable, the difference between reﬁned copper sales price
and scrap purchase price must exceed these treatment charges. When this is not so, scrap is
held off the market. In 2011, many smelters are actively seeking scrap and scrap collection
is very proﬁtable.
21.8 Leach/solvent extraction/electrowinning costs
The investment and operating costs of heap leach/solvent extraction/electrowinning
plants are listed in Tables 21.12 and 21.13. The costs are shown to be considerably lower

than those for conventional concentration/smelting/reﬁning complexes (Mokmeli,
2020). This accounts for the rapid adoption of leaching around the world, especially
in Chile.
Unfortunately, chalcopyrite ore (the world’s largest source of copper) cannot be pro-
cessed by heap leach/solvent extraction/electrowinning (Chapter 13). Chalcopyrite ores
must be treated by conventional concentration/smelting/reﬁning/reﬁning, irrespective
of cost.

Costs of copper production

The small investment requirement of leach/solvent extraction/electrowinning plants
is due to the small equipment and infrastructure requirements of these processes. Specif-
ically, leaching and solvent extraction require much less equipment than concentrating,
smelting, converting, and anode casting.
An interesting aspect of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical copper extraction is
sulfuric acid production and use. Hydrometallurgical copper extraction requires sulfuric
acid (Chapter 14), and pyrometallurgical copper extraction produces it (Chapter 11).
Companies with both processes beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from this synergistic effect, especially
if the operations are close together.
21.9 Proﬁtability
The key to a proﬁtable mine-to-market copper operation is, of course, a large, high Cu-
grade ore body. Such an ore body maximizes copper production per tonne of ore mined,
moved, and processed. Optimal use of an ore body requires that each part of the ore body
be processed by its most efﬁcient methoddleaching or concentrating/smelting. Separa-
tion of the ore body into milling ore, leaching ore, leaching waste, and unleachable waste
is crucial for optimal utilization of the resource.
21.10 Summary
The total direct plus indirect cost of producing electroreﬁned copper from ore by con-
ventional mining/concentration/smelting/reﬁning is in the range of $3e$6 per kg of
copper. The total direct plus indirect cost of producing electrowon copper cathodes
from oxide and chalcocite ores (including mining) is $1e$2 per kg of copper.
Copper extraction is distinctly proﬁtable when the selling price of copper is >$6 per
kg. It is unproﬁtable for some operations when the selling price falls below $3 per kg. At
the former price, the industry tends to expand. At the latter, it begins to contract.
The selling price of copper in mid-2019 is w$6 per kg, and has been rising since.

CHAPTER 22
Toward a sustainable copper
processing
Since the ﬁrst edition of Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, the processing of primary and
secondary copper containing materials has experimented dramatic changes. Efforts
have been made in the last 40 years to
•
Improve energy efﬁciency by reducing the speciﬁc energy consumption.
•
Increase sulfur capture.
•
Adapt existing processes to declining copper grades.
•
Develop new copper processing technologies.
•
Optimize recovery of valuable elements
•
Develop environmentally friendly technologies to stabilize and safely storage metal-
lurgical wastes
•
Develop technical solutions to improve equipment reliability
•
Increase productivity
•
Develop process synergies to recover valuable metals from secondary materials and
industrial wastes as part of existing ﬂowsheets or by coupling new processes to existing
ﬂowsheets.
Many of the above-mentioned aspects have been at the core of ﬂowsheet transforma-
tions required to meet the increasing copper demand. This explosive copper demand has
been driven by the urbanization needs of emerging economies and a growing middle
class with more expectation for comfort and goods all over the world (Alvear Flores,
Löbbus, Springub, FallaheMehrjardi, & Tappe, 2018). Although we are living unprec-
edented times in 2020 due to the CV19 pandemic, there is a consensus that the future
will require even more copper to meet the expectations of a more sustainable planet.
22.1 Resource complexity and ﬂowsheet solutions
The primary and secondary copper processing industry will continue facing challenges
associated with resource complexity, regulatory legislation, lower ore grades and higher
impurity levels, ﬂowsheet optimization, energy utilization, water access, and pressure to
reduce operating costs and remain competitive.
A global copper mine review reported by the ICSG found that the average global
copper ore grade was 0.45% in reported reserves, and 0.65% copper in copper mine
production in 2015 (Alvear Flores, Risopatron, & Pease, 2020). This reduction in grade
can be seen in the declining copper concentrates grades processed by the main custom

smelters (Table 6.1, also see ﬁfth and sixth editions of Extractive Metallurgy of Copper).
Copper smelters have responded by increasing their processing capacity to achieve at least
the same copper output, which at the same time increases acid production and slag
generation, and in some cases operating costs.
In addition, the content in copper concentrates of deleterious impurity elements has
also increased. Arsenic is a clear example of this trend. According to Metals Economics
Institute of Japan, the arsenic content in copper concentrates processed in Japanese
smelters has increased since 1991 from 400 ppm to over 1000 ppm in 2016 ( Japan
Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, 2020). When combining this ﬁgure with
the reduction of copper concentrate grade, this represents a threefold increase in the units
of As per unit of Cu in the feed.
Complexity in secondary processing is also a relevant aspect to consider. With nonfer-
rous metals recycling intended to recover copper, nickel, tin, and precious metals,
electronic equipment have consistently reduced the valuable metal content in their prod-
ucts, and equipment design have become more complex, making it more difﬁcult to
enrich the metallic content in these end-of-life materials before processing. As a result,
pretreatment facilities are required to eliminate before the main smelting process
elements that might negatively impact the direct or indirect processing of these materials.
Off-gas handling also requires special attention to manage postcombustion and heat
release, proper handling of halides, and avoidance of formation of dioxins and furans
during cooling of the metallurgical off-gas streams.
Chapter 5 showed how copper smelters have gradually increased their processing
capacities, up to 400,000 tonnes of copper per year, aiming to meet increasing demand
for copper and remain competitive at the same time. From this perspective, a continuous
growth of processing capacity to reduce unitary costs seems to be reaching slowly and
steady reaching a plateau, from which it will become more difﬁcult to improve proﬁt-
ability. Smelters have to be creative and look for alternative feedstocks that could help
them to increase their margins without upsetting their metallurgical operations. Intake
of diverse input materials, not only from primary sources but also from urban mining
resources, with a multimetal recovery approach, will be one of the differentiating factors.
22.2 Multimetal ﬂowsheet integration
Processing of complex copper-bearing materials requires a multimetal recovery approach
to optimize metals recovery, minimize waste, and maximize commercial beneﬁts. This
approach involves a combination of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical unit
operations, and ideally synergies between base metals operations. Flowsheet interactions
involving copper, lead, nickel, and zinc operations can allow the maximization of
metallurgical recoveries at an optimum costebeneﬁt balance, taking advantage of
the collector capacity of base metals, and more efﬁcient and integrated minor metals
and waste processing.
540
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

The above-mentioned approach is illustrated by Fig. 22.1. Taking advantage of the
base metal carrier properties, materials and metal ﬂows can be optimized by processing
materials according to their relative physical and chemical properties in a copper, lead,
and/or zinc circuits. Primary and secondary resources can be pretreated as required to
optimize recovery of other containing materials such as plastic, paper, aluminum base
materials, and steel. For instance, waste incineration can help to remove zinc as a valuable
subproduct prior to copper recycling and generate a more suitable product for copper
processing. Halogen, dioxins, and furans removal can be also accomplished prior to
incorporating the materials into more traditional base metal ﬂowsheets.
Examples of the above mentioned multimetal processing principle have been success-
fully applied in processing of primary and secondary resources. The following examples
can be mentioned:

22.2.1 Primary base metal integration: the Ust-Kamenogorsk metallurgical
complex
The Kazzinc Ust-Kamenogorsk Metallurgical Complex (UKMC) is an example of a
multimetal recovery plant combining copper, lead, and zinc (Fig. 22.2). The UKMC
ﬂowsheet is shown in Fig. 22.3. The copper plant involves processing of complex copper
concentrates and other valuable materials in a process conﬁguration involving a TSL
ISASMELT furnace, electric furnace, PeirceeSmith converters, anode reﬁning, and
copper electroreﬁning. The lead circuit involves processing of lead concentrates in a
TSL lead ISASMELT furnace, followed by the production of lead bullion in a blast
furnace. A pyrometallurgical lead reﬁning plant allows further lead reﬁning, and recovery
of copper intermediates. The zinc plant involves roasting, leaching, and electrowinning
processes and a Waelz kilns plant to process zinc residues and recover valuable and
precious metals. The anode slimes from the copper circuit and the Parkes crust from
the lead circuit are reﬁned to recover precious metals. Leadesilver alloys produced
from Parkes crust and dried anode slimes from the copper reﬁnery are processed in cupels.
The dore metal produced in the cupels is spooned manually for casting into molds,
creating anodes ready for reﬁning (Burrows & Azekenov, 2018). A hydrometallurgical

plant acts a key element to treat intermediate products generated in the base metal
circuits, recovering valuable minor metals, enriching base metal streams, and stabilizing
residues.
The integration of the three base metals metallurgical circuits is the key to optimizing
metallurgical ﬂows, increasing concentration of elements in different streams, minimizing
metallurgical wastes, and optimizing metal recoveries. Some examples of these synergies
illustrated in the UKMC ﬂowsheet are as follows:
•
Integrated hydrometallurgical plant to recover minor metals
•
Integrated precious metal plant
•
Integrated zinc residue processing plant in synergy with hydrometallurgical plant.
The integrated approach of the UKMC using, copper, lead, and zinc base metals as
the main collectors allows the recovery of precious metals, platinum group metals,
selenium, tellurium, cadmium, thallium, mercury, zinc sulfate, and sodium antimonate.
22.2.2 Primary and urban mining integration: Japanese industrial examples
The Japanese nonferrous industry has developed a multimetal recovery approach process-
ing primary raw materials in conjunction with recyclable materials, allowing at the same
time the processing and detoxiﬁcation of industrial wastes.
Industrial wastes and recyclable materials are preprocessed and detoxiﬁed in dedicated
plants, generating metal containing streams that are then directed to the most suitable
processing plant, depending on their base metal content. This approach allows to maxi-
mize synergies with existing base metals processing plants. Industrial examples of this
approach are as follows:
•
JX Nippon Mining multisite integration for processing on industrial waste, recycling
materials, and primary materials ( JX Nippon Mining, 2020)
•
Dowa group Eco-recycling Network (Kosaka, 2019)
•
Mitsubishi Onahama and Naoshima smelters primary and recycling materials process-
ing (Takagi, 2018).
Fig. 22.4 shows the integrated approach developed by JX group ( JX Nippon Mining
& Metals, 2010). In contrast with UKMC, processing plants are in different geographic
locations requiring transportation of intermediate and preprocessed materials to the
processing plants. The JX integrated approach involves direct processing and/or prepro-
cessing of recycling materials, detoxiﬁcation of industrial residues, and subsequent
direction of subproducts to copper and lead processing plants or battery materials
processing facilities.
This eco-processing approach offer several advantages such as the following:
•
Incorporate back into the metal ﬂow base metals contained in WEEE (waste electrical
and electronic, equipment)
•
Minimize waste generation
•
Detoxiﬁcation and minimization of industrial waste prior to landﬁll
546
Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

•
Stabilization of residues
•
Preprocessing of WEEE and removal of harmful materials prior to processing in
primary smelters (i.e., halogens that could chemically attack off-gas equipment)
The main copper recovery hub for JX approach is the Saganoseki copper smelter
where urban mining resources are processed with copper concentrates allowing recovery
of precious metals from WEEE. Lead-containing materials are processed at the Hitachi
lead smelter. A dedicated battery recycling processing plant allows the recovery of cobalt
and nickel.
A regional eco-system approach was also developed by Dowa in the northern region
of Akita, Japan. Taking advantage of the location of copper, lead, and zinc processing
plants, Dowa developed an eco-recycling network to facilitate recovery and recycling
of metals from traditional urban mining resources, allowing at the same time the process-
ing of general and industrial wastes. Fig. 22.5 shows the integrated approach developed
by Dowa Group. The integrated eco-system allows the collection and preprocessing of
end-of-life electric and electronic equipment, industrial wastes, and contaminated soils.
These materials become raw materials for processing in zinc, copper, and lead processing
lines located in two different locations.

22.2.3 European examples of integration
Examples of synergies to optimize processing of primary and secondary raw materials can
be found in the integrated ﬂowsheet of the following plants:
•
Umicore Hoboken plant: Flowsheet developed to process complex primary and
secondary raw materials. The ﬂowsheet combines copper, lead, precious metals
reﬁning, and special metals reﬁning operations (Vanbellen, 2010)
•
Aurubis: Combination of primary copper and lead operations to optimize processing
of complex materials and recovery of precious metals (Aurubis AG, 2020)
•
Boliden: Integration of copper, lead, and zinc operations with intake of primary and
secondary materials (Testaye, 2017).
Fig. 22.6 shows the integrated processing ﬂowsheet developed by Aurubis to process
complex concentrates. The overall ﬂowsheet combination allows the integration and trans-
fer of materials from the lead to the copper smelter. The lead process circuit consists of an
electric furnace that processes in different campaign copperelead containing materials and a
converter to produce copper matte and blister copper. Products from the copper campaign
are transferred to the copper smelter. Lead generated in the process is pyroreﬁned. The lead
plant is integrated with the anode slimes plant and the precious metal reﬁning plant.
On the secondary copper side, Aurubis has developed the Kayser Recycling System.
This ﬂowsheet, shown in Fig. 22.7, and developed to recover copper, lead, tin, and
precious metals has been in operation since 2002 in L€unen, Germany. The process

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

involves the reductive smelting of secondary copper sources in a TSL ISASMELT
furnace, converting in a TBRC furnace and subsequent anode reﬁning. A leadetin
furnace allows the recovery of a leadetin alloy. The smelting process conducted at a
reductive environment allows the fuming of zinc, which is recovered as a complex
zincebearing residue. A partnership with a third party company allows the processing
of the zinc containing material, recover of copper and lead, safe disposal of residual
elements, and valorization of zinc for further use (Aurubis Homepage, 2020).
These examples show how synergies can create opportunities to recover metals, mini-
mize waste streams, optimize recovery, and ﬁnally most importantly achieve a sustainable
processing of materials. In most of the above-mentioned cases, integration of hydromet-
allurgical and pyrometallurgical plants allows the optimization of multimetal recovery
and minimization of wastes.

Integration of complexity by processing of primary and urban mining resources, using
base metals metallurgy as a core, will become even more relevant for the future of smelter
operations as they become essential players of a circular economy enhancing recovery,
recycle, and reuse of metals.
Fig. 22.8 shows the ﬂowsheet developed by Umicore Precious Metals for the processing
of complex materials. The main processing unit is a TSL ISASMELT furnace. Complex
lead/copper materials, containing valuable minor elements, are treated in this furnace in a
two-step smelting and converting process. The smelting stage involves the oxidation of
the feed to form a copper matte and a smelting slag (see Chapter 9 for TSL operating
principles). The silica-based lead-rich slag produced during smelting is tapped and slow
cooled for further reduction and lead bullion production in a blast furnace. The copper
matte is converted in the TSL ISASMELT furnace after the tapping of the smelting
slag. The ﬂowsheet allows maximization of precious metals recovery. The ﬂowsheet is
complemented with a precious and minor metals processing plant (Vanbellen et al., 2006).

Extractive Metallurgy of Copper

22.3 Concluding remarks
This book has described through many decades the evolution of copper processing,
explaining in detail technologies involved in the processing of copper concentrates
from mine to cathode, and providing relevant metallurgical information to support the
education and training of students and technical personnel. In the last 40 years, the
industry has evolved to become more energy efﬁcient (Coursol et al., 2010), environ-
mentally sustainable, and competitive. Pyrometallurgical production has also shifted to
China and resources have become more complex. Recycling has also become more rele-
vant as society has transformed its core to become a high intensity metal consuming one.
These changes have also been at the core to evaluate the required technological trans-
formation in metallurgical ﬂowsheet to adequate them to integrate processing of primary
and urban mining resources.
As described in this chapter, copper smelters have therefore become industrial assetsd
part of integrated processing networks enabling the sustainable production of metals from
complex sources. As our modern society moves towards a more digital society, with
intense use of metals to enhance sustainable living, process engineers and technologists
will be required to constantly evaluate how existing metallurgical processes will handle
more complex materials recover from urban and traditional mining sources.
Eco-processing systems integrating the processing of industrial waste, WEEE and other
recycling materials, traditional copper ores, and other potential sources will be required
to a larger extent.

In addition, complexity derived from the increment of deleterious elements such as
arsenic will require the industry to revisit the current strategy of blending. Preprocessing
of complex concentrates, involving hydrometallurgical processing or roasting, might be
required.
Eco-processing systems involve an efﬁcient and sustainable recovery of metals. From
this perspective, the following elements will continue to be relevant to ensure sustainable
eco-friendly copper smelters:
•
Base metal integration to allow efﬁcient recovery of minor and valuable metals and
safe disposal of metallurgical wastes
•
Valorization of copper slags as subproducts
•
Integration with industrial waste processing facilities to minimize overall waste
generation and maximize recovery of valuable elements
•
Maximization of impurity capacity usage in copper smelters
•
Development of integrated hydrometallurgical solutions to complement smelting
processing
