Introduction
P
roject management has been around as long as there have been people
coming together trying to get things done. Some ancient fellow with a
lot of ambition probably took the lead as the very first project manager. He
carved diagrams in stone tablets to help his team members understand his
strategy and actually talked to them to communicate progress (no e-mail in
those days!). Unlike you, this early project manager had no senior manage-
ment to report to, no formal budget, and no cubicle, but the fundamental
spirit of a project was there.
Over the years, project management has evolved into a sophisticated disci-
pline that involves standardized methodologies and techniques. Project man-
agers have a toolkit that includes detailed analyses and projections, tools to
track time and money, and highly visual reports to impress management.
Project management software — which has been around only about 25 years
or so — has brought a new face and functionality to project management that
would have left our ancient project managers speechless.
About This Book
Microsoft Office Project 2007, the most recent version of the world’s most
popular project management software, provides a treasure trove of function-
ality; it makes the features of your average word processing software look
like child’s play in comparison.
All that functionality can be wonderful, but if you’ve never used project
management software, those features can also be a bit overwhelming. One
key to making the leap from your traditional project management methods
to project management software is to understand how its features relate to
what you do every day as a project manager. Another is to get a book like
this one that tells you all about Project’s features and how to use them. Even
if you have used project management software or Project itself before, this
book offers a wealth of advice and information on Project 2007 features that
can help you get productive right away.
In Microsoft Office Project 2007 All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, our
goal is to help you explore all that Project offers, providing information on
relevant project management concepts in handy modules (called minibooks)
while also offering specific procedures to build and track your Project plans.
But more importantly, we offer advice on how to make all these features and
procedures mesh with what you already know as a project manager to make
the transition easier.

How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into digestible chunks of chapters contained in ten
minibooks. Each minibook covers an important topic you need in order to
use Project, such as basic project management concepts, resources, and
tracking. If you’re new to Project, you might want to read each book in
sequence, but if you’ve used Project before, you can simply refer to the mini-
book that you need at the moment.
In addition, we include case studies throughout this book to help you see how
Project works in action. Files that go along with those case studies are on the
book’s companion Web site, located at www.dummies.com/go/project
2007aiofd.
The following sections offer a quick synopsis of what each book contains.
Book I: Project Management
This book gives you a firm grounding in project management concepts and
the Microsoft Project 2007 environment. You discover what typical tasks go
into a project, as well as how using Project to manage your tasks and
resources can save you time and money. Finally, in Chapter 5, we explore
what’s new in Project 2007, particularly some neat features such as Change
Highlighting and Task Drivers.
Book II: Project Basics
Some of the basic building blocks of Project include the overall structure of a
project plan, which we discuss in Chapter 1, and the tasks that make up that
plan. It’s in this minibook that you create your first task and explore the
many views Project offers to help you review and analyze your project data.
In Chapter 4, we cover calendars, very important tools in building your pro-
ject’s timing. Finally, in Chapter 5, we explore Project’s help system so you
can use it to find topics of interest easily.
Book III: Getting Your Plan in Order
This is the minibook where you explore the outline structure of a Project
plan, made up of summary tasks and subtasks, and how to assign outline
codes. Chapter 3 introduces you to the work breakdown structure (WBS)
code, used by many organizations to uniquely identify tasks in a project
plan. Finally, in Chapter 4 you discover the ins and outs of inserting and link-
ing projects so that a task within one project can represent the timing of
another project.

Book IV: Establishing Task Timing
Task timing is determined by a number of factors, several of which are
reviewed in the chapters of this minibook. Chapter 1 explores the basics of
timing. Chapter 2 provides an introduction to what drives task timing, includ-
ing the start and finish dates of a project and the setting for how Project
schedules tasks. In Chapter 3, you explore dependencies, timing relationships
between tasks that control their timing in relation to each other. Finally,
Chapter 4 deals with constraints, settings such as Start No Later Than that
force a task’s timing in some fashion.
Book V: Working with Resources and Costs
Resources are the people, equipment, and materials that you use to get
things done on your project. There are various kinds of resources, which you
discover in Chapter 1, “Creating Resources.” Chapter 2 shows you how
resources relate to costs in your project. Chapter 3 is where you discover
how to assign resources you’ve created to tasks in your project. The last
chapter in this minibook explores how Project totals up costs resulting from
resource assignments.
Book VI: Communicating Project Information
When you input data about tasks and resources into Project, it returns a
wealth of information about your schedule and costs. In this minibook, you
look more closely at all the views Project offers for reviewing that informa-
tion, as well as tables of data you can display in those views and even cus-
tomize. This minibook ends with two chapters about reporting, one covering
traditional Project reports and one covering a Visual Reports feature that’s
new in Project 2007.
Book VII: Resolving Problems in Your Plan
When you have created a Project plan, before you put it into action it’s a
good idea to review it and fix any problems. In this minibook, we introduce
filters and groups that help you spot trends and problems. Chapter 2 helps
you through several methods for resolving resource conflicts, which might
include resources who are overbooked at some point during the life of your
project or whose assignments are causing delays in your schedule. Chapters
3 and 4 show you how to spot and resolve problems with timing in your proj-
ect, including how you can use Project to help you convince your manage-
ment that you need more time to get everything done.

Book VIII: Tracking
The project has started, tasks are being worked on, resource costs are tallying
up. Now comes the tracking phase, when you set a baseline against which you
can record progress. In this minibook, we discuss recording actual activity on
tasks and reviewing what that activity is doing to your budget.
Book IX: Advanced Project Topics
Project is a very sophisticated piece of software, and it provides you with
several more advanced tools to make your life easier. Book IX is where you
find out how to customize the interface that Project shows you and the look
of the various elements in your project plan. You also discover how to use
macros to automate procedures and how to both import and export data in
Project.
Book X: The Basics of Project Server
Project Professional can be used in conjunction with Project Server to create
an enterprise-wide project management solution. Chapter 1 of this book
gives you an overview of Project used with Project Server. Chapters 2
through 4 approach enterprise project management using Project and
Project Server from the perspective of the Project Server administrator, the
project manager, and the project team member.
Glossary
Project management and Project itself involve a lot (and we mean a lot) of
terms and acronyms that you need to know to input and analyze data. This
glossary is a good place to go when an unfamiliar word or string of letters
pops up.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use a few conventions in this book that you ought to know about.
Web site addresses, or URLs, and other items such as filenames are highlighted
like this: www.microsoft.com and IAmAFile.mpp.
Menu commands are given in the order in which you select them; for example,
Choose Tools➪Resource Sharing➪Share Resources.
Options in dialog boxes use initial caps even if they aren’t capitalized on
your screen. This makes it easier for you to identify them in sentences. For
example, what appears as “Show summary tasks” in the Options dialog box
appears as Show Summary Tasks in our chapters.

Foolish Assumptions
We’ve made some assumptions in writing this book. First, we’ve assumed
that you are computer literate — that you’ve used software and know what a
menu and dialog box are. We assume you know how to use a mouse to select
objects and text. We assume you have good file management skills and know
that you should keep copies of your files and save frequently.
We have not assumed that you have used Project before, though you might
have used a previous version and simply want to find out more about some
area of it.
We haven’t assumed that you manage multimillion dollar projects; whether
you deal with small projects or large projects, the information and concepts
in this book help you manage them better.
In case you’re new to project management, we’ve provided the first minibook
to give you a grounding in some key project management concepts.
Icons Used in This Book
Putting little pictures in the margins of tech books to call your attention to
certain types of information has become a standard, and For Dummies books
use the neatest little pictures around. Here’s what they mean:
Tips are the advice columns of computer books. They offer wise advice from
those of us who have been in the Project trenches, a bit more information
about a topic under discussion, or a different way to achieve some results.
Remember icons offer a relevant fact or reminder of a key concept. These
juicy tidbits are likely to be useful to you repeatedly, so don’t forget them.
Warning icons alert you to potential problems, so don’t ignore them. If you
don’t take the advice in warnings, you might end up with lost data, a faulty
project plan, or a really bad day.
This icon marks Project information that goes beyond the basics.
Throughout this book, we have included case studies that help you envision
how Project works in a real world (well, a pretend real world) setting. The
files for these case studies are also included on the companion Web site
(www.dummies.com/go/project2007aiofd).

Where to Go from Here
If you know a bit about Project and want to explore some aspect of it further,
just jump to the relevant book and have at it. If you want to start by checking
out what’s new in Project 2007, Book I, Chapter 5 is the place to go. If you
need to start from square one, start with Chapter 1 of Book I and work your
way through each minibook to get a logically organized introduction to all
that project management with Project has to offer.
Wherever you dive in, you’ll find what you need to make your experience
with Project more productive.

M
icrosoft Project 2007 is a wonderful tool for managing projects.
However, a tool is only as good as the person wielding it. Understanding
how Project fits in the context of a typical project is important to using it 
successfully.
In this chapter, we look at what occurs during the life of a project and how
Microsoft Project fits within that life cycle; the typical roles in a project and
how people in each of those roles might interact with Project; and some
basic project management concepts.
The Life of a Project
You handle projects day in and day out. Some take a few hours to complete,
such as that shed you built in your yard last Saturday. Others might take
years from beginning to end to complete the work and reach your goals.
However, most projects that you handle will have several things in common.
So, just what is a project?
Microsoft Project has certain features that help you deal with all the elements
of a typical project. So what is a typical project? All projects have
✦An overall goal
✦A project manager
✦Individual tasks to be performed
✦Timing for those tasks to be completed (such as three hours, three
days, or three months)
✦Timing relationships between those tasks (For example, you can’t
launch a space shuttle until you fill it with fuel.)

The Life of a Project
10
✦Resources (people, equipment, facilities, and supplies, for example) to
accomplish the work
✦A budget (the costs associated with the people, equipment, facilities, and
supplies)
Project management is simply the process of managing all the elements of a
project, whether that project is large or small.
Taking a closer look at the project life cycle
You can typically expect to work through several phases of a project, and in
each phase, you’ll perform different activities in Microsoft Project. Projects
typically break down into the following phases:
1. Planning: Whether it takes hours, days, or months, this is a very impor-
tant phase. This is when you identify your goal or goals (see Chapter 2
of this minibook for more about this process), get management support
for the project, and line up your internal and external resources, includ-
ing people, facilities, equipment, and so on. In Project you can start to
sketch out your Project plan by adding tasks that, at this point, might or
might not have timing (see Figure 1-1) and entering information about
resources that you’ll use.

ment.

2. Finalizing the plan: After you’ve gathered all your resources and thought
through the steps of your project in the planning phase, it’s time to dot
your i’s and cross your t’s so you’re ready to launch the project. In Project,
this means making sure all the logical timing relationships between tasks
have been accounted for (see Figure 1-2), all the cost information for
resources is correct, and that you resolve any resource conflicts. (An exam-
ple of a resource conflict is when one person is booked to work 16 hours in
one day, for example.) This is also the time to present your final plan to
management and get their approval. (Project’s reporting capabilities come
in handy here.) When your plan is approved, you save a baseline project
against which you can track actual progress after your project begins.
See Book IV for information about task timing, Book VII about resolving
problems in your plan, and Book VIII, Chapter 1 for information about
setting a baseline.

3. Launching the project: With an approved plan in hand, you can officially
launch the project. Make sure your entire team has information about
individual responsibilities and that you’ve set up channels of communi-
cation either online, using printed reports, or through regular in-person
meetings. Also make sure you have set up reporting mechanisms for
your team members to report their work hours on tasks and progress.
Be sure to instruct your team in how to use those mechanisms, such as
the Timesheet feature built into Project Web Access (see Figure 1-3). See
Book X, Chapter 4 for more about this.
4. Tracking and revising your plan: When your team starts working on
tasks and reporting progress, you or somebody you designate has to
track that progress in Project. With information on tasks and resource
time added into your project plan, you’ll find that actual work is likely to
differ from your projections. When that happens, you might have to
make adjustments to the remainder of your plan to meet your deadline,
budget limits, or goals. You can also use Project’s reporting capabilities
(see Figure 1-4) to keep your management, clients, and other project
stakeholders current on the status of your project. See Book VIII for
details about tracking activity on a project.
5. Ending the project and debriefing: If you’ve established a clear set of
goals and deliverables, you’ll know when the project is over. When that
moment comes, your job isn’t quite finished. It’s important that you send
out final reports or accountings to management and clients, thank your
team members for their efforts and communicate with them about the
project’s success, and hold a meeting to debrief the team about the proj-
ect so you can learn from both your failures and successes along the way.

a particular role, everybody in a project has unique responsibilities. From
the project manager to the folks who do work on tasks and even the client or
customer who will benefit from the final results, you need to understand
how each person in your project fits in. What does a project manager do?
A project manager could be described as somebody who knows how to wear
many hats. A project manager is a scheduler, a budget maker, a facilitator of
communications, a resolver of conflicts, a troubleshooter, a counselor, and
much, much more.
A project manager isn’t always the highest authority in a project; often, that
role belongs to the project manager’s own manager, up to and including
members of senior management. Rather, the project manager is the person
on the front lines who puts together a plan, gathers resources, makes sure
that the tasks in the project happen, and records project activity in Project.
Ideally, a project manager should have some experience in managing people
and processes and to some degree should be familiar with the type of work
that resources will be asked to perform.

A project manager supervises these essential pieces of a project:
✦The project plan or schedule: This is what you create with Microsoft
Project. It includes the estimated steps and associated timing and costs
involved in reaching the project goal.
✦Resources: Managing resources involves assigning resources and track-
ing their activities on the project as well as resolving resource conflicts
and building consensus. This part of the job also involves managing the
use of nonhuman resources, such as materials and equipment.
✦Communication with the project team, management, and customers:
Communicating the project’s status to everyone who has a legitimate
stake in its success (stakeholders) is a key responsibility.
As a project manager, it’s your job to keep all stakeholders informed, get
appropriate approvals, and involve the right people at the right time.
Stakeholders of all types
In addition to a project manager and the resources who perform tasks, others
will have an interest in the project and its outcome. In project management
parlance, anybody involved in a project is considered a stakeholder.
✦The person who champions (and has the ultimate responsibility for) a
project is the project sponsor. This person usually belongs to higher-up
management and should support the project manager by helping to get
key approvals, providing input on larger organizational priorities, and
obtaining funding from management.
✦Although a project manager might work for a project sponsor, the project
often also has a customer for whom the end product is produced. That
customer can be outside the project manager’s own company or within.
A customer generally gets final approval of the deliverables of a project
and pays the costs of a project.
✦A project might have a whole slew of additional stakeholders in the form
of vendors, contractors, or consultants who will work on the project
along with internal resources.
Getting a Few Project Management 
Concepts under Your Belt
As you work with Microsoft Project, you’ll deal with all-important timing
details to try to make your deadline. You need to understand some concepts
behind scheduling in order to make intelligent choices as you build a Project
plan.

The dreaded triple constraint
You’ve seen the signs at the copy store or the auto repair place: “You can
have it fast, cheap, or right; pick two.” That, good friend, is the triple con-
straint of project management in a nutshell.
In a project, you have timing, resources (which are essentially costs), and
the quality of the product or service you want to produce at the end of the
project. Microsoft Project helps you to manage the resources and timing of
your project. Still, the quality of your project is often affected directly by
how well you manage these other two elements. If you add time, costs
increase because resources are working longer hours at a certain wage. If
you take away resources, you save money, but this can affect quality.
Creating a balance among time, money, and quality is the juggling act you
will perform throughout the life of a project. Project offers the following
tools to help you do this:
✦Change Highlighting helps you see how one change (say, in timing)
affects other aspects (such as cost). See Book I, Chapter 5 for more
about Change Highlighting.
✦Resource leveling is a calculation that moves your schedule out to
free up overtaxed resources. Of course, in this case you sacrifice time,
but with less-stressed resources, you probably improve the quality of
your outcome. See Book VII, Chapter 2 to discover how to use this
handy feature.
✦You can set priorities on tasks so that you can keep tabs on changes
that occur on tasks that ensure quality (for example, quality testing or
QA tasks).
Keeping on track: Critical path and slack
If you look at all the tasks in a project, you find a series of tasks that, if
delayed, would delay the project. This is called the critical path. The simplest
example of a critical path is a project with two tasks, one of which takes two
weeks to complete and one of which takes one week to complete. If those
tasks can happen simultaneously, the longer path is on the critical path, but
the shorter task could be delayed several days and not delay the end date of
the project. If the shorter task is delayed, say, eight days, it then becomes the
critical task in the project.
Staying aware of what the critical path of your project is at any point in time
(and it will shift around, trust us) is vital to staying on schedule. Project pro-
vides filters and reports that help you spot your critical path easily (see
Figure 1-5).

Getting a Few Project Management Concepts under Your Belt
16
Tasks that aren’t on the critical path in your project have some slack — that
is, some time that they could be delayed without delaying the entire project.
Ideally, every task in your project should have slack because things can
come up that you never expected (shortages of vital materials, asteroid
strikes, or management turnover that places you in an entirely different
department). It’s up to you to build slack into your schedule as you build in
task timing in Project (see Book IV for more about how to do this).
See Book VII, Chapter 4 for more about working with slack.
Using tried-and-true methodologies
Microsoft Project incorporates some scheduling and tracking tools that are
the result of many years of developing project management methods. A few
of these are worth noting:
✦A Gantt chart (shown in Gantt Chart view in Figure 1-6, which is the main
view of Project), shows you a spreadsheet with columns of data along
with a graphical representation of the tasks in the project arranged along
Figure 1-5:

view.

Book I
Chapter 1
A Project
Management
Overview

a horizontal timeline. By using the data in the columns (such as task
name, start date, finish date, and resources assigned to tasks), you can
understand the parameters of each task and see its timing in the graphi-
cal area. Being able to view all this information on one page helps you
understand what’s happening in your project in terms of time and costs.
If you’re a history buff, you’ll be interested to hear that the Gantt chart
was created in 1910 by Henry Gantt, a mechanical engineer, and the idea
was first published in The Engineering Magazine.
See Book II, Chapter 3 for more about working with and changing Project
views.
✦The Network Diagram (also called a logic diagram), shown in Figure 1-7,
is essentially the Microsoft version of a PERT chart. PERT (Program
Evaluation and Review Technique) was developed during the construction
of the Polaris submarine in the 1950s. This mostly graphical representa-
tion of the tasks in your project reflects the flow of work in your project
rather than the literal timing of tasks. This view helps you to see how one
task flows into another and to get a sense of where you are — not so much
in time, but rather in terms of the work you have to accomplish.

Resource Management Basics
If you asked us to do so, we could write an entire book about resource
management. This is one of the most important skills a project manager
can acquire because resources are the way things get accomplished in any
project. But we have much more to cover, so here’s the ten-cent tour of
resource management.
How Project sees resources
Resource management consists of using your resources wisely. This involves
not only managing people, but also strategically selecting the right resource
and making the right assignments.
In Microsoft Project, resources are also the method used to accrue costs.
Resources, in Project’s terms, can be people, equipment, facilities that you
rent, or fixed costs such as a consultant’s fee or an airplane ticket; in short, a
resource is anything or anybody you use to perform the tasks in your project.
All resources have a defined amount of availability. You might have to ensure
that there is enough material on hand to complete a task, that a meeting

room is available when you need it, that an in-demand piece of scientific test-
ing equipment isn’t offline, or that a key human resource isn’t on vacation or
assigned to another project.
What it takes to manage people
When dealing with human resources, a good project manager can do the 
following:
✦Find the right resource for the job, taking into account skill level and cost.
✦Provide any required training for resources.
✦Assign the resource a reasonable workload, which sometimes means
negotiating with other project managers for that person’s time.
✦Stay alert for shifts in the schedule that cause the resource to be 
overbooked.
✦Make adjustments during the life of the project that keep all resources
most productive.
In Project, tools are available, such as a resource graph (traditionally called a
histogram) and the resource usage chart (shown in Figure 1-8), to help you
track resource workload. You can see how overbooked the Systems Analyst is.
Project allows you to assign codes for resources that you can use to desig-
nate skill levels or abilities so that finding the right resource for each job is
as simple as performing a search.
Do I always need resources?
Resources in Project are there to accrue costs
and to help you monitor overbooked resources,
which might cause delays in your schedule.
Some project managers choose not to assign
resources to tasks in Project if those resources
have no associated cost and their time doesn’t
need to be tracked. For example, if an 
administrative assistant does some work for the 
department that includes project work, but
nobody allocates his or her time to the project
budget, there’s no need to assign that person to
individual tasks. If you use a meeting room but
there is no charge to use it and the hours you
use it don’t need to be tracked for any reason,
you don’t need to create, assign, or track such a
resource.

Resource Management Basics
20
It’s especially hard to anticipate resource assignments in a lengthy project
because it’s difficult to know who will be available a year or two from now.
To deal with that, consider creating generic resources, such as “Engineer,”
and fill in the appropriate individual’s information later in the project.

elcome to the world of computerized project management with
Microsoft Project. If you’ve never used project management software,
you’re stepping into a whole new era of project management. You’ll be leav-
ing the world of the handwritten to-do list and entering a world teeming with
hi-tech calculations and sophisticated project data.
Everything you ever did with handwritten to-do lists, word processors, and
spreadsheets all magically comes together in Project. However, the transition
into computerized project management doesn’t happen in seconds. First you
need a basic understanding of what project management software can do,
what it demands of you, and what results it can provide.
If you’ve used previous versions of Project, this little overview can help you
refresh your memory as well as ease you into a few of the new features of
Project 2007.
The Basics of Computerized Project Management
If you’ve scanned this book’s Table of Contents, you’re probably shaking
your head and saying, “Boy, handwritten to-do lists look pretty good right
now. Beats having to key in tons of data about tasks, schedules, and
resources,” right?
Well, you’re right and wrong about that. You do have to enter a lot of infor-
mation into Project to get the benefit of its features. But after you provide
Project with some data, you can also get a lot out of it.

The Basics of Computerized Project Management
22
Making the leap to Project
“So,” you ask, “what exactly can Project do for me?” The following list
describes the payoff that you get for investing time to understand and use
Project to manage your work.
With Project, you enjoy the following benefits:
✦Automatic calculations: Project automatically calculates costs and
timing for you based on your input. This gives you an instant snapshot
of your status at any point during your project. See Book VII for more
about automatic versus manual calculations.
✦Ability to try out what-if scenarios: You can quickly have Project recal-
culate what-if scenarios to solve resource conflicts, get your costs within
budget, or meet your final deadline.
✦Views and reports: Project offers views and reports that, with the click
of a button, make a wealth of information available to you and those you
report to. No more manually building a report on total-costs-to-date to
meet a last-minute request from your boss. If she wants to know total-
costs-to-date, you can just print your Tracking Gantt view with the
Tracking table displayed. See Book VI for information about reporting.
✦Templates: You can use built-in templates to get a head start on your proj-
ect. Project templates are prebuilt plans for a typical business project,
such as commercial construction, an engineering project, a new product
rollout, software development, or an office move (see Figure 2-1 for an
example). See Book II, Chapter 1 for more about using templates.
You’re likely to do similar types of projects all the time. After you create
one project, make it a custom template for future projects. See Book II,
Chapter 1 for information about how to save a file as a template.
✦Resource management: You can create resources for your project based
on information that already exists in your Outlook Address Book. Your
company could create one set of resources and give access to them to
every project manager in the company. This not only saves you time in
building resources from scratch, but it also helps you track resource
time across multiple projects. See Book V for more about working with
resources.
✦Calculation of project data: A number of tools in Project employ com-
plex algorithms (that we couldn’t even begin to explain) to help you
resolve problems or view data, such as leveling resource assignments to
solve resource conflicts, filtering tasks by various criteria, and calculat-
ing in dollars (or francs, or whatever) the value of work performed to
date. See Book V, Chapter 4 for information about how Project calculates
costs, and Book VII, Chapter 1 to discover how filters help you focus on
certain types of information in your project.

Connecting with your team online
You can hop onto the Internet and communicate with your project team by
using Project collaboration features. In fact, using Project 2007 you can enter
the world of Enterprise Project Management (EPM), where it becomes possi-
ble for you to easily share ideas, information, and documents across your
entire enterprise.
You can do a number of useful activities online; for example, Project allows
you to request updates on a task’s progress from team members via e-mail.
You can post documents to a SharePoint site and ask for team input. You can
even publish your project on the Web so those without Project can view it.
The Professional version of Project includes Project Server and Project Web
Access, which enable many of the workgroup collaboration features in
Project. With these tools, you can take advantage of an online project center
and resource center with areas for discussions, progress tracking, document
exchange, and more.
Book X looks at how to take advantage of the enterprise-wide features of
Project Server and Project Web Access.

What You Have to Put Into Project
24
What You Have to Put Into Project
Project can give a lot back, but it depends on the information you put in to
produce its calculations, reports, and so on.
Though there are a few other pieces of information you can provide to
Project, by far the two biggest chunks of data it requires of you are the tasks,
or steps, to be completed to reach your project goal and the resources you
will use to accomplish those tasks.
Tasks and their timing
A task is simply one of those items you used to scribble on your handwritten
to-do lists, such as Write final report or Apply for permits. Tasks are typically
organized into phases (appropriate stages) in Project, arranged in an outline-
like structure, as you can see in the project shown in Figure 2-2.
The length of tasks (their duration) and the sequence of tasks together create
the timeline for your project. Project allows you to create that sequence by
building in timing relationships among tasks.
Figure 2-2:

Chart view.

Book I
Chapter 2
The Ins and Outs 
of Using Project

25
Mastering tasks
A task can be as broad or as detailed as you like. For example, you can
create a single task to research your competition, or you can create a project
phase that consists of a summary task and various subtasks below it (see
Figure 2-3).
In a project phase involving researching your competition, the summary task
might be Competitive Research, which includes the subtasks Researching
Online Business Databases, Assembling Company Annual Reports, and
Reviewing Competitive Product Lines.
A project can have as many tasks and as many phases as you like. You simply
use the outlining structure in Project to indent various levels of tasks. The
more deeply indented in an outline a task is, the more detailed the task.
However, don’t overdo it: If you’re tallying up task 2,503, consider whether you
need to make your project less granular or start to break up this behemoth
into a few smaller projects.
Figure 2-3:
A project
broken up
into phases.

What You Have to Put Into Project
26
One handy thing about Project’s outlining structure is that you can roll up all
the timing and cost data from the subtasks within your phases into summary-
level tasks. Three sequential subtasks that take two days each to complete
and cost you $500 apiece result in a summary task that spans six days and
costs $1,500. You can view your project at various levels of detail. If you view
only summary tasks, you get automatic tallies of timing and costs, and if you
display deeper levels of detail, you get an accounting of every last dime and
minute in your project.
For more about organizing your tasks and outlining, see Book III.
It’s all in the timing
They say that timing is everything: Knowing when to sell that hi-tech stock,
buying real estate before the boom hits, and finding the best time to pop the
question come to mind. The importance of timing applies to Project tasks, as
well. Almost all tasks have timing — referred to as duration. Duration is
simply the amount of time it takes to complete the task.
The only tasks without duration are called milestones. A milestone is a task
of zero duration; in essence, it simply marks a moment in time that you need
to account for in your Project outline. Typical milestones are the approval of
a proposal and an assembly line startup. Figure 2-4 shows a project with sev-
eral important milestones, indicated by a diamond-shaped icon.
Unfortunately, you can’t ask Project to come up with accurate durations: You
assign duration based on your own experience and judgment. Does printing
a product package take three days or three weeks? Will getting senior man-
agement approval take a day or a month? (Don’t forget to pad this task in
proportion to how many of those senior types have to buy in.) Project can’t
come up with these estimates: You have to provide facts, figures, and edu-
cated guesses to build your Project schedule. After you enter that informa-
tion, though, Project can do some wonderful things to help you maintain
your schedule and monitor your progress.
How tasks depend on each other
One very important determining factor in how long your project will take
involves the concept of dependencies, or the timing relationships among
tasks. If you have a schedule that includes ten 2-day tasks that all begin at
the same time, your entire project will take as long as the longest task, which
in this case is two days (see Figure 2-5). However, after you define and imple-
ment timing relationships among tasks, ten 2-day tasks could take as long as
20 days to accomplish.

28
Here’s how this works. On the simplest level, if each of ten 2-day tasks hap-
pens in sequence — that is, each task can’t begin until the task before it is
completed — it will take 20 days to complete them. But dependencies are
often more complex. For example, one task might begin only after another is
finished, but another task can start halfway through the preceding task. The
second task cannot start until a week after the first task is finished. Only
after you start to assign these relationships can you begin to see a project’s
timing as related not just to each task’s duration but also to the specific
ways in which the tasks relate to each other.
Here are some examples of dependencies:
✦You can’t begin to use a new piece of equipment until you train people in
how to use it.
✦You must wait for a nuclear reactor to get online before you can begin to
generate energy.
✦You can’t start to ship a new food product until the FDA approves it.
Figure 2-6 shows a project plan where each task’s duration and the depend-
encies among tasks have been established. Note the resulting overall timing
of the project.
You can find out more about the fine art of managing dependencies in Book IV,
Chapter 3.

Lining up resources
When you’re new to Project, it’s easy to get a bit confused about what a
resource is. Resources aren’t just people: A resource can be a piece of equip-
ment you rent, a meeting room that you have to pay an hourly fee to use, or
a box of nails or a software program you have to buy. Essentially, a resource
is anything or anybody you need to get your tasks done, and though they
don’t always have costs associated with them, they usually do. Resource
costs are, in fact, how Project accounts for your project budget.
Project allows for three kinds of resources: work resources, material
resources, and cost resources. A work resource is charged by how many
hours or days the resource (often human) works on a task. A material
resource, such as baking supplies or steel, is charged by a per-use cost or by
a unit of measurement (such as pounds of flour or tons of steel). A cost
resource has a set cost, such as a conference fee of $250; this fee doesn’t
vary by how much time you spend at the conference, nor by how many
events you attend.
Some resources, typically people, perform their work according to a working
calendar (see Figure 2-7). Say the calendar includes 5 workdays in a working
week. If a person works an 8-hour day and you assign him to a task that takes
24 hours to complete, that person has to put in 3 workdays to complete the
task. In comparison, someone with a 12-hour workday takes only 2 days to
complete the same task.
In addition to establishing the workdays in a typical week, you can set working
and nonworking days for your human resources to accommodate variations
such as 4-day weeks or shift work.
Built-in constraints count, too
There’s one other thing you should know about
the timing of tasks: In addition to applying
dependencies to tasks, you can apply con-
straints. For example, say you don’t want to start
shipping your new toy until you get the ad for it
in your Christmas catalog, so you set a depend-
ency between those two events. You can also
set a constraint which says that you must start
manufacturing the toys no later than November
3. In this case, if you don’t make the catalog
deadline, the product will still ship on November
3; that task won’t be allowed to slip its constraint
because of this dependency relationship.
You can find out more about constraints in Book
IV, Chapter 4.

What You Have to Put Into Project
30
You can set different rates for resources, such as a standard hourly rate and
an overtime rate. You can even indicate that the resource rate changes at
certain times of the year over the life of the project. Project applies the
appropriate rate based on each resource’s calendar and work assigned. For
more about resources and costs, see Book V.
Resource assignments have an impact on both the cost of your project and
its timing. In addition, several views in Project let you see information about
resources and how their assignment to tasks affects your project. Figure 2-8
shows you the Resource Sheet, which has columns of information about
resources and their costs.
Here’s another important thing you should know about resources: They tend
to have schedule conflicts. When assigned resources become overallocated
for their available work time because they’re assigned to too many tasks at
once, Project will alert you to the fact.
For example, if you assign one poor guy to three 8-hour tasks that must all
happen on the same day — and in the same eight hours — Project has fea-
tures that do everything but jump up on your desk and whistle Dixie to
alert you to the conflict (see Figure 2-9). Happily, Project also provides
tools that help you resolve those conflicts, which are covered in Book VII,
Chapter 2.

Keeping a Project on Track
32
Keeping a Project on Track
Projects aren’t set in stone: They typically go through a lot of changes over
their lifetime. Tasks run late, costs go over budget, and sometimes the whole
scope of your deliverables changes. That’s why Project’s capability to make
changes to your project data on the fly is so useful. And the ability to track
those changes against your original plan can be invaluable.
After you complete your original plan, build all your tasks, give them dura-
tions and dependencies, and assign all your resources and costs, you set a
baseline. A baseline is a snapshot of your project at the moment you feel
your plan is final and you’re ready to get started on that first task.
Because Project saves both sets of data in a single schedule, after you set a
baseline and record actual activity on your tasks, you can then compare that
actual activity against your baseline (see Figure 2-10).
The recording of actual activity in a project is called tracking. Tracking activ-
ity in your project involves recording the actual timing of tasks and the time
that your resources spend on those tasks, as well as entering any actual
material costs that accrue. You can then display Project views that show you
how far off you are at any time (compared with your baseline) in terms of
the actual timing of tasks and cost of your project.
Figure 2-10:

activity

33
Tracking allows you to make adjustments when you see that your schedule
or costs are getting out of hand. In addition, when you track activity to date,
you can easily generate reports that help you show your bosses the status of
your project.
Keeping Others in the Loop
One of the big payoffs for entering all that information about tasks and
resources into Project is the ability it offers you to share that information in
reports. Reports help you document progress, beg for additional funding, or
even motivate your team members by showing them all they’ve accomplished.
Project offers a wealth of reporting options to help you view your project and
communicate your progress to your project team, clients, and management.
You can generate predesigned reports based on information in your sched-
ule or simply print any of the views you can display in Project. Project 2007
offers a set of Basic Reports and a new feature called Visual Reports.
You must have the Microsoft .NET Framework installed, which is free and
downloadable from www.microsoft.com/downloads, in order to use
Visual Reports.
Figures 2-11 and 2-12 show you just two of the reporting options available in
Project.

ne of the trickiest parts of putting your project down on paper (or in a
computer file) is knowing exactly what tasks to include in it. Too much
detail and you’ll spend more time creating tasks than getting the work of
your project done. Too broad a vision and you might miss crucial tasks
because nobody defined them along the way.
Some useful tools that are available to project managers can help them focus
their projects at the outset to lay a foundation for eventual success. These
tools include establishing a clear-cut goal and defining the scope of your proj-
ect. After you’ve taken these steps, you can start to outline the various phases
of your project and begin to fill in the tasks you need to get to your goal.
In this chapter, we walk you through setting your project goal and scope,
including writing a goal statement and a scope statement. Then, we take a
look at some general rules that help you make choices about building your
project phases.
First Things First: Define the Business Need
Good project management practice requires that you start at the beginning,
considering what business need your project is fulfilling. Before you begin a
project to upgrade your computer network at a branch office, you should be
sure that your company will continue to invest in that division and won’t be
downsizing the staff that will use the network. You should be sure the tech-
nology you’re installing today will meet the technology needs of the staff in
the future.

Target Practice: Project Goal Setting
36
Too often in companies, projects are launched without anybody considering
the greater organizational goals. One good way to ensure that there’s a match is
to get senior management buy-in up front. If your senior management folks
have a cohesive vision of the short- and long-term goals of the company, it’s
their job to put a stamp of approval on your project goals within that context.
(If your senior management doesn’t have a cohesive vision, we can’t help you.)
Don’t assume your managers have given approval because you copied them
on a memo about the project launch. Get approval, get it in writing, and file it
away.
In looking at the overall fit of your project in your organization, consider factors
such as
✦Future budget and cash flow issues: Does the cost of your project fit in
with overall budgetary constraints?
✦Risk tolerance: For example, is your company being conservative or
aggressive in its growth projections, and does your project fit within risk
parameters?
✦Target customer base: Will your project meet the needs of internal or
external customers, or is your company intending to target new sets of
customers in the future?
Another good idea is to measure your project’s goal against your company’s
mission statement. If the fit isn’t good, your project might be doomed to fail.
For example, if your company’s mission statement includes the phrase “to
service a small, select clientele with high-quality products” and your project
is to launch a Web site offering low-priced products to a wide customer base,
think again!
Target Practice: Project Goal Setting
You can’t hit a target if you don’t know what it looks like. Similarly, you can’t
possibly reach your project’s goal if you don’t know what it is. When you
understand how your project fits in with the broader company direction, it’s
time to really pin down your goal.
“But,” you say, “I know exactly what my goal is, because my boss told me.”
However, a set of deliverables isn’t necessarily a goal.
On first consideration, you might say the goal of expanding the railroad west-
ward in the United States was to enable a train to go from coast to coast. But
was it? Perhaps the goal of those railroad barons was not to get a train to go
cross country, but to open up opportunities for commerce in the West.
It’s time to put the same kind of thought to your project’s goal.

Book I
Chapter 3

Target Practice: Project Goal Setting
37
Getting your goal straight
Say your project involves training new employees in a new software system.
Your goal in training them on this software could be to
✦Make employees more productive in their jobs.
✦Enable employees to better serve customers.
✦Create a prototype program with reduced training costs that can be
used to reduce overall training costs across the company.
✦Increase employee retention by providing useful on-the-job skills.
These goals suggest different priorities as well as different measurements for
gauging the degree to which your project has succeeded in meeting its goal.
How, exactly, do you go about determining your goal? First, go back to the
person who asked you to take on the project and grill him or her about what’s
expected of this project. Should the training have a measurable impact on job
performance, customer satisfaction, employee retention, or cost of delivery?
The answer you get might be that the project should do all of these things.
But think about whether that’s realistic and whether one of these goals
should be paramount in guiding you and your project team. If overall training-
program cost reduction is the biggest goal factor, for example, employee pro-
ductivity might have to take a back seat when you’re making choices along
the way. If customer satisfaction is the real goal, training costs might have to
be adjusted accordingly.
Writing a goal statement
After you get more specifics about your project’s goal, it’s a good idea to put
your goal in writing in a goal statement.
A goal statement outlines why you’re doing this project and what you hope to
accomplish at the end. You don’t get down to specific deliverables and
parameters in a goal statement (you tackle that in the next section on the
project’s scope). For now focus on the why and the desired result.
Here are a few sample goal statements:
✦The goal of the project is to upgrade the shopping cart feature on our Web
site to be easier to use so we can increase online sales by 25 percent.
✦Our goal is to reduce human resource workload by 10 percent by offer-
ing self-service information on job benefits on the company intranet.
Using the example of a training project, consider for a moment what such a
project might involve. Are you supposed to write new training materials, hire

Taking a Look at Your Project’s Scope
38
staff to deliver classes, analyze the training’s effectiveness, update training
materials as needed, and promote the training internally? In that case, the
scope of your project involves managing the entire creation, delivery, and
maintenance of a training program.
Or is your goal to simply create the training materials? Or should your focus
be limited to launching the new training, including promoting it to manage-
ment and staff? These goals indicate very different projects, each with its
own set of deliverables, tasks, resources, schedule, and costs. Writing a goal
statement helps you focus on such a project from the outset.
Taking a Look at Your Project’s Scope
When you understand your goal, you can begin to define the specific param-
eters of the project. This is often referred to as a project’s scope.
A scope is not a goal
Though some confuse them, a goal is not a definition of scope. Here’s how
they differ. Take a look again at this goal statement from the previous section:
The goal of the project is to upgrade the shopping cart feature on our Web
site to be easier to use so we can increase online sales by 25 percent.
A scope statement for this same project might look something like this:
This project will involve all the steps involved to design and implement a
new shopping cart feature (but does not include maintaining or refining it
once launched). The cost of the project will not exceed $25,000 and imple-
mentation must be completed before October 1 to accommodate holiday
sales traffic. The new shopping cart feature should help to increase sales
by allowing customers more options to review their orders, give them
more frequent opportunities to shop for more items after they have added
a product to the cart, and allow them to save their cart contents and
come back to complete the sale at a future date. The new feature must
function on our existing Web technology infrastructure.
Writing a scope statement
Scope statements define both what a project will involve and what it will not
involve. In our example here, the scope statement specifies that the main-
tenance and refining of the shopping cart feature, once launched, will be
handled by some other project team.
You typically get into specifics about the project budget, timeframe, and
deliverables in a scope statement. You shouldn’t include every single detail,

Book I
Chapter 3
Just What Tasks
Should You Include?
Breaking Your Project into Phases
39
but you should have enough information that a project team can understand
the most important parameters of the project. Together, a goal statement
and a scope statement are two valuable tools for focusing yourself and your
team and keeping you on track as you proceed.
If you take the next logical step in pinning down your project at the outset,
at this point you would create what’s called a project charter. This would
include specifying a project name, getting authorization in writing to begin
the project as of a certain date and to draw on a specified budget, creating 
a list of responsibilities, and having those with an interest in the project
(called stakeholders) sign off giving you authority to run the project. You
can use your goal and scope statements to help you obtain the various
pieces of your project charter.
Breaking Your Project into Phases
How does all this goal and scope analysis relate to Project? We’re glad you
asked.
When you start a new project schedule in Project, one of the first things you
will do is begin to enter individual tasks. Knowing your goal and scope helps
you to identify the steps you should be performing to accomplish them.
Thinking things through
Before you create your first task, you should probably begin to think 
beyond the scope of your project to more detailed project parameters.
These parameters help you determine what tasks to include in your project.
For example, you might consider
✦Deliverables: These are tangible products, services, or results that
you’ll produce during your project. Somewhere in your project should
be tasks that reflect the delivery of each deliverable.
✦Key Dates: In addition to the project end date, do you have to meet
other key dates along the way? A rough timeline might help you figure
out the general order of tasks.
✦Completion Criteria: How will you know when you’re done? Do you start
up the new service and that’s it, or do you have to test it for a week
before your job is done? Knowing your completion criteria gives your
team something specific to aim for and helps you create the last phase
of your project.
✦Expectations: Knowing what you expect from your team, management,
and yourself can help you identify some tasks. If you expect your team
to hold a quarterly debriefing meeting and submit a progress report, you

Breaking Your Project into Phases
40
might include such a task in your project. If you expect management to
sign off on a prototype, a task such as Prototype Approval is logical.
✦Potential Risks: Identifying potential problem areas can help you build
in some checks and balances to help avoid or minimize them. For exam-
ple, you may create tasks that contain terms such as Q&A, Testing,
Review, Debrief, and Revise to monitor or fix problems along the way.
It’s just a phase
Many people prefer to start at the upper level of detail in the project by
defining the major phases. Within each phase are the detailed tasks that are
essentially steps to complete the phase.
Figure 3-1 shows the major phases of a Web site implementation project. With
the scope of your project in mind, be sure you know what your last phase is;
in the earlier example of adding a shopping cart feature, the last phase might
be to hand off the project to a team that will handle the maintenance and
refinement of the feature after it’s implemented.
Book III covers specifics about how to organize a project into major phases
and subtasks.
Figure 3-1:

41
Choosing how granular to make your tasks
When you have the major phases of your project in place, you can begin to
add tasks. People who are new to project management or to Project some-
times overdo it at this stage, creating a task for just about every activity they
can imagine. Others don’t put down enough detail to ensure that all require-
ments for the project are met. So how much detail is enough?
We wish we could tell you it’s a science, but it’s not. However, here’s 
some guidance about how to identify tasks. You should include tasks that
indicate
✦The start of a phase: For example, the first step in hiring a vendor might
be to send out a request for proposal.
✦Key milestones: These can be points in time such as approvals, completed
reviews, or confirmation of a deliverable. Milestones help you measure
your achievements in a project.
✦Action steps that must be completed before a next step can occur: If
you have to obtain a permit before you can begin to build a house, don’t
skip the permit task!
You don’t have to include steps that are either too detailed or not project
specific, such as
✦Tasks that your team members should keep track of themselves as they
manage their own time to produce a result (it’s the result you need to
track)
✦Everyday work tasks such as frequent staff meetings, refilling the copy
machine with paper, or booking travel arrangements
Figure 3-2 shows a project outline for a marketing project. This schedule is
too general to be very useful.
Figure 3-3 shows a project that has way too much detail. You would spend all
day every day tracking the progress on such tiny tasks.

Figure 3-4 shows a much better level of task detail, with enough tasks to keep
track of progress and be sure all bases are covered, without micromanaging
people or activities.
As you work on projects using Project, you will get better and better at
defining the level of task detail you should create. One good rule is to not
create more tasks than you have the means or the time to track in your
Project schedule.

n 2007, Microsoft launched a dramatically new interface for selected
products in the Microsoft Office family, of which Microsoft Project is a
part. However, Microsoft Project wasn’t one of the Office family products to
get this new interface-lift, so it sports a very similar look to the previous
edition, based on menus and toolbars that are familiar to most folks.
In this chapter, you get a glimpse of Project 2007 menus and tools, as well
as the various views that make up Project. These views offer you different
perspectives on data that can help you manage your projects efficiently. In
addition, Project Guide offers a wizardlike interface that can walk you
through the development of a new project. Finally, task panes such as New
Project allow you to work with handy sets of tools to complete certain
activities.
This chapter helps to familiarize you with all that the Project environment
has to offer.
Exploring Menus and Toolbars in Project
Menus and toolbars have been the way to get work done in software for the
last several years. Here’s a quick overview of the menus and toolbars that
Project 2007 offers.

Exploring Menus and Toolbars in Project
46
Menu basics
If you’ve ever used a computer, you know what a menu is. Menus such as the
one shown in Figure 4-1 contain sets of commands that might perform a
function or display a dialog box.
In Project 2007 menus, tool icons are displayed to the left of any command
that has a corresponding tool. Also, in the View menu, a check mark appears
to the left of any items that are currently displayed in the view, such as Gantt
Chart, or the View bar (which you read more about later). Some menu com-
mands also display keyboard shortcuts (such as Ctrl+X) to their right.
If you use Project Standard, you have ten menus available to you, as
described in Table 4-1.

site. Book X explores these collaborative capabilities in more detail.
Displaying and using toolbars
Toolbars (which vary slightly depending on the version of Project you’re work-
ing with) are simply another way of invoking commands. You can display sev-
eral built-in toolbars in Project 2007, such as the Resource Management
toolbar shown in Figure 4-2.
Follow these steps to display or hide a toolbar:
1. Right-click in the toolbar area.
2. In the list of toolbars that appears, click the one you want to display.
The toolbar appears near the top of the screen.
3. To hide a toolbar, right-click the toolbar area.
4. In the list of toolbars that appears, click a selected toolbar to deselect it.
The toolbar is hidden.

To save space on your screen, you might want to show toolbars on one row
instead of two. To do this, click the arrow at the far right of a toolbar and
choose Show Buttons On One Row from the list of commands that appears.
Navigating Project
Project 2007 offers a wealth of views that provide different perspectives on
your project. Throughout this book, we advise you on which view to display
to get certain types of work done most efficiently. But first things first: Here
we tell you the basics about how to display and change views.
Getting to a view
You can move from one view to another in Project by using the View bar or
the View menu. The View bar runs along the far left side of every view, as
shown in Figure 4-3. Simply click any view icon there to display that view.

If the View bar doesn’t appear on your screen, choose View➪View Bar to dis-
play it.
Eight commonly used views are already displayed on the View bar: Calendar,
Gantt Chart, Network Diagram, Task Usage, Tracking Gantt, Resource Graph,
Resource Sheet, and Resource Usage. In addition to these views, you might
want to use any of the few dozen other views available. To display views not
shown on the View bar, follow these steps:
1. Click the arrow at the bottom of the View bar to scroll down to the
bottom.
2. Click the More Views icon.
The More Views dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-4.
You can also access the More Views dialog box by choosing View➪More
Views.
3. Use the scroll bar to locate the view you want.
4. Select the view you want and click Apply.
Scrolling to get a better view
The simplest views, such as Calendar view, have a single pane with horizontal
and vertical scroll bars. Other views, such as Resource Usage view (see Figure
4-5), sport two panes. Each pane has its own horizontal scroll bar, but they
share the vertical scroll bar, so the panes move up and down together.
In views with two panes, the pane on the left is referred to as the sheet. This
is a spreadsheetlike interface that contains columns of information. The pane
located on the right of this view is called the chart. The chart uses bars, sym-
bols, and lines to represent each task in your project and the dependency
relationships among them.
Figure 4-4:
Dozens of

50
At the top of the chart area is the timescale. This tool is used as a scale
against which you can interpret the timing of the taskbars. To see your plan
in greater or lesser timing detail, you can modify the time units used in the
timescale. For example, you can look at your tasks in detail over hours or in
a broader overview in weeks or months. Figure 4-6 shows a two-pane view
with a sheet, chart, and timescale.
See the “Changing the timescale” section, later in this chapter, to find out
how to change the time increments displayed in the timescale.
You can click and drag the horizontal scroll bars in either pane to view
additional columns or additional time periods in any pane that includes a
timescale. Timescale panes cover the life of the project; in longer projects,
you can find yourself scrolling through years of time.
Use these different methods to work with horizontal scroll bars:
✦Click the scroll box and drag it until you reach the location in the
pane that you want to look at. When you click and drag the scroll box
to move through a timescale display, the date display indicates where
you are at any time in your scrolling calendar. Release the mouse button
when the date display matches the date you want to view.

51
✦Click to the left or right of the horizontal scroll box to move one page
at a time. Note that a page in this instance is controlled to some extent
by how you resize a given pane. For example, with a timescale pane and
a timescale set to weeks, you move one week at a time. In a sheet pane
displaying three columns, you move to the next (or preceding) column.
✦Click the right or left arrow at either end of a scroll bar to move in
smaller increments. With a sheet pane, you move about one-half column
per click. In a timescale view with weeks displayed, you move about one
day at a time.
Jumping to a particular point in time
To reach a specific timeframe in your Project plan, you can also use the Go
To command on the Edit menu. In the Go To dialog box, you can enter one of
two criteria to find a task:
✦A task date you select from a drop-down calendar.
✦A task ID, which is assigned automatically when you create tasks. This
number provides a unique identifier for tasks in the plan. See Book III for
more about the structure and organization of tasks in a project.

52
You can also click the Go To Selected Task tool (or press Ctrl+Shift+F5) to
scroll the timescale to show the taskbar for a selected task in the sheet pane.
You can use the View➪Zoom command to change the timescale that is dis-
played in the Chart pane. For example, you can show a week of tasks or the
entire project.
Finding Another View
Views are a way to organize information in the software so that you can find
useful information in logical ways. A typical Project plan contains a lot of
data. The many views offer you a way to examine logical subsets of data. You
need these many views because, if an average spreadsheet document is as
complex as a calculator, your average Project plan is more like a souped up
master computer that tracks and controls our national debt.
For example, in a typical Project plan, you can find data about the following:
✦Resources: The resource name, resource type, rate per hour, overtime
rate, assignments, department, cost per use, and more
✦Tasks: The task name, duration, start and finish dates, assigned
resources, costs, constraints, and dependencies, for example
✦Project timing and progress: Several types of calendars, project start
and finish dates, percentage of tasks completed, resource hours spent,
baseline information, critical path information, and more
✦Financial information: Earned value, time and cost variance, and pro-
jected costs for uncompleted work, for example
You might mostly work in two or three views, but still, finding out how to use
the many Project views to enter, edit, look at, and analyze Project data is an
important basic Project skill. When you know what’s available and how to
display it, you can pick and choose what you need.
For more about modifying the format of elements displayed in a view, see
Book VI, Chapter 1.
A popular view: Gantt Chart
Gantt Chart view is like your comfortable neighborhood hangout, the cafe
where most people end up and like to linger. It’s the view that appears first
when you open a new project. This view, shown in Figure 4-7, is a combina-
tion of spreadsheet data and a graphical representation of tasks. Gantt Chart
view is popular because it offers a wealth of information in one place.

Book I
Chapter 4
Exploring the
Project Environment
Finding Another View
53
Gantt Chart view is one of those two-sided views, so it has two major sec-
tions: the sheet pane and the chart pane.
Gantt charts were first developed by engineer Henry L. Gantt in 1917 to deal
with production-control projects in manufacturing. Today they’re used in all
kinds of industries to organize all kinds of projects.
Following the (work)flow: Network Diagram view
Network Diagram view, which is shown in Figure 4-8, is a more visual repre-
sentation of data. The organization of information in this view represents the
workflow in your project with a series of task boxes.
Lines run between these boxes to reflect the sequence of tasks as well as
dependency relationships between them (see Book IV, Chapter 3 for more
about dependency relationships).
In Network Diagram view, the earlier tasks are on the left, and later tasks and
subtasks are to the right. Tasks that happen in the same timeframe are
aligned vertically above each other. Tasks with an X through them have been
marked as complete.

More history: Traditionally called a PERT chart, this method of diagramming
workflow was developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s to help build
the Polaris submarine, a pretty hefty project by anybody’s standards.
Note that there is no timescale in this view. That’s because the view isn’t
used to see specific timing but rather to see the general order and flow of
tasks in your project. However, you can set up task boxes to hold specific
timing information about each task, such as the start date, finish date, and
duration. (Customizing the information in the task boxes is described in
Book VI, Chapter 2.
Controlling time with Calendar view
Look at just about any workplace in the world and you’ll find a calendar.
Calendars are one of the most familiar tools for managing our time, and
therefore, logically, Calendar view is one of the many views offered in
Project. Calendar view, as shown in Figure 4-9, resembles your wall calendar,
representing each week of the month as a row on the calendar.
Calendar view can be set up to display from one to six weeks (or more, by
using a Custom setting in the Zoom dialog box). Calendar view sports a
timescale, which you can change to show a 7-day or 5-day week. If you dis-
play a 5-day week, shading indicates working and nonworking days based on
the base or resource calendar you’ve selected.

Changing Views
The array of views in Project is impressive, but consider this: Every one of
those views can be customized to show a variety of information. Given this,
the possible view variations become astronomical.
For example, you can choose to show different columns of information in
spreadsheets, different labels on the task boxes in Network Diagram boxes
or taskbars in Gantt Chart view, or different sets of data in graph views. You
can modify the size of panes in certain views and adjust the timescale to
reflect different time periods in your project.
This flexibility helps you focus on different aspects at various times over the
life of your project. If you’re having a problem with costs, for example, you
might take a look at Resource Usage view and insert several columns of cost
information, such as resource rates and total actual costs. If your project is
taking a lot — we mean a lot — more time than you expected, you might
want to display Tracking Gantt view and look at a bunch of columns with
timing and dependency data or examine the project’s critical path in the
chart pane. If you need to display more of the sheet area so that you can
read columns without having to scroll, you can do that, too.
This is the section where you find out how to show a variety of information
in each view.
Figure 4-9:

(or even

Changing Views
56
These sections cover some of the most-often used views in Project, but
many more views are available. As you work through specific elements of
Project in this book, keep an eye out for views that are useful for certain
types of project management activities.
Modifying view panes
Several views besides Gantt Chart view also include two panes. These include
Task Usage, Tracking Gantt, and Resource Usage views. You can modify the
information that you see in the sheet pane as well as the scale for timing in the
chart pane. You can also display information near taskbars in the chart pane.
Resizing a pane
In views that include more than one pane, you can reduce or enlarge the size
of each pane. This allows you to see more information in one area, to suit
your focus at the time.
The overall area taken up by the two panes is constant, so when you enlarge
one pane, you reduce the size of the other.
Follow these steps to change the size of a pane in a view:
1. Place your cursor over the edge of a pane.
2. When you see a cursor that’s a line with two arrows (one pointing left
and one pointing right), click and drag.
• Dragging to the left enlarges the pane on the right.
• Dragging to the right enlarges the pane on the left.
3. Release the mouse button.
The panes are resized.
Note that if you display the Project Guide or another task pane, such as New
Project, Project automatically resizes the sheet and chart panes to accom-
modate the additional pane.
Project Guide and the View bar take up valuable on-screen space, so a quick
way to see more of any of the project information in any view is to hide the
Project Guide or View bar. The Project Guide toolbar includes a Hide/Show
Guide button that you can click to hide or display it. Choose View➪View Bar
to turn the View bar on and off.
Changing the timescale
At times during the life of your project, you might want to focus on the
details or switch to the big picture. The ability to modify the timescale to

display your plan in larger or smaller time increments is a handy feature to
help you get the focus you need.
A timescale consists of a possible total of three tiers, as you can see in Figure
4-10. You can use them to display different time increments. For example, the
top tier could mark off months, whereas the middle tier could mark off weeks,
and the bottom tier could mark off days. This variety of detail lets you easily
observe overall task length as well as points in time during the life of the task.
You can use all three tiers, only the middle tier, or the middle and bottom tiers.
You can customize the timescale in several ways. You can
✦Modify the units of time and the alignment of each tier.
✦Include tick lines to mark the beginning of each increment on the
timescale.
✦Include nonworking time on the timescale. For example, if you include
an indication of nonworking time on a project for which weekends are
nonworking, Saturdays and Sundays are indicated by a shaded area in
the display, which can help you visually differentiate between weeks.

inside, or to the left or right of the taskbars.

Especially in projects where you display many columns of data and a lengthy
schedule, a taskbar can be placed far to the right of the sheet pane data,
making it hard to track which task the taskbar is associated with. In that
case, it can be useful to include information, such as the task name or start
date, alongside the taskbar to help you read your plan more easily.
To modify the timescale, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the timescale in any view that contains one and then
choose Timescale.
The Timescale dialog box appears. (See Figure 4-11.)
2. Click a tier tab and select styles for Units, Label, and Align.
3. Set the count.
For example, if your Units choice is weeks and you change the Count
option to 2, the timescale appears in two-week increments.
4. If you don’t want to display a certain tier, select One Tier or Two Tiers
from the Show drop-down list (under the Timescale Options section).
5. If you want Project to use fiscal year notation in the timescale, select
the Use Fiscal Year check box.
For example, if your 2006 fiscal year begins July 1, 2006, 2007 is used on
all months in the fiscal year. The fiscal year is set in the Options dialog
box on the Calendar tab.
6. To show marks at the beginning of each unit of time, select the Tick
Lines check box.

7. Repeat Steps 2–6 for each tier you want to modify.
8. Click the Non-Working Time tab.
9. In the Draw options, select the one you prefer.
Your choices are to have the shaded area for nonworking time appear
behind or in front of taskbars or just not appear.
10. In the Color or Pattern list, select different options for the shading
format.
11. Click the Calendar setting and select a different calendar to base the
timescale on.
You can find out more about calendar choices in Book II, Chapter 4.
12. Click OK to save your new settings, which apply only to the timescale
for the currently displayed view.
You can use the Size setting on the three tier tabs to shrink the display pro-
portionately to get more information on your screen or the printed page.
Choosing to display different columns
Each spreadsheet view has certain default columns of data that are stored in
something called tables, which are described in the next section. In addition
to displaying predefined tables of columns, you can also modify any spread-
sheet table to display any columns you like.
Follow this procedure to show selected columns of data:
1. Right-click the column heading area and then choose Insert Column.
The Column Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-12.
2. In the Field Name list, select the field that contains the information
you want to include.
3. If you want to enter a different title for the field, type it in the Title box.
The title in the current view appears in the column heading for this field.

4. Use the Align Title, Align Data, and Width options to modify the
column format.
5. Click OK to insert the column.
To hide a column, right-click its heading in the sheet pane and then choose
Hide Column.
Changing tables
In any view with a sheet pane, such as Gantt Chart view, you can change
what information is shown in the sheet by using tables. Tables are preset
combinations of columns of data. Displaying the appropriate table helps you
deal with certain tasks, such as using the Tracking table for recording activ-
ity on tasks or the Entry table for entering new task information.
You can easily display a different table by following these steps:
1. Choose View➪Table.
2. Select a table (such as Entry or Cost) from the submenu that appears.
3. To view more tables, click More Tables from the submenu.
4. Click a table and then click Apply.
The columns for the selected table are displayed.
You can also customize the column display for any table by displaying or
hiding individual columns of data one by one. (See Book VI, Chapter 2 for
more about customizing tables.)
Zooming in and out
One way to modify your display for any Project
view is to use the Zoom In and Zoom Out but-
tons on the Standard toolbar. This feature
shows you a longer or shorter period of time in
your project without you changing the timescale
settings. When you need to see several years at
a time in your project, for example, click Zoom
Out several times until you fit as many months
or years as you like in the view. You can also
choose View➪Zoom and specify periods of time
to display in the Zoom dialog box, or even
choose to have the entire project appear on-
screen.

Displaying task panes
Project 2007 has a couple of task panes. Task panes display a side panel of
tools and text boxes you can use to work on a particular type of task.
A New Project task pane (see Figure 4-13) displays when you choose File➪
New, and a Document Management task pane appears when you choose
Tools➪Document Management, for example.
Displaying and Hiding Project Guide
Project Guide is a special task pane that offers you a great way to get a new
project going. It walks you through a series of steps that ask you to enter
certain project information. Based on your choices and entries, Project
Guide then takes care of the creation of various aspects of your project, such
as tasks and resources.
Book II, Chapter 4 provides detailed information about using Project Guide.

f you’re one of those people who have to be in on anything new, or if you
used Project 2003 and need a heads up about what new features in
Project 2007 are worth checking out, this chapter is for you.
In this chapter, we offer a rundown of the various versions of Project 2007 that
are available to help you choose the right one for your needs. We also provide
an overview of new features, including Multiple Undo, Change Highlighting,
task drivers, Visual Reports, Cost resources, and budget tracking. Each of
these features will make your Project experience a little more fruitful.
Each of these features is covered in more detail in individual chapters
throughout this book. Check the index to find additional coverage!
Exploring the Many Versions of Project
Microsoft has, for some time, offered several different versions of Project
based essentially on the size of your organization and projects. Project 2007
is no exception, with two individual user packages and what Microsoft calls
the EPM, or Enterprise Project Management Solution.
Enterprise Project Management simply means project management that
takes place in an organization that is large enough to have departmental and
geographical boundaries across which people must work on projects.
Collaborative tools, most of which are hosted online on a company intranet

Getting out of Hot Water with Multiple Undo
64
or the Internet using Microsoft SharePoint, are vital for enterprises. Book X
covers Enterprise Project Management in more detail.
Here’s the rundown of Project products available to you, starting with the
two individual user offerings:
✦Project Standard is the meat and potatoes version of Project, with lots of
the core functionality, but some of the fancier features are omitted.
These core tools help you manage schedules and resources, but with less
ability to share your project information with others. The product inte-
grates well with Microsoft Office 2007 products such as Excel and Word.
✦Project Professional 2007 contains all that Standard does but adds
some collaborative tools for sharing resources and information with
others. Professional is integrated with Microsoft Office Project Server
2007; when your IT person sets this up, you can keep folks updated and
keep your project updated by using Project Web Access tools.
✦Enterprise Project Management (EPM) Solution helps an entire organi-
zation manage a portfolio or projects and standardize their project
practices. This solution requires that you own several products, includ-
ing Project Professional, Project Server, Project Server Client Access,
and more. At this level, your organization is probably working directly
with a Microsoft salesperson to buy licenses for these many products,
and your IT people have to get involved to set the whole thing up.
Getting out of Hot Water with Multiple Undo
Multiple Undo has been a requested feature in Project for years. Though an
undo feature sounds simple, it can have a lot of value when working with a
project because individual changes to timing in your project plan can cause
hundreds of changes in a large schedule. For that reason, undoing several
actions in a row in Project was a major technology challenge.
Many project managers find that the ability to try out different scenarios
that involve several changes to a project is extremely useful. In the past, you
had to do an action and then undo it, then do the next action and undo it,
and so on, which is time-consuming and doesn’t really enable you to see
cumulative effects.
With Multiple Undo, you can try out several changes and then undo the whole
list of changes or a portion of them at once. Because you often want to try out
several changes when finalizing or making adjustments to a project — for
example, changing the timing of a set of tasks — Multiple Undo can be very
handy.

Chapter 5
What’s New in
Project 2007

65
Be aware that you have to undo all changes in order. For example, if you
made six changes and you want to undo the fourth change, you have to
undo changes four through six.
Here’s how to undo more than one change:
1. Make all the changes you want to your schedule but don’t save the
schedule yet.
2. Click the down arrow to the right of the Undo icon on the Standard
toolbar.
You see a list of changes you’ve made (see Figure 5-1), starting with the
most recent action at the top.
3. Click the change you want to undo.
That change and all others you performed subsequent to it are
undone.
Figure 5-1:

sequentially.

Spotting Changes with Change Highlighting
66
Spotting Changes with Change Highlighting
You can use the brand-new Change Highlighting feature to see how the
changes you make affect your project. When you turn on Change Highlighting
and take any action that changes your project’s schedule, a highlight appears
on every task that has been affected (see Figure 5-2). Because it’s easy to miss
how a single change can impact dozens of other tasks, Change Highlighting
provides a visual clue to help you avoid surprises down the road.
You can toggle this feature on and off by choosing View➪Show Change
Highlighting/Hide Change Highlighting.
Change Highlighting shows you only the results of the last change you made
and works only on changes that have an impact on the timing of tasks in
your schedule.

Knowing What’s Driving Your Tasks
67
Knowing What’s Driving Your Tasks
When you create a task such as Print Brochure in a project, several factors
might affect its timing. It might have a constraint causing it to start no later
than a certain date or a dependency relationship with the earlier task,
Design Brochure. A new feature called Task Drivers helps you understand all
the settings that are affecting the timing of a task.
The Task Drivers feature helps you recognize the many possible settings that
might affect your tasks, which can include
✦Actual Start Date or Assignments: You’ve entered an actual start date,
or you have made a resource assignment to a task and the resource isn’t
available.
✦Leveling Delay: If you turned on leveling to deal with resource overallo-
cations, it might have caused a delay on a task.
✦Constraints: You apply a constraint to a task, such as forcing it to finish
on a certain date.
✦Summary Tasks: Summary tasks’ timings are driven by the timing of
their child tasks or subtasks.
✦Dependency Relationships: A predecessor task can cause changes in a
task’s timing.
To display task driver information, follow these steps:
1. Scroll to the task in your project that you want to review.
2. Click the Task Drivers icon on the Standard toolbar. (It looks like a
taskbar with an arrow and question mark above it.)
The Task Drivers pane appears (see Figure 5-3), explaining the various
conditions driving a task’s timing.
3. Click another task to display its drivers.
4. Click the Close button in the Task Drivers pane to close it when you’re
done.
See Book IV, Chapter 1 for more about how task drivers can help you fine-
tune task timing in your project.

Making Reports More Visual
68
Making Reports More Visual
Many people swear by PivotTable reports in Excel and Visio because they
allow you to compare data from a variety of perspectives. Pivot tables offer
perspectives that are especially useful for data analysis. If you’re a PivotTable
fan, you’ll be glad to know that the same capability has come to Project 2007
in the form of Visual Reports. Pivot tables allow you to view data from a vari-
ety of perspectives beyond the standard Project report capabilities.
The Visual Reports feature allows you to select the fields you want to 
view and compare and to modify your reports in a variety of ways (see
Figure 5-4).
Project offers six categories of Visual Reports as well as custom reports that
you can build yourself. Some of these categories are based on timephased
data (that is, data distributed over time, such as allocations of resource time
or costs).

Making Reports More Visual
69
Visual Report categories include
✦Task Usage: Based on timephased data for tasks, this category of report
gives you a peek at information such as cash flow and earned value over
time.
✦Resource Usage: Based on timephased resource data, these reports
include cash flow, resource availability, resource costs, and resource
work data.
✦Assignment Usage: Also based on timephased data, this category of
reports provides information in areas such as baseline versus actual
costs and baseline versus actual work.
✦Task Summary, Resource Summary, and Assignment Summary: These
three categories of reports provide diagram views of a variety of work
and cost data and are not based on timephased data.
See Book VI, Chapter 4 for in-depth information about working with Visual
Reports.

A New Resource: Cost
70
A New Resource: Cost
If you’ve used Project in earlier versions, you worked with material and work
resources. Material resources might include tons of steel or yards of fabric;
the units of these resources have an associated cost and the more units you
use, the more it costs you. Work resources are typically people who get paid
so much per hour that they put in on a task; the more hours they work, the
more it hits your budget.
In Project 2007, there’s a new resource in town called the Cost resource. Cost
resources have a set cost associated with them that you create in the Task
Information dialog box, which displays when you double-click a task name in
any view (see Figure 5-5). Unlike material resources that affect your budget
by the number of units you use and work resources whose hourly costs tally
up dollars, Cost resources have a fixed cost that you assign.
Here’s an example of how you would use Cost resources: Say you’re manag-
ing a construction project to build 20 cottages. Each cottage requires a build-
ing permit with a cost of $250. You can create a Cost resource called Permit
and assign it to each of the 20 subprojects in your overall project. No matter
how long each cottage takes to build or how many resources work on them,
your permit cost remains the same. (That is, unless you run over the allotted
time allowed by the permits for building and final inspection on each of the
cottages, in which case you’d better have a Penalty Cost resource ready to
apply!)
See Book V, Chapter 1 for more about various resource types.

Working with Budgets
71
Working with Budgets
In Project 2007, budget resources can help you track your budget against
your actual costs.
You can specify a resou rce as a budget resource by selecting the Budget
check box in the Resource Information dialog box, which displays when you
double-click a resource name in a view such as Resource Sheet (see Figure
5-6). You then assign these resources to the project’s single summary task. For
example, you might create a budget resource called Travel Budget and associ-
ate costs with it. You can then assign this resource to the project summary
task so that it’s applicable to the entire project.
Using budget resources, you can display fields that allow you to compare
your budgeted cost with your planned cost. (Unfortunately, there’s often a
difference.)
For example, you might have $10,000 budgeted for travel, and in creating
your individual tasks you might have applied $11,450 in costs for individual
business trips associated with the project. The budget setting can help you
compare these amounts as you add and delete resources to or from various
tasks.
If you assign a budget resource, you can then view budgeted work at any
time by displaying the Budget Work field. Note that this field reflects only
material and work resource costs.

 Opening a new, blank project
 Opening project templates
 Opening a schedule based on an existing project
 Entering basic project information 
 Saving projects
W
hen you’re ready to begin your first project using Microsoft Project
2007, you start by opening a file. You can use a blank template or get
a head start by opening a template that includes sample tasks for a certain
category of project.
After you open a project, your first step is to enter certain global project
information, such as the scheduling method for the project. Finally, you
should know how to save and close a project so that it’s ready for you to
work on it another day.
In this chapter, you get going with the creation of your very first Project
schedule.
Creating That First Project
You can create a new project in three ways: You can open a new, blank proj-
ect; open a project template that contains sample tasks; or open a project
based on an existing project. In the following sections, you get a feel for the
pros and cons of each method.
Starting from scratch
If you want a clean slate to work with when you begin a new project, open-
ing a blank template is your best bet. You can start building your new proj-
ect directly in this blank schedule, which contains no tasks, resources, or
other settings except default project settings. Starting a project from the
blank template requires you to do more work inputting information, but if
your project is somewhat unique, this might be the best way to go.

Creating That First Project
76
Whenever you open Project 2007, you see a blank project file on-screen along
with the Project Guide task pane. You can also open a new, blank project
schedule at any time by choosing File➪New and then clicking the Blank
Project link in the New Project task pane (see Figure 1-1).
Project Guide can help you build a project. Project Guide reminds you of the
typical steps you should take in entering project, task, and resource data.
Discover more about this method of creating tasks in Chapter 5 of this 
minibook.
Getting a head start with templates
You don’t have to start from scratch if your project is typical of those in your
industry, because Microsoft provides some convenient project templates to
get you going. These include projects by type: for example, an engineering
project or office move. Templates include many tasks appropriate to your
project to save you time and help you to think through your plan when you
are new to Project.

Figure 1-2 shows the Project Office template. Templates typically contain
sample tasks broken down into logical phases, with task durations and
dependencies in place. The templates from Microsoft sometimes include
generic resources, but you can create your own resources as well as use,
edit, or delete the ones provided.
You can open a template from the New Project task pane. To do so, follow
these steps:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Project task pane appears, as shown in Figure 1-3.
2. Click the On Computer link.
The Templates dialog box opens. You can also use the On Web Sites link
and the Templates on Office Online link to access online templates.
3. Click the Project Templates tab, which is shown in Figure 1-4.

4. Click a template to display a preview.
5. When you find the template you want to use, click OK.
The template opens in Microsoft Project document format (MPP). You
can then save the file with a new name. You can also delete tasks, move
them around, or add tasks as necessary for your project.

Making Global Project Settings
79
After you open a template, be sure to check its project information
(choose Project➪Project Information) to make sure that the Start Date
and Calendar options are set as you want. See the next section for more
about this.
If you modify a template and want to use that set of tasks again for future
projects, consider saving the file as a custom template. Just choose File➪
Save As and then select Template in the Save As Type list. You might also
consider having organizational templates that are saved on your network or
in a shared folder for other project managers to access.
If you have an existing project with similarities to a new project but you neg-
lected to save it as a template, you can simply open the existing Project file,
save it with a new name, and voila — you have a head start on building your
new plan.
Making Global Project Settings
When you start a new project and find yourself staring at that blank project
schedule, a logical first step is to enter some general project information.
This information mostly affects the general timing of your project.
Entering settings
To enter general project information, choose Project➪Project Information.
The Project Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-5.
Here’s what you can do in this dialog box:
✦Use the Start Date setting to specify the start date for the project. If
you’re not sure when the project will start, set the start date about a
month from today. Then, after you build some tasks and have a better
handle on the entire length of your project, you can come back and set a
real start date. Project automatically recalculates all dates when you do.
Figure 1-5:
Use the
Project
Information
dialog box
for some
basic
project
settings.

Making Global Project Settings
80
✦Use the Finish Date setting to specify the finish date for the project.
Especially if you have a drop-dead date (an attention-getting term!)
beyond which the project cannot wander and still reach completion, you
can set the finish date. In such a case, be sure to look at the next setting
in this list — and change it accordingly.
✦Schedule from the start or finish of the project. Most projects work
forward from the start date. However, if you have an absolute drop-
dead date for the end of your project (for example, if you’re organizing
a sports event that must occur on New Year’s Day next year), you might
want to set the finish date and then work backward to fit all your tasks
into the allotted length of time. If you change this setting to Project
Finish Date, the Finish Date field becomes available.
✦Set the current date. You can fill in the current date according to your
computer calendar. Or, you can choose another date if you like, but that
usually doesn’t make much sense unless you’re in a different time zone
from where the project will occur.
✦Set a status date. By default, no status date is set for the project. You
use a status date when you’re tracking the progress of your project at
regular intervals. If you set a status date, your computer assumes that
any activity you record in your project is being tracked as of this date.
You can find out more about settings for tracking in Book VIII.
✦Set the working calendar for your project. You have three choices:
Standard, Night Shift, and 24 Hours. Base your choice on the working
habits of your organization. For example, if your company uses resources
in three shifts per day — a total of 24 hours of straight working time —
and all those shifts would contribute work to your project, choose 
24 Hours. If you use a day shift and a night shift, choose Night Shift. If 
you work a standard 8-hour day, choose Standard. (Most projects use a
standard calendar with a typical 8-hour workday.)
Calendars can be a little complex. A project calendar that you set in this
dialog box indicates what the usual workday is at your company, but
you can set up individual calendars for each task you create. The Task
calendar then takes precedence over the project calendar. See Book II,
Chapter 4 for more about Task calendars.
✦Assign a priority to your project. Assigning a priority can be especially
useful if you use the same resources across several projects and want to
use the Resource Leveling feature. With your priorities set on all projects,
Project tools can then automatically reallocate resources. A priority of 1
would cause Resource Leveling to assume it is just fine to delay a task,
where a priority of 1000 would cause Resource Leveling to avoid moving
such a task at any cost.

You can also create custom project information fields for your organization
in the Enterprise Custom Fields section of this dialog box. For example, you
might want a field that explains which department in the company is running
the project.
Click the Statistics button in this dialog box to get an overview of your project,
as shown in Figure 1-6.
You need to enter much more information in addition to general project
information and tasks in order to build a complete project, as you discover
in the next few chapters. However, entering general project information is a
logical starting point.
Using start and finish dates
It’s important at this point to give you some advice about how to use start and
finish dates in Project. Many people new to project management software
attempt to use it like a paper-based schedule, pinning down every known date,
setting the start and finish dates while still in the planning stages.
However, one of the most useful aspects of Project is that it can show you
what a shift in timing does to your project instantly. If you nail down specific
dates, you have to go in and reset them whenever a change occurs. This is
true on the task level, where making settings that force a task to happen on a
certain day undermines the abilities of Project to move tasks based on their
timing relationships. For example, suppose you build in a relationship that
says you can’t send out the brochure until you receive the brochure from
the printer. If the printer is late, the ship date of the brochure moves out
automatically, providing you with valuable real-world information.
Setting the start or finish date of a project while still in the planning stage can
have similar issues. If you don’t really know the very day things can start
Figure 1-6:
You can
review a
summary 
of the
information
you entered.

Making Global Project Settings
82
rolling, you don’t have to set a start date until you’re further along in your
planning. You can still observe the overall length of time it will take for the
project to run its course. Then when you have better information about a real
start date or you want to propose a few different start dates and see the
results in your schedule (see Figure 1-7), use the Start Date setting to do so.
One final word of advice: It usually makes sense to set a start date or a finish
date, but you cannot set both. By setting a start date, the tasks and timing
relationships you create reveal to you what a realistic finish date will be. If
you don’t like the results, make changes to tasks, relationships between
them, or resource assignments to tighten things up. (See Book VIII for more
about how to do this.) Setting a finish date lets you see when you must start
(or have already started) by to complete your project on time.
Conversely, if you decide to schedule back from a finish date, don’t set the
start date as well. Setting a drop-dead finish date and creating your tasks
then lets you see exactly when you have to start (or when you should have
started) to realistically complete your project (see Figure 1-8). Again, when
you see what Project shows you about your start date, you can adjust your
tasks if necessary to obtain a start date you can live with.

To save a Project file that you haven’t saved before, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
2. Use the Save In drop-down list at the top (see Figure 1-9) to locate the
folder where you want to save the file; then click to select it.
3. In the File Name text box, type a name for the project.
4. Click Save.
It’s a good idea to create a folder for your project either on your local hard
drive or on your company network where you save in one place not only
your Project files but also supporting documents, e-mails, and other items.
You can create a new folder from within the Save As dialog box by clicking
the New Folder button.

Saving in other formats
As with most software, Project allows you to save a file in other formats.
When in the Save As dialog box, use the Save as Type field to choose one of
these other formats:
✦Project 2000–2003: If you want to share this file with folks who have an
earlier version of Project, this could be a logical format to save in.
✦Template: To create a template from a file, save in the Template format.
✦Excel: There are two options here: You can save a project as an Excel
Workbook or an Excel PivotTable. If you want to share your data in
Excel, choose one of these formats.
✦Text, CSV: Text saves your file in formats that don’t include a lot of 
formatting bells and whistles. When you choose these formats or any
Excel formats (see previous bullet), an Export Wizard appears to help
you choose which fields of data will export and how to export. 
✦XML: This is similar to the MPV format in older versions of Project, in that
it allows you to exchange data with programs other than Project 2007.
XML stands for Extensible Markup Language, and is used especially over
the World Wide Web to deliver structured data in a consistent format.
You can save a file to a workspace. A project in a workspace offers an easy
way for members to access and work on related files in one central location.
Just choose File➪Save as Workspace to do so.

T
asks are the essential building blocks of any project. They’re like the items
on your old-fashioned to-do list for your project. When you create a task,
you build in the What, When, Who, and Where information of your plan.
But tasks serve other roles. For example, resources work on a project when
you assign them to tasks. The timing of tasks and the relationships between
them form the overall schedule for your project. By tracking the activity on
tasks, you can see the progress of your project over time.
You can create tasks in a few different ways: by typing information in the
sheet area of Gantt Chart view (or any other view that displays information
in columns) or by using the Task Information dialog box. You can also
import tasks from Outlook or Excel. You can even use a hyperlink to create a
task in your project that represents data in another project.
In this chapter, you find out all about the various ways to create tasks,
entering task basics in the process.
Tackling Task Basics
Before you can start to build tasks, you have to identify the individual steps
required to complete your project. When you know what steps you need to
take to accomplish your project goal, you can create each of those steps as
individual tasks in Project.
Chapter 1 in this minibook gives you a lot of advice about how to figure out
which tasks to include in your project and how to identify your project
scope and goal.

Tackling Task Basics
86
In a longer project, you might find that your tasks number in the hundreds
or even thousands. As you create tasks, you might find it useful to organize
those tasks in a logical way by creating phases consisting of summary tasks
with subtasks below them. This structure is essentially Project’s version of
an outline (see Figure 2-1). For example, you might have a summary task
named Product Brochure with three subtasks: Design Brochure, Write and
Approve Copy, and Print Brochure. It’s up to you to decide how much detail
each phase of your project requires.
You can find out how to organize tasks into outlines in Book III, Chapter 2. All
you have to focus on in this chapter is how to create tasks.
Identifying what makes up a task
Creating a task is a bit more complicated than writing an item on a to-do list.
Think of each task in your project as a record — like a database record that
lists a person’s name, address, e-mail, and birthday. In a similar way, a task
in Project contains data about that task: not only a task name but also other
vital data about how that task fits into your project.
Figure 2-1:
A large task

into phases.

Book II
Chapter 2
Creating That

Tackling Task Basics
87
To create a task, you enter information such as
✦Task name
✦Task duration
✦Task type
✦Task priority
✦Constraints for scheduling the task
At a basic level, all you have to do to create a task is enter a task name.
However, a task record can contain much more information than that. You
can add all task information up front or, if you haven’t obtained or figured
out all the task settings, enter more and more data over time.
What task settings control
You have to make some choices when you create tasks, which we don’t go into
detail about here because our goal in this chapter is to simply have you create
a task. However, you see several task settings in the Task Information dialog
box that you use in this chapter (see Figure 2-2), so we briefly address them.
Some settings, such as task type (fixed duration) and priority (none), can
often be left at default settings. Others, such as task duration (how long the
task will take to complete), almost always require some input from you.
Book IV provides details about how to make each task setting and how they
drive task timing.
For now, remember that pretty much everything that you enter about a task
(except the task name and resources assigned to the task) involves how the
task timing is controlled. Several of these settings work in combination, with
Figure 2-2:
The Task
Information

The Many Different Ways to Create a Task
88
Project performing complex algorithms to set the timing of the task accord-
ing to the value of each setting. Other elements, such as the task finish date,
don’t determine timing but rather cause Project to display a symbol in the
Indicator column (the column to the right of the task number column with a
small blue circle containing an i at the top) to alert you when a task has
moved beyond its estimated finish date.
You can also specify a unique Task calendar in the Task Information dialog
box; calendars are covered in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
The Many Different Ways to Create a Task
You can create a task by entering a name for it. You can fill in the details of
task duration and task type, for example, at the same time or later.
However detailed you want to get in your task settings, you can create tasks
by using a few different methods:
✦Enter task data in a Gantt Chart view sheet pane.
✦Enter data in a Task Information dialog box.
✦Import tasks from Excel or Outlook.
✦Link to a task in another project.
Creating a task in Gantt Chart view
Many people who work on lengthy projects find that entering all task names
in the sheet pane of Gantt Chart view is the quickest and easiest way to go.
You can actually use any view that includes columns of data, such as Task
Usage or Tracking Gantt.
You don’t have to use a spreadsheet view to enter a new task, though it is 
perhaps the quickest way to create tasks. You can also enter a new task in
Network Diagram or Calendar view by displaying the view and choosing
Insert➪New Task. A new task box or calendar entry opens and is ready for you
to type a task name. However, in Resource views, the New Task command isn’t
available to you on the Insert menu at all.
Follow these simple steps to enter a task in Gantt Chart view:
1. In the Task Name column, click a blank cell.
2. Type a task name.
You can edit what you type by clicking in the entry box above the sheet
and pressing the Backspace or Delete key to clear characters (see Figure
2-3). You can also click the X and check mark buttons to the left of the
entry box to clear or accept your entry.

89
3. Press the down-arrow key to move to the next cell in the column and
then type the next task name.
When you move to the next cell, Project automatically assigns a sequen-
tial task number in the far-left column. This number is a handy way to
identify tasks in larger schedules.
4. Repeat Step 3 until you enter all task names.
You can display other columns in Gantt Chart view to quickly enter addi-
tional task information, such as duration, type, start date, and finish date.
To display additional columns, right-click any column heading, choose
Insert Column, and then select the column you want to display from the
Field Name list.
Try displaying the Entry table (choose View➪Table➪Entry). This table
offers the most common task information columns.
Going the Task Information dialog box route
Dialog boxes offer the advantage of a centralized information form that
allows you to make more than one entry or setting at a time. The form also
serves to remind you about all the possible settings you have at your dis-
posal. If this approach appeals to you, consider using the Task Information
Figure 2-3:
You can
clear or
accept text
in the entry
field.

The Many Different Ways to Create a Task

dialog box to enter task information. A series of tabs in this dialog box con-
tain all the information that can possibly exist about a task.
Follow these steps to create a task by using the Task Information dialog box:
1. In the Task Name column, double-click a blank cell.
The Task Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-4. The
General and Advanced tabs in this dialog box contain various timing
settings for the task.
2. In the Name field, type a task name.
3. Click OK to save the new task.
The task name appears in Gantt Chart view in the cell you clicked in
Step 1.
4. Press the down-arrow key to move to the next cell.
5. Repeat Steps 2–4 to add as many tasks as you like.
Try to keep the task names in your project both descriptive and unique so
you and others reviewing your project don’t get confused. However, if you
can’t make all the names unique (for example, you want to have three tasks
in three different phases named Hire Staff), you can use the automatically
assigned task number or the work breakdown structure (WBS) code (see
Book III, Chapter 3 for more about WBS) to identify tasks. These numbers are
always unique for each task.

Importing tasks from Outlook
Just as you might start roughing out a project with a handwritten to-do list,
you might start thinking about your project as a series of simple to-do tasks
that you enter in Outlook. When that list of tasks becomes the basis of a
project, you don’t have to lose the list and start from scratch. Microsoft pro-
vides an easy-to-use import feature that puts the tasks you create in Outlook
into Project.
When you bring data in from one application to another, you use something
called import-mapping. For example, you can map a spreadsheet field labeled
Staff to the field labeled Resources in Project. The Project import-mapping
feature allows you to map fields in a file created in another application to
fields in Project to import data. However, the import-mapping process can be
tedious at best and confusing at worst. The Import Outlook Tasks feature in
Project is essentially an import map that’s preset to work with mapping
Outlook task fields to Project task fields.
Follow these steps to import Outlook tasks into Project:
1. Open the plan that you want to insert tasks into or open a new project
(choose File➪New).
2. Choose Tools➪Import Outlook Tasks.
The Import Outlook Tasks dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-5.
3. Select the options for the tasks you want to import or click Select All
to import all Outlook tasks.
Figure 2-5:

The Many Different Ways to Create a Task
92
By default, Outlook keeps tasks in a Tasks folder. Selecting the check box
for the Folder: Tasks item is another way to select all tasks in Outlook.
4. Click OK.
The tasks are imported and appear at the end of your list of tasks with
Change Highlighting applied (see Figure 2-6).
When you import tasks from Outlook, the task name, task duration, and any
task notes are brought over. If a task in Outlook has no duration, Project cre-
ates the task with an estimated one-day time frame.
Project 2007 can integrate your schedule in various ways with Outlook via
Project Web Access. See Book X, Chapter 4 for more information about this.
Getting your tasks from Excel
If you’re a devoted Excel fan, you might like to create your task list for a proj-
ect in Excel. At some point, when you’re ready to move that list into Project,
you’ll be glad to hear that Microsoft has provided the Project Plan template
that makes the process simple. You can open this template, located in the
Microsoft Office template 1033 folder, from within Excel.

The template provides four Excel worksheets, as shown in Figure 2-7. You
can enter information about tasks, resources, and resource assignments on
three of them and then easily export that data from Excel to Project.
Follow these steps to use this template:
1. In Excel, open the template called ProjPlan.
2. Fill in information about tasks, resources, and dates in the appropri-
ate columns on the appropriate worksheets and then save the file.
3. Open Project and choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
4. Locate the ProjPlan file you just saved and then click Open.
The Import Wizard appears.
5. Click Next to begin the wizard.
6. Choose the second option, Project Excel Template, for the format of
the data you’re importing. Then click Next.

7. On the next wizard screen (see Figure 2-8), choose the method for
importing the file.
You can import the file As a New Project, to Append the Data to the
Active Project, or to Merge the Data into the Active Project. If you
choose the third option, you have to create a merge key that delineates
how the data should merge with existing tasks.
8. Click Next and then click Finish.
The project appears with whatever tasks, resources, and assignment
information you entered in a project plan format.
Creating a task that represents another project
When you and your co–project managers handle a lot of projects, it’s often
useful to create a task in one project that represents the timing of the sum of
tasks in another project. For example, if you’re driving the network installa-
tion project, having a task that indicates the completion of your new office
building construction can be very helpful.
To accomplish this, you can insert a hyperlink in a project outline. This cre-
ates a task that not only reflects the overall timing of another project, but
also provides a handy way to quickly open the other project from within
yours, assuming it’s available on your company network or intranet. After
you create the task, you can move it around in your project and even create
timing relationships, called dependencies, to it (see Book IV, Chapter 3 for
more about dependency relationships).

To insert a hyperlink to another Project file in your project, follow these
steps:
1. Click to select the blank task name cell where you want the hyper-
linked task to appear.
2. Choose Insert➪Hyperlink.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-9.
3. In the Text to Display box, type a name for the hyperlinked file.
Make sure that this text indicates what information is being summarized.
4. In the Link To area, click the Existing File or Web Page icon.
You can link to a document, an e-mail address, or a Web page.
5. In the Look In list, locate and select the file to which you want to
insert a hyperlink.
6. Click OK.
The link text is inserted, and a hyperlink symbol appears in the Indicator
field (see Figure 2-10). You can simply click that link symbol to open the
other file.
If you need to, use the Indent and Outdent tools on the Formatting toolbar
(arrows pointing to the left and right, respectively) to place tasks at the
appropriate level in your project. You can find out more about how to organ-
ize tasks into outlines in Book III, Chapter 2.

I
n real estate, they say a view is worth thousands. In Project, the right
view could easily help save you thousands. That’s because views are the
way you get at all the valuable data you need to keep your project on track
and within budget.
Essentially views in Project provide you with different perspectives on your
Project plan. Some help you focus on resources. Others help you get your
tasks in line. There are views that make data entry quick and easy, and
others that help you track progress on your project.
In Book I, Chapter 4 we discuss the three most commonly used views —
Gantt Chart, Network Diagram, and Calendar. In this chapter, we go deeper
into views, showing you some of the more esoteric but very useful views
Project makes available to you.
A View for Every Need
Think about it: After you enter all the project, task, and resource data for a
big project of, say, 1,000 tasks, you’ve created a powerful database of infor-
mation. Add to that, Project automatically performs complex calculations on
that data to make information about schedules, costs, dependencies, and
more available, and you have a huge chunk of data at your disposal. The
way you get at that data is through views.

A View for Every Need
98
Many people spend the majority of their time in Gantt Chart view (see
Figure 3-1), which is fine. Gantt Chart view provides columns of data in a
variety of tables that you can display and modify, as well as a graphical
depiction of your task timing.
But Project has a great deal more to offer, namely 25 different built-in
views. Some views let you examine your data in unique ways that might
help you spot problems or opportunities. Some, such as Milestone Rollup
(see Figure 3-2), summarize information; others enable you to enter data
you can’t enter elsewhere. Still others, such as Multiple Baselines Gantt,
can display several saved baselines side by side, or let you view sets of
data that you can find in other views.
Book I, Chapter 4 is where you can find steps for changing from one view to
another and for making basic modifications to views such as displaying dif-
ferent tables of columns in the sheet pane and modifying the timescale in
chart panes. Book VI offers some more-advanced advice on using views to
communicate information about your project.

Finding Just the Right View for You
The view you need is likely to depend on what you’re trying to accomplish
with your Project plan at the moment. Some views are useful in building your
task list, whereas others work well for entering resource data. Certain views
are wonderful for resolving problems or tracking data. How do you know
which view will work best? Here are some guidelines to help you out.
First, Project offers a few different types of views. To see the entire list, you
can click the More Views icon at the bottom of the View bar. This displays
the More Views dialog box shown in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3:
Select a

Figure 3-2:

Discovering Various Task Views
100
Scanning this list, you can see views that include the term Resource or Task
in their names, which gives you a clue what they’re about. Beyond that,
views fall into one of these categories:
✦Graph views such as Resource Graph present information in a visual
way. If you want a quick impression of what’s going on or of a trend,
rather than the detailed numbers, a graph view might be for you.
✦Chart views such as Gantt Chart view include a sheet pane and a chart
pane. The sheet includes columns of data, whereas the chart displays a
graphical representation of that data.
✦Combination views quite logically combine two views, displaying them
one above the other. If you need to analyze one set of data, such as infor-
mation about tasks, along with another set of data, such as information
about resources, a combination view might fit the bill.
Beyond understanding the basic types of views, the best way to find the
ones that are useful to you is to look at them and see what each has to
offer.
Discovering Various Task Views
Most views contain some information about tasks; even resource views
might offer resource data listed by task. However, some views are useful for
working with task data. Here’s a quick survey of some interesting task
views:
✦Task Details, shown in Figure 3-4, is a handy view for reviewing task
essentials. Though much of this information is available on the various
tabs of the Task Information dialog box, this view offers both a one-page
summary of the most important settings and an option to open the
dialog box for changing those settings.
✦Task Entry is a combination view (see Figure 3-5). Gantt Chart view is
shown on top, and the Task Details view is shown on the bottom. This is
a great way to be able to review detailed task settings alongside your
entire project plan to see how that task fits in the larger scheme of
things.

✦Task Usage, shown in Figure 3-6, is a useful view for spotting the amount
of work going on in your project task by task over a period of time such
as a week or month. This overview of work hours can help you spot
potential work bottlenecks, slow times when it might be a good idea to
make better use of resource downtime, and times when resources might
be overworked.
✦You may have used Network Diagram view, but Descriptive Network
Diagram view adds information about whether a task is critical or non-
critical (that is, whether the task can be delayed without delaying the
overall deadline of the project).
✦Relationship Diagram is a simple graphical view that shows you each
task in your project, one by one, with all the dependency relationships
to each task shown in a simple diagram with the type of relationship
noted next to each task (see Figure 3-7).

What Resource Views Tell You
103
What Resource Views Tell You
Resource information also pops up in many views, but some resource-specific
views could help you manage your resources more effectively. Here are a few
to consider:
✦Resource Graph view (see Figure 3-8) offers a visual way to review work-
load, resource by resource. You can easily spot when resources are over-
booked by looking at the peak units (often this is 100%) and the bars
that show when a resource is booked over peak time.
✦Resource Allocation is a combination view (see Figure 3-9) that allows you
to view all the tasks to which a resource is assigned, both as a work hours
listing at the top and a Gantt chart with task bars on the bottom. This
helps you see both workload and task timing within your schedule, simul-
taneously, so you can resolve resource conflicts or fine-tune assignments.
✦Resource Form view (see Figure 3-10), like the Task Entry view, is a sum-
mary of all of a resource’s settings on a single page. Use this view to
review resource assignments, calendars, and rates of pay. It’s a one-page
alternative to the various tabs of the Resource Information dialog box.
✦Resource Sheet (see Figure 3-11) is a great view for entering resource
information, including the type of resource, maximum units of work,
standard and overtime rates, cost, and calendar.

The Best Views for Tracking Progress on Your Project
106
The Best Views for Tracking Progress on Your Project
After you save a baseline copy of your project plan, you can begin to track
progress against that baseline. Tracking usually involves a combination of
two things: entering information about actual versus planned activity, and
finding ways to resolve problems that occur with your schedule and
resources. Several views work very well for helping you to track and make
changes to your plan.
Turn to Book VIII for a wealth of information about tracking activity on your
projects.
✦Leveling Gantt view (see Figure 3-12) allows you to see what delays lev-
eling has caused in your schedule if you use Project’s Resource Leveling
feature (a calculation you can apply to delay tasks to avoid resource
overallocations) to work out resource issues.
Figure 3-12:
Leveling
Gantt view
helps you
figure out
your
resource
challenges.

Book II
Chapter 3
Exploring Task
Views
The Best Views for Tracking Progress on Your Project
107
If you find that delays due to Resource Leveling are unacceptable, you
can turn it off and use other methods to solve resource problems. See
Book VII, Chapter 2 for more about this.
✦Tracking Gantt (see Figure 3-13) is a great place to go to enter actual
start and end dates for your tasks and to mark tasks as finished in the
columns of the sheet area. You can then view your tracked activity
against the baseline by looking at the taskbars in the chart pane.
✦Multiple Baselines Gantt (Figure 3-14) is useful if you’ve had occasion
to save several baselines over the life of your project. This can occur
when serious changes to your project come up — for example, if you
have to stop your project midway because of a materials shortage and
start it up again months later. By setting a new baseline, you’re track-
ing against an iteration of your plan that makes sense against future
actual activity. This view displays, side by side, all baselines you have
saved in your project so you can see (or explain) how things changed
overtime.

Displaying Combination Views
108
Displaying Combination Views
Looking at two views side by side (or more accurately, one on top of the
other on your computer screen) can be useful when you’re comparing two
aspects of your project. That’s where combination views come in.
For example, you might display Network Diagram view along with Gantt
Chart view to get columns of data about your tasks and a graphic represen-
tation of project workflow. You can also display a combination view and then
print the view, packing lots of data into your printout.
To display a combination view, follow these steps:
1. Display the first view you want to use by using the View bar or View
menu.
2. Choose Window➪Split.
A second copy of the currently displayed view appears.
3. Click within the view you want to change.

to apply it.
The combination view is displayed (see Figure 3-15).
If the second view you want to display is listed on the View bar, a quicker
method for displaying it is to display the first view and then press the Shift
key and click the View icon.
To remove the bottom view at any time, choose Window➪Remove Split or
click on the line dividing the panes and drag down to close the bottom pane.
You can also change the views that appear by simply clicking another view
in the View bar; it replaces the active view in the combination view.

T
ime: There’s never enough of it, so using what you’ve got wisely can
make the difference between a successful project and a disaster. In
Microsoft Project, one of your most useful tools for getting your project
timing right is calendars. Calendars allow you to define working and non-
working time, such as your average workday or workweek, and specify
exceptions such as holidays.
It’s not difficult to define your company’s typical workday, whether every-
body works from 9 to 5 or particular jobs call for people to work from mid-
night to 8 a.m. Project 2007 calendars allow you to set standards for typical
working time and then allow for variation. But to make life interesting,
Project 2007 has several types of calendars you have to deal with.
The Big 4: Base, Project, Resource, and Task Calendars
Mastering the four calendars in Project 2007 takes a little time. However,
understanding how calendars work in Project 2007 is essential to mastering
the software. You schedule tasks and assign resources based on the calendar
settings that you make. The costs accumulated by resource work hours won’t
be accurate if you don’t understand your calendar settings from the get-go.

The Big 4: Base, Project, Resource, and Task Calendars
112
Because the use of the term “project” can get confusing as it refers to the soft-
ware, your project plan, and one of the calendar types (the Project calendar),
we need to explain the terminology we use in this chapter. We use Project
2007 when referring to the software itself, Project calendar when referring to
the calendar settings in the software, and just plain old project when talking
about your project plan or schedule.
How calendars work
Project 2007 has four calendars that you have to deal with. Each takes prece-
dence over others in a very specific way, which we cover in the next section.
The four Project calendars are
✦Base calendar: This is the calendar template that all other calendars are
built on top of. Three Base calendars are available: Standard, 24 Hours,
and Night Shift.
Not everybody in a company works the same schedule, and not every
task can be performed in the same eight-hour workday. To deal with the
variations in schedules that occur in most workforces, Project, Resource,
and Task calendars can be set to use one of three Base calendar templates
built into Project 2007.
The three Base calendar templates are as follows:
• Standard: The default setting. It sets a working day as 8 a.m.–5 p.m.
with an hour for lunch and a five-day, Monday–Friday workweek.
• 24 Hours: Allows work to go on around the clock every day of the
week.
• Night Shift: Sets Sunday as a nonworking day, three shifts Tuesday
through Friday, two shifts on Saturday, and one on Monday. Working
times for a Night Shift calendar are shown in Figure 4-1.
The legend in Figure 4-1 explains how different hours are shaded to help
you identify them in the calendar display.
You can modify the three Base calendar templates and create new tem-
plates from them. See the section “Creating Your Own Custom Calendar
Template,” later in this chapter.
✦Project calendar: This is the default calendar for scheduling. This is
where you choose which Base calendar template this particular project
should use.
✦Resource calendar: This combines the Base calendar settings with any
exceptions (nonworking times) that you set for a particular resource.
✦Task calendar: This is where you can set exceptions for a particular task.

Chapter 4

The Big 4: Base, Project, Resource, and Task Calendars
113
When you create tasks and assign resources to work on them, Project 2007
has to base that work on a timing standard. For example, if you say that a
task should be completed in one workday, you also have to tell Project that a
workday means 8 hours (or 12 hours or whatever). That’s why you have to
set up a standard workday in your Project calendar.
In a similar way, suppose that you assign a resource to put in two weeks of
work on a task in a company that uses a standard five-day workweek. If that
resource is part-time and their calendar is set for a standard three-day work-
week, the two weeks of work put in by that resource defer to the timing of
the Resource calendar for a total of only six workdays.
Several variables affect the timing of tasks in Project. Some settings you
make when you create a task can also have an effect on resource time. A two-
week, effort-driven task isn’t complete until its resources have put in two
weeks (according to the Project or Task calendar) of effort. You can set other
tasks to finish in two weeks no matter how much effort has been expended.
Find out more about settings, such as the effort-driven setting, in Book IV,
Chapter 2.

Understanding Calendar Options and Working Times
114
How does one calendar relate to another?
By default, all calendars in your project are controlled by the Project calendar
setting. However, when you change a Task or Resource calendar (this type of
change is referred to as an exception), it’s important that you understand
which setting takes precedence.
Here’s how this precedence works:
✦With no other settings made, the Base calendar template you select for
the Project calendar when you first create the project controls the work-
ing times and days of all tasks and resources.
✦If you make changes in the working hours for a resource assigned to a
task, those settings take precedence over the Project calendar for that
resource and the Task calendar. Likewise, if you assign a different Base
calendar for a task, that calendar takes precedence over the Project cal-
endar for that task.
✦If you apply one calendar to a resource and a different calendar to a task
that the resource is assigned to, Project 2007 uses only common hours
to schedule the resource. For example, if the Task calendar allows work
from 8 a.m.–5 p.m. and the Resource calendar allows work from 6 a.m.–
2 p.m., the resource works from 8 a.m.–2 p.m., which is the only period
the calendars have in common.
✦You can set a task to ignore Resource calendar settings by opening the
Task Information dialog box (double-click the task name in Gantt Chart
view) and selecting the Scheduling Ignores Resource Calendars check box
on the Advanced tab. (This setting isn’t available if the Task calendar is
set to None.) You might select this setting if you know that all resources
are required to be involved in a task, such as a quarterly company meet-
ing, regardless of their usual work hours.
Understanding Calendar Options and Working Times
Just when you thought you were beginning to get a handle on calendars, we
throw two more timing elements at you — calendar options and working
times. These aren’t that hard to grasp, so just hang in there!
You use calendar options to change the standards for a working day, week,
and year. For example, if you set a Project calendar to Standard (by default, 
8 a.m.–5 p.m., five days a week), the Calendar tab of the Options dialog box
is where you can designate which five days are working days or modify the
working hours to 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
You use working time to adjust the time available for work on a particular
date or days. Suppose you make a change to the calendar options so that

Book II
Chapter 4
Working with
Calendars
Understanding Calendar Options and Working Times
115
you have 8-hour days and 32-hour workweeks. You should also check your
working time and be sure that you specify that three days of the seven-day
week should be nonworking to jibe with the 32-hour week. If you want to set
a certain date, such as your company offsite meeting day, as nonworking for
your project, you can do that with the working time settings.
If you use Project Server to implement enterprise-wide project management,
you can make settings in the Enterprise Global Template. This template sets
the working time for all projects across your company. See Book X, Chapter 2
for more about the Enterprise Global template.
Setting calendar options
When you make changes to a Resource or Task calendar, you simply adjust the
times that a resource is available to work or the time during which a task can
occur. You don’t change the length of a typical workday for your company. A
day is still eight hours long if that’s the Project calendar setting, even if you
say that a task that takes place on that day uses the 24-hour Base calendar
template.
To change the length of a typical workday to ten hours rather than eight, for
example, use the Calendar tab of the Options dialog box.
Follow these steps to modify the calendar options:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Options dialog box appears.
2. Click the Calendar tab, as shown in Figure 4-2.
You can also display these settings by clicking the Options button in the
Change Working Time dialog box. Read about the settings there in the
following section.
3. From the Week Starts On drop-down list, select a day.
4. To modify the start of your fiscal year, select the month you want
from the Fiscal Year Starts In drop-down list.
5. To change the working hours for a typical day, type new times in the
Default Start Time and Default End Time fields.
If you change the Default Start Time or Default End Time setting, you
should also change the corresponding working times. See the following
section to discover how to do this.
6. Modify the Hours Per Day, Hours Per Week, and Days Per Month
fields as needed.
7. Click OK to save the settings.

Understanding Calendar Options and Working Times
116
If your company uses the settings you specified in the previous steps for
most projects, you can click the Set As Default button on the Calendar tab of
the Options dialog box. Then, whenever you create a new project, these are
set by default.
Making exceptions
If you want to change the available working hours for a particular day (for
example to take the day before a holiday off), you use the working time set-
tings. For example, if you want the day before Christmas to be a half day, you
can modify the working time settings for that day; then any resources
assigned to a task on this date put in only one-half day of work. You also use
these settings to specify global working and nonworking days to match the
calendar options settings.
Here’s how to change working times:
1. Choose Tools➪Change Working Time.
The Change Working Time dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-3.
2. In the Click On a Day to See Its Working Times calendar section, click
the day you want to change.
3. Click the Exceptions tab to display it; then click a blank row and type
a name for the exception.

6. Enter a time range in the From and To fields.
If you want to set nonconsecutive hours (for example, to allow for work-
ing mornings, taking a lunch break, and then including afternoons), you
can. Simple enter two or more sets of numbers in the time range fields,
such as 8 to 12 and 1 to 5.
7. Select a recurrence pattern and then set an interval in the Every X field.
For example, if you select Weekly and click the arrows to set the interval
field to 3, this pattern recurs every three weeks.
8. Set the range of recurrence.
You can do this step by entering Start and End By dates or by selecting
the End After radio button and setting the number of occurrences there.
9. Click OK twice to close the dialog boxes and save your changes.
Use the Nondefault Work Week legend item in the Change Working Time
dialog box (refer to Figure 4-3) to specify a working time that varies from the
working time established by the Base calendar template for this calendar.
Getting the Project Calendar Set Up
The first calendar that you should set up for your project is the Project cal-
endar, which sets up overall defaults. You set the Project calendar in the
Project Information dialog box (shown in Figure 4-5). You can display this
dialog box by choosing Project➪Project Information.
Here are the settings that you can make in the Project Information dialog box:
✦Calendar: Select the Base calendar template to use for the Project calendar
from this drop-down list. We list this setting first because it’s the only one
you have to deal with when you start a new project.

119
✦Start Date and Finish Date: You might want to wait to set these dates
until you build in most of your tasks and resources. Then, when you
really know when you can start work, set the start date and let Project
2007 calculate the finish date based on your tasks’ timing and dependen-
cies. See more about these settings in Book IV, Chapter 1.
✦Schedule From: You can choose to have tasks scheduled backward from
the finish date or forward from the start date. Most folks go forward
from the start date.
✦Current Date: By default, this setting matches your computer clock
setting. However, you can change this so that it doesn’t match your
computer clock setting. Changing this date is useful for looking at
what-if scenarios or for tracking progress as of a certain date in the
past.
✦Status Date: You typically set this to the current date to track progress
on your project. When tracking, you usually want to see the status of
your project as of now, so you don’t really need to deal with this setting.
However if you want to track as of the end of a fiscal period or another
timeframe, you can change this to track the status of your tasks as of
any other date.
✦Priority: This field is useful if your organization has many projects and
you create links among them. If you use a tool such as Resource Leveling
to resolve conflicts (see Book VII, Chapter 2 for more about this topic), it
can consider this project’s priority setting when making its calculations
about what to delay and what to keep on track.
Letting Project Guide Make Calendar Settings For You
Project Guide includes a useful Calendar Wizard that can help you set both
calendar options and working time settings. This guided procedure can be
very useful when you’re new to Project.
Follow these steps to make calendar options and Project calendar settings
using this wizard:
1. If Project Guide isn’t already visible, you can display it at any time by
choosing View➪Toolbars➪Project Guide.
If the Project Guide toolbar is displayed and you want to hide it, you can
click the Show/Hide Project Guide button on the Project Guide toolbar
to hide it.
2. Click the Task button if the task pane isn’t already displayed.
3. Click the Define General Working Times item listed in the Project
Guide task pane.
The Preview Working Time calendar appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.

Letting Project Guide Make Calendar Settings For You
120
4. From the Select a Calendar Template drop-down list, select the Base
calendar that you want your project to use.
The Calendar setting offers the three Base calendar templates: Standard,
Night Shift, and 24 Hours, as described in the “How calendars work” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter; if you or an administrator has created any
custom calendars, they are also listed here.
5. Click the Continue to Step 2 option at the bottom of the Project Guide
pane.
The task pane contents change to show check boxes for each day of the
week (see Figure 4-7). If you want to change the working days in your
calendar for this project, click to select or deselect any day.
6. Click the Continue to Step 3 option, and then click Change Working
Time in the task pane.
The Change Working Time dialog box, described in the preceding section,
appears. Refer to that section to find out about changes you can make
here.
7. Click OK to close the Change Working Time dialog box and then click
the Continue to Step 4 option.

121
8. Use the three text boxes that appear in the task pane to change the
Hours Per Day, Hours Per Week, and Days Per Month settings, if you
want.
9. Click the Continue to Step 5 option.
A message appears in the task pane to say that the Project calendar is
now set. If you want to work with other calendars at this point, you can
click the Define Additional Calendars option.
10. Click Save and Finish.
When you choose a Base calendar template, it sets the typical working time
for your company. If a few resources on your project work the night shift 
but the majority of your resources work a standard workday, you might want
to choose the Base calendar template that applies to the majority of your
resources (in this case, Standard). You can make changes to specific Resource
and Task calendars later (see the next two sections).
Making Changes to Task Calendars
You can set a Task calendar to use a different Base calendar template than
the one you selected for the Project calendar. When you change a Task calen-
dar, it takes precedence over the Project calendar for that task.
Figure 4-7:
Click and
choose
which days

resources
to work.

Setting Up Resource Calendars
122
Suppose that you select the Standard calendar template for a project and a
24 Hours Task calendar template. If you then specify that the task has a dura-
tion of one day, it’s a 24-hour day. But remember, Resource calendar settings
take precedence over the Task calendar!
To modify settings for a Task calendar, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the task name.
The Task Information dialog box appears.
2. Click the Advanced tab.
3. From the Calendar drop-down list, choose a different Base calendar,
as shown in Figure 4-8.
4. Click OK to save your new calendar setting.
If a resource assigned to this task has a modified calendar, that resource
works only during the specific hours that the Task calendar and Resource
calendar have in common.
Setting Up Resource Calendars
Even the most productive resources have only so many hours in a day to
work. When you have to deal with variations in resource schedules, you can
modify Resource calendars.
Figure 4-8:
You can
apply any of
the three
calendar
types to

Book II
Chapter 4
Working with

Setting Up Resource Calendars
123
Calendars for different types of resources
Remember that projects can have three types of resource: Work, Material,
and Cost, which you can read more about in Book V. For now, you should
know that only one resource type — the Work resource — has its own calen-
dar. That’s because Material resources are charged not by time worked but
rather by units used, and a Cost resource gets assigned a set cost that also
doesn’t relate to the amount of time worked on a task.
You can change the Base calendar template for each Work resource and set
specific dates as working or nonworking. These exceptions take precedence
over your Project and Task calendars, and control when a specific resource
can work.
We have one word of caution about modifying Resource calendars: Unless a
resource truly has a unique working schedule, don’t change its Base calen-
dar template. For example, if a resource usually works a day shift but works
a night shift for only a few days during the life of the project, don’t change
that resource’s Base calendar template to Night Shift. If one person works
from 10 a.m.–7 p.m. because the company allows him to, you probably don’t
have to vary his schedule from the typical 8-to-5 work schedule that’s set in
the Project calendar because he puts in eight hours a day like everyone else.
Unless your project deals with the most detailed level of time, where hours
and not days are the typical units of measure for tasks, making these types
of changes is more work than it’s worth.
If you are trying to use a resource that is part of an enterprise pool, you will
need permission to make changes to a resource. See Book 10, Chapter 3 for
more about this topic.
Making changes to Resource calendars
To modify a resource’s calendar settings, follow these steps:
1. Display a view that includes a resource column, such as the Resource
Sheet.
Just click the view in the View bar. Book I, Chapter 4 covers how to dis-
play different views.
2. Double-click a resource name.
The Resource Information dialog box appears.
3. Click the Change Working Time button to display the Change Working
Time dialog box, shown in Figure 4-9.
The Exceptions and Work Weeks tabs have settings identical to the ones
in the Change Working Time dialog box for tasks, but changes made here
affect this resource rather than the task.

Setting Up Resource Calendars
124
4. In the Click On a Day to See Its Working Times calendar section, click
the day that you want to change.
5. Click the Work Weeks tab to display it; then click a blank row and
enter a name for the exception.
6. Click the Details button.
The Details dialog box for this calendar appears (see Figure 4-10).
7. Select either the Nonworking or the Working Times radio button.
8. Enter a time range in the From and To fields.
If you want to set nonconsecutive hours (for example, to build in a lunch
break), you have to put two or more sets of numbers here, such as 8 to
12 and 1 to 5.
9. Select a recurrence pattern and then set an interval in the Every X box.
For example, if you choose Daily and click the arrows to set the interval
field to 3, this pattern recurs every three days.
10. Set the range of recurrence.
You can do this by entering Start and End By dates or selecting the End
After radio button and setting the number of occurrences.
11. Click OK twice to close the dialog boxes and save your changes.

125
Resources can work overtime even if their calendars say that their regular
hours are, say, 8 to 5, but you have to tell Project 2007 to schedule overtime
work. You can also set a different rate to be charged for overtime work for
that resource. To find out more about overtime, see Book V, Chapter 3.
Creating Your Own Custom Calendar Template
What do you do if you’ve got a very unique situation, calendar-wise?
Although Project 2007’s three Base calendar templates probably cover most
working situations, you might want to create your own calendar template.
For example, if your project involves a telemarketing initiative and most
project resources work six hours, from 4 p.m.–10 p.m. (that’s when they all
call us!), it might be useful to create a new calendar template and give it a
name like Telemarketers.
You can save some time when creating a custom template by starting with
the existing Base calendar that most closely fits your needs. Then modify it
as you like by making changes to the working times and calendar options
(see the section “Understanding Calendar Options and Working Times,” ear-
lier in this chapter) to make sure that they’re in agreement. After you create
a new calendar template, it’s then available for you to use when setting up
any of the other three calendar types: Project, Task, and Resource.
Because the Project calendar is the basis of your entire project, it should
represent the most common working schedule in your project. If only some
resources in your project work odd hours, change the Resource calendars
and not the Project calendar.

Sharing Calendars with Other Projects
126
Follow these steps to create a new calendar template:
1. Choose Tools➪Change Working Time.
The Change Working Time dialog box appears.
2. Click the Create New Calendar button.
The Create New Base Calendar dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-11.
3. In the Name box, type a unique name for the new calendar.
4. Select either the Create New Base Calendar or the Make a Copy Of X
Calendar radio button. Then select an existing Base calendar from the
list to base your calendar template on.
In Step 4, if you choose Create New Base Calendar, Project creates a
copy of the Standard calendar with a new name. If you choose Make a
Copy Of and select 24 Hours or Night Shift, your new calendar is based
on that choice. Whichever you choose, it’s your starting point, and you
can make changes to make the calendar unique after making this choice.
5. Click OK to return to the Change Working Time dialog box.
Now you can make changes to the working time for the new calendar
template.
6. Click Options.
The Options dialog box appears with the Calendar tab displayed.
7. Make changes to the start of the week or year, the start and end times
for a workday, and the hour or day settings.
8. Click OK twice to save the new calendar settings.
Sharing Calendars with Other Projects
You can make a calendar available for all projects in two ways:
✦Set a calendar as the default for all new projects by making that
choice in the Change Working Time dialog box.

✦Make calendars from one project available for use in another project.
This second method is especially useful when you want to share calen-
dars with other project managers in your company and don’t want to
change your own default calendar.
To copy a calendar from one project to another, follow this procedure:
1. Open the project to which you want to copy a calendar.
2. Choose Tools➪Organizer.
The Organizer dialog box appears.
3. Click the Calendars tab, as shown in Figure 4-12.
4. From the Calendars Available In drop-down list (lower left), select the
Project 2007 file that contains the calendar you want to copy.
5. In the Calendars Available In drop-down list (lower right), choose
whether you want to make the calendar available in another currently
open project or the Global template.
6. In the list on the left, click the calendar you want to copy and then
click the Copy button.
The calendar is copied to the current project.
7. If you want to give the calendar a different name, click the Rename
button, type a new name in the Rename dialog box that appears, and
then click OK.
8. Close the Organizer by clicking the close button (the X) in the upper-
right corner.
Here are a few pointers about copying calendars from project to project:

✦Make sure that the name you give the calendar is descriptive.
Providing an appropriate name helps you remember the calendar’s gen-
eral parameters.
✦If your company has standard calendars, try having one resource
create and disseminate them. If ten versions of a management calendar
float around and you grab the wrong one, it can cause problems.
✦Put the project manager’s initials in each calendar template name you
create. That way, you know which ones you created.

icrosoft Office Project 2007 is a complex product that offers a wealth
of functionality. But all that functionality comes at a price: It’s not
always perfectly obvious how the many tools at your disposal work or how
to find the information about your project that you need.
That’s where Project’s Help feature comes in. In Project Help, you can look
up information or get answers to questions; go online and tap into a wider
range of information and advice; run Diagnostics that tell you what to do if
you’re having problems with the Project software; or let a guide take you
through the process of creating a project.
Entering the Universe of Project Help
Because you probably use software day in and day out, you probably have
used a Help feature before. Though they all have similarities, they all are
slightly different, as well. Project 2007 Help relies heavily on online
resources, though it also contains a built-in knowledge base of help topics,
accessed through a Table of Contents.
Here’s a rundown of the type of help you can find in Project 2007 when you
click the Help icon on the Standard toolbar. As you can see from this list,
you have several ways to get to help in Project:
✦Microsoft Office Project Help: This option displays the full Help feature
with a Browse feature, Table of Contents, and a Search field.
✦Microsoft Office Online: Because Project is part of the Office family of
products, this link to the Office Online Assistance Center is provided.
✦Microsoft Office Diagnostics: This option automatically identifies
errors and tries to correct them. Use it if you have serious problems
using the software (for example, if the software continually shuts down
or displays error messages).

One helpful option not accessed from the Help menu, Project Guide, offers
step-by-step guidance to help you build a new project (see the last section of
this chapter for more about Project Guide).
Exploring Microsoft Office Project Help
Though this portion of Help sports some new features and a look that differs
from Project 2003, it offers similar functionality. Essentially you can click on
the links in the Browse Project Help list to display articles of information,
locate a help topic in a Table of Contents, or use a search tool to search the
Help knowledge base.
Click the Help menu and choose the Microsoft Office Project Help option, or

Browsing topics
Home in the Microsoft Office Project Help window consists of a list of topics
labeled Browse Project Help (refer to Figure 5-1). By clicking a topic, you can
drill down to articles of information related to a major topic.
For example, if you click a topic such as Estimating Task Durations, you see a
further list of subtopics like the one shown in Figure 5-2.
By clicking one of these subtopics, you can display an article about the
topic, which often includes step-by-step instructions (see Figure 5-3). Here
are a few guidelines for getting the most out of these subtopics:

these, shaped like a little blue book, is the Show Table of Contents button.
When you click this button, a pane opens on the left of the window that
shows a list of all Help topics. You can click a book icon to the left of a major

The topics and subtopics listed in the Table of Contents are the same as
those listed in the Browse Project Help section to the right of this pane.
However, by displaying the Table of Contents, you can display all subtopics
in a single list, rather than going to a new window to view each set of
subtopics as you do when you use the Browse feature. This capability might
help you spot the subtopic you need more easily.
Searching for Help
You can search for help in two ways. One method is to simply enter a ques-
tion in the Ask a Question box on the Project page and press Enter (see
Figure 5-5). This brings up the Help window with suggested topic matches.
Click a topic to view it.

Microsoft advises that searches with two to seven words in them get the
best results. So avoid using single words and avoid getting too wordy!
The second place to search from is within the Microsoft Office Project Help
window. Enter words or a question in the Search box located there (refer to
Figure 5-5) and then click Search. Again, results appear, and you can browse
through them or click one to read the related article.

If you want a broader universe of answers to explore and to be sure you
have the most up-to-date help information, it’s time to leave the knowledge
database built into Project and wander around the Internet. When you take
this trip through the Microsoft Office Online command in the Help menu,
you end up at the Microsoft Office Online site shown in Figure 5-6. Here you
find downloadable clip art, templates, training, and advice.

Running Diagnostics
136
Running Diagnostics
Sometimes the problem isn’t that you can’t figure out how to do something
in Project; sometimes the problem is that Project itself isn’t working cor-
rectly. When that happens, you can run Diagnostics, which test your com-
puter to see why you might be experiencing crashes while using Project.
Diagnostics check for a few possible problems, including those caused by
✦Hard drive errors
✦Conflicting Office programs
✦Missing updated service packs for Office that might correct bugs or
errors
✦Memory
Running Diagnostics can take about 15 minutes, so be prepared to take a
break from your work. Also, it’s a good precaution to close all other pro-
grams while running Diagnostics.

You can follow these steps to use Diagnostics:
1. Choose Help➪Microsoft Office Diagnostics.
2. In the dialog box that appears, click Continue.
The Start Diagnostics dialog box shown in Figure 5-9 appears.
3. Click Run Diagnostics.
The tests run and display progress and results. When the tests are 
complete, a window might appear telling you whether any repairs 
were made.
4. Click the Detailed Results link to get more information about the
repairs.
Putting Project Guide to Work
Project Guide is a wizard-like tool that helps step you through the process of
building a project. If you’ve never used project management software (or
Project itself), you might find it helpful to run through Project Guide when
you’re faced with a new project. Project Guide helps you work through the
entire life of your project, helping you to enter task information at the start,
add resources, track the project, and even generate your final report.
Where Project Guide can lead you
Project Guide is divided into four sections: Tasks, Resources, Track, and
Report. Within each of those categories are ten or so links for you to click to
Figure 5-9:

initiate an action. When you do so, you might have to choose a variety of
subactions, depending on what you need to do to create your particular
project.
To know how to make intelligent choices in Project Guide, you need some
basic understanding of how a project is built, which we provide starting in
this minibook. Our advice is to walk with us through many of the steps in
this book and then use Project Guide to practice building your first project.
Then you make intelligent choices about how to use the various options
Project Guide offers.
Getting to work with Project Guide
A Project Guide toolbar displays by default as the bottommost of the tool-
bars at the top of your Project screen (see Figure 5-10). The toolbar includes
an icon you click to show or hide Project Guide, so if Project Guide doesn’t
appear on the left side of your screen, just click the Show/Hide Project Guide
button.
To use the Project Guide, you click a category on the Project Guide toolbar
(such as Tasks) and then click a link in the drop-down list of items (such as
List the Tasks in the Project). This displays additional information in the
Project Guide pane (see Figure 5-11) asking you to enter data or choose or
accept a setting and move through a series of screens. When you finish
working through one set of screens, you return to the Project Guide pane
and can click another task or category to proceed.
Microsoft laid out these categories and tasks in the logical order in which
you should tackle them to build most projects. Therefore it’s a good idea,
when you start to use Project Guide, to just click the categories and the
tasks within them in sequence. Each item serves to remind you of all the
things you should consider (and even a few things you might have forgotten
you need to do), even if you choose to skip a few steps here and there for
your particular project.

here’s nothing stopping you from creating a project schedule that
simply lists your tasks and subsequently creating links that identify
which tasks depend on other tasks. But, if you take advantage of Project’s
outlining capabilities, you establish additional visual cues that help you
easily identify related tasks and help you organize both your project and
your thoughts.
Project provides several ways to organize tasks in the schedule; in this
chapter, you work with the basic ways Project can outline tasks in a 
schedule.
A To-Do List . . . or a Project Schedule?
If you simply type tasks into a project schedule, you end up with a schedule
that looks just like a to-do list. Even when you later add dependencies, the
titles of the tasks still look just like a to-do list (see Figure 1-1).
Although there’s nothing wrong with a to-do list, an organized to-do list is
typically more useful. From an organized to-do list, you can get a sense of
which tasks are related to other tasks by simply looking at the list. Using the
outlining features available in Project, you can look at the table portion (the
spreadsheet-like interface in the left pane that contains columns of informa-
tion) of Gantt Chart view to identify related tasks without looking at the
chart portion (the right pane) of the view to study dependencies (see 
Figure 1-2).

Building an outline
So, how do you actually go about building an organized outline? No hard and
fast rules exist, so just use the approach that works best for you:
✦Some people like to list all the major headings first and then fill in more
detailed information below each major heading.
✦Other people like to list everything they can think of and then focus on
sorting those items in orderly and logical groups.
✦Still other people work on one phase at a time, listing its major heading
and then the tasks associated with it.
✦And then there’s the group of people who use combinations of all of
these methods.
“I’ve got a little list . . .”
One of the major questions facing a project manager is, “What should I
include and what should I exclude?” A sketchy project schedule has holes
that can threaten the integrity of the schedule, leaving you late on delivery
and overbudget. A schedule filled with excessive detail can make you lose
focus of the project’s purpose.
When you’re making that list of tasks to include in your project, help your-
self focus by defining both the goal and the scope of your project. Lack of a
clearly defined goal and scope is among the top five reasons that projects
fail. So, don’t set yourself and your project up for failure; before you dive
into entering data in a project management software package, settle the mat-
ters of goal and scope for your project.
To identify your goal, ask yourself, “What will my project achieve? What will
have changed when I complete my project?” Will you, for example, have put
on a conference, built a building, or trained a staff?
To define the scope of your project, ask yourself questions like these:
✦What is my project’s budget?
✦Who will be affected by my project — my entire company, the IT depart-
ment, or my workgroup in Human Resources?
✦How many people will work on or have input into my project?
✦Does my project have a deadline date and, if so, what is it?
For more on a project’s scope and goal, see Book I, Chapter 3.

A To-Do List . . . or a Project Schedule?

A typical project outline
Whether you’re writing a paper or preparing a project schedule, an outline is
an outline. It contains higher-level headings that summarize the topics of the
lower-level headings below. Yep, just like your English teacher taught you.
If you look closely at the project outline shown back in Figure 1-2, you notice
that it organizes the tasks into three levels, and each level represents a col-
lection of tasks that you can consider a phase of your project. A task that
has other tasks indented below it is called a summary task, and the indented
tasks are called subtasks. Summary tasks appear in boldface type, and you
can easily identify them because a plus sign (+) or a minus sign (–) appears
beside the task name. When you see a plus sign beside a summary task, its
subtasks are hidden. The subtasks are visible when a minus sign appears
beside the summary task name.
You can have just about as many levels of detail as you want in a schedule,
but before you get “level-happy,” consider that tracking a very detailed proj-
ect can be difficult. In addition, if you find yourself building a project sched-
ule with four, five, or six levels, you might actually be building several
projects. When you find yourself with many levels, you might want to con-
sider taking a group of tasks and turning it into a separate project, with a
separate project manager. By dividing that many-level project into several
smaller projects, managing the projects should be easier. And, even if the
phases relate and seem to be part of the same project, you can still break
them into separate projects and then consolidate the smaller projects when
you need to view the big picture.
You can read more about consolidating projects in Chapter 4 of this 
minibook.
Summary tasks are special
A summary task isn’t one to which you assign resources to accomplish; it’s a
placeholder task in Project that you can use to get a feel, at a glance, for the
duration and cost of a set of tasks — a phase — of your project.
In addition to appearing in boldface type, a summary task has no duration,
start date, or finish date of its own. Instead, the duration, start date, and
finish date of the summary task all summarize the information of the sub-
tasks indented below the summary task. And, by default, Project changes the
appearance of the bar in the chart portion of Gantt Chart view to a solid
black bar with downward-pointing arrows at the beginning and ending dates
of the period covered by the subtasks that the summary task summarizes.

In Figure 1-3, the Select a Location summary task is expected to take 18 days
to complete, and 18 days is the sum of the durations of the subtasks shown
below Select a Location. The start date and finish date for the summary task
are, respectively, the start date of the earliest subtask and the end date of
the latest subtask.
In addition to summarizing duration information, a summary task, by default,
has no cost of its own. However, you can assign a cost to a summary task 
by assigning a resource to the summary task. The cost of a summary task
includes the cost of the resource you assigned to it plus the cost of the sub-
tasks below it.
The most special task of them all — 
the project summary task
Ideally, you’d like one more summary task — one for the entire project. This
is called the project summary task. Take the easy way to achieve this and let
Project insert the project summary task for you. Follow these steps:

1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the View tab.
3. Click Show Project Summary Task.
4. Click OK.
Project adds, on Row 0, a summary task at the top of your schedule,
naming the task with the name you assigned to the file in which you
saved your schedule. I like the name of the project summary task to
match the project name, and that’s what happens by default if I name
the file using the project name.
5. (Optional) Change the name of the project summary task and press
Enter.
If, however, you prefer to name the file something different than the proj-
ect name and you want the summary task to reflect the project name, no
problem. Just edit the Task Name of the summary task by clicking in the
Task Name column and pressing F2. Then type a new name and press
Enter. In Figure 1-4, you see a project file with a name that’s different
from the project’s summary task name.

Although you might think that setting the option to display the project sum-
mary task applies to all projects, it doesn’t. If you want to display a project
summary task, you need to set this option in each project file you create.
Creating Structure in the Schedule
After you identify the tasks that you want to include in the outline, you can
add structure to the outline — and obtain peace of mind — by grouping the
tasks into phases of your project and establishing summary tasks for each
phase. Adding structure enables you to easily identify, at a glance, related
tasks, helping you organize both your project and your thoughts.
Selecting tasks
Many of the activities involved in adding structure to your outline require
that you select a task. You can use any of the techniques in Table 1-1 to
select tasks, depending on what you want to select.
Table 1-1
Selecting Tasks
To Select This . . .
Do This . . .
A single task 
Click its Gantt bar or its ID number.
Several contiguous tasks
Select the first task. Then hold down Shift and click the last
task that you want to select.
Several noncontiguous tasks
Hold down Ctrl as you click the ID numbers or Gantt bars of
the tasks that you want to select.
Promoting and demoting tasks
You use the Indent and Outdent buttons on the Formatting toolbar in Project
to create an outline of summary tasks and subtasks. Select the task you want
to indent or outdent and then click the appropriate button. To indent or out-
dent several tasks, select all of the tasks and then click the appropriate button.
When you indent a task, Project makes that task a subtask of the task that
precedes it in the Task Name column, and that preceding task becomes a
summary task. Outdenting a task moves the task to a higher level in the out-
line and can change the status of a summary task to a task or subtask if you
outdent the only subtask of a summary task.
In Figure 1-5, Select a Location is a summary task and Select a Date is a sub-
task of the Select a Location summary task. To change Select a Location from
a summary task to a regular task, we would need to outdent the task that
appears immediately below the summary task, eliminating both the concep-
tual and visual status of the summary task.

Creating Structure in the Schedule
150
Expanding and collapsing the outline
Outlining is the tool of choice for organizing your thoughts. In writing, 
outlining helps you identify major topics and topics subordinate to the
major topics. You not only identify what you want to write about, but you
also identify an order in which to write. Also, you can easily focus on one
area of the outline.
Outlining in software products adds some delightful capabilities. In Project,
you can hide all tasks except the most major ones — the ones at the left
edge of the outline. You also can display the subtasks of only one major
heading. Or you can hide all subtasks but display the major headings of your
choice. To take advantage of these delightful capabilities, you need only to
have indented some tasks, creating summary tasks and subtasks.
You can use outlining to help you focus your attention. You might want to
display only summary tasks for a project while talking to your boss. During a
meeting, you might want to collapse all portions of the outline except the
portion being discussed in the meeting. You also can close most of the out-
line so that you can easily jump to a later phase in the project without scroll-
ing endlessly.

151
For any summary task, you can use the Show Subtasks and the Hide
Subtasks buttons on the Formatting toolbar to expand or collapse the out-
line. Select a summary task and click the appropriate button. If a plus sign
(+) appears beside a summary task, Project has collapsed that portion of the
outline and hidden the subtasks below the summary task. If a minus sign (–)
appears beside a summary task, Project expands that portion of the outline
and displays the subtasks of that summary task. In Figure 1-6, we’ve col-
lapsed the entire schedule except the subtasks below the Identify
Performers summary task.
In addition to the Show Subtasks and Hide Subtasks buttons on the
Formatting toolbar, you can click the plus and minus symbols beside the
name of each summary task to collapse or expand that portion of the 
outline.
You also can use the Show button to control which levels of tasks appear as
you view the schedule. When you click the Show button, Project displays a
list, as shown in Figure 1-7; choose the outline level to display. For example,
display Outline Level 1 to see only the highest level tasks in the schedule.

You can choose the All Subtasks command from the Show list to display all
tasks in your schedule.
So, What Happens When You Reorganize the Outline?
You can easily reorganize a schedule after you initially set it up. You can add,
delete, move, and copy tasks.
Adding tasks
As you created your list of tasks, you might not have thought about adding
tasks that serve as summary tasks. Or, you might have simply forgotten a
task. No worries — you can easily add a task. To add a task, follow these
steps:
1. Position the cell pointer on the task that should appear below the new
task you intend to insert and then press the Insert key.
Project inserts a blank row in the sheet pane (see Figure 1-8), renumber-
ing the rows of the tasks that fall below the new row.
Figure 1-7:
Select an
outline level

153
2. Type a title for the task and, if you’re creating a new task for the 
project, supply a duration.
If you’re creating a summary task for a phase, you can skip entering the
duration because Project calculates the summary task’s duration as the
sum of the durations of its subtasks.
3. Press Enter to finish the process.
For more on setting up any task as a summary task, read the section
“Promoting and demoting tasks,” earlier in this chapter.
Deleting tasks
It happens — you set up a task and then realize that you don’t need it. You
can easily delete it by following these steps:
1. Select the task by using any of the techniques described earlier in this
chapter and press the Delete key.
Because deleting a summary task has ranging effects, Project displays a
dialog box after you press the Delete key to confirm that you really want
to delete the summary task and all of its subtasks (see Figure 1-9).
Figure 1-8:
Inserting 
a task is
simple.

So, What Happens When You Reorganize the Outline?
154
If you delete a summary task, Project also deletes all of the summary
task’s subtasks. Make sure this is what you really want to do before
deleting any summary tasks.
2. Select Continue or Cancel and then click OK.
If you choose to continue, Project deletes the task.
“Doing it over and over again . . .”
You might need to include tasks in your project that occur at some regular
interval — what Project calls a recurring task. For example, perhaps you need
to review some work daily. You can avoid the drudge of setting up these
tasks and let Project set them up for you. Use the Recurring Task feature by
following these steps:
1. Select the task that you want to appear below the recurring task.
2. Choose Insert➪Recurring Task to open the Recurring Task
Information dialog box, as shown in Figure 1-10.

3. Type a name for the recurring task.
4. Set the task duration in the Duration field.
5. Set the pattern for the occurrence of the task by selecting one of the
Recurrence Pattern option buttons: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Yearly.
Depending on the recurrence that you select, the timing settings to the
right of the control buttons change. Figure 1-10 shows daily settings.
6. Select the appropriate settings for the recurrence frequency.
If you choose Weekly, place a check mark next to the day(s) of the week
on which you want the task to occur. If you choose Monthly, select either
the date of each month or the day, such as the third Wednesday. If you
choose Yearly, select a specific date or a day, such as the second
Thursday in March.
7. In the Range of Recurrence section, set the period during which the
task should recur by entering Start and End After or End By dates.
8. Click OK.
Project creates the appropriate number of tasks above the task you selected
in Step 1 and displays them as subtasks under a summary task with the
name that you supplied in Step 2. In Figure 1-11, you can see the recurring
daily task we created; the symbol in the Indicators column identifies the task
as a recurring task. If you hover the cursor over the Indicators column,
Project displays the number of times the task occurs between its start and
end dates. When you expand the task, you see that Project adds the number
of the occurrence to the task name of each recurring task.
Moving tasks
Moving tasks and subtasks isn’t a difficult proposition; you just need to be
aware of the effects that moving summary and subtasks can have on the
schedule’s outline:
✦When you move a summary task, its subtasks move with it. To move a
summary task only (without moving any of its subtasks), you must first
promote all its subtasks so that the summary task is no longer a sum-
mary task.
✦If you move a task at the highest level of the outline to a new location
just below a task with subtasks, Project demotes the task that you move.
✦If you move a subtask so that it appears below a task at the highest level
of the outline, Project promotes the subtask that you move.
To move tasks in an outline, you can drag and drop or you can cut and paste.

So, What Happens When You Reorganize the Outline?
156
Moving by dragging
You can easily move a task by dragging it to a new location using these
steps:
1. Display a view that contains a table, such as Gantt Chart view.
2. Select the task(s) you want to move using any of the techniques
described in the preceding section.
If you select a summary task, Project automatically selects its subtasks
for the move.
3. In the row number column, drag the task to the place in the task list
where you want it to appear.
A gray line appears, identifying the place where the task will appear (see
Figure 1-12).
4. When the gray line appears where you want the task to appear,
release your mouse button.
Project moves the task from its original location to the new one; you can
change the task’s level in the outline by indenting or outdenting it.

Moving by cutting
If you’re not dealing with a lot of tasks in a project schedule, dragging works
well. But, if your project contains lots of tasks, dragging to find the target
location can be difficult; and, if you’re like us, you run the risk of accidentally
releasing that mouse button earlier than you intended (we can be clumsy
with the mouse). So, consider using the Cut and Paste tools on the Standard
toolbar to move your tasks. Follow these steps:
1. Display a view that contains a table, such as Gantt Chart view.
2. Select the task(s) you want to move using any of the techniques
described earlier in this chapter.
3. Click the Cut tool on the Standard toolbar.
Project removes the task from the outline and places the task informa-
tion on the Windows Clipboard. If you selected a summary task, Project
asks whether you really want to remove the summary task and all its
subtasks.
4. Scroll to the place in the task list where you want the task to appear.
5. Click the task that appears below the place where you want the task
you’re moving to appear.

6. Click the Paste tool.
Using the information stored on the Windows Clipboard, Project dis-
plays the task(s) you cut in the new location.
You might need to adjust the task’s position in the outline by using the
Indent and Outdent buttons.
Copying tasks
Copying tasks in a schedule is a simple matter. To copy a single task, follow
the steps in the preceding section, but select the Copy tool in Step 3 instead
of the Cut tool.
Planning for a regular meeting
Company: A law firm with more than 75 employ-
ees that depends on word-processing software
Project: Upgrade the word-processing soft-
ware on all computers in the firm to Word 2007
Challenge: Meet regularly to monitor team
progress during the planning phase of the project
Because the law firm depends on word pro-
cessing, migrating to a new word-processing
package is a huge project. To effectively
manage the project, the project manager has
set up a separate project for the planning
phase. The project manager is concerned about
communication during the planning phase,
which will impact all other phases. During the
planning phase, several resources will be per-
forming a variety of tasks. Existing hardware
and operating systems must be identified and
assessed to ensure that they can support the
new software. Existing documents and tem-
plates must be evaluated and assessed to
determine which will be converted, which will
be used “as-is,” and which will be redone.
Compatibility issues must be examined with
other software used by the firm and by other
firms with which the firm interacts. Potential
customization issues need to be identified.
Network, browser, and Internet profiles need to
be established. Security and Training needs
must be addressed.
Because the findings of one team member can
affect the analysis of other team members, the
project manager has decided to include weekly
meetings in the project plan during the planning
phase to exchange findings. The meetings will
be held every Thursday, and team members can
place this meeting on their calendars.
Solution: To include this weekly meeting in the
project schedule, the project manager sets up
a recurring task that will last over the life of the
planning phase of the project, which is pro-
jected to last approximately 53 days, as shown
in the duration column for the summary task in
the figure. The project manager uses the sum-
mary task bar of the Planning phase to identify
the starting and ending dates of the Planning
phase, determining that the phase is scheduled
to begin on December 26, 2006 and end on
March 8, 2007.

Project Plan
So, What Happens When You Reorganize the Outline?

Suppose, though, that you have a series of tasks that you need to repeat in
the outline. For example, when planning to install new software company-
wide, you typically set up test environments that mirror the conditions
under which the new software will run, and then you test the software
repeatedly. So, the test plan portion of your project plan might include tasks
like Run Test Case, Record Results, Revise Test Case, Rerun The Test, and
Record Revision Case Results for each test case you devise. Instead of typing
these tasks repeatedly, you could enter them once and then use the Fill
handle — a small black square that appears in the lower-right corner of a
selected cell — to copy them repeatedly. When all the repeated tasks appear
in the project plan, you can simply insert summary tasks that represent each
of the test cases and therefore distinguish the groups of repeated tasks from
each other.
If you open the project file for this case study
on our book’s Web site, you can hover the
cursor over the Indicators column to see the
information stored about each occurrence of
the recurring task. You also can double-click
the summary task for the recurring task to view
the settings we used to create this weekly
recurring task.

So, What Happens When You Reorganize the Outline?
160
The Fill handle copies tasks into a contiguous range. If the range already con-
tains information, using the Fill handle to copy overwrites the existing infor-
mation. To avoid this problem, insert blank rows in the project before using
the Fill handle. Select the task that you want to appear beneath the new row
and press the Insert key on your keyboard. To insert several blank rows, select
the number of rows that you want to insert before pressing the Insert key.
To copy a contiguous group of repeated tasks using the Fill handle, follow
these steps:
1. Select the tasks by using any of the techniques described earlier in
this chapter.
If you include both the task name and the duration in the selection,
Project copies both the task name and the duration.
2. Place the mouse pointer over the Fill handle in the lower-right corner
of the selection.
The mouse pointer changes to a plus sign (+).
3. Drag the fill handle down until you have selected the group of rows
that you want to contain the repetitive tasks (see Figure 1-13).

Chapter 2: Assigning Outline 
Codes to Tasks
In This Chapter
 Understanding outline numbers
 Assigning outline numbers
 Understanding outline codes
 Creating customized outline codes
 Adjusting outline codes and renumbering
You have a couple of options that you can consider if you want to assign
outline numbers to the tasks in your schedule. In addition to the WBS
(work breakdown structure) codes described in Chapter 3 of this minibook,
you can use automatic outline numbering, or you can use outline field codes.
Make the choice between outline numbers and outline codes based on
whether you want the value to remain static when you make changes to the
project’s outline structure. When you use outline numbers, Project automat-
ically updates the numbers if you change your project’s outline structure.
When you use outline codes, Project doesn’t make any changes to the value
when you change your project’s outline structure.
Understanding Outline Numbers
Project can assign outline numbers to the tasks in your schedule based on
the task’s level in the outline; the outline numbers help you identify, visually,
each task’s hierarchical position in the outline. In addition, you can easily
and clearly refer to tasks by using their outline number.
Project uses an outline numbering system that’s similar to the numbering
system you find in most legal documents. You usually find a whole number
preceding each major heading in a legal document. Headings subordinate to
the major heading are numbered with the major heading’s whole number, a
period, and then a subordinate paragraph number. So, the first paragraph
under the first major heading is numbered 1.1, and the second paragraph
under the first major heading is numbered 1.2.

Letting Project Assign Outline Numbers
164
By default, Project uses the same numbering scheme, assigning whole num-
bers to tasks that aren’t indented at all. Subtasks are assigned outline num-
bers based on what task they fall under and how many times they are
indented from the left edge of the outline.
Letting Project Assign Outline Numbers
You can let Project assign outline numbers that identify each task’s level in
the outline, as shown in Figure 2-1. Project adds a number that you can’t edit
to the task’s name. Like the legal numbering scheme described in the previ-
ous section, Project assigns whole numbers to the tasks at the left edge of
the outline, which are tasks at the top level of the outline. To each subtask of
a task at the left edge of the outline, Project assigns the whole number, fol-
lowed by a period, and then a sequential number for each subtask. Project
continues to follow this pattern for any subtasks that appear beneath other
subtasks. So, in Figure 2-1, the tasks at the left edge of the outline — the
highest level in the outline — display numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Below Select a
Location, which is Task 1, each subtask displays a number that includes its
parent number and a sequential number for its place in the outline. The Sell
Tickets task, with outline number 3.4, is the fourth subtask under the third
top-level task.

To display outline numbers, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options to display the Options dialog box.
2. Click the View tab.
3. Select the Show Outline Number check box in the Outline Options sec-
tion (see Figure 2-2).
4. Click OK.
Understanding Outline Codes
When you use the technique described in the preceding section to assign
outline numbers, you can’t edit the outline numbers. You must simply
accept the outline numbers Project assigns.
Suppose, though, that you want to assign codes to your tasks that reflect the
way your organization does business. For example, you might have devel-
oped accounting codes that use an outline format and you want to assign
these codes to each task. You can use a custom outline code field to create
your accounting codes and assign them to each task.
Figure 2-2:

Designing Your Own Outline Numbers
166
Project’s automatic outline codes and custom outline codes aren’t mutually
exclusive — you can assign both to your tasks. They differ in that you can
control the appearance of custom outline codes but not the appearance of
Project’s automatic outline numbers. In addition, outline codes aren’t tied to
the hierarchical structure of your project like outline numbers are but can be
set up to use a hierarchical structure that you define. And, outline numbers
and outline codes behave differently when you move a task.
Designing Your Own Outline Numbers
You can enter outline code information in an ad hoc manner, but most
people create a list of valid outline codes so that the outline codes assigned
are meaningful and consistent.
Although outline codes aren’t dependent on the structure of your project
outline, they do work in a hierarchical fashion — hence the name outline
code. However, you define the hierarchy by defining codes at the highest
level — we’ll call that Level 1 — and then additional codes at various subor-
dinate levels — Level 2, Level 3, and so on. Level 2 codes would appear sub-
ordinate to Level 1, Level 3 subordinate to Level 2, and so on.
Defining a custom outline code is a three-part process:
1. You select an outline code to customize. Project contains ten outline
code fields that you can customize for a variety of purposes.
2. You set up a code mask that defines the size and content of each por-
tion of the code. The code mask defines the appearance of the code, and
when you define the code mask, you can use numbers, uppercase let-
ters, lowercase letters, or characters (a combination of letters and 
numbers).
3. You set up a lookup table for the outline code. The lookup table con-
tains the valid values for the outline code that you can assign to tasks.
By using a lookup table to assign outline code values, you ensure that
the outline code values you use are both valid and consistent.
Although Project won’t limit you, try not to get carried away defining subor-
dinate levels of outline codes; stacking codes deeply makes them harder 
to use.
Selecting an outline code to define
To complete the first part of the process of defining an outline code, follow
these steps to select an outline code to define:
1. Choose Tools➪Customize➪Fields.

Project displays the Custom Fields dialog box (see Figure 2-3).
2. Open the Type drop-down list and select Outline Code.
3. Select an Outline Code from the Field section to customize.
4. Click the Rename button and type the new name (see Figure 2-4).
5. Click OK to redisplay the Custom Fields dialog box.

Defining the code mask
We didn’t ask you to close the dialog box in the previous section because
you haven’t finished the process of defining an outline code. When you use a
code mask, you define the format of the code — the number of characters in
each part of the code, and whether the characters are numbers, letters, or a
combination. To define the code mask, follow these steps:
1. Click the Lookup button.
Project displays the Edit Lookup Table dialog box. In Figure 2-5, we’ve
collapsed the dialog box so that you can focus on the pertinent part at
this point — the code mask.
2. To define a mask for the lookup table, click the plus sign (+) beside
Code Mask.
The plus sign changes to a minus sign (–) and displays the top portion of
the Edit Lookup Table dialog box.
3. Click the Edit Mask button.
Project displays the Code Mask Definition dialog box, shown in Figure 2-6.
As you define the code mask, Project displays filler characters in the Code
Preview box.

4. Click the first blank row in the Sequence column to display a drop-
down arrow and select the type of character that you want to use for
the first part of the outline code.
If you choose Characters, Project initially displays asterisks for that 
part of the code mask in the Code Preview box, indicating that you can
replace those asterisks with any characters that you want when you
define values in the Lookup Table.
5. Click the first blank row in the Length column and then specify a
length for that portion of the outline code.
6. Click in the first blank row of the Separator column and select a char-
acter to separate the parts of your WBS code.
You can choose a period (.), dash (–), plus (+), slash (/), or type any
character that isn’t a number or a letter (such as =).
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 for each level you want to define in your out-
line code.
8. Click OK to redisplay the Edit Lookup Table dialog box.
In the next section, you see how to create valid values that can appear as the
task’s outline code.
Defining values for the lookup table
Finally, to complete the process of defining an outline code, define a list of
acceptable entries to use when assigning the outline code to tasks in the
project. Follow these steps with the Edit Lookup Table dialog box still open:
1. Click the plus sign beside Lookup Table.
Project expands the Edit Lookup Table dialog box so that you can define
lookup table values (see Figure 2-7).
2. On Row 1 of the Value column, type a permissible value for the first
level of your outline code — think of it as Level 1 — and press Enter.
You can optionally type an explanation of the value in the Description
column.
3. On the next line, type an outline code for the second level that is per-
missible under Level 1 and press Enter.
4. Move the pointer back into the row in which you typed a Level 2 out-
line code and click the Indent button (the right arrow) at the top of
the dialog box to indent the value.
5. On subsequent lines, type other acceptable Level 2 values.

Designing Your Own Outline Numbers
170
6. If you need a Level 3 outline code under a Level 2 outline code, simply
type the code on a blank line below the Level 2 outline code, press
Enter, move the pointer back to the line on which you just typed the
code and click the Indent button.
7. To supply another Level 1 code, type the code on a blank line, place
the pointer on the code’s row, and click the Outdent button (the left
arrow) as many times as necessary, depending on the last code that
you entered.
If you forget to include a code, highlight the code that you want to
appear below the code that you’ll add, and then click the Insert Row
button at the top of the dialog box. And, if a code becomes invalid at
some later date, reopen this dialog box, highlight the code, and click the
Delete Row button.
You can click the plus sign beside Display Order for Lookup Table to
control the order in which lookup table codes appears. Similarly, you
can click the plus sign beside Data Entry Options to allow users to add
codes to the lookup table or to force entry of only Level 1 codes. In both
cases, when you click the plus sign, it changes to a minus sign and dis-
plays your options.

8. Click Close to redisplay the Custom Fields dialog box.
9. Click OK to save your outline code settings.
Entering outline codes
After you define an outline code, you need to insert a column in a table to
display outline codes. Follow these steps:
1. Display a view that includes a table, such as Gantt Chart view.
2. Right-click the name of the column that you want to appear to the
right of the column that will display the outline code.
3. Choose Insert Column from the shortcut menu that appears.
The Column Definition dialog box appears (see Figure 2-8).
4. From the Field Name list, select the outline code you customized.
After you open the list, you can type the first letter of the name you
assigned to the outline code to see the first choice in the list that begins
with that letter.
5. Click OK.
Project displays a column for the outline code you customized. No
codes appear in the column yet because you need to use the lookup list
that you defined to assign a code to each task.
6. Enter values in the custom outline code column by clicking in the out-
line code column.
Project displays a list box arrow.
7. Open the list to display the entries from the lookup table and select a
code (see Figure 2-9).

Outline Numbers and Codes and Renumbering
172
Outline Numbers and Codes and Renumbering
What happens to outline numbers and outline codes when you move tasks?
Insert new tasks? Delete tasks? Well, that depends.
If you’re using the outline numbers, Project renumbers affected outline num-
bers automatically if you move a task, insert a new task, or delete a task. In
Figure 2-10, we’ve hidden all the subtasks except for those in the Select a
Location phase. When we switch the first two subtasks, Project automati-
cally renumbers them, as you can see in Figure 2-11. We also added a new
task — cleverly named New Task — just above the Review and Sign Contract
task. Project renumbered the Review and Sign Contract task from 1.4 to 1.5
to accommodate the new task’s number, 1.4, and place in the outline.
Although Project automatically renumbers outline numbers, Project doesn’t
automatically renumber outline codes when you move tasks, insert new
tasks, or delete tasks. Outline codes are static values you assign. Although
you can create a hierarchical structure for an outline code, Project doesn’t
read the outline codes as values that can be sorted in any particular order.
Further, Project doesn’t associate the outline codes with the level of the task
in your project schedule outline. So, Project doesn’t renumber outline codes
when you make structural changes to the tasks in your outline.

In Figure 2-12, we’ve displayed the customized outline code we created ear-
lier in this chapter. In Figure 2-13, we’ve once again switched the first two
tasks and added a new task above Review and Sign Contract. As you can see,
the outline codes assigned to each task stayed with the task, and the new
task has no outline code assigned automatically.
Use outline numbers if you want Project to automatically update the num-
bers based on changes to your project’s outline structure. Use outline codes
if you want the value you assign to the task to remain static, regardless of
the changes you make to your project’s outline structure.
For a combination approach, consider using WBS codes; you can read about
them in the next chapter of this minibook.

 Customizing WBS codes
 Understanding WBS codes and renumbering
L
ike outline numbers and codes, WBS codes provide a way to number
tasks in a project; the structure of the WBS code helps the reader iden-
tify the phase of the project in which the task occurs. You can use WBS
codes instead of or in addition to outline numbers and outline codes.
WBS stands for work breakdown structure. WBS codes were originally devel-
oped by the United States defense establishment to help identify tasks in a
project based on the phase in which the task occurs. So, you can use WBS
codes as another way to organize tasks in a project. In this chapter, you
explore Project’s support for WBS codes.
What’s a WBS Code?
The United States defense establishment designed a numbering system,
reminiscent of the paragraph numbering used in legal documents, to help a
person viewing a list of project tasks quickly and easily identify the phase in
which the task occurs and its relationship to other tasks in the phase. When
working with the government, unique WBS codes are often assigned to each
task in a project, and the tasks are often referred to by their WBS codes.
In Figure 3-1, you see a common view of a WBS chart, which probably
reminds you of a company organization chart. Notice how each task’s WBS
code identifies the phase in which it occurs and the phase’s hierarchical
relationship in the project; for example, the third task in the first phase of
the project has a WBS code of 1.3.
Although Project doesn’t produce a WBS chart picture, you can assign WBS
codes to the tasks in your project.

Creating WBS Codes
178
Creating WBS Codes
You don’t have to create WBS codes; you can use the default codes that
Project assigns to your tasks. Project assigns WBS codes based on a task’s
position in the outline structure. So, you start by setting up your outline so
that it displays the summary task and subtasks with which you want to
work, as described in Chapter 1 of this minibook. Then follow these steps
to display the WBS codes that Project has already assigned to each task:
1. Display a view that includes a table, like Gantt Chart view.
2. Right-click the name of the column that you want to appear to the
right of the column that will display WBS codes.
3. Select Insert Column from the shortcut menu that appears.
The Column Definition dialog box appears (see Figure 3-2).
4. From the Field Name drop-down list, select WBS.
After you open the list, you can type a W to see the first choice in the list
that begins with W.
5. Click OK.
Project displays WBS codes for each task in the WBS column, as shown
in Figure 3-3. The WBS code that Project assigns to each task is based on
the task’s level in the outline; tasks at the highest level of the outline
have whole numbers for WBS codes.

Project doesn’t contain a view of your project as a WBS chart, but you can
create a WBS chart from your project data in two ways:

Visit www.criticaltools.com to find out more about WBS Chart Pro.
To use Visio to create a WBS chart from Project data, you need Visio 2007
installed on your computer. You create a WBS chart using the visual reports
in Project, which are new to Project 2007. To create a WBS chart with Project
data in Visio, you create a visual report that contains the information you
want to view in Visio. In Visio, you make some modifications to display WBS
numbers. Follow these steps to create a Visio report in Project, send the
data to Visio, and modify the Visio report to display WBS numbers:
1. Open the project for which you want to create the WBS chart.
The project doesn’t need to display WBS codes.
2. Choose Report➪Visual Reports.
The Visual Reports – Create Report window appears (see Figure 3-4).
3. On the All tab, click a report to use as a foundation for your template;
for this example, we chose Task Status Report (US).
4. Click the View button.
Visio opens on your computer, displaying the visual report you selected
using the data found in the project you opened in Step 1. The WBS num-
bers don’t appear by default.

183
We displayed more tasks in the project by selecting both tasks (using
Ctrl+Click) at the bottom of the Visio diagram and then clicking Tasks in the
Add Category section on the left side of the Visio screen.
If you use custom WBS codes and you’ve assigned them to tasks so that they
don’t match the hierarchical structure of your project, the Visio report won’t
be a true WBS chart; it will display your custom WBS codes but it will pres-
ent the report hierarchically using Project’s built-in WBS codes, which do
match the hierarchical structure of your project.
Customizing WBS Codes
By default, Project assigns WBS codes using numbers only, and it bases the
assigned number on each task’s position in the project schedule’s outline.
Project assigns whole numbers to the tasks at the left edge of the outline,
which are tasks at the top level of the outline. To each subtask of a task at
the left edge of the outline, Project assigns the whole number, followed by a
period, and then a sequential number for each subtask. Project continues to
follow this pattern for any subtasks that appear beneath other subtasks.
You can think of the whole number as identifying a phase of the project;
tasks within that phase start with the phase’s whole number followed by a
period and a sequential number. So, the third task in the second phase of the
project would have the number 2.3.
Often, those default numbers work just fine. However, you might find yourself
in a situation where you want to modify the appearance of the WBS code to
incorporate information that’s meaningful to you and your client. For exam-
ple, you might want to include the project name or a client number as a
prefix for the WBS code. Further, you might want to include letters in the
WBS code along with numbers, as does the project shown in Figure 3-9.
You can customize the WBS codes that Project assigns by establishing your
own code mask; the code mask defines the appearance of the code. When you
define the code mask, you define the length of the code. You can use any or
all of the types of information listed in Table 3-1.
Table 3-1
WBS Code Mask Elements

Numbers (ordered)
Numbers in sequential order
Uppercase Letters (ordered)
Capital letters in alphabetical order

Lowercase letters in alphabetical order
Characters (unordered)
Numbers or letters in no order

Customizing WBS Codes
184
The first three elements are fairly self-explanatory, but the last element,
Characters (unordered), deserves a little more attention. If you include
Characters (unordered) in your code mask, Project initially displays aster-
isks for that part of the code mask, and you can replace those asterisks with
any characters that you want. For example, suppose that you use a mask of
Numbers (ordered) with a length of one, Characters (unordered) with a
length of 3. For any second-level task, you can enter any three characters
that you want for the second part of the WBS code. In this example, when
you enter a second-level task, you initially see a WBS of 1.***. However, you
can change it to something like 1.x%7.
To create your own custom WBS codes, follow these steps:
1. Choose Project➪WBS➪Define Code.
Project displays the WBS Code Definition dialog box (see Figure 3-10).
The Code preview box shows you the format of the WBS code that you’re
designing as you design it, so it appears blank until you make selections.
2. In the Project Code Prefix box, type a prefix that you want to appear
at the beginning of all WBS codes.
For example, you might want to use the initials of the project name or a
client number.

down arrow and select the type of character that you want to use for
the first part of the WBS code.
4. Click the first blank row in the Length column and then specify a
length for that portion of the WBS code.
You can type a number, choose Any, or choose a number between 1 and 10.
If you choose 3 for the first level of your WBS code, the WBS code for all
tasks in the first phase of your project begins with your project code
prefix followed by 001, and the WBS code for all tasks in the second phase
of your project begins with your project code prefix followed by 002.
Choosing Any, the default choice, is a safe bet because Project then
automatically expands the WBS code to accommodate the task’s posi-
tion in the outline.
In case you care, I tested the number 100, and Project accepted it. But
using a 100-digit number in a WBS code isn’t particularly practical.
5. Click in the first blank row of the Separator column and select a char-
acter to separate the parts of your WBS code.
You can choose a period (.), dash (–), plus (+), or slash (/), or you can
type any character that isn’t a number or a letter (such as =).
6. Repeat Steps 3 through 5 for each level in your outline.
7. Click OK to save your customized WBS code.
You might have noticed that the two boxes at the bottom of the WBS Code
Definition dialog box in Figure 3-10 were both checked. Project selects these
boxes by default; leaving them selected ensures that new tasks you insert in
the project are assigned WBS codes and that all WBS codes are unique.
When might WBS codes not be unique? If you insert a subproject, it’s possi-
ble that the subproject might contain WBS codes that duplicate those that
already exist in your project.
Read more about inserting subprojects in Book 4 of this minibook.

WBS Codes and Renumbering
186
WBS Codes and Renumbering
What happens to WBS codes when you move tasks? Insert new tasks? Delete
tasks? Well, that depends.
If you’re using the default WBS codes that Project inserts (that is, if you haven’t
customized WBS codes), Project renumbers affected WBS codes automati-
cally if you move a task, insert a new task, or delete a task. In Figure 3-11,
we’ve hidden all the subtasks except for those in Phase 1. When we switch
the first two subtasks, Project automatically renumbers them, as you can see
in Figure 3-12.
If, however, you use a custom code mask for WBS codes, Project doesn’t
automatically renumber the subtasks. In Figure 3-13, we customized the WBS
codes for the same project shown in Figure 3-11. We made sure that both
check boxes at the bottom of the WBS Code Definition dialog box were
selected to ensure that Project would generate a new WBS code for any new
task we insert and that the WBS code would be unique.

188
In Figure 3-14, we once again switched the first two subtasks. As you can see,
the WBS codes appear to be out of sequential order; Project lists the task
with WBS code C102-1.B before the task with WBS code C102-1.A.
We also inserted a new subtask before the first subtask; notice that its WBS
code of C102-1.G is unique, but again, out of sequential order.
Project uses this behavior with custom WBS codes because there are cir-
cumstances under which you don’t want to renumber the WBS codes in
your project. However, for those times when you do want to renumber WBS
codes, you can. Choose Project➪WBS➪Renumber. Project displays the WBS
Renumber dialog box, shown in Figure 3-15. Click OK, and Project renumbers
the WBS codes in the project schedule.

n this chapter, we look at different ways to link and insert projects. For
example, you can include a link in a project to backup documentation
stored in an Excel spreadsheet, or you can create several project files that
cover different phases of the same project and then consolidate them to
look at the big picture. As you read about these techniques, you also see
how they can affect the structure of your project.
Connecting Projects with Hyperlinks
You can link one project to another by using a hyperlink. A hyperlink enables
you to jump from the currently displayed document to another document
on your hard drive, a computer network, or the Internet — useful when, for
example, you’d like your Project schedule to reference some backup infor-
mation stored in a Word document, an Excel spreadsheet, or even another
Project file.
Creating a hyperlink
When you insert a hyperlink in a project schedule, you can link an existing
task to another project or create a new task that you can use to represent
the timing or costs of another project. The hyperlink contains information
about the physical location of the other Project file, but it doesn’t contain
any of the timing or cost information, so you have to add that information to
the task formed by the hyperlink.

Connecting Projects with Hyperlinks
192
To create a hyperlink to another Project file, follow these steps:
1. Select a blank cell in the Task Name column where you want the
hyperlinked task to appear.
2. Choose Insert➪Hyperlink or click the Insert Hyperlink button on the
Standard toolbar.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears (see Figure 4-1).
3. In the Text to Display box, type text that represents the hyperlinked file.
This text should explain to viewers what they’ll see if they click the link.
4. In the Link To area on the left, select the Existing File or Web Page
option.
5. Use the Look In drop-down list to select the file or Web page to which
you want to link.
6. Click OK.
Project inserts the hyperlink. A hyperlink icon, like the one shown in
Figure 4-2, appears in the Indicator field to the left of the selected task.
When you move the mouse pointer over the icon and pause, Project displays
a ScreenTip containing the text you supplied in Step 3. If you click the hyper-
link icon in the Indicators column, Project opens the file associated with the
hyperlink.
To remove a hyperlink, right-click the task for which you created the link and
then choose Hyperlink➪Remove Hyperlink. No warning appears; Project
simply removes the hyperlink.
Figure 4-1:
Use this
dialog box
to set up the
hyperlink.

What happened? My hyperlinks don’t work
Typically, when a hyperlink doesn’t work, the file to which you created the
link no longer exists in the location you specified when you created the link,
which can happen for two reasons:
✦The linked file was deleted. If the file has been deleted, you can’t link to
it any longer.
✦The linked file was moved to a new location. Here’s some good news:
You can avoid hyperlinks that don’t work because files moved. To pre-
vent such a calamity, simply use relative addressing whenever possible
when you create hyperlinks. For example, g:\project.mpp is an
absolute address. If your server drive changes from G: to H:, the link
won’t work. However, if you use \\servername\share\project.mpp,
a relative address, your server drive can change from G: to any other
letter, and the relative address to your server will still work.

194
Editing hyperlinks
If you create a lot of hyperlinks, using the Project ScreenTip that appears
when you hover the mouse pointer over each link to review hyperlink infor-
mation can be tedious. You might find it easier to display hyperlinks in one
of Project’s built-in tables by following these steps:
1. Begin in any view that includes a table, such as Gantt Chart view.
2. Choose View➪Table➪Hyperlink.
The Hyperlink table shown in Figure 4-3 displays columns of information
relevant to any links that you’ve created for your project.
You can edit the hyperlink by using the Edit Hyperlink dialog box. Right-click
the link and choose Hyperlink➪Edit Hyperlink to reopen the dialog box
(shown previously in Figure 4-1) and make changes.

Moving or copying hyperlinks
If the information in the hyperlinked file becomes pertinent to a different
task or more than one task, you can move or copy the hyperlink from one
task to another by using the Hyperlink table. Follow these steps:
1. Select the hyperlink cell by clicking its task name and then using the
right-arrow key to select the hyperlink cell.
Clicking a cell in the Hyperlink, Address, or SubAddress column of a task
containing a hyperlink activates the link.
2. Press the Shift key and the right-arrow key to also select the address
and, if appropriate, the subaddress of the hyperlink.
3. Do one of the following:
• To move the link: Click the Cut button on the Standard toolbar, click
the hyperlink cell next to the task where you want to move the link,
and then click the Paste button.
• To copy the link: Click the Copy button, click the hyperlink cell next
to the task where you want to place a copy of the link, and then click
the Paste button.
Consolidating Projects
Sometimes you have a really complex project to manage, and although you
can expand and collapse the outline for the schedule, you feel you’d work
better if you could just focus on one piece with no other distractions —
including collapsed portions of the outline. Setting up separate projects for
each phase would help you focus, but what do you do about dependencies
across phases? And resource allocations?
The answer: Use consolidation.
What is consolidation?
Consolidating is a useful way to break a complex project down into smaller
projects — referred to as subprojects — and then combine the smaller projects
into one large project when you need to look at the big picture. Consolidating
projects can help you manage the following situations:

Consolidating Projects
196
✦A project might be so complex that breaking it into smaller pieces can
help you to organize it. You can use consolidation to combine the sub-
projects to view the big picture.
✦Suppose that you have tasks in a project that are managed by different
people and those tasks are interdependent. By creating subprojects and
using consolidation techniques, you can allow independent project man-
agement and still create the correct dependencies between the schedules
of the various subprojects and assign the necessary resources.
✦If you use the same resources for several projects, you can consoli-
date those projects so that you can level the resources and avoid 
overallocations — and surprises.
See Book VII, Chapter 2 for more information on handling resource 
overallocations.
When you use Project’s consolidation features, you create subprojects that
contain the tasks that constitute one portion of your project, and you save
the subproject as a separate project file. You assign resources and set up
each subproject with links and constraints, just as if you were working with
the entire project.
While working in the consolidated project, you can focus on any portion of
the project. Subprojects appear as summary tasks in the consolidated proj-
ect, and you can use Project’s outlining tools to hide all tasks that are associ-
ated with any subproject. You can view, print, and change information for
any subproject, just as if you were working with a single project. Figure 4-4
shows you a consolidated project.
You can review outlining techniques in Chapter 1 of this minibook. And, the
numbering techniques described in Chapters 2 and 3 of this minibook also
apply to consolidated projects and their subprojects.
Best of all, when you work in a consolidated project file, you have the option
to save changes you make to any subproject to that subproject’s source file.
Similarly, if you open the subproject file and make changes, Project asks
whether you want to update the consolidated project file. So, you don’t have
to face the nightmare of recording changes twice; Project tracks all the
changes for you, and Project updates the consolidated file if you want it to.
Do I need to use consolidation?
“My company uses Project Server with Project Professional. Do I need to
read this section?” you ask. Although Project Server can provide Project

Book III
Chapter 4
Linking and
Consolidating
Projects
Consolidating Projects
197
Professional users with much of the information you can get from consoli-
dating, Project Server can’t show you one critical path (the series of tasks in
your project that must happen on time for the project to meet its final dead-
line) across a consolidated project. In the section “The Critical Path in a
Consolidated Project,” later in this chapter, you see how consolidation
affects the critical path. So, even Project Professional users have a reason
to use consolidation.
In Book X, you can read about Project Server, a product used in conjunction
with Project Professional in environments that manage many projects using
the same set of resources. Project Server provides your organization with a
database in which all projects are stored. Users with the proper credentials
and a browser can use Project Web Access, a browser-based interface, to
view and work with projects stored in the Project Server database.
When you use consolidation, you also want to use resource pooling,
covered later in this chapter in the section “Sharing Resources Using a
Resource Pool,” to assign the same resources across projects and avoid
overallocations.

solidated

Consolidating Projects
198
Creating subprojects
It doesn’t really matter when, in the project schedule setup process, you
decide to use consolidation. For example, you might realize right away that
the project is too large to handle in a traditional way; in this case, start by
saving each phase of the project as a subproject file.
If you discover that consolidation would work for you after you start work-
ing on a project, no problem. Suppose, for example, that you’re working on
setting up a project plan to migrate your organization to Word 2007, and
then management decides to also migrate to Excel 2007 and Outlook 2007 at
the same time. Adding these two software packages to the upgrade process
changes the scope of the project and adds tasks and dependencies that
didn’t exist previously. In this case, you can easily break the original project
down into subprojects and create additional subprojects to accommodate
the new tasks.
If you decide to use consolidation at the outset, create separate Microsoft
Project files for various portions of the project that will serve as subprojects
when you consolidate. Set up each subproject file so that it’s independently
complete and create any necessary links within each subproject file.
If you start a project and then find that you want to use consolidation, you
can create subprojects by following these steps:
1. Save your original project file.
2. Select all the tasks that you want to save in your first subproject file
(see Figure 4-5).
Use the Show button on the Formatting toolbar to display only Outline
Level 1 headings. Then select the heading for the set of tasks you want to
save in a subproject; Project selects the heading and all of its subtasks.
3. Click the Copy button.
4. Click the New button to start a new project.
5. If necessary, click Blank Project in the New Project task pane.
Project displays the Project Information dialog box (see Figure 4-6).
If Project doesn’t automatically display the Project Information dialog
box when you start a new project, choose Project➪Project Information
to display it.
6. Establish basic information for the subproject, such as the start date
and scheduling method.

To make the Project Information dialog box appear each time you start a
new project, choose Tools➪Options, click the General tab, and select
the Prompt for Project Info for New Projects check box.

dialog box,

7. Click the Paste button.
Project pastes the information you copied from the original project into
the new Project file (see Figure 4-7).
8. Save the subproject and close it.
9. Repeat Steps 2 through 5 until you’ve saved several separate files that
contain portions of your original project.
In our example, we included the last Outline Level 1 heading, a milestone
to mark the end of the project, in our last subproject file. So, we created
five subproject files from the original file shown in Figure 4-5.
10. Close the original file.
You’re now ready to edit each subproject file that you create to make it an
independently complete project. For example, establish task durations and
dependencies and assign resources in each subproject file. Don’t worry about
connecting tasks in one subproject to another; you can use the techniques in
the following sections to consolidate the subprojects and link them together.

Creating a consolidated project
To consolidate subprojects, you insert them into another project file; being
the clever folks we are, we call that project file the consolidated project file.
Each subproject that you insert appears as a summary task in the consolidated
project file, and Project calculates inserted projects like summary tasks.
An icon in the Indicator field identifies an inserted project (see Figure 4-8).
You might notice, in Figure 4-8, that the task numbers appear a bit odd. Project
assigns the equivalent of a project number to each inserted project, with task
numbers following that run sequentially for each inserted project. So, the
summary task for the first inserted project appears on Row 1, followed by its
first task, also assigned a row number of 1. After Task 7, the last task in the
first inserted project in Figure 4-8, the summary task for the second inserted
project appears on what seems to be Row 2, but it’s actually the inserted
project’s project number. The tasks of the second inserted project follow,
beginning again with Row 1 for the first task of the second inserted project.
Figure 4-8:
You can

tify inserted

Consolidating Projects
202
To insert a project, follow these steps:
1. Start a new project or open the project you want to use as the consoli-
dated project.
2. Switch to Gantt Chart view.
3. Click in the row of the Task Name column where you want the
inserted project to begin.
When you insert a project, Project places the project immediately above
the selected row. So, if your consolidated project already contains tasks,
click the task in the Task Name column that you want to appear below
the subproject.
4. Choose Insert➪Project.
Project displays the Insert Project dialog box (see Figure 4-9).
5. Navigate to the folder that contains the project that you want to insert.
6. Highlight the file that you want to insert.
7. Click the Insert button.
Project inserts the selected file into the open project. The inserted sub-
project file appears as a summary task, and its subtasks are hidden (see
Figure 4-10).

203
When you insert a project, you have a couple of options you can set:
✦By default, a check mark appears in the Link to Project check box (refer
to Figure 4-9). When the projects are linked, Project retains all of the
information stored in the inserted file, including the information you
provided in the Project Information dialog box (the information you set
concerning how to calculate the project schedule). If you remove the
check mark, Project doesn’t connect the inserted project to its source
project. You don’t see the icon in the Indicators column, and Project
ignores the information you stored in the subproject’s Project Information
dialog box. If you make changes to the subproject while working in the
consolidated project file, Project doesn’t prompt you to update the
inserted project’s source file.
✦The Insert button has a drop-down arrow beside it. If you click that
button, you can choose either Insert or Insert Read-Only. If you choose
Insert Read-Only from the Insert drop-down menu, Project still treats the
subproject as an inserted project for purposes of calculating the project
schedule, but if you make changes to the subproject in the consolidated
file, Project doesn’t let you save the changes to the subproject file.

204
Because linking the files makes updating easy, why wouldn’t you want to link
the files? Well, you might want to create a consolidated file just so you can
generate a report quickly.
The link you create when you insert a project works like any link that you
create between two files in the Windows environment. For example, if you
rename the subproject file or move it to a different folder, the link won’t
work anymore unless you update it. To update a link, display the consoli-
dated project in Gantt Chart view and double-click the inserted project.
Project displays the Inserted Project Information dialog box for the inserted
project; this dialog box is the equivalent of the Task Information dialog box
for any task (see Figure 4-11).
In addition to using the Browse button to navigate to the new location for an
inserted project, you can unlink subprojects from their source files by
removing the check mark from the Link to Project check box.
If you attempt to expand the outline of an inserted project in a consolidated
project file and the inserted project’s location isn’t valid any longer, Project
automatically displays a dialog box that looks like the Open dialog box. Use
this dialog box to navigate to the new location of the file and click OK after
you finish. This process also re-establishes the link between the files.
Inserted projects and the outline
You can hide or show tasks of a subproject in the consolidated project file
the same way you hide or show tasks in any project file. Click the outline
symbol — the plus or minus sign next to the task name — of the inserted
project’s summary task.

205
You can insert projects at any level in the project outline, and the outline
level assigned to the inserted project depends on the level of the tasks
above and below the inserted project in the consolidated project.
A shortcut to consolidate projects
Company: Medium-sized company with more
than 75 employees.
Project: Upgrade all computers from Office
2003 to Office 2007.
Challenge: To monitor overall progress on a
project being managed by several different
managers.
In this situation, when several different people
within the organization will be managing differ-
ent phases of a large project, each manager
will want to create and manage a project
schedule for his or her phase of the project.
However, dependencies exist between phases,
so viewing the “big picture” is just as important
as managing the phases. The company wants
to be able to quickly and easily produce a con-
solidated project for analysis.
Solution: There’s a quick and easy way to con-
solidate projects, but to make sure that the sub-
projects appear in the correct order when you
consolidate, naming the subproject files
becomes important. To take advantage of this
shortcut, name your subprojects with a number
at the end that represents the order in which it
should appear when you consolidate. For
example, name the first phase Subproject1, the
second phase Subproject2, and so on.
Then use this very cool shortcut to create a
consolidated project:
1. Open all the subprojects that you want to
consolidate.
2. Choose Window➪New Window.
Project opens the New Window dialog box
shown in the figure.
3. Press and hold down Ctrl as you click
each project that you want to consolidate.
4. Click OK.
Project creates a new consolidated project that
contains the projects that you selected in the
New Window dialog box. Project inserts the
subprojects as linked files into the consolidated
project file in the order in which the subprojects
appear in the New Window dialog box, so naming
the subprojects as we describe sets the order
in which they consolidate. On this book’s Web
site, you’ll find five subproject files: Office
2007 deployment-subproject1.mpp
through Office 2007 deployment-
subproject5.mpp. Open all five subpro-
jects in any order, select some or all of them,
and see the results. And, using this approach,
any changes made to any subproject update
the consolidated project file and vice versa.

Consolidating Projects
206
When you insert a project, you select the task that you want to appear below
the inserted project. Project assigns the outline level of the inserted project
at the same level in the outline as either of the following:
✦The selected task
✦The task above the selected task
In most cases, Project inserts the project at the same outline level as the
task above the selected task. But there’s one exception (isn’t there always at
least one?): If the task above the selected task is at the same outline level
or outdented farther than the selected task, the inserted project appears in
the outline at the same level as the selected task, not the task above the
selected task.
To really get a handle on this behavior, compare Figures 4-12, 4-13, and 4-14.
In Figure 4-12, we selected the Secure Executive Sponsorship task when we
inserted Subproject2. This subproject appears at the same outline level as
the Determine Major Milestones task, the task above the selected task.
Figure 4-12:
When we
inserted
Subproject2,
we selected
the Secure

task.

207
In Figure 4-13, we collapsed the Identify Corporate Desktop Vision task,
selected the Secure Executive Sponsorship task, and then inserted
Subproject2. Although the Identify Corporate Desktop Vision task contains
indented subtasks, they’re hidden, so Project inserts the subproject at the
same level as the Identify Corporate Desktop Vision task, which is the task
above the selected task.
In Figure 4-14, we selected the Determine Project Scope task when we
inserted Subproject2. This subproject appears at the same outline level as
the Determine Project Scope task we initially selected because the task
above it is outdented farther than the selected task.
To produce a consolidated project in which the inserted projects line up
at the highest outline level, make sure that you collapse the preceding
inserted project so that you can’t see its tasks when you insert the next 
subproject.

Moving subprojects within a consolidated project
You can easily move subprojects around in the consolidated project by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Select the row of the summary task for the subproject.
2. Click the Cut tool on the Standard toolbar.
Project opens the Planning Wizard dialog box (see Figure 4-15).

3. Select the Continue option.
4. Click OK.
The summary task that represents the subproject disappears, along with
all of its subordinate tasks.
5. Select the row you want to appear below the last task of the subproject.
6. Click the Paste button on the Standard toolbar.
Project reinserts the subproject at its new location, immediately above
the row you selected in Step 5.
Dependencies in Consolidated Projects
Like tasks in any project, tasks in a consolidated project depend on other
tasks in the project. Most likely, a task within one phase of the project
depends on a task in another phase of the project. Essentially, you need to
create dependencies that reflect how you work, even if the dependencies
cross phases that you’ve divided into subprojects, which isn’t a problem.
Creating dependencies across projects
You find out about dependencies in great detail in Book IV, Chapter 3. So, in
this section, we focus on showing you how to create dependencies across
subprojects.
In Project, you can create the same four types of dependencies between 
subprojects as you can create between tasks: finish-to-start, start-to-start,
finish-to-finish, and start-to-finish. And, you can add lag or lead time to links
between subprojects, just like you can to links between tasks.
Create a consolidated project and then follow these steps to link a task
stored in one subproject to a task stored in another subproject:
1. Click Gantt Chart on the View bar.
2. Select the tasks that you want to link (see Figure 4-16).
To select noncontiguous tasks, press and hold down Ctrl as you click
each task name.
3. Click the Link Tasks button on the Standard toolbar.
Project creates a finish-to-start link line between the two tasks.
In the consolidated project, the link line between tasks across subprojects
looks just any other link line. Things look normal.

Dependencies in Consolidated Projects

But, in either of the subproject files, an external task appears. You can iden-
tify an external task because both its task name and Gantt bar are light gray
(see Figure 4-17). If you point at the bar in Gantt Chart view, Project displays
information about the task, including the fact that it is an external task. If you
double-click the task name of the external task, Project opens the subproject
to which the external task is linked.
From a subproject file, you can create an external link to another subproject
file using the Predecessors field on the Entry table of Gantt Chart view (see
Figure 4-18).

In the Predecessors field, type a path to the subproject file and ID number
of the task to which you want to link. Separate the path to the location of
the subproject file from the ID number of the task with a backslash (\).
In Figure 4-18, the Assign/Define Project Manager task, which is Task 3 
in a subproject file named Office 2007 Deployment-Subproject2.
MMP, is linked to the Envisioning Complete task, which is Task 7 in a sub-
project file called Office 2007 Deployment-Subproject1.MPP. 
You can see the complete pathname of a linked task in the Entry bar
(just below the toolbars) when you select the task’s information in the
Predecessors column.

Changing cross-project dependencies
After you link tasks across subprojects, you might need to change informa-
tion about the link. For example, you might want to add lag time or assign a
different type of dependency.
You can modify a link between tasks in different subprojects from the sub-
project or from the consolidated project using pretty much the same tech-
nique. About the only advantage to working in the subproject is that you can
change the path to the subproject.
In the consolidated project, double-click the line that links the two tasks (see
Figure 4-19). In the subproject, double-click the line that links an internal
task to the external task (see Figure 4-20). In both cases, Project displays the
Task Dependency dialog box.

As you can see, the two versions of the dialog box differ slightly. In both 
versions, you can use the Type list box to change the type of link and the
Lag box to change the amount of lag time between the linked tasks. If you
work from within the subproject, you can update the path of the link, but if
you work from within the consolidated project, you can’t update the path of
the link.
Saving a consolidated project
You don’t need to save consolidated project files unless you want them,
because you can easily re-create the consolidated project file. But, as you’d
expect, Project prompts you to save a consolidate project when you close it.
No problem; choose Yes or No as appropriate. But, because the project
you’re closing is a consolidated project, Project’s behavior changes slightly.

When you close the consolidated project, Project first asks whether you
want to save the consolidated project. Whether you save the consolidated
project doesn’t change Project’s behavior; Project next asks whether you
want to save changes that you made to inserted projects (see Figure 4-21).

The Critical Path in a Consolidated Project
215
Project treats a subproject file like any other Project file; when you close a
subproject, Project asks whether you want to save changes to the file.
Here’s a cool thing: If you save the changes to the subprojects — even if you
don’t save the consolidated project — Project saves external tasks, such as
the one that you saw previously in Figure 4-18, in the subproject files.
The Critical Path in a Consolidated Project
In a regular project, Project automatically calculates the critical path (the
series of tasks in your project that must happen on time for the project to
meet its final deadline) for the entire project using the late finish date of
the project to make calculations. And, by default, when you consolidate 
projects, Project calculates inserted projects like summary tasks and calcu-
lates the critical path by using the finish date of the consolidated project
to show you the overall critical path across all the projects. This behavior
can make subprojects look like they don’t have critical paths of their own.
In Figure 4-22, the critical path has a hatched pattern and is driven by
Subtask 7 in Subproject2.
Figure 4-22:
By default,
Project
treats
inserted
projects like
summary
tasks, and
you see only
one critical
path for the
consolidated
project.

The Critical Path in a Consolidated Project
216
But suppose that you want to see each subproject’s critical path while view-
ing the consolidated project. No problem.
Although you might be tempted to turn on the Project setting to view multi-
ple critical paths while working in the consolidated project, you probably
won’t see any change to the project. Why? Because multiple critical paths
apply only to tasks that are owned by the project, and a consolidated project
doesn’t own the tasks of the subprojects you insert — the subprojects own
those tasks.
To view the critical path of each inserted project, tell Project to stop treating
subprojects as summary tasks. If you do, Project uses the late finish dates
that the subprojects pass along to the consolidated project to determine
the critical path, and you’re likely to see each subproject’s critical path.
When you turn off this setting, you see critical paths in the consolidated
project as they appear in each subproject. In Figure 4-23, the critical path for
Subproject1 is driven by Subtask1, Subtask2, and Subtask3, and the critical
path for Subproject2 is driven by Subtask7.

Sharing Resources Using a Resource Pool
218
Sharing Resources Using a Resource Pool
If you work in an environment in which several project managers use the
same set of resources on multiple projects, a resource pool can be useful.
A resource pool is pretty much what its name implies: a set of resources
that are available to any project. When you set up a resource pool in Project,
you can open it and view resource assignments across all projects using
the pool.
The resource pooling techniques we describe in the following sections apply
more to Project Standard users than Project Professional users who also use
Project Server. Project Professional users using Project Server can use the
Enterprise Resource Pool in Project Server to accomplish the same things
that resource pooling does.
Creating a resource pool
To use resource pooling, you need a project that contains all the available
resources you intend to share. To really be effective, we suggest that you
include all available resources in the resource pool, even if you intend to
share resources across two projects and use only some of those resources.
By including all your resources in the resource pool, you eliminate the need
to create several resource pools and to keep straight which ones contain
which resources.
You create a resource pool by simply setting up the resources in a Project
file and then saving that Project file. The Project file doesn’t have to contain
tasks, but if it does, that won’t affect anything. To keep things clean and
avoid confusion, we recommend that you create a Project file that contains
only resources and no tasks. To get details on setting up resources, See
Book V, Chapter 1.
Sharing resources
If you intend to share the resources in the resource pool, don’t bother to set
up any resources in your project. Instead, connect your project to the proj-
ect file that contains the resource pool by following these steps:
1. Open the project that serves as the resource pool file.
Ours is cleverly named resource pool.mpp.
2. Open the project that will share resources.
Both projects appear on the Windows taskbar.

Book III
Chapter 4
Linking and
Consolidating
Projects
Sharing Resources Using a Resource Pool
219
3. Choose Tools➪Resource Sharing➪Share Resources.
Project displays the Share Resources dialog box (see Figure 4-25).
4. Select the Use Resources option.
5. Open the From drop-down list to select the resource pool project.
You can choose any open project when you identify the resource pool.
So, if you have any projects open besides the resource pool project and
the project that will share resources, those additional projects appear
as candidates for the resource pool project when you open the From
list box.
6. Select an option to tell Project how to handle calendar conflicts.
If you select the Pool Takes Precedence option, the Resource calendars
in the resource pool file take precedence when conflicts arise. If you
select the Sharer Takes Precedence option, the Resource calendars in
the file that’s sharing resources take precedence over the Resource cal-
endars in the resource pool file when conflicts arise.
7. Click OK.
If you switch to Resource Sheet view of the project that you just set up to
share resources, Project displays all the resources that appear in the
resource pool file. And, although those resources appear to be in your proj-
ect file, they aren’t until you actually make an assignment.
If you ignored our advice and set up resources in a project that you then
set up to share resources, the resource pool resources appear along with
any resources that you set up in your project file, which could cause some
confusion.
Figure 4-25:
Use this
dialog box
to connect
your project
to the

Sharing Resources Using a Resource Pool
220
You can now continue working in your project, or you can save your project
and close it. You can also close the resource pool file.
Opening a project
Okay, you saved and closed your file that shares resources and now you
want to open it again. You open this file the same way that you open any file,
but you might be wondering whether you need to open the resource pool file
first. The answer, in a word, is no. Instead, when you open a file that you
have set up to share resources, Project displays the Open Resource Pool
Information dialog box (see Figure 4-26).
So, which option do you choose? When you select the Open Resource Pool
to See Assignments Across All Sharer Files option, Project opens your file
and the resource pool, but the resource pool opens as a read-only file. If you
make changes that involve resources, you need to update the resource pool
to reflect the changes — you can read more about updating the resource
pool in the next section.
The “read-only” thing happens so that multiple users can work with the
resource pool file simultaneously.
If you select the Do Not Open Other Files option, Project opens only your
file. If you haven’t previously assigned resources and you check Resource
Sheet view, you don’t see any resources — remember, they are stored in the
resource pool. When Resource Sheet view is blank, you can’t make any
changes involving resources to your project.

221
When in doubt, choose the first option to open the resource pool.
Updating the resource pool
Remember, letting multiple project managers working in different projects
share a finite set of resources is the whole idea behind the resource pool.
While you’re working, if you change resource information, you need to
update the resource pool file so that others who are using the resource pool
have the most up-to-date information.
To update the resource pool, it has to be open. Choose Tools➪Resource
Sharing➪Update Resource Pool (see Figure 4-27).
“But the Update Resource Pool command isn’t available,” you say. That hap-
pens when you open your project file but you choose not to also open the
resource pool. And, you lose your changes if you save and close your file
and then reopen it along with the resource pool. So, to get around the prob-
lem, click the Open tool on the Standard toolbar to open the resource pool
file. Project then displays the dialog box you see in Figure 4-28.

Use the

mand to

changes in

while the

222
If you select the first option, Project opens the resource pool file so that you
can update it with the changes you made to your project, and others can
continue to use the resource pool. (The second and third options in the
Open Resource Pool dialog box are discussed in the next section.)
If you forget to update the resource pool after you make a change in your
project that affects the resource pool, Project displays a message, shown in
Figure 4-29, when you save your project. If you click OK, Project updates the
resource pool for you.
Viewing resource assignments 
when you share resources
If you’re sharing resources, it’s important to monitor resource allocations,
and the resource pool makes that task easy.

223
Use the Open tool on the Standard toolbar to open the resource pool file.
Project displays the Open Resource Pool dialog box shown previously in
Figure 4-28.
To get a good handle on resource assignments across projects, choose the
third option. Project opens the resource pool file and creates a consolidated
project that includes all the files that are sharing the resource pool file.
Switch to the consolidated file by using the Windows taskbar or the Window
menu in Project (see Figure 4-30). You can make updates, and other users
can work at the same time in the files that share the resource pool; other
users see updates you make as you work.
Choose View➪Resource Usage to review the resource assignments.
You might be wondering what the second option in the Open Resource Pool
dialog box does. If you want to update cost or availability information, the
second option lets you open the resource pool and make those changes.
However, others won’t be able to update the pool with new information; that

is, when they choose Tools➪Resource Sharing, the Update Resource Pool
command you saw in Figure 4-27 isn’t available until you close the resource
pool. If Project prompts you to save any of the files that share the resource
pool, save them.
Stop sharing resources
You don’t have to continue to use the resource pool after you connect a proj-
ect file to it. You can disable the resource pool for your project if you follow
these steps:
1. Open the project that you want to disconnect from the resource pool.
When prompted, you can open the resource pool or not — it doesn’t
matter.
2. Choose Tools➪Resource Sharing➪Share Resources.
Project displays the Share Resources dialog box (see Figure 4-31).
3. Select the Use Own Resources option.
Project displays a message, asking you to confirm that you want your
project to now use its own resources instead of the resource pool.
4. Click Yes.
Project redisplays the Share Resources dialog box.
5. Click OK.
Project closes the Share Resources dialog box and your project now
must use its own resources.
Do you want to disable the resource pool in general? No problem. You don’t
need to open each file and disable resource sharing. Follow these steps to
disable the resource pool file:

1. Click the Open tool on the Standard toolbar and open the resource
pool file the same way that you would open any file.
Project displays the Open Resource Pool box (refer to Figure 4-28).
2. Choose either the middle option or the last option.
Either option works because both options open the resource pool as a
read-write file.
3. Choose Tools➪Resource Sharing➪Share Resources.
Project displays the Share Resources dialog box (see Figure 4-32).
4. Select the project(s) that you want to exclude from the resource pool.
Press and hold Ctrl as you click to select multiple noncontiguous proj-
ects or press and hold Shift as you click the first and last projects to
select contiguous projects.
If you choose to break the links of all files to the resource pool
and other project managers use the pool, you could become a very
unpopular person. Make sure you select files for which you have
responsibility.
5. Click the Break Link button.

projects you selected from the resource pool.

 Understanding what drives timing

 Understanding the nature of backward scheduling
 Saving time
A
fter you have created tasks, given them durations, added dependen-
cies, and designated any constraints, you have effectively set up the
timing for your project. At this point, it’s important to take a look at the
timing information Project is returning to you and what it means for your
project’s overall schedule.
In this chapter, we sit back and take a look at timing, review what drives
timing, and look at the options available for scheduling.
Understanding What Drives Timing
Consider the way your typical day goes. The timing of all the tasks you per-
form, all the errands you run, and all the work you get done is affected by a
number of factors. It’s not just the times you set up to get to work, run to a
doctor’s appointment, or have dinner that drives your day’s timing. Your
schedule is also affected by whether your partner showed up to help you
prepare dinner, whether your co-worker finished the draft of the report you
were supposed to finalize, and whether you got a late start because your
alarm clock didn’t go off.
The timing of tasks in a Project plan also isn’t determined by a single factor,
but by a combination of factors.
Timing factors
Timing of tasks in a Project schedule might be influenced by several things,
including
✦A task duration you specify (for example, 3 days)
✦The start or finish date of the project

Understanding What Drives Timing
230
✦Dependencies with other tasks that must be started or completed before
this task can begin or finish (see Figure 1-1)
✦Constraints that you have set such as starting on a certain date or finish-
ing no sooner than a certain date
✦Resource availability, especially if you have turned on the Resource
Leveling feature
✦Project, Task, and Resource calendars
One other point you should understand is that Project assigns weight to the
various timing influences in a complex calculation to set final task timing. So,
for example, a constraint that a task must start on a certain date takes prece-
dence over dependencies with other tasks. A Resource calendar takes prece-
dence over the project calendar in determining when a task can take place.
You have some control over the rules of precedence that Project follows. For
example, you can make task dependencies override the more inflexible con-
straints that you have set for tasks. In the Tools menu, click Options, and
then click the Schedule tab. In the Scheduling options section, deselect the
Tasks Will Always Honor Their Constraint Dates check box.

You can see

ships among

Book IV
Chapter 1
Looking at Timing
Scheduling Backwards or Forwards
231
You can also cause Project to ignore Resource calendars by selecting the
Ignore Resource Calendars setting on the Advanced tab of a task information
dialog box.
Your first look at your project’s timing
If you’ve left the start date for your project at the default, it stays set at
the current day (whatever date it was when you first created your project).
We suggest you leave this setting (which you find in the Project Information
dialog box) alone while entering the details of your project plan. When you’ve
made all the settings for your tasks, you can see how long completing your
project will take either by looking at a project summary task which summa-
rizes all the timing of your tasks in one line item, or by looking at the start
date of the first task and finish date of the last task.
You can read more about creating a project summary task in Book V, Chapter 4.
If, for example, your project is starting today and today is March 1, and your
overall project duration is six months, you can figure that if you started
today you would be done around August 31, depending somewhat on holi-
days, working days, and so on. If you then calculate that the work on the
project won’t actually start till you get your plan approved and get funding,
which could take about a month, you can figure that you’ll actually get done
closer to the end of September.
At this point, you can really begin to see whether your schedule is going to
fit your timing needs. You can start to play around with setting different start
dates (see the next section for more about this process) or tweaking any of
the timing factors in the previous list to try to shorten your schedule to
meet a more aggressive deadline (see Book VII, Chapters 3 and 4 for more
about the process of finalizing your schedule).
Project 2007 has a feature called Task Drivers. This feature allows you to
open a pane that displays all the drivers for a selected task. Book VII,
Chapter 2 goes into detail about using task drivers.
Scheduling Backwards or Forwards
When you’re content that your project plan is complete and you’re ready to
begin work, that’s the moment when you freeze your plan in time by setting
either a start date or a finish date, which is dealt with in Book VII. For now,
it’s important that you understand how Project schedules tasks so you can
understand the timing information it shows you.

Scheduling Backwards or Forwards
232
How scheduling works
One reason using Project is a lot handier than entering tasks on your calen-
dar or to-do list is that Project works with your built-in scheduling logic to
make your plan flexible. So, if you change your project start date or add a
new task, Project automatically adjusts your schedule. That’s why you should
avoid putting in specific constraints on tasks, but instead let them start as
soon as possible. If you set a specific date and things change, you just have
to manually change all those set dates, just as you had to do when you
worked with a calendar program.
In most cases, people schedule from the beginning of a project so that all the
task timing flows from the beginning date of the schedule. After you build all
your tasks, Project in effect tells you when the project will finish, based on
your start date.
However, in some cases, the finish date is such a driving factor (think of a
project such as planning an event for the opening day of fishing season) that
scheduling from the finish makes the most sense. Scheduling from the finish
is one way to let Project tell you when you have to start to get things done
by a certain date.
Here are the three settings in the Project Information dialog box (see Figure 1-2)
that you need to understand regarding scheduling:
✦Set the start date for the project. When you set the start date for your
project, the first task in the project (assuming it’s set at the default con-
straint of as soon as possible) starts on that date, with all subsequent
task timing being driven by all the timing factors Project takes into
account. Project automatically recalculates all dates when you select
this setting.
✦Set the finish date for the project. You can set the finish date. This option
is especially handy if you have a drop-dead date beyond which the proj-
ect cannot wander and still reach completion. In such a case, be sure to
look at the next setting in this list — and change it accordingly.
✦Schedule from the start or finish of the project. If you change this 
setting to Project Finish Date, the Finish Date field becomes available.
All tasks occur by default as late as possible in the schedule. This is
sometimes referred to as backward scheduling of backward estimating.
Figure 1-2:
The Project
Information
dialog box.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Looking at Timing
Scheduling Backwards or Forwards
233
A word of warning about backward scheduling
If you leave the default setting in the Project Information dialog box to sched-
ule from the start date, all tasks you create have the As Soon As Possible
(ASAP) constraint. If you change this setting to schedule from the finish date,
all tasks you create have the As Late As Possible (ALAP) constraint applied.
Here’s where this gets tricky. If you don’t change this setting at the outset,
create your schedule, and then change to the Schedule from Finish of Project
setting, tasks you already created stay set at ASAP and tasks you create sub-
sequent to changing the setting are created with the ALAP setting.
This situation causes ASAP tasks to start only when you enter an actual start
date, which can cause some unnecessary down times (or slack) in your
schedule. For that reason, you must modify this one setting before you even
begin to enter information for your project. However, you can wait to set the
actual start or finish date till your project planning is complete.
If you find out after the fact that you have to use backward scheduling, you
have to go in and change the ASAP setting on tasks manually. However, you
can display the Constraint Type column in any Gantt Chart view table (see
Figure 1-3) to speed up your changes, or you can even create a macro to go
down this column changing all settings in sequence. See Book IX, Chapter 3
for more about using macros.

Surviving Schedule Shock
234
Surviving Schedule Shock
Most people panic when they first see the length of the schedule they’ve 
created in Project. But take a step back for a moment. If you have entered
correct information about your tasks, dependencies, and resources, what
Project tells you should be realistic, if a bit frightening.
The first thing you should do upon seeing the total duration of your sched-
ule is go back and make sure you were accurate in the information you gave
Project. Check dependencies and constraints to see whether they’re really
logical. Is Resource Leveling on and therefore pushing tasks out to accom-
modate resource schedules? (See Figure 1-4 and 1-5, which show the total
duration of a project with Resource Leveling turned on and turned off.) Did
you move a task in your schedule in such a way that a former dependency
no longer makes sense?
A timing case study
Company: A large Canadian pharmaceutical
company.
Project: Direct marketing campaign for a new
drug launch.
Challenge: Make sure that the launch of the
marketing campaign happens as soon as the
drug has been approved for sale.
This project involves the creation and delivery
of e-mail, regular mail, and telemarketing cam-
paigns to educate doctors about the release of
a new drug product for the treatment of hyper-
tension.
The key to the timing of this large direct-mar-
keting campaign is the final approval of the drug
by the Canadian government. The project man-
ager wants to ensure that much of the work is
done so she can move quickly on the final push.
The following factors need to be considered
here:
 It is probably logical to schedule this proj-
ect from the start, because the finish date
is not set yet and won’t be set until later in
the project when the drug is approved.
 Tasks should therefore, for the most part,
use the ASAP constraint.
 The task of actually launching the cam-
paign should have a dependency such that
it cannot start until an approval task is 
complete.
 The project manager has to judge how
much time, effort, and money should be put
in before the company is absolutely sure
the drug will be approved. He might there-
fore build in checkpoints at the end of each
phase to get formal internal approval for

See Book VII for more about Resource Leveling and how it affects your

It’s part of your role as project manager to take that second swing at your
schedule to make it more realistic and still fit your needs. In Book VII, we go
into the various techniques you can use to resolve problems in your sched-
ule and tighten up that timing.
Solution: One tactic the project manager could
use is to break up the project into two parts, the
first one including all the tasks that can be per-
formed before the launch, and the second part
including the tasks that are part of the launch,
as shown in this figure. That way, she won’t
delay the first part of the project because of
constraints or dependencies in the second. She
can also anticipate how long from the approval
it will take to complete the launch by looking at
the duration of that second project. As soon as
the launch is approved, she can set the start
date of that second project and get going.

T
he timing of tasks is at the heart of all projects. Task timing in Microsoft
Project is driven by a combination of factors, which is what this entire
minibook is about. In this chapter, we explore some of the basic settings you
can make when creating tasks that have an effect on timing.
First, you choose a task type that specifies what affects a task’s timing, such
as whether the task has a fixed duration or a duration that changes based
on how much work has been accomplished. You can enter a duration for
each task, which is simply the length of time you think it will take to com-
plete the task. You can also enter a start date or finish date, or you can even
insert a pause in the middle of the task. Finally, the Effort Driven setting has
to do with how the work performed on a task affects its timing.
Be sure to also take a look at Book II, Chapter 4 to brush up on Project,
Resource, and Task calendars. See Chapters 3 and 4 in this minibook to 
discover how dependencies and task constraints further determine the
timing of tasks.
Finding Just the Right Task Type
When you perform a task, the time it takes to complete it might be a set time
(for example, when you take a test in school, it might end in 30 minutes
whether you’re done or not), or the task might not finish until all the work
is done. What constitutes a finished task varies slightly depending on the
task type.

Finding Just the Right Task Type
238
The big three: Task types
Task types define the relationship that balances a task’s duration, the work
required to complete the task, and resource availability. This is known as the
golden triangle.
Before you begin to enter task durations, you need to be aware of the three
task types. These types have an effect on how Project schedules the work of
a task.
Essentially, your choice of task type determines which element of the task
doesn’t vary when you make changes to the task:
✦Fixed Units: This is the default task type. With this task type, when you
assign resources to a task with a certain number of units (hours of work
expressed as a percentage of the working day), the resources’ assign-
ments don’t change even if you change the duration of the task and the
work amount.
✦Fixed Duration: This task type takes a set amount of time to complete,
no matter how many resources you add to the mix. For example, a test
on a substance that requires that you leave the test running for 24 hours
has a fixed duration even if you add 20 scientists to oversee the test.
✦Fixed Work: The number of resource hours assigned to the task deter-
mines its length. If you set the duration of a Fixed Work task at 40 hours,
for example, and you assign two resources to work 20 hours each (simul-
taneously) at units of 100 percent, the task will be completed in 20 hours.
If you take away one of those resources, the single resource must put in
40 hours at units of 100 percent to complete the task. Understanding
how the choice of task type causes your task timing or resource assign-
ments to fluctuate is an important part of creating an efficient project.
Be sure to review Book V, Chapter 3 for information about assigning
resources to tasks to get the full picture of how resource assignments can
affect task length.
Specifying task type
After you figure out what type of task you’re dealing with, setting the task
type is simple to do through the Task Information dialog box.
Follow these steps to set the task type:

Book IV
Chapter 2

239
1. Double-click a task.
The Task Information dialog box appears.
2. Click the Advanced tab, if necessary, to display it (see Figure 2-1).
3. Choose one of the three choices from the Task Type list (see the list of
choices in the preceding section).
4. Click OK.
You can also display the Type column in a Gantt Chart sheet and make this
setting there.
Task types in practice
Your selection of task type — in combination with a setting that determines
whether a task is effort driven, which is covered at the end of this chapter —
has an effect on the timing of your tasks relative to your resource assignments.
Essentially, task types control what remains constant in a task when you add
or remove work resources to it after making the initial resource assignment.
Although this whole work and duration and resource assignment percentage
calculation can be complicated, you need to understand it if you want
Project to accurately determine task durations in your plan according to
resource assignments.
Figure 2-1:
Set the task
type here.

Finding Just the Right Task Type
240
Here’s what happens when you’re working with different task types in your
project:
✦The default task type is fixed units. With a fixed-units task, the task
duration you enter and the resource effort (work) assigned to that task
jointly determine the timing of the task. With this task type, the assign-
ment units you specify for your resources don’t change even if the
number of hours required to complete the task shrinks or grows.
With a fixed-units task, if you increase the duration of Task A from two to
three days, your resources will continue to work on it at the assigned
units for the specified duration; Project increases the Work amount
accordingly. When you add or take away resources, Project changes the
task duration accordingly, based on the assignment units you specify.
✦The fixed-work task type takes a specified number of work units to
be completed. A one-day task requires eight hours to be completed
(assuming a Standard calendar). This type of task changes its duration
in response to the number of resource units you assign.
With a fixed-work task, resource assignments may change in response to
a work change. For example, suppose Task A takes four days to complete
when one person is assigned; with a fixed-work task, the same task takes
only two days when two people are assigned. Project doesn’t modify the
hours of work required to complete the task, but it does modify resource
assignment units to complete that work within the specified timeframe.
Thus, if you up the duration of Task A, resource assignment units shrink
in response. If you reduce the time to complete Task A, resource assign-
ments increase to complete the unchanged amount of work hours in
less time.
✦A fixed-duration task doesn’t vary its length, no matter what resource
assignments you make. Suppose that Task A takes four days. If you
assign additional resources or remove resources, the task still takes four
days, but the resource-assignment units will change.
Figure 2-2 shows the same task with the three different types specified. Each
task was created with a four-day duration and one resource at 100 percent.
Then an additional resource was added at 100 percent. Note the resulting
change — or lack of change — with each type. The fixed-duration task
didn’t change duration but did reduce resource assignments. The fixed-units
task kept resource assignments constant at 100 percent — but reduced the
task duration. The fixed-work task was accomplished faster, and the work
(32 hours) stayed constant.

Setting Task Duration
241
Setting Task Duration
Project can produce some wonderful calculations and reports, but it can’t
tell you how long each task in your project will take. That’s up to each proj-
ect manager to figure out.
Estimating the duration of tasks isn’t a science. A task’s duration is usually
based on your experience with similar tasks and your knowledge of the
specifics of your project.
If you often do projects with similar tasks, consider saving a copy of your
schedule as a template that you can use in the future. Using this template
will save you the effort of re-estimating durations every time you start a sim-
ilar project. Find out about working with templates in Book II, Chapter 1.
Determining the right duration
Most tasks in a project have a duration, whether it’s ten minutes or ten months
or anything in between. (For milestone tasks, which have no duration, see
the next section.)

Setting Task Duration
242
Deciding how finely to break down your tasks can affect how efficiently you’re
able to track progress on those tasks: Tasks that linger over an entire year are
probably too broad, and a schedule full of tasks that take ten minutes each
will force you to track progress 24 hours a day just to keep up with them.
For example, if your project is to run a half-day event, getting to the level of
ten-minute tasks might make sense, although more from a planning perspec-
tive than a tracking perspective. In most projects, however, such finely
detailed timing doesn’t make sense because it defeats the point of all the
tracking and reporting features of Project.
On the flip side, creating a 12-month-long task suggests that you might be
defining your project too broadly to accurately keep track of all that can
happen in a year. How do you track your progress every week, in a meaning-
ful way, on a task that will take 12 months to complete? Is the task 1.5 percent
complete in the first week, and how useful is that information? Consider
breaking up tasks that linger longer than a few weeks into smaller tasks.
The Project Management Institute provides a suggestion that task durations
range from 4 to 80 hours, as a rule of thumb.
Entering duration
Whatever your best guess at a task’s duration is, Project makes it easy to
add it to your task. As with all task information, you can enter a duration in a
Gantt Chart sheet or in the Task Information dialog box.
Follow these steps to enter a duration by using the Task Information
dialog box:
1. Double-click a task to display the Task Information dialog box.
2. If necessary, click the General tab to display it (refer to Figure 2-1).
3. In the Duration box, use the spinner arrows to increase or decrease
the duration.
4. If the current duration units aren’t appropriate (for example, days
when you want hours), type a new duration in the Duration box.
New tasks are created with an estimated duration of one day unless you
change the duration. You can use the following abbreviations for various
time units:
• m: Minutes
• h: Hours

Book IV
Chapter 2
Defining What
Drives Task Timing
Setting Task Duration
243
• d: Days
• w: Weeks
• mo: Months
Don’t assume that changing the start and finish dates of a task changes
its duration, because it doesn’t. You have to manually change the dura-
tion; if you don’t, your project plan won’t be what you intend it to be.
5. Click OK to accept the duration setting.
If you’re not sure about the timing of a particular task and want to let people
know the duration is just a guess, or if you need a way to search for such
tasks and enter more solid timing when you have better information, select
the Estimated check box on the General tab of the Task Information dialog
box. Then apply a filter for tasks with estimated durations (see Book VII,
Chapter 1 for more about using filters). Tasks for which you have not set any
duration will be considered estimated by default and you will see a question
mark by their durations in the Duration field.
Working with tasks with no duration: Milestones
We mention in the preceding section that almost all tasks have durations;
the exception is a milestone — a task with no duration. Milestones are per-
haps less like tasks than they are like signposts that mark moments in time.
Examples of milestones are the approval of a new product design (although
the deliberations to make that decision might have taken months) and the
completion of a network installation.
What does priority do to timing?
One other tool on the General tab of the Task
Information dialog box is the Priority field. You
might think establishing task priority might have
an impact on timing, but think again.
Setting a high or low priority on your task doesn’t
influence timing of the task at all. In fact, this
field is essentially there to help you enter your
own ranking of the importance of tasks in your
project. You can use that ranking to filter tasks
by priority or to display a priority column in a
view with a sheet area so you can scan tasks
that have high importance and stay abreast of
major shifts in your schedule. Though not part
of the timing calculation Project uses, it can be
a useful tool for flagging your own priorities in
a project.
You can use the Priority field either in the Task
Information dialog box or in a column on a
sheet pane to set a priority from 0 (lowest) to
1000 (highest).

Setting Task Duration
244
Some people include tasks such as Design Complete or Testing Complete at
the end of each phase of their projects. They can then create timing relation-
ships to the moment of completion (for example, allowing production of a
drug to proceed after the testing and approval is complete). Such milestones
also alert you and your team members to a moment of progress in your proj-
ect that can help to keep the team motivated.
New tasks are created with an estimated duration of one day unless you
enter a duration. To create a milestone, you indicate that the task has zero
duration. The quickest way to do that is to simply type 0 in the Duration
column in Gantt Chart view. Or, you can perform these steps:
1. Double-click a task to open the Task Information dialog box.
2. Click the Advanced tab.
3. Set the Duration to 0.
Project marks the Mark Task as Milestone check box.
4. Click OK.
When you return to Gantt Chart view, the milestone is designated with a
black diamond shape rather than a taskbar.
They keep showing up: Recurring tasks
Some tasks occur again and again in projects. For example, attending a
monthly project debriefing or generating a quarterly project report is con-
sidered a recurring task.
No one wants to create all the tasks for the monthly debriefing in a project
that will take a year to complete. Instead, you can designate the recurrence,
and Project automatically creates the 12 tasks for you.
Here’s how you create a recurring task:
1. Choose Insert➪Recurring Task.
The Recurring Task Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-3.
2. In the Task Name box, type a name for the task.
3. In the Duration box, click the spinner arrows to set a duration or type
a duration, such as 10d for 10 days.
You can read about the abbreviations you can use for units of duration —
such as d for days — in the earlier section, “Setting Task Duration.”

245
4. Select a recurrence pattern by selecting the Daily, Weekly, Monthly,
or Yearly option.
What you select here provides different options for the rest of the recur-
rence pattern.
5. Depending on the selections offered to you, make choices for the rest
of the pattern.
For example, if you select the Weekly option, you must choose a Recur
Every X Week(s) On setting, and then choose one or more days such as
Wednesday and Friday. Or, if you select Monthly, you must specify which
day of every month the task will recur.
6. In the Range of Recurrence area, type a date in the Start box. Then
select and fill in either the End After or End By option.
For example, you might start on January 1 and end after 12 occurrences
to create a task that occurs every month for a year.
7. Click OK to save the recurring task.
If your settings cause a task to fall on a nonworking day (for example, if you
choose to meet on the eighth day of every month and the eighth day is a
Sunday in one of those months), a dialog box appears, asking you how to
handle this situation. You can choose not to create the task, or you can let
Project adjust the task to fall on the next working day in that period.
When you’re ready to assign resources to a recurring task, you have to
assign them to each incidence of the recurring task in Gantt Chart view; the
Recurring Task Information dialog box doesn’t have a Resources tab.

Starting and Pausing Tasks
246
Starting and Pausing Tasks
When most people start using Project, one of the first things they try to do is
enter a start date for every task in their project. This is largely a matter of
habit: You always include dates when you write up a to-do list, right?
The problem is that setting every task in your project in stone from the get-go
means you’re missing out on one of the great strengths of project management
software: the capability to schedule tasks for you according to sometimes-
complex combinations of factors, such as dependencies between tasks and
task constraints. When you allow Project to determine the start date of a
task, you enable it to give you a realistic picture of your project’s schedule.
You also allow it to make adjustments automatically when changes occur.
To retain this flexibility, enter a task duration and don’t enter a start date for
the task. That task will then start by default as soon as possible after the
project start date you set in the Project Information dialog box, based on any
dependencies you set up between tasks.
In general, you establish a task’s start date with dependencies (which you
hear more about in the next chapter). You look for something in the project
that would dictate its timing; for example, if you don’t want construction to
begin until you obtain permits, set a dependency between the permits task
and the construction task in such a way that construction can’t start before
the permit task ends.
Certain tasks, however, must start on a specific date. Examples are a holiday
sale, an annual meeting, or the start of the baseball season.
Project sets the finish date of a task based on when that task starts as well
as the task duration. If a task must finish on a certain date, however, you can
set a finish date and let Project determine the start date.
Entering the task start date
Setting a start date or a finish date for a task applies a kind of “soft” con-
straint on it that can override dependency relationships or other timing fac-
tors. A Must Start/Finish On task constraint, discussed in Chapter 4 of this
minibook, is the way to force a task to start or end on a certain day. In many
cases you do not have to set a start or finish date at all because the project
start date and task dependencies will set the logical timing of the task for
you. If you determine, however, that a particular task must begin or end on a
set date no matter what, you can enter a specific start or finish date.

Book IV
Chapter 2

Drives Task Timing

Setting the start or finish date is simple. To enter a start or finish date for a
task, simply follow these steps:
1. Double-click a task.
The Task Information dialog box appears.
2. Click the General tab if it’s not already displayed; refer to Figure 2-1.
3. Click the arrow on the Start or Finish box.
A calendar appears.
4. Click a date to select it or click the forward or backward arrow to
move to a different month and select a date.
If the current date is the date you want, use the shortcut of clicking the
Today button on the drop-down calendar.
5. Click OK.
Note that setting a start date isn’t quite as strong a factor in how Project
determines timing as applying the Must Start On constraint. You can find out
more about how constraints work in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
Taking a break: Splitting tasks
Did you ever start something — building that garden shed, for example —
and find that you just had to drop everything before you were done and go
do something else?
It’s the same in projects. Sometimes tasks start, and then you have to put
them on hold until they can start again later (for example, if you experience
a work shutdown due to labor negotiations). Or, perhaps you can anticipate
a delay in the course of a task and want to structure it that way when you
create it. In that case, you can use Project’s Split Task feature to split a task
so that a second or third portion starts at a later date, with no activity in
between. You can place as many splits in a task as you like.
Follow these steps to split a task:
1. Click the Split Task button on the Standard toolbar (it looks like a
little taskbar with a jagged cut down the middle).
A box appears, as shown in Figure 2-4. The box provides a readout to
guide you as you set the start date for the continuation of the task.

Starting and Pausing Tasks
248
2. Click the task at the date where you want to split the task and then
drag until the box contains the date on which you want the task to
begin again.
3. Release the mouse button.
The task is split.
You can rejoin a split task by placing your cursor over the taskbar until the
move cursor appears. Then click the split taskbar and drag it back to join
with the other portion of the taskbar. If you need to, zoom out to make it
easier for you to maneuver the pieces of the taskbar.
Don’t use the split-task approach to put an artificial hold on a task until
some other task is complete. Suppose that you start testing a product but
then have to wait for final approval before finalizing the test results. In that
case, you should create a Testing task, a Final Approval milestone, and a
Finalize Test Results task, and then you must create dependency relation-
ships among them. That way, if one task runs late, your final task shifts along
with it instead of being set in stone (as a split task is).

Chapter 2
Defining What
Drives Task Timing
Understanding Effort-Driven Tasks
249
Understanding Effort-Driven Tasks
Project’s complex calculation of work, task duration, and assignment units
involves not only task types and task durations, but also the Effort Driven
setting. This setting, which is on by default when you create a new task,
relates to the impact that work done on a task has on task durations.
How effort-driven tasks work
When you hear the word effort in Project, you can equate it with work. When
you create a task, by default it is effort driven, which means that if you adjust
resource assignments, the duration might change, but the number of hours
of effort (work) you need to put in to complete the task stays the same.
When you add or delete a resource on an effort-driven task, work is spread
around equally among resources.
With the Effort Driven setting active, if you add resources to a task, Project
distributes the specified work equally among them and might change the task
duration according to the total resource effort, depending on the task type.
Suppose that you have a two-day task to install modular furniture in a new
office. With one resource assigned to the task, working 8 hours a day, it
will take 16 hours to complete the work (two 8-hour days). If you assign a
second resource, the task no longer takes two days because the hours of
effort required will be completed more quickly by the two people working
simultaneously — in this case, in one 8-hour period.
An example of a task that isn’t effort driven is attending a three-day workshop.
No matter how many people attend or how many people are present, the
workshop still takes three days to complete. With the Effort Driven setting
turned off on a task, no matter how much effort your resources put in, the
task won’t be completed sooner.
When effort rules timing
With all three task types, by default Project makes each task effort driven.
You can turn off the Effort Driven setting if you choose the fixed-duration or
fixed-units task type. With the fixed-work task type selected, the Effort Driven
setting isn’t only turned on automatically, but in fact it can’t be turned off.
Follow these steps to change the settings for an effort-driven task:
1. Double-click a task.
The Task Information dialog box appears.

2. Click the Advanced tab, as shown in Figure 2-5.
3. To turn off the Effort Driven setting, select the Effort Driven check
box to remove the check mark.
The Effort Driven setting is on by default.
4. Click OK to save the new setting.
If you want to see the effect an Effort Driven setting makes on the timing of
your task, display a Gantt chart and add an Effort Driven column in the table.
Change the setting and view how start/finish dates and the taskbar length

I
f you create 100 tasks and don’t change their default settings, they all
start as soon as possible after the project start date. In the absence of
timing relationships, called dependencies, all those tasks not only start on
the project start date, but they occur simultaneously. That means that a
project consisting of 100 tasks takes exactly as long to complete as the
longest task.
Of course, that’s not a very realistic scenario for a project. Typically, tasks
don’t happen at the same time. It might be impossible for certain activities to
happen before others are complete, or you might not have the resources to
perform two tasks at once. For that reason, you have to incorporate timing
relationships that spread those tasks out through the life of your project.
Why Dependencies Are Needed
The reality is that tasks in a project can’t all start at the same time. To reflect
that reality in a Project plan, you have to build in a timing logic. You build that
logic into your plan by setting dependency links between tasks. Dependencies
are timing relationships between tasks (for example, when one task can’t start
before you complete another, or one task can’t end before another task ends).
Dependencies can be driven by
✦The nature of the tasks: You can’t mail a brochure, for example, until
it’s printed.
✦A lack of available resources: Your CEO can’t give new product launch
keynote speeches in two cities simultaneously.

Understanding Dependencies
252
Understanding Dependencies
In Chapter 2 of this minibook, we tell you that you shouldn’t set task start
dates very often because projects are fluid — that is, they change and grow —
and if you set every date in stone, those dates have to be manually adjusted
if a change occurs. If, instead, you build in timing logic rather than assign
specific dates, Project can reflect changes by adjusting your project auto-
matically based on that logic.
With the right dependencies in place in Project, if the Receipt of Training
Materials task is delayed by a week, for example, the dependent task of Start
Training moves out a week automatically. When you note a change in the
timing of one task while you’re tracking activity in your plan, Project makes
adjustments accordingly.
The alternative to building in dependencies is to go in and manually change
the start date of just about every task in your schedule every time a task runs
late. Given the way things change in a typical project, not using dependencies
will leave you with many late nights at the office and a disaster in the making.
Identifying the players in a dependency relationship
A task in a dependency relationship is either a predecessor or a successor.
You might think the predecessor comes first and the successor follows, and
that is usually true. However, two tasks with a timing relationship will be a
predecessor-successor pair, even if the timing of the two tasks overlaps or
they’re set to happen concurrently.
Figure 3-1 shows you how the taskbars in Gantt Chart view graphically
depict the predecessors and successors in dependency relationships.
Notice how taskbars fall before or after another task in the relationship or
when a task starts during the life of another task. Also notice the lines drawn
between tasks: These lines indicate dependency links.
Generally speaking, you set dependencies between one task and another but
not between a task and a summary task. If you set a dependency to a sum-
mary task and the specific action that had to be complete before your task
could start finishes early, you may introduce unneeded delay in your schedule.
When to set a dependency and when 
to leave well enough alone
We want to offer one very important piece of advice about dependencies:
You can have more than one dependency link to a task, but don’t overthink
this. Many people who are new to Project make the mistake of building every

Book IV

Adding
Dependencies

253
logical timing relationship that could exist. If your project timing changes or
the dependencies have to be modified (for example, to shorten a schedule),
you’re stuck with changing the huge web of dependencies, which can easily
get out of hand.
For example, say that you have to complete the tasks of designing and printing
a brochure before you can mail it. You could set up a dependency between
designing and mailing, designing and printing, and printing and mailing, but
why bother? If you set up a dependency between designing and printing, set
a dependency between printing and mailing that ensures that you can’t mail
the brochure before it’s designed.
If you use a dependency to delay a task and then change the resources
assigned to the task, you’ve built in a false delay. There is another and 
perhaps better method than dependencies to prevent resources from 
working on two tasks simultaneously: You can set the availability for
resources and assign them to tasks. You can then use tools such as Resource
Leveling, which forces one task to be delayed if there are resource conflicts.
See Book VII, Chapter 2 for more about how resource conflicts affect task
timing.

Understanding Dependencies
254
All types of dependencies
You can establish four types of dependency links: finish-to-start, start-to-
finish, start-to-start, and finish-to-finish. Using these types efficiently can
help you to build a tightly structured timing logic into your schedule that
can help keep your project moving along.
In Book IV, Chapter 4 we cover task constraints. These settings and task pri-
orities work in concert with dependencies to determine the ultimate timing
of tasks in your project.
Here are the four dependency types:
✦Finish-to-start: A finish-to-start dependency is the most common type
of dependency link. In this relationship, the predecessor task must be
completed before the successor task can start. When you create a
dependency, the default setting is finish-to-start.
An example of a finish-to-start dependency is when you must complete
the Write Annual Report task before you can begin the Send Out Annual
Report task. Figure 3-2 shows two tasks with the finish-to-start relation-
ship indicated by a successor taskbar that starts where the predecessor
taskbar leaves off. When one task ends, the other begins.

to-start

✦Start-to-finish: In a start-to-finish dependency, the successor task can
finish only after the predecessor task has started. If the predecessor
task is delayed, the successor task can’t finish.
Suppose that you’re planning the opening of a new theater building.
You might start selling tickets for the theater’s first production while
the building is being built, and you don’t want to stop selling tickets
until opening night. So, the predecessor task is Theater Building Complete
(a milestone or task of no duration), and the successor task is Sell Tickets
for Opening Night. If the theater isn’t ready on time, you can keep selling
tickets. When the theater is ready to go, the ticket windows close, and
that task can finish. Break a leg!
✦Start-to-start: Start-to-start means what it says: Two tasks exist in a 
parallel relationship and therefore start simultaneously. For example,
even though posters and invitations for your blockbuster event are
being created by different designers, you might want to ensure that you
send the posters and invitations to the printer at the same time for cost
efficiency.
Figure 3-3 shows the start-to-start relationship between the two tasks.

to-start

✦Finish-to-finish: Finish-to-finish means that (you guessed it) two tasks
must finish at the same time.
Suppose that you’re preparing an advertisement for your adventure-travel
company. You have to obtain photographs of travel destinations and
have the ad copy laid out. You need both items in hand before you can
forward the ad to travel magazines. If you set a finish-to-finish depend-
ency between these two tasks, you allow both tasks the greatest length
of time to be completed. (Why have the photos been sitting around for
four weeks, for example, when the copy isn’t ready?) However, keep in
mind that if one task finishes late, they both finish late.
More complex dependencies: Lag and lead time
Dependencies can be more complex than simply establishing the four types
of dependency links we describe in the preceding section. You can use lag
time or lead time to fine-tune your timing relationships in the following ways:
✦Lag time occurs when you add time to the start or finish of a predeces-
sor task; lag time causes a gap in timing.
✦Lead time is created when you subtract time from the start or finish of
the predecessor task; lead time causes an overlap between two tasks.
You might use lag time to reflect that a task such as Run Focus Group might
have to wait a week or two after you distribute sample materials to the
group members so that they have time to study them. On the other hand,
you could use lead time to allow one task to begin part way through another
task. For example, you could begin to train people on new equipment when
only half of the new pieces of equipment have been received.
See the Case Study at the end of this chapter for a study of the use of lag and
lead time in a sample project.
Setting Dependencies
Establishing dependency relationships is easy to do. You simply create a
dependency, make settings to select the dependency type, and build in any
lag or lead time.
What’s more complex is understanding how each type of dependency affects
your plan when your project starts and you begin to record actual activity
that resources perform on individual tasks.
This section provides guidance on establishing dependencies and under-
standing more about how they function in a real-world project.

Setting up dependency links
When you create a dependency, by default, it’s a finish-to-start relationship:
One task must finish before another can start. If your situation calls for that
kind of simple scenario, you can set a dependency between two tasks by
using a simple click-and-drag method, and you’re done.
To establish a simple finish-to-start link, follow these steps:
1. Display Gantt Chart view and make sure that the two tasks you want
to link are visible.
You might have to collapse some tasks in your project or use the Zoom
command on the View menu to fit more tasks on your screen.
2. Move your cursor over a taskbar until it changes to a four-headed arrow.
3. Click the predecessor taskbar and drag your cursor to the successor
taskbar.
As you drag, a box appears, as shown in Figure 3-4, and your cursor
changes to the shape of a little chain link.
4. When the readout indicates the task number you want to link to,
release your mouse button.
Figure 3-4:
This box lets
you know
when your
cursor is
resting over
the task to
which you
want to link.

Setting Dependencies
258
You can also use the following method to establish a finish-to-start relationship
between two tasks: Click the predecessor task, press Ctrl, click the successor
task, and then click the Link Tasks button on the Standard toolbar.
If you have to refine your dependency after you create a dependency link,
you can edit that link to change the dependency type or to build in lag or
lead time.
To establish a link in the Task Information dialog box or to modify an existing
relationship, make note of the task ID number (you can find it in the far-left
shaded column in the Gantt Chart sheet pane) of the predecessor task and
then follow these steps:
1. Double-click the successor task.
The Task Information dialog box appears.
2. Click the Predecessors tab, shown in Figure 3-5.
On this tab, you can build as many dependency relationships as you like.
3. In the ID field, type a task ID number for the predecessor task.
Alternatively, you can select the task from the Name drop-down list.
4. Press Tab.
The task name and the default finish-to-start dependency type with 0d
(no days, the default unit of time) of lag time are entered automatically.
5. Click the Type field and click the arrow to display the dependency
types and then click the appropriate dependency for your situation.
Figure 3-5:

6. If you want to add lag or lead time, click the Lag field and use the
spinner arrows to set the amount of time.
Click up to a positive number for lag time or down to a negative number
for lead time.
7. Repeat Steps 3–6 to establish additional dependency relationships.
8. When you’re finished, click OK to save the dependencies.
The Gantt chart displays your dependencies with lines and arrows, as
shown in the project displayed in Figure 3-6.
Most dependency links exist between tasks that are close to each other in
your schedule. However, sometimes dependencies exist between tasks that
are weeks or months apart. In that case, the click-and-drag method can be
difficult to use. For this type of situation, you can use the successor task’s
Task Information dialog box to create the relationship by entering the prede-
cessor task ID number or name and by defining the lag or lead time in the
appropriate fields.

Connecting to other projects 
with external dependencies
Few projects in organizations exist in a vacuum. Many times, another project
you’re managing or another project going on somewhere else in your organi-
zation affects your project. Perhaps you share resources or equipment with
others, or perhaps the timing of tasks in other projects affects the timing of
tasks in yours.
If your project is to launch a Web site, you might have to create a depend-
ency from your Launch Web Site task to the New Product Release task in
someone else’s project so you’re sure you can offer the new product line on
the Web site.
To deal with this cross-project coordination, you can create a hyperlinked
task that represents the timing of the other project (or of a particular task in
the other project). Enter a start date and duration for the external task as a
task in your project. You can then create dependencies between that task
and other tasks in your project to connect your activities to the external
timing. Use the hyperlink to jump quickly to the other project whenever you
want to update your timing information. (See Book III, Chapter 4 for informa-
tion about hyperlinking tasks in projects.)
You can also insert an entire project and add a link to it so that updates to
the other file are reflected in your plan automatically.
Things change: Deleting dependencies
Over the life of a project, you’re likely to find that timing relationships among
tasks change. For example, sometimes you no longer need a dependency you
created to avoid resource conflicts because of a shift in resources or overall
project timing.
When you need to get rid of a dependency, you can undo what you did in
either Gantt Chart view or the Task Information dialog box.
With Gantt Chart view displayed, follow these steps:
1. Select the two tasks whose dependency you want to delete.
• For two adjacent tasks: Click and drag to select their ID numbers.
• For nonadjacent tasks: Click one task, press and hold the Ctrl key, and
then click a nonadjacent task.
2. Click the Unlink Tasks button on the Standard toolbar (it looks like a
chain link with a break in the middle).

Book IV
Chapter 3

Dependencies

261
Be careful when you use this method: If you click a single task and then click
the Unlink Tasks button, all dependency relationships for that task are
removed.
To remove dependency relationships in the Task Information dialog box,
here’s the drill:
1. Double-click a successor task name.
The Task Information dialog box appears.
2. Click the Predecessors tab to display it.
3. Click the Type box for the dependency that you want to delete.
A list of dependency types appears, as shown in Figure 3-7.
4. Select None.
5. Click OK to save the change.
The dependency line on the Gantt chart is gone. The next time you open
that Task Information dialog box, you find that the dependency is no
longer listed there.
If you turn on the Change Highlighting feature, you can see how making this
kind of change to dependencies affects your schedule. To turn on Change
Highlighting, choose View➪Show Change Highlighting. Any tasks affected by
subsequently adding or deleting a dependency have either their start or
finish date column highlighted in the spreadsheet pane, depending on which
date was affected.

Visualizing Task Dependencies
262
Visualizing Task Dependencies
Being able to get a look at the dependency structure in your project can be
very useful, especially when you’re trying to solve a problem or refine the
details in your project to save time or money.
Project provides several ways to view dependencies in your project. This
involves displaying various views that represent dependencies by using text
to describe them or lines that run between graphical representations of
tasks.
You might have already seen the dependency link lines that appear in the
Gantt chart (refer to Figure 3-6). Another great way to see the flow of depend-
encies is in Network Diagram view. This workflow view uses similar lines and
arrows to reveal dependency relationships, but it allows you to get a differ-
ent perspective on them.
You can also display the Task Drivers pane (choose Project➪Task Drivers) to
see a list of everything in the schedule that’s driving the timing of a selected
task. For more about the Task Drivers feature, see Book I, Chapter 5.
Figure 3-8 depicts a Network Diagram view of an IT project. Notice that each
task is represented by a node that contains data about the task. Between the
nodes run lines that represent dependency relationships among the tasks.
Although you can’t see the effect in this black-and-white image, any task
dependency links on the critical path are displayed in red by default, and
noncritical tasks are displayed in blue. (Critical-path tasks have no slack:
They can’t be delayed without delaying the entire project.)
One way to help you remember what’s going on with dependencies in Network
Diagram view is to edit the layout to show link labels. Here are the steps to
do this:
1. Right-click anywhere outside the task nodes.
2. Choose Layout.
3. Select the Show Link Labels check box.
A code, such as FS for finish-to-start, is displayed to explain the type of
dependency that each dependency line represents, as shown in Figure 3-8.
You can also display a view that contains columns to view by task ID
number, successors or predecessors for each task, or the dependencies 
for a task. You can do this in any view with a sheet area, such as Gantt Chart
view. Figure 3-9 shows a Gantt Chart view for an engineering project with
Predecessors and Successors columns displayed.

Training new staff efficiently
Company: Large science museum.
Project: Staff and train a new set of volunteer
docents to give museum tours.
Challenge: Organize training as quickly as pos-
sible to handle upcoming peak season. In the
first version of this plan there was a finish-to-
start relationship between the two tasks Locate
Recruits and Train Recruits. That meant that no
training could begin until the last docent recruit
was on board. With this dependency in place,
the project couldn’t meet the required deadline.
Solution: To get some docents trained and
working more quickly, the project manager
decided to incorporate a week of lead time —
that is, allow the training of the earliest hires to
start before all the recruits are hired. To do this,
he essentially deducted time from the finish-to-
start relationship between Locate Recruits
and Train Recruits. This change allows the
training to start a week before the finish of the
Locate Recruits predecessor, as shown in this
figure.

These columns also include a notation of any type of dependency other than
the default finish-to-start type and any lead or lag time using percentages
or lengths of time. For example, 71SS+50% is a start-to-start link to task 71,
with lag time set so that the successor task begins halfway through the pred-
ecessor task. Similarly, 71SS+2 days is a start-to-start link to task 71, with lag
time set so that the successor task begins two days after the predecessor
task starts.
Note that you can also edit the contents of Network Diagram nodes to
include predecessor and successor data.
Another way to achieve this would be to break
the recruiting and training into two pieces. To do
this, you could have two recruiting and two train-
ing tasks. Say you have to recruit ten people.
The first task could be Recruit Half of Docents
and the second task Recruit Second Half of
Docents. Create finish-to-start relationships
between the first recruiting task and the first
training task; then create the same relationship
between the second recruiting task and a
second training task. If there’s a delay in hiring
the second set of docents, the first half of the
docents can still proceed with their training.

hen you build a project, each task in it gains its timing from a variety
of influences with a sometimes-complex set of priorities. You may
give a task a specific start date, set dependency relationships that drive the
task’s timing, or even set up a project calendar that dictates how much work
can go on in a given day or week.
In addition to all these influences and more, you can apply constraints to
individual tasks. A constraint is a restriction that you place on a task to control
when it can start or finish. In combination with other factors, a constraint
can be a powerful force for determining the timing of your tasks and project.
Deadlines, on the other hand, are more informational and are used to alert
you when you’re running late, but they don’t control the timing of tasks in
any real sense.
Beginning with the Start and Finish Dates
Every task has a start date and a finish date. You can set fixed start or finish
dates, or (and this is the preferred method) you can let Project schedule
them based on several criteria. In the absence of a fixed start or finish date,
Project schedules a task based on the task duration, calendars (including
the Project calendar and assigned Resource calendars), dependencies with
predecessor and successor tasks, constraints applied to predecessor and
successor tasks, and a task’s own calendar and constraints.

Understanding How Constraints Work
268
Brush up on calendar settings in Book II, Chapter 4, and on dependencies in
Chapter 3 of this minibook.
The weight that Project gives each of these factors is a rather complex thing
to understand, and frankly, it’s not going to help you that much. Rather than
dissect the complex algorithm Project uses, what you should know is that
the more you change default settings to apply constraints, set a fixed start
date, or modify each task’s calendar, the more settings you have to track
down when a problem occurs. That’s one reason why you should use con-
straints sparingly and only when absolutely necessary (more about when
that might be shortly).
So how, exactly, does a task constraint work? We’re glad you asked. . . .
Understanding How Constraints Work
Though constraints are only one of the criteria used to establish task timing,
when Project performs calculations to try to save you time in a project that’s
running late, it considers constraints to be the most sacred timing settings.
For example, if you set a constraint that a task must finish on a certain date,
Project doesn’t do anything to change that date when recalculating timing of
tasks in your project.
Default constraints
When you create a task, depending on the scheduling method that you 
set in the Project Information dialog box shown in Figure 4-1 (see Book II,
Chapter 1 for more about scheduling methods), you can apply two default
constraints:
✦If you’re scheduling your project to be calculated from the start date,
the As Soon As Possible constraint is selected by default. In other
words, the task starts as soon as the project starts, assuming that no
dependencies with other tasks exist that would delay its start.
✦If you’re scheduling your project to be calculated from the finish date,
the As Late As Possible (ALAP) constraint is applied by default. In this
case, the task occurs as late as it possibly can while still meeting the
finish date of the entire project.

Information
dialog box.

269
You can create a task by clicking and dragging within the chart area in Gantt
Chart view. When you create a task using this method, Project applies the
Start No Earlier Than constraint if you have set up your project to schedule
from the start date. If you’re using the finish date scheduling method, such a
task has the Start No Later Than constraint applied.
Constraint types
Table 4-1 lists all the constraints and an explanation of their effects on your
task’s timing.
Table 4-1
Task Constraints
Constraint

As Late As Possible
The task occurs as late as possible in your schedule, based on
dependencies and the project finish date.
As Soon As Possible
The default setting; the task starts as early in the schedule as 
possible based on dependencies and the project start date.
Finish No Earlier Than
The end of the task can’t occur any earlier than the date you specify.
Finish No Later Than
The end of the task can’t occur any later than the date you specify.
Must Finish On
The task must finish on an absolute date.
Must Start On
The task must start on an absolute date.
Start No Earlier Than
The task can’t start any earlier than the date you specify.
Start No Later Than
The task can’t start any later than the date you specify.
Flexible versus inflexible constraints
It’s helpful to understand that the constraints Project offers fall into two cat-
egories: flexible and inflexible (also known as soft and hard constraints).
Flexible constraints allow Project to move the task start and end dates based
on other factors in the project such as dependencies with other tasks that
are delayed. A typical flexible constraint is As Soon As Possible. A task could
start, for example, as soon as possible when all other elements (such as the
project start date, dependency relationships, and assigned Resource calen-
dars) are satisfied. Flexible constraints include
✦As Soon As Possible
✦As Late As Possible
✦Finish No Earlier Than
✦Finish No Later Than
✦Start No Earlier Than
✦Start No Later Than

Understanding How Constraints Work
270
An inflexible constraint never allows the start or end date (depending on the
constraint) to be moved because it essentially sets that date in stone.
Inflexible constraints include:
✦Must Finish On
✦Must Start On
Constraints and dependencies
Most tasks have some dependency relationships with other tasks. When a
dependency is in place, it’s important that you know how constraints affect
a task. Here’s one example.
If you create a task called Wire House and another task called Wiring
Inspection, you might put a finish-to-start dependency between them so
that the inspection can’t happen until the wiring is complete. If the wiring is
completed early, the inspection could happen earlier. If the wiring task runs
late, the inspection task is pushed back.
But if you know that inspections are done every two weeks on Thursdays
and you really want the inspection to occur in a certain week of the project,
you might decide to put a Must Start On constraint to force the inspection
task to happen in the week you want wiring to be complete. If you set that
constraint, here’s what happens:
If the wiring finishes two weeks early, your schedule shows that you have to
sit around for two weeks until the inflexible Must Start On constraint date
rolls around. If you don’t notice the problem and manually move the inspec-
tion up by removing the constraint, that could cost you valuable time in
your schedule.
If you’re late on the predecessor task when you track the earlier start date,
Project displays a Planning Wizard dialog box like the one shown in Figure 4-2.
This warning notes that the pushing back of the predecessor task causes a
conflict with a successor task that cannot move. At this point, you can choose
to cancel the tracking activity or allow the conflict. If you allow the conflict,
the successor task falls behind the predecessor task (see Figure 4-3).
Instead of setting the Must Start On constraint, consider using a deadline
(see “Setting a Deadline,” later in this chapter) to flag the date you think the
inspection should happen. If the deadline passes and the inspection hasn’t
happened, Project displays an indicator in the Indicator field for that task,
alerting you to the fact that you’re running late. By not using the constraint if
the earlier task finishes ahead of schedule, the inspection task is allowed to
move up, saving you time overall.

Establishing Constraints
You can set only one constraint for a task. Setting a constraint involves
selecting the type of constraint you want in the Task Information dialog box.
Some constraints work together with a date you choose. For example, if you
want a task to start no later than a certain date, you need to select a date by
which the task must start. Other settings, like As Soon As Possible, work off
a different date — in this case, the start date you set for the whole project or
any dependency relationships you set up with other tasks. (See Chapter 3 of
this minibook for more about dependency relationships.)
To set a task constraint, follow these steps:
1. Double-click a task.
The Task Information dialog box appears.
2. Click the Advanced tab (see Figure 4-4).
3. Select a constraint from the Constraint Type list.
4. If the constraint requires a date, select one from the Constraint
Date list.
5. Click OK to save the settings.

Setting a Deadline
272
Setting a Deadline
Strictly speaking, deadlines aren’t constraints (although the setting for the
deadline is in the Constraint Task area of the Task Information dialog box, on
the Advanced tab). Deadlines differ from constraints in that they don’t force
the timing of your tasks in any sense.
If you set a deadline, it simply causes Project to display a symbol in the
Indicator column if the task has run past the deadline to alert you so that
you can panic (we mean, take appropriate action). Using a deadline is often
preferable to setting an inflexible constraint because a deadline allows a task
to shift with other changes in your schedule, yet keeps you aware when
you’re going to miss a target date.
To set a deadline, follow these steps:
1. Double-click a task.
The Task Information dialog box appears.
2. Click the Advanced tab.
3. Click the arrow in the Deadline field to display a calendar (see
Figure 4-5), and then select a date.
If necessary, use the forward or backward arrow to move to a different
month.

Waiting till the last minute
Company: Home office of a large retail clothing
chain.
Project: Office move.
Challenge:Training employees on the new phone
system should happen as late as possible in the
move so they can begin working on a day-to-day
basis, with minimal down time, with the phones
in their new office space right after training.
The main office of a company that runs dozens
of retail clothing stores is moving to new office
space. The staff in the office includes the cus-
tomer support group that provides support via
phone and e-mail. Part of the move involves
installing a new phone system with some
sophisticated features, and the staff needs
training to use those features.
The project manager has been charged by the
VP of Operations with arranging the training on
the phone system to occur as close as possible
to the end of the project — the last milestone
task named “Move Complete.” This ensures
that employees are trained in the phone system
no more than a day before they move into the
new offices and begin to use the system.
Solution: To achieve this result, the project
manager applies an As Late As Possible con-
straint to the training task and then creates a
finish-to-start dependency between it and the
Move Complete task. With these settings, the
task appears just before the move-in but no
earlier, as shown here.

 Working with consolidated resources
P
rojects typically involve people to get the work done. Projects also use
equipment and materials. Those people, equipment, and materials are
your project resources.
Resources are the means by which Project adds up the costs in your plan.
For example, when you assign a resource to work for ten hours on a task
and give that resource an hourly rate of $30, you’ve just added a $300 cost
to your project.
Because resources affect timing and costs, they’re an important element of
Project. Many tools are available to help you create resources, make settings
for how and when they’ll work, assign them to tasks, manage their costs,
and manipulate their workload. The first step in working with resources is
to create them in Project and enter certain information about them. That’s
what this chapter is all about.
What Exactly Is a Resource?
It’s natural to think of a resource as a person. After all, companies have
human resources who work on projects, right? Well, people are indeed a 
frequently used project resource, but they’re not the only type of resource.
Resources can also be equipment that you rent or buy (such as a truck), as
well as materials (such as paper clips or scrap iron).
You can even create resources that represent facilities you have to rent by
the hour, such as a laboratory or a meeting space, or travel costs. For exam-
ple, you could create a resource named Conference and assign it a unit cost
of $900, which covers the average cost for attending a professional confer-
ence, including airfare, hotel, and the conference fee.

All Kinds of Resources
278
Here are some typical and not-so-typical project resources:
✦Lab technicians
✦Trade show booth
✦Office supplies
✦Offsite meeting facility
✦Administrative assistants
✦Rocket fuel
✦Consultant fees
✦Service call
✦Computer software
✦Printing services
✦Web designer
✦Prototype design
Essentially, a resource is anything or anyone who adds to the bottom line
cost of your project or whose time or involvement you need to track.
All Kinds of Resources
Typically after you create and organize the tasks in your project, the next
step is to create resources. Before you start creating resources, however,
you should understand how they affect not only your project costs, but also
the timing of tasks.
Understanding resources
The key to understanding resources is to realize that costs in Project are
accumulated by assigning resources. If you want to account for costs in your
project — such as a person putting in hours of work on a task, materials that
you have to buy to make a product, or your monthly office space rent — you
have to create resources and assign them to one or more tasks. When you
do, you can see the resulting costs in the Total Cost column of the Gantt
Chart spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 1-1.
You can create resources with no associated costs. You might do that so you
can track only that resource’s time. Some people use Project strictly as a
scheduling tool, so watching the time people are spending on tasks is their
only interest, not what the time is costing. That’s okay as long as you know
that if you don’t assign costs to resources, you get no cost or budget infor-
mation back from Project.

Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Resources
All Kinds of Resources
279
One other way to add costs to a project is to use a fixed cost. Fixed costs
aren’t assigned through resources because they don’t accumulate costs by
hours of work or units used. Instead, a fixed cost is a set cost applied directly
to individual tasks. If a cost isn’t task specific — such as a flat $10,000 con-
sulting fee to a firm that’s advising you on a project — you can create and
assign a fixed cost to a task. (For more on fixed costs, see Chapter 2 in this
minibook.)
After you create the resources, you need to manage the workflow for any
resource that has limited time availability for your project. You can track the
time being used for any type of resource with limited availability by creating
resources that are available so many hours per day and so many days per
week. For example, one person might be available to work on your project
50 percent of the time, or 20 hours in a 40 hour workweek, whereas another
might be available full-time (40 hours). A supercomputer might be available
to your project only 10 hours a week, or you might be able to book a meeting
room for only an hour a day.

When you assign limited-availability resources to your project, you can then
use various views, reports, and tools to see whether any resource is over-
booked at any point during your project. You can also see whether people
are sitting idle when you might be able to make use of them on another task.
You can even account for resources that work on multiple projects across
your organization and make sure that they’re being used efficiently.
See Chapter 3 in this minibook and Book III, Chapter 4 for more about
resources used in multiple projects.
Views such as Resource Usage view (as shown in Figure 1-2) help you visual-
ize resource working time in your project.
Resource types: Work, Material, and Cost
The number of resources you assign to work on a task usually has an effect
on the duration of that task. Think about it: If you have a certain number of
hours of work to do but few people to do that work, a typical task takes
longer to finish than if you had all the resources in the world.

281
The task type determines whether a task’s duration changes based on the
number of resources assigned to it. See Book IV to explore more about tasks
and timing.
Although people and things come in all shapes and sizes, only three types of
resources exist as far as Project is concerned:
✦Work resources are typically (but not always) people. They can’t be
depleted but can be reassigned. Their costs are associated with the
amount of work time they put in, usually at an hourly rate or a cost per
use. Work resources are assigned to tasks based on a Working Time cal-
endar (as shown in Figure 1-3), where you specify their working and non-
working hours. You can select one of three base calendars and then
modify specific working hours.
A typical Work resource is a person working eight hours a day at a 
standard rate of $20 per hour and an overtime rate of $30 per hour.
Another example of a Work resource is a meeting facility available only
eight hours a day at an hourly rate. Even though it’s not a person, the
meeting facility would probably be created as a working resource
because it has limited “working” hours.
Figure 1-3:
Work
resources

to tasks

Time
calendar.

All Kinds of Resources
282
The number of hours a resource can work is determined by the calen-
dars. The three kinds of calendars are Project, Task, and Resource.
Calendars, their settings, and how those settings interact are discussed
at some length in Book II, Chapter 4.
✦Material resources can have an hourly rate or a unit cost, and they also
have an unlimited working time. This type of resource has no calendar,
no overtime, and you make no settings for working and nonworking time.
A typical Material resource is any material — such as steel, rubber,
paper, chairs, or shoes — assigned to a task with an associated unit
cost. For example, a resource called Books with a unit price of $12.95,
assigned to a task called Computer Training at ten units, accrues a cost
of $129.50 to the task. Another example of a material cost is anyone per-
forming a service for a fee in a situation where working time isn’t an
issue. A facilitator who runs an offsite meeting for a fee of $1,000, but
whose working calendar and time aren’t your concern, could be created
as a Material resource with a unit cost of $1,000.
✦Cost resources have a set cost associated with them. Calendars and
units of work or unit costs have nothing to do with the amount such
resources deduct from the bottom line of your project.
An example of a Cost resource is a consultant working for a set fee.
The cost to set up your network might be $25,000, for example, and
wouldn’t change based on the time it took to set up the network or the
volume of hours or units used.
Estimating your resource requirements
You usually can use a calculation to estimate how much of a Material resource
you need to complete a task: In most cases, you can calculate the number of
pounds of sugar, tons of steel, yards of fabric, and so on based on previous
projects and industry standards. But how do you know how much effort it
will take on the part of Work resources to complete the tasks in your project?
As with many aspects of information you put into a Project plan, this judg-
ment rests to a great degree on your own experience with similar tasks and
resources. One approach is to start with an educated guess at how long it
might take you to complete such a task, and then factor in variables for an
individual resource. Consider the following guidelines:
✦Consider skill levels. A less skilled or inexperienced resource is likely to
take more time to finish something.
✦Look to the past. Look at previous projects and tasks. If you’ve tracked
people’s time, you can probably see how much effort was required to
complete various types of tasks on other projects and draw parallels to
your project. If you’ve worked with a particular resource before, check
your notes about his or her performance and use that as a guide.

Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Resources

283
✦Go to the source. Ask the resources themselves how long they think it
will take. Then add 10 percent to that time in case the resources were
being overly optimistic!
Committed versus proposed resources
Last time you asked somebody whether he was available to work on your
project, did you get a half-hearted, “Well, maybe, if I have time, if my man-
ager says it’s okay, if it falls on a Leap Year . . .”? You may well ask: So is that
resource available or not? You can’t always be positive about a resource’s
commitment in the planning stages of your project. How can Project help?
Project has the capability to designate a resource as either proposed or 
committed. You can use the Booking Type field in the Resource Information
dialog box to make this setting.
What does this setting do? Well, it’s pretty much a field you can use to keep
track of resource status. If you’re not quite sure about a resource’s commit-
ment to your project, you call that resource proposed. Then you can display
the Booking Type column in a resource view (such as the Resource Sheet)
and keep track of resources you might have to firm up as you get closer to
finalizing your project plan.
Creating Resources
Creating a resource in Project essentially involves filling out a form with
some vital statistics about the resource. On the Resource Information form,
you enter information such as the resource name, rate per hour or cost per
use, and availability. You can also enter optional information. Entering a
resource’s e-mail address helps you stay in touch, and entering a setting
such as proposed (see the previous section) gives you a field you can search
or filter to locate certain resources by those criteria.
You can create a resource to represent an individual person; a thing such as
a telescope used for scientific study; a generic resource (that is, a skill set
with no person attached, such as Assistant or Engineer); and even a group of
several resources that work together.
Creating one resource at a time
Whether your resource is a person, a piece of equipment, or a material, you
can begin to create these individual resources by entering information in the
Resource Information dialog box.
Another method for entering resource information is to display Resource
Sheet view and enter information in the columns included there for each
individual resource. This is often a faster way to enter information about
several resources one after the other.

Creating Resources
284
When you create a resource, you must, at a minimum, type the Resource
Name. You can also include as much information as you want on the several
tabs of the Resource Information dialog box. Some people prefer to create
all the resources first and deal with details such as contact and cost informa-
tion at a later stage.
They say the devil is in the details! If you create resources with only bare-bones
information, be sure to go back later in your planning to add the details.
The details, such as rate per hour or working time settings, can make the 
difference between an accurate schedule and one that bears no resemblance
to reality.
Note that to create a resource using the Resource Information dialog box,
which allows you access to every single detail of a resource, you have to
first display a view that includes a Resource Name column. Follow these
steps to create a resource via the Resource Information dialog box:
1. Click Resource Sheet view on the View bar.
2. Double-click a blank Resource Name cell.
The Resource Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-4.
3. In the Resource Name text box, type a name.
4. In the Initials box, type an abbreviation or initials for the resource.
These shorthand versions of the names can be displayed in the
Resource Initials column and can be a useful reference if you have many
resources assigned to a task. If you don’t enter anything here, the first
letter of the resource name is inserted when you save the resource.
Figure 1-4:
These four
tabs can

285
5. From the Type drop-down list, select Work, Material, or Cost.
The settings available to you differ slightly depending on what you
choose. For example, a Material resource won’t have the Email box avail-
able, and a Work or Cost resource won’t have the Material Label box
available.
6. Continue to enter any information you want to include for the resource.
That information might include
• Email: Just what it seems
• Group: A department, division, or workgroup, for example
• Code: Such as a cost center code
• Material Label: For example, pounds for food coloring or tons for steel
If you enter information in the Group text box, you can then use filters,
sorting features, and the Group feature to look at sets of resources. See
Book VII, Chapter 1 for more about filtering and working with groups.
7. Click OK to save the new resource.
If you use Project Server (a feature that you can use along with Project
Professional for online collaboration, covered in Book X), the Resource
Information dialog box will include a Workgroup field. You or the administra-
tor who sets up your enterprise-wide resource pool can choose the Microsoft
Project Server option in the Workgroup field. You can also use the Windows
Account option in the Resource Information dialog box to specify how you’ll
communicate with the team. See Book X, Chapter 2 for more about enter-
prise resources.
Identifying resources you don’t know
In the planning stages of a project, you might find that all your resources
aren’t identified. Sometimes even well into the project, you don’t know what
resource you’ll be using; you know only that you need a resource with a cer-
tain skill set to complete upcoming tasks. In that case, you might be better
off creating some generic resources.
If you want to create a generic resource, you should give it a name that
describes its skill, such as Engineer, or Designer, or even Meeting Space
(as opposed to a specific resource named Conference Room B). Then, in the
Resource Information dialog box, be sure to select the Generic check box.
You can display a column titled Group to identify these resources (see
Figure 1-5). You can then create a resource filter to find resources with a
Generic entry in the Group column when it’s time to update these resources
with more specific information.

Creating Resources
286
No formula takes the Generic setting into account in recalculating your sched-
ule based on resource availability. However, many people find this setting
useful in long-range planning and in situations where they aren’t responsible
for specific resource assignments (for example, if you have to assign a tem-
porary worker to a task when the specific individual will be chosen by the
temp agency).
Resources that work in groups
Although you probably have little use for a chain gang in your project, it
exemplifies the principle of a resource that represents multiple resources.
Rather than assigning people one by one to some tasks, you want to assign a
group of people who typically work together. Being able to make one assign-
ment of a consolidated resource rather than several separate resources and
assignments can be a timesaver in larger projects.
Here’s an example of a consolidated resource: Suppose that you’re managing
a project to get a new office site up and running. You have four office planners
of equal skill at your disposal, so you create a resource named Office Planners.
You can assign Office Planners to a task at 400 percent (see Figure 1-6) and
have all four planners working at once. Or you can assign the Office Planners
resource to work on a task at 100 percent, thereby assigning one resource to it.
Figure 1-5:
Identifying
generic
resources in
your project.

Book V
Chapter 1
Creating Resources
Creating Resources
287
See Chapter 3 in this minibook for making resource assignments such as
the 400 percent maximum units assignment mentioned in the preceding
example.
There is no special setting to designate a multiple resource: However, you
might want to include some indication of the number of resources in the
resource name. For example, you could name your planner resource Four
Office Planners (if you know the office planner group consists of four people)
or Office Planner Group. What really defines this type of resource is the maxi-
mum assignment units; 400 percent would indicate four resources in the
group each working 100 percent of the time.

Resource management: An art, not a science
When you start creating resources, you almost
immediately have to start managing them.
Here’s the nickel tour of the art of managing the
people who will make your project happen.
Conflict resolution is a necessary skill for project
managers. It involves creating an environment
of cooperation and respect, building consensus
(agreement) among team members, and encour-
aging honest communication.
As a project manager, you can set up well-
designed communications tools (such as frequent
status meetings or reports) so people stay in
touch throughout your project. You can also make
a point of staying alert to conflict — and nipping
it in the bud. (A conflict ignored only festers and
becomes something worse.) Try to keep the focus
of any project discussions on the project goal,
and not on personalities. See Book I, Chapter 1
for more about project management concepts.

Creating Resources
288
In Book VI, Chapters 3 and 4, we tell you all about designing and generating
reports in Project that help you keep your resources informed. Book X also
offers some ways to help resources communicate clearly with each other in an
online enterprise environment, which can help you avoid misunderstandings.

Chapter 2: Understanding Costs
In This Chapter

 Adding fixed costs

 Estimating resource availability
T
hese days, not much in life is free — and if you use Project to track
costs, there’s no such thing as a free resource. That’s because Project
uses resources assigned to tasks as a way of calculating most of the costs
accruing to your project.
When you create a resource, you specify a Work resource rate (by default,
this rate is tallied up per hour) or a per-use cost for a Material resource.
You can also create Cost resources; that is, a set cost that you can apply to
a task that isn’t calculated using a per-use or hourly rate. An example of a
Cost resource is a fee for your trade show booth.
Other factors can come into play in determining your project costs, such as
how many hours a day a resource is available to work and overtime rates.
As you tally your bottom line, all these settings come together to put you
over or under budget.
In this chapter, you explore the relationship between resources and costs.
You find out how to set resource standard and overtime rates, create fixed
costs, and set the availability of resources on individual tasks in your project.
Accruing Costs All Over the Place
Project helps you to account for costs on your various tasks with a combi-
nation of costs per hour, costs per unit, and fixed costs. Before you begin to
assign cost information to your resources, it’s important to understand how
these cost calculations work.

Accruing Costs All Over the Place
290
Tallying costs
The best way to understand how costs add up in your project is to look at an
example. Jane Doe (that’s not her real name) is managing a project involving
the building of a new candy-packaging plant. Jane has created a task called
Install Candy Mixers. Here are the costs Jane anticipates for that task and
how they add up:
✦About ten person-hours of effort to do the installation
The ten hours of effort will be expended by Work resources. The total
cost for the ten hours is a calculation: 10 × the resource rate. If the
resource rate is $20, this cost totals $200. If two resources work on the
task, one at a rate of $20 and one at a rate of $30, then (by default)
Project splits the ten hours of effort between them, and the resulting
cost is $250.
✦A fixed cost of $500 paid to the mixer manufacturer to oversee the
installation and train workers on the machine
The fixed cost of $500 for a fee to the manufacturer is created as a Cost
resource. When you assign this resource to a task, you enter a cost for
that resource on that task. This cost won’t change based on the number
of resources or the time involved.
✦Twenty pounds of ingredients to test the mixers
The cost for 20 pounds of sugar for the test candy is calculated as 20 ×
the unit cost of the ingredients. If the unit cost is $2, this cost is $40.
And that’s how costs are assigned and how they add up on your projects.
Not all resources have associated costs. For example, if you want your vice
president (VP) to review status reports on your project but your company
doesn’t require that the VP’s time be charged to your project, you can
simply use her resource assignment to remind you about the need for the
VP’s availability on a particular day or week.
Your project has two main perspectives on your budget: one perspective
at the moment you freeze your original plan (a baseline plan) and one 
perspective of the ongoing picture of actual costs that comes from the 
activity and material usage you record as your project moves along.
You record a certain amount of work effort on tasks, and tasks with
resources assigned to them then run up costs based on the effort expended
or units of materials used.
The sound of costs hitting the bottom line
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could choose when all your costs hit your pocket
book? Well, in Project, you can choose when your costs hit your budget.

Book V
Chapter 2
Understanding
Costs
Assigning Costs to Resources
291
You can set up resources to accrue costs at the start or end of the task that
they’re associated with or to be prorated throughout the life of the task.
So, if a three-month-long task begins April 1, a $90 Cost resource could be
added to your actual costs to date on day 1, on day 90, or at $1 per day until
the end of the task.
Now, this isn’t exactly a realistic reflection of when you have to pay for
costs, because most bills come due 30–60 days after they arrive, long after
the task is finished. It’s more a factor of when you want that cost to show up
for the purposes of tracking costs and reporting expenses on your project.
Assigning Costs to Resources
You have to do your homework before you can assign resources to tasks.
Most projects involve a combination of the three cost types: Cost, Work, and
Material. That means that you have to find out the fixed costs as well as the
hourly or unit rates for all your resources.
In the early stages of your project planning, you might not be able to find out
exactly what a particular cost will be or know every resource’s rates. If you
have to, build the resource or fixed cost with your best estimate. That way,
at least some cost will be reflected in your plan, and you can go back to
enter more accurate information as soon as you know it. Don’t worry;
Project updates everything when you enter a change.
Use a field in your Resource Sheet, such as Code, to designate resources for
whom you have estimated rates or costs. Then apply a filter or display the
column so you can easily go back to those tasks and update the estimates as
your plan progresses.
Fixed costs you can count on
Maybe you have to pay a huge fee to a design company to redesign your
product logo, including all your collateral marketing materials. Or perhaps
you have to buy yourself a $2,000 laptop so you can manage your oil explo-
ration project with three drilling sites in different states when you’re on the
road. Whatever it is, it’s a cost that won’t change no matter how many hours
the task goes on or how many people work on the task. It has no unit cost or
rate per hour. It’s a fixed cost.
You can specify fixed costs by creating a resource with a Cost type. Every time
you assign the resource to a task, you specify the cost associated with it.
You can also simply enter a fixed cost associated with a task without having
to create and assign a Cost resource to it. To do so, you can use the Cost
Table in any view with a spreadsheet pane, such as Gantt Chart view.

Assigning Costs to Resources
292
Tables are preset column combinations that make entering certain informa-
tion in a sheet pane easier. See Book VI, Chapter 2 for more about customiz-
ing tables.
Follow these steps to view the Cost Table and enter a fixed cost for a task:
1. Display the project in Gantt Chart view (click Gantt Chart in the
View bar).
2. Choose View➪Table➪Cost.
The table of columns appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
3. Click the Fixed Cost column for the task to which you want to assign
the cost and then enter the amount.

Chapter 2
Understanding
Costs
Assigning Costs to Resources
293
You can enter only one fixed-cost amount for a task by using the Fixed Cost
column. You can total your fixed costs and enter that number here, but in
that case, you should also enter a task note where you can itemize fixed
costs if you have more than one. The option if you have a lot of fixed costs is
creating fixed Cost resources and assigning them to the task one by one.
Note also that the default fixed-cost accrual method is prorated. If you prefer
to have your fixed costs hit your budget at the start or end of a task, use the
Fixed Cost Accrual column in this table to select another option.
Paying per hour
Whether a resource gets minimum wage or charges a hefty billable hourly
rate every time you make a phone call, most people get paid something per
hour. To represent most people involved in your project, you create Work
resources and charge them to your project with a specific hourly rate.
After you set a resource hourly rate and enter an estimate of how many
hours that person will work on each task that he’s assigned to, Project totals
the cost of using that resource on your project. These estimates form the
budget for your project in the planning stage.
When you track actual effort expended on tasks, a calculation of actual 
effort × the hourly rate returns your actual costs.
By comparing estimated costs and actual costs, you get an ongoing picture
of whether your project is financially on track. See Book VIII for more about
tracking costs in a project.
To set resource rates per hour, follow these steps:
1. Display Resource Sheet view by clicking the Resource Sheet item in
the View bar (see Figure 2-2).
2. Click the Std. Rate column for the resource to which you want to
assign a cost.
3. Type a dollar amount.
If you’re entering a rate for a unit other than hours, type a slash (/) and
then the unit (for example, minute or month).
4. Press Enter.
The entry is saved.

Assigning Costs to Resources
294
Setting alternative rates
Note that you can also make cost-rate entries in the Resource Information
dialog box (to get to this dialog box display a view with a Resource Name
column such as Resource Sheet view and double-click the resource name).
The Costs tab of this dialog box, which is shown in Figure 2-3, offers a
Standard Rate, an Overtime Rate, and a Per Use Cost.
Even more options for setting rates are available in the Resource Information
dialog box; five tabs labeled A through E allow you to enter several different
rates for any resource during different time periods of your project. Tab A is
the default rate, but by using the Effective Date column in the other tabs to
specify the start date of a new rate, a resource could work for several
months at one rate and then start working at a different rate on a preset
date. This helps you account for periodic raises or seasonal shifts in rates
(for example, paying a premium for construction resources in months with
better weather when they are more in demand).

The cost-per-use scenario
Project allows you to enter a cost per use. With a cost-per-use scenario you
assign a cost for a single unit (per yard, ton, or gallon, for example), and
assign so many units to each task. Project calculates the cost based on the
number of units × the cost per use.
Technically speaking, you can have a cost per use for either a Work or
Material resource. You could, for example, have a consultant who costs $500
per use (that is, each time you use her to consult on a task, you get hit with a
$500 fee). More commonly, you use a cost per use for a Material resource
such as steel or sugar.
To assign a cost per use, follow these steps:
1. Display Resource Sheet view.
2. Click the Cost/Use column for the resource you want to set and then
type an amount for the per-use cost.
3. Click the Material Label column for that resource and then type a unit
name (such as Tons, as shown in Figure 2-4).
4. Press Enter to accept your entry.
Figure 2-3:
You can set
several
rates for a
resource.

Assigning Costs to Resources
296
Note that you can use the Resource Information dialog box to enter up to
five per-use costs with effective dates. You might do this to deal with fluctua-
tions in unit cost because of inflation or seasonal variations over the life of
your project.
Oops . . . you’re into overtime!
Overtime is a fact of working life for many people: It can be helpful for those
who earn it but hard on the project manager paying and tracking it. If you
have resources that shift into time and a half after so many working hours,
Project makes it easy for you to enter an overtime rate for them. With the
rate in place, overtime automatically kicks in when that resource’s calendar
indicates that her regular day is over but her task assignment still has her
working.
For example, a resource with a standard eight-hour-day calendar who puts
in ten hours on a one-day task is charged by Project with eight hours at the
standard rate and two hours at the overtime rate.

 Creating a resource pool
 Modifying resource working time
 Communicating assignments to your team
S
o you’ve created dozens of resources available to work on your project.
Now you must find the right resources for each task and assign them.
It’s important that you understand how to make those assignments and how
they affect the timing of tasks and ultimately your entire project.
Sometimes you need to finesse resource assignments to make them work.
For example, you might find that assigning resources as groups rather than
one by one saves you time. In other cases, you might want to tell Project
when resources put in different amounts of effort over the life of a task to
avoid resource overallocations. Finally, you might need to modify the time
that a resource puts in on any task.
In this chapter, you discover the vagaries of assigning resources to tasks,
and even how to let your resources know their assignments.
Locating the Right Resource for the Job
If you were coaching a basketball team, you probably wouldn’t bring in just
anybody in the fourth quarter with one minute to go to sink the winning
basket. It has to be Reggie or nobody. In projects, sometimes the same prin-
ciple is true, and you have to have a specific person for a task.
However, if just about anybody with a certain skill level (or a certain rate
per hour or the availability) will work, you can use Project features to find
the right resource and make sure he or she has enough time to take on just
one more task.

Locating the Right Resource for the Job
300
Finding resources
You’ve probably used the Find feature in other software to find a word or
phrase or number. Project’s Find feature is all that plus a bag of potato chips.
After all, Project’s Find feature can find you anything from a corporate jet to
a person.
You can use Project’s Find feature to look for resources with a wide variety of
criteria. You might search for resources who are assigned certain pay rates
or who come from a particular workgroup. You can search for resources by
their initials, their maximum assignment units, their standard or overtime
rate, and so on.
For example, you might need to find a resource whose standard rate is less
than $50. Or you might want to find someone who can put in extra hours on
a task, so you search for any resource whose maximum units are greater than
100 percent. (In other words, the resource can put in a longer-than-usual day
before he or she is considered overallocated.)
Perhaps you need to find a Material resource that consists of a metal alloy
measured in tons, but you can’t remember the exact name of the alloy. In that
case, you can search for resources whose material label includes the word
tons and locate the resource you need.
To use the Find feature with resources, first display any resource view and
then follow these steps to find resources in Project:
1. Choose Edit➪Find.
The Find dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
2. In the Find What text box, type the text you want to find.
For example, type 50 if you want to search for a resource with a stan-
dard rate of $50, or laboratory if you want to find a resource whose
material label contains that word.

3. From the Look in Field drop-down list, select the name of the field you
want to search in.
For example, to search for resources that have a maximum unit assignment
percentage of more than 100 percent, choose the Max Units field here.
4. From the Test drop-down list, select a criterion.
For maximum units of more than 100 percent, for example, this choice
would be Is Greater Than. There are a total of eleven criteria, such as
contains, equals, is less than, is within, and does not contain.
5. (Optional) If you prefer to search backward from your current location
(that is, the currently selected cell in the task list) instead of forward,
select Up from the Search drop-down list.
6. (Optional) If you want to match the case of the text, select the Match
Case check box.
7. To begin the search, click Find Next.
8. Continue to click Find Next until you find the instance you’re
looking for.
You can also use the Find feature to find and replace an entry. For example, if
your Human Resources department (HR) changes its name to Human Capital
Management (HCM), you can take these steps:
1. Search the Group field for the code HR.
2. In the Replace dialog box that appears, click the Replace button, and
type the letters HCM, as shown in Figure 3-2.
3. Click the Replace button to replace each instance one by one or click
the Replace All button to replace every instance of that entry in that
field, wherever it occurs in your project.

Creating custom fields
When you assign resources to tasks, it’s often important to take a person’s
skill set into account. If you absolutely have to have someone who can
type 110 words a minute, it would be handy to have a way to locate such a
keyboard wizard. If a person with less skill or experience could work on a
particular task (and save you money because he or she has a lower rate per
hour), wouldn’t it be nice to be able to find such resources easily?
Project doesn’t include a Skill field, but it does allow you to add fields of
your own called custom fields. After you create them, you can use these
fields for anything, but one great way to use them is to code your resources
by skill level. You can use a rating system such as A, B, and C, or use terms
such as Exp for an experienced worker and Beg for a beginning-level worker.
Consider using custom fields for information about tasks, as well. You can
create a field to identify tasks that require your boss’s input, tasks that
involve another department’s approval, or tasks that have to have their
results reviewed by your legal department, for example.
Here’s how to add a custom field:
1. Choose Tools➪Customize➪Fields.
2. Click a field name.
3. Click Rename.
4. In the Rename Field dialog box, type a name for the field.
5. Click OK twice to save the change.
You can now go to any view with a sheet pane, right-click the column head-
ings, and choose Insert Column. In the Column Definition dialog box that
appears, choose the newly named field and click OK to display it.
After you create a custom field, you can enter whatever you like in this
column for each resource in your project. Then you can search for specific
entries in that field by using the Find feature, or you can turn on a filter to
display only resources with a certain skill level in that field. (Read more
about filters in Book VII, Chapter 1.)
Some organizations designate enterprise-wide custom fields for certain com-
pany information such as an accounting code or a vendor rating. If you have
a project administrator who’s in charge of these enterprise-wide standards,
check with him or her before you choose to modify a locally saved custom
text field.

Locating the Right Resource for the Job
303
Acquiring the right resources
If you find the right resources for your tasks, the task of resource manage-
ment becomes much easier. But how do you know who will work best on a
given task?
What makes a good resource choice is a combination of factors. The right
resource for a task is somebody who has
✦The right skills for the task at hand (or who is trainable, if training is
included in your budget)
✦Enough time available to complete the task according to your schedule
✦The ability to commit to the project (which sometimes involves getting
not only the resources but also their manager’s buy-in)
✦A cost that fits in your budget
Although the preceding list covers some basics, it’s important that you con-
sider other details, such as whether the resource is set up to communicate
with the project team and whether the technology to communicate and
share documents is available (see Book X for more about this). Also, give
some thought to how well each resource you choose will work as part of the
team and whether the resource is considered dependable.
In Project, you have several ways to flag and find resources, categorizing
them by skill or other criteria:
✦Use the Resource Notes area to record information about a resource’s
skills and abilities. Then use the Find feature to search note fields for
words such as highly skilled, dependable, and trainable.
✦Use the Code field in the Resource Information dialog box to rank
resources by skill, cost, or ability to work well with others.
✦Create Custom Fields for resources to note specific skills and search for
resources by those skills.
Sometimes it’s worthwhile to consider using a less experienced, cheaper
resource to save money. However, if you do, just be sure to factor in the time
and money needed to train or mentor that resource.
Keeping resource workload balanced
Another important part of resource management is managing the assignment
of resources so that nobody is excessively overbooked. Although occasional
overtime is expected of most workers, constant overtime causes people to
burn out and work to suffer.

Locating the Right Resource for the Job
304
Also keep in mind that a less skilled worker takes longer to perform a task
than a skilled worker. Take that into account when scheduling the time a
resource might need to complete his or her work.
The following techniques can help you stay aware of resource workload
when working with Project:
✦Keep an eye on your Project plan. Various tools such as Resource Graph
view (as shown in Figure 3-3) allow you to spot overbooking on tasks.
✦Track the workload of individual resources. When tracking activity on
tasks, you will receive an account from resources (see Book VIII for infor-
mation on tracking) about the actual time they’re spending on tasks.
Notice the people who have to constantly put in overtime to keep their
heads above water, and keep an eye on those who are falling behind.
✦Talk to people. That’s right. This isn’t a feature of Project, so stop look-
ing for the Talk to People button. It’s an old-fashioned communications
device that works amazingly well. Check in with resources often and ask
whether things are going well — and don’t forget to ask whether your
human resources are running on empty. Then help those who are over-
worked by modifying your schedule or adding other resources to help.

Assigning
Resources to Tasks
Your Assignment Is . . .
305
Your Assignment Is . . .
After you’ve located the right resources, assigning resources to tasks is just
the software equivalent of filling out paperwork. However, it’s useful to
understand a few things before you begin making assignments.
First, it’s important that you understand how resource assignments affect
task timing. That knowledge helps you to understand how to handle assign-
ment units, which differ slightly between Work resources and Material
resources.
Finally, you can use a couple of methods to assign resources to tasks.
Of course, you have to create resources before you can assign them, so
make sure you’ve covered that by reading Chapter 1 of this minibook.
How resources affect task timing
For a fixed-unit or fixed-work task type, the addition or removal of resources
assigned to the task has an impact on the time it takes to complete the task.
In essence, the old saying that “two heads are better than one” might be
modified to “two heads are faster than one.”
Here’s an example: Suppose that one person is assigned to the Clean Up
task, which should take four hours of effort. Two people assigned to the
Clean Up task will finish the job in two hours because two hours are being
worked by each resource simultaneously, which achieves four hours of effort
in half the time.
One big word of warning here: Assigning additional people to tasks doesn’t
always cut work time down proportionately even though that’s how Project
calculates it. When you have more people, you have more meetings, more
memos, some duplicated effort, personality conflicts, and so on. If you
add more resources to a task, you might consider upping the amount of
effort required to complete that task to account for inevitable workgroup
inefficiencies.
Determining Work, Material, and 
Cost resource assignment units
You assign Work resources, which are typically people, to a task by using a
percentage: for example, 100 percent, 50 percent, or 150 percent. When you
assign a resource at a percentage, the assignment is based on the Resource
calendar.

Your Assignment Is . . .
306
A resource with a Standard calendar will put in eight hours a day if you assign
it at 100 percent assignment units. Theoretically, a resource with a 24-hour
calendar will work a grueling 24 hours a day at 100 percent (and quit the
next day) or 12 hours at 50 percent. (If such a resource were not a human
but a machine in your plant, such an assignment might work just fine.)
A Material resource is assigned in units such as gallons, consulting sessions,
yards, or tons. When you assign a Material resource to a task, you designate
how many units of that resource will go to that task.
Note that Work resource units are part of the entire work-unit-duration calcu-
lation that can cause Work resource assignments to change task durations.
A Cost resource is one that incurs a certain cost every time you assign it. For
example, if you create a Cost resource called Permit Fee and assign a cost of
$100, every time you assign a permit fee to a task, it is assigned at $100.
Making assignments
You have four ways to make resource assignments in Project. You can select
resources from the Resources tab of the Task Information dialog box, enter
resource information in the Resource column in the Entry table (displayed in
Gantt Chart view), split the window and use the Resources and Predecessors
form in a pane, or use the Assign Resources dialog box.
Which method you use depends to some extent on your own preferences,
but generally speaking, here are some parameters for using each:
✦Use the Resource Column to assign a default 100 percent assignment.
If you want to assign a different percentage, don’t use this method.
✦Use the Assign Resources dialog box if you want to replace one resource
with another (a handy Replace feature is available in this dialog box) or
if you want to filter the list of available resources by a criterion (for exam-
ple, resources with a rate or unit cost of less than a specified amount).
This dialog box is very useful for making multiple resource assignments.
✦Work in the Task Information dialog box if you want to have task details
(such as task type or the constraints contained on other tabs of this
dialog box) handy when you make assignments.
Choosing resources in the Resource column
You can add resources in a Resource column, whether you access it from
Gantt Chart view or Tracking Gantt view. (See Book I, Chapter 4 for informa-
tion about displaying additional columns or tables of columns in views.)

Book V
Chapter 3
Assigning
Resources to Tasks
Your Assignment Is . . .
307
Even though it lists tasks in its sheet pane and can even display a Resource
column, you can’t use Task Usage view to add resource assignments.
Follow these steps to assign resources at a default percentage:
1. Display Gantt Chart view by clicking it on the View bar.
2. Choose View➪Table➪Entry.
3. Click in the Resource Names column for the task on which you want
to make a resource assignment.
An arrow appears at the end of the cell.
4. Click the arrow to display a list of resources.
5. Click the resource you want to assign.
The resource name appears in the Resource column, assigned at
100 percent.
You can create assignments at the default level and then change the assign-
ment units later by opening the Task Information dialog box and making the
change on the Resources tab.
Using the Assign Resources dialog box
To assign a Work or Material resource to a task, you can select a task and
then use the Assign Resources dialog box to make assignments. To do so,
follow these steps:
1. Click a task to select it.
2. Click the Assign Resources button on the Standard toolbar.
The Assign Resources dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4:
Every

308
3. Click a resource to select it and then click the Assign button.
A check mark appears next to the assigned resource in the Resource
Name column.
4. Click the Units column for the resource you just assigned.
If it’s a Work resource, the default assignment of 100% appears. If it’s a
Material resource, the default is one unit.
5. Specify a percentage of assignment units for the resource.
Click the spinner arrows in the box to increase or decrease the setting.
For a Work resource, change the percentage units in 50-percent incre-
ments by clicking the arrows; or, you can simply type a percentage. For a
Material resource, use the spinner arrows in the Units column to increase
or decrease the unit assignment; or, you can type a number of units.
6. Repeat Steps 3–5 to add all resources.
7. (Optional) If you want to replace one resource with another, click an
assigned resource (indicated with a check mark), click Replace, select
another name on the list, set its units, and click OK.
8. Click Close to save all the assignments.
You can also open the Assign Resources dialog box from the Resource
Management toolbar. This toolbar offers handy tools for adding resources
to your project, from sources such as your Outlook Address Book, and tools
for managing overallocated resources.
Adding assignments in the Task Information dialog box
You can assign resources on the Resources tab of any Task Information
dialog box by following these steps:
1. Double-click a task name in Gantt Chart view.
The Task Information dialog box appears.
2. Click the Resources tab to display it.
3. Click in a blank Resource Name box and then click the arrow that
appears at the right side of the box.
A drop-down list of resources appears.
4. Click the resource you want to assign.

Book V
Chapter 3
Assigning
Resources to Tasks
Your Assignment Is . . .
309
5. Click the Units column and use the spinner arrows to set an assign-
ment percentage.
6. Repeat Steps 3–5 to assign additional resources.
7. Click OK.
If you’re assigning a Material resource, the Units default is a single unit. (For
example, if your units are pounds, the default assignment is 1 lb.) Use the
spinner arrows in the Unit field to assign additional material units.
Contours set the level of work
When you make a Work resource assignment, Project spreads the work evenly
over the life of the task. Even if work effort isn’t identical every single day, if
it averages out across the life of the task, this default setting is probably fine.
However, there are times, especially on longer tasks, that it’s useful to spec-
ify that more work goes on at some point in the task. This can help you free
up resources that have a conflict with another task, for example.
To deal with a variable workload, you can modify the level of work that goes
on during the life of the task — called a work contour — so that more work
takes place near the beginning, middle, or end of the task.
Look at an example: Suppose that you know that the people assigned to set
up a new enterprise-computing database will have to spend some time up
front studying the software manuals and customizing templates before they
can begin to make measurable progress on the task. In this case, you might
use a late-peaking contour. Or, if you know that people are likely to put in a
lot of work up front on a survey and then sit back and wait for the results to
come in, you might choose an early peaking contour.
Using a different contour on a particular resource’s task assignment could
free up that resource to work on a second task that occurs during the life of
the first task. This can help you resolve a resource conflict.
The contour you select will have slightly different effects depending on the
task type, some of which can throw your schedule entirely out of whack.
This is a complex equation not worth your while to try to analyze. My advice
is to simply try a different contour and see whether it solves your problem
and doesn’t make too dramatic a change to your task duration or other
resource assignments.

Your Assignment Is . . .
310
To set a task’s contour, follow these steps:
1. Display Task Usage view.
This view shows resource assignments by task.
2. Double-click a resource.
The Assignment Information dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
3. From the Work Contour drop-down list, select one of the preset 
patterns.
The default choice is Flat, with work spread out evenly throughout the
task. Other options include the self-explanatory Backloaded and
Frontloaded; Early Peak and Late Peak with spike of work in the first or
last half of the project, respectively; Double Peak, which ups the work-
load twice over the life of the task; and the Bell and Turtle Curves, which
you can visualize by thinking of their namesakes.
4. Click OK to save the setting.
A symbol for the contour pattern is displayed in the Indicator field for
the resource.
If none of the contour patterns fits your situation, you can manually
modify a resource’s work. You do this by changing the number of hours
the resource puts in day by day on a task in Task Usage view. Remember
that if you do this painstaking manual work to deal with resource avail-
ability, if tasks shift timing you may have to undo all this and redo it all
over again.
Before you save a contour setting, make sure your modifications add up to
the number of hours you want the resource to work, or you could inadver-
tently change the resource’s assignment.

Assigning
Resources to Tasks
Making Sure of Availability
311
Resource Allocation view is useful for reviewing resource assignments at
this stage. This view provides a side-by-side comparison between a single
resource’s workload and all the tasks going on during a particular time
period in your project.
Making Sure of Availability
By default, a resource is assigned to a task at 100 percent availability, but you
can modify that if you know a resource will be assigned to several tasks and
is likely to put in only part of that person’s time over the course of a task.
How you assign availability is important to managing your resources suc-
cessfully. Consider that many Project features that deal with resources help
you to spot resource overallocation. Overallocation is a calculation involving
the resource’s calendar and availability that tells you when a resource is
overbooked on one or more tasks.
Here’s an example: Charlie Ruiz is a graphic designer who works a standard,
eight-hour day based on his calendar. Charlie is assigned to the Create Design
Budget task at 50 percent of his availability and to the Create Design Specs
task — which occurs at the same time as the budget task — at 100 percent
of his availability. Charlie is now working at 150 percent of his availability, or
12 hours per day. Charlie is definitely overallocated, and one way to solve
that is to make sure you’ve dealt with availability correctly.
Setting availability
Availability is easier to estimate for some resources than for others. A man-
ager isn’t likely to give an entire day over to any single task because he has
to deal with all the people who report to him, or he has to sign authorizations,
go to meetings concerning various projects, work on budgets, and so on.
With a production worker, it might be simpler to pin down availability to a
single task: If one manufacturing job is going through the line for three days
and one person is working on the line all that time, it’s closer to the mark to
say that he or she is working on that task full-time.
One big mistake that new users of Project make is to microthink availability.
Of course, no one actually spends eight hours every day on a single task in
one project. People spend part of their days reading e-mail about company
holidays, chatting with co-workers, and blogging about their latest vacations.
A resource might spend seven hours on a task one day but only three the
next. Don’t get hung up on a day-by-day resource schedule in estimating
availability. If over the life of a task the person is pretty much devoted to it,
100 percent availability is a good setting. If that person puts in only, say, five
days of work on a ten-day task, that’s 50 percent availability whether she
works four hours per day for ten days or five full days at any point.

Making Sure of Availability
312
The Availability setting exists to help you spot overbooking of a resource
who might work on multiple tasks at the same time in a project schedule.
To set resource availability, follow these steps:
1. Display Resource Sheet view.
2. Double-click a resource.
The General tab of the Resource Information dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 3-6.
3. In the Units column (in the Resource Availability area), either click
the arrows to raise or lower the availability in 50-percent increments
or type a number.
The most common entry here (the default entry) is 100% for a single
resource working full-time on the task.
4. Click OK to save the setting.
Here’s an example of how you might use the Units column for assignments;
type 33 for a resource available one-third of the time, or 400% for a pool of
four resources all available full-time.
When resources appear and disappear
In addition to being available only a certain percentage of the time on any
task or project, a resource might be available for only a certain period of
time during the life of the task or project.
Figure 3-6:
You can
enter any
number you
like in the
Units box.

Chapter 3
Assigning
Resources to Tasks
Sharing Resources
313
On the other hand, you might have a resource that’s available half-time for
the first few days of the project and then full-time for the rest of the project.
In either case, you can enter a date range in the Available From and Available
To columns of the Resource Availability area in the Resource Information
dialog box (refer to Figure 3-6) to specify the variations in the resource’s
availability.
Sharing Resources
Most organizations have several projects going on simultaneously. Sometimes
a project, such as managing company acquisitions, is the only project of its
type happening in a company. Others, such as setting up PR campaigns in
an advertising company, will happen at the same time as several other 
similar projects and draw on many of the same resources, such as market
researchers and copywriters.
If your organization has projects of a similar nature going on at the same time,
creating centralized resources is useful. This can save you time because you
don’t have to create resources again and again for each project. It can also
help you to track resources across projects.
You can also pull existing resources from a company address book or your
own Address Book in Outlook. See Book IX, Chapter 4 for information about
importing information into Project.
This collection of enterprise resources is called a resource pool. By using a
resource pool, you can save everybody the time of re-creating the same
resources again and again.
Don’t confuse a resource pool with enterprise resources, which require that
you have Project 2007 Professional, Project Server 2007, and Microsoft Office
Project Web Access set up. With all this in place (see Book X for more about
enterprise projects), you can track and assign resources across an entire
enterprise. A resource pool, on the other hand, is simply a list of resources,
saved on your company server, that several people can assign to projects.
A resource pool saves everybody the trouble of creating these resources
again and again in their individual projects.
Both individual and consolidated resources can be created in a blank project
as a resource pool and saved to an accessible location on your company
server. Then any project manager can call on those resources for his or her
own projects; those projects are then referred to as sharer files because they
share resources with the resource pool. For example, if you have a pool of
maintenance people that everyone in your manufacturing company assigns

Sharing Resources
314
to projects, create a project called Resource Pools and then create all your
enterprise resources in this project. Or you could create a resource called CEO
and let all the people managing projects that require the CEO’s involvement
assign him or her from that central location. Then use the resource-sharing
tools in Project to assign these resources to your plan.
When anyone makes resource assignments in a sharer file, that information
is also saved in the resource pool file. Then anyone can use that file to look
at resource allocations across all projects in the organization.
To access a resource that’s available to your entire organization, follow this
procedure:
1. Choose Tools➪Resource Sharing➪Share Resources.
The Share Resources dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-7.
2. Specify the resources for the project.
If you want to specify that a project will use only its own resources
(the default), select the Use Own Resources option. If you want to share
resources, select the Use Resources option and then choose a project in
the From list.
3. Specify what Project should do when a conflicting resource setting,
such as a different calendar setting in the shared resources and your
project, exists.
If your project’s setting should take precedence, select the Sharer Takes
Precedence option. If you want the pool setting to rule, select Pool Takes
Precedence.
4. Click OK to complete the process.
All resources in the specified resource pool are added to your own pro-
ject’s resource list, ready to be assigned to tasks.

After you add a shared resource to your project, you should periodically
update shared resource information. You want to do this in case the person
who maintains those shared resources has made a change, such as upping
the resource’s rate per hour. To do this, choose Tools➪Resource Sharing➪
Refresh Resource Pool.
If you combine separate projects into one master project at any point,
Project allows you to have duplicate resources. But be careful: If you link the
combined projects and then delete a duplicate resource in the master proj-
ect, it’s deleted in the subproject, as well.
If you share resources across an enterprise, see Book X, Chapter 2 for more
about how to set these up.
When Do My Resources Work?
In Book II, Chapter 4, we cover calendars, including Project, Task, and Resource
calendars. Now that you’re in the thick of working with resources, take a
closer look at how Resource calendars work.
First, be aware that Resource calendar settings take precedence over your
Project and Task calendar settings. You create your Resource calendar based
on a base calendar template that can be Standard, Night Shift, or 24 Hours.
(You can also create custom calendars.)
✦Standard is a typical 9-to-5 workday and five-day workweek.
✦Night Shift is an eight-hour workday, scheduled between 11 p.m. and
8 a.m., with an hour off for a meal, from Monday through Friday.
✦The 24 Hours base calendar shows just what it says: 24 hours per day, 7
days per week.
After you specify a base template for your Resource calendar, you can specify
working hours, such as 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. for a standard
eight-hour day, or 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. for a variation on
that eight-hour day. Finally, you can select specific days when a resource
isn’t available (for example, when someone will be on vacation, at an offsite
conference, or busy on another project) and mark him or her as nonworking.
Avoid micromanaging nonworking time for your resources because that
could drive you crazy. For example, if someone is taking off half a day to go
to the dentist, it’s probably not necessary to set that half day as nonworking,
because you figure the resource will make up the time on the task overall.
However, if a resource is taking a two-week vacation or a three-month sab-
batical, it’s probably a good idea to modify that resource’s Working Time 
calendar.

When Do My Resources Work?
316
To make changes to the Resource calendar and available working times, you
can click the Change Working Time button on the General tab of the Resource
Information dialog box. The Change Working Time dialog box opens (see
Figure 3-8).
To make changes to a resource’s calendar, follow these steps:
1. Display the Resource Sheet.
2. Double-click a resource name.
The Resource Information dialog box appears.
3. Click the Change Working Time button on the General tab.
The Change Working Time dialog box opens.
4. In the Base Calendar box, select a base calendar.
5. If there will be an exception to the default base calendar hours, enter
the Name, Start, and Finish for the exception on the Exceptions tab.
Then click the Details button.
The Details for ‘Exception’ dialog box opens (see Figure 3-9).

E-mailing an Assignment to Your Team
After you work out all your resource assignments on paper, see whether
your ideas will work for your resources’ schedules.
Of course, you should check to see who is available for your project. And
because things can change in the time it takes to work out your plan and
make assignments, make sure that your resources are committed to you
before you commit yourself to a final plan.

If you use Project Server and Project Web Access with Project, you can use
collaborative tools to publish assignments to a server, where people can
review them and accept or decline. For more on Project Web Access, see
Book X, Chapter 3.
You can send your entire project plan to resources as an e-mail attachment
or just send selected tasks. You can also generate a resource assignment
report and send that to people so that they can review their assignments
in detail.
E-mail can be a very useful tool for any project manager. You can use it to
communicate throughout the life of your project and to send your project
plan for review at various stages. One of those stages is the point at which
you want your resources to commit to their task assignments.
You can send your project as an e-mail attachment or as a schedule note,
which is an e-mail with only updated tasks attached; you might send a
schedule note after the project has started when you change or make a new
assignment. You also have the choice of sending an entire plan or just
selected tasks from it.
To send a project as an e-mail attachment, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Send To➪Mail Recipient (as Attachment).
An e-mail form is displayed.
2. Fill in a subject and your e-mail message.
3. Click Send to send the message.
If you want to send a schedule note, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Send To➪Mail Recipient (as Schedule Note).
The Send Schedule Note dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-10, appears.

2. Choose any intended recipients of the message from among Project
Manager, Resources, and Contacts.
3. Select either Entire Project or Selected Resources to specify what to
include in the schedule note.
4. In the Attach area, select what to attach to the e-mail message.
If you select the File option, Project attaches the entire file. If you
instead select the Picture of Selected Resources option, Project attaches
a bitmap picture of the selected tasks in the view you had active when
you started the Send procedure.
Note: If you were in a Resource view when you began this process, this
option reads Picture of Selected Resources, and the resources you had
selected are sent.
5. Click OK.
An e-mail form is displayed.
6. Fill in a subject and your e-mail message.
7. Click Send to send the message.
To help you make sure that e-mails to resources on your project arrived, set
your e-mail program to provide return receipts when messages are received
or read. Check your e-mail client help program to find out how to do this.

Chapter 4: Tallying Costs
In This Chapter
 Reviewing what affects costs
 Determining how Project calculates costs
 Viewing cost data
 Customizing cost fields
 Creating a project summary task
A
fter you’ve created and assigned some resources to your project, you
begin to see your costs mount up at the summary task level. Under-
standing what affects those costs, how Project calculates those costs, and
what cost information Project makes available helps you to understand what
constitutes your Project budget.
In this chapter, we provide a good grounding in the hows and whys of costs
and your Project plan.
How Your Settings Affect Your Budget
In Chapters 2 and 3 of this minibook, you explore costs and assigning
resources to tasks. To help round out this discussion of costs, you should
review all the factors that drive costs. In addition to a resource cost per
hour and a resource base calendar and availability, you assign resources to
tasks at certain percentages. Project uses all these factors to calculate the
cost of a resource assigned to a task. (See the next section to understand
how those calculations work.)
Here’s the real beauty of entering information in Project: After you make set-
tings for your resources, Project does the work of tallying and showing total
costs to you in views, such as the Cost Table of Gantt Chart view shown in
Figure 4-1.

How Your Settings Affect Your Budget
322
For example, suppose you want to assign a production worker to a task.
Here are the specifics:
Base calendar: Night Shift (8 hours, 6 days per week, between 11 p.m.
and 8 a.m.)
Cost per hour: $20
Overtime cost: $30
Availability: 100 percent
Assigned to a two-day task: 50 percent
What’s the cost of this resource? Here’s how it works: Two days at half-time
availability based on an 8-hour calendar is a total of 8 hours (4 hours per
day). The resource incurs no overtime, so the cost is 8 × $20, or $160.
Change one setting for the same resource, and see what you get:
Assigned to a two-day task: 150 percent
Now the resource is working 12 hours per day (150 percent of 8 hours) over
2 days. With 16 total hours at the standard rate ($20) and 8 hours of over-
time ($30), this person costs $560.

How Project Calculates Costs

How Project Calculates Costs
While you enter resource information and assign resources to tasks, Project
is busy making calculations that can shift around task timing and resource
workload in your plan. These calculations relate to how Project updates
tasks, determines the critical path, and calculates earned value. You can, to
some extent, control how Project goes about making these calculations.
Earned value is a calculation that occurs after you have begun your project
and recorded actual work on it. It’s essentially the value of work completed.
A task with $1,000 of costs has an earned value of $750 when the task is 75
percent complete. See Book VIII, Chapter 3 for more about earned value.
Letting Project calculate or doing it yourself?
By default, Project performs calculations automatically. When you make a
change to your plan, Project recalculates totals, the critical path, and so on
without you having to do a thing. However, you can change that default set-
ting and have Project wait for you to initiate calculations manually. You make
this setting on the Calculation tab of the Options dialog box (Tools➪Options).
Figure 4-2 shows the settings available there.
Figure 4-2:
Click the
Calculate
Now button
to make

calculations
on your
command.

How Project Calculates Costs
324
If you change the Calculation mode to Manual, you must either press F9, or
click the Calculate Now button in this dialog box any time you want Project
to perform all its calculations. You also have the choice of affecting All Open
Projects or only the Active Project.
So why would you choose to use manual calculation? One reason might be
that you want to make a lot of changes and not have Project take the milli-
seconds required to recalculate between each change, slowing down your
entry work. You can put things on Manual, make all your changes, and then
use the Calculate Now button to make all the changes at once.
In addition, even with Change Highlighting on it’s not always easy to spot all
the items that have been recalculated when you make a series of changes.
So, it might be easier to make all the changes in Manual mode, print your
Gantt Chart view, and then recalculate and compare the two. This approach
shows you the cumulative calculations that occurred when all your changes
were made so you can see whether you’re happy with the revised plan. (This
feature is especially useful for trying out what-if scenarios.)
In Project 2007, you can also take advantage of the Multiple Undo feature.
This means you can leave your calculations on automatic, make changes,
and then undo them, thereby undoing the calculations in sequence. For
more on Multiple Undo, see Book VII, Chapter 2.
Earned-value options
What do the settings you can make to the earned-value calculation do to
your project? To understand that, start by looking at Figure 4-3, which shows
you the options offered when you click the Earned Value button on the
Calculation tab of the Options dialog box.
Figure 4-3:
Here are
two simple
settings to
use for
calculating
earned
value.

Book V
Chapter 4
Tallying Costs
Examining Cost Data
325
The Default Task Earned Value Method setting provides two choices:
✦% Complete: This setting calculates earned value using the percent com-
plete that you record on each task. This assumes that for a task that’s
halfway complete, half the work hours have been used.
✦Physical % Complete: Use this setting if you want to enter a percent of
completion that isn’t based on a straight percent-complete calculation.
For example, if you have a four-week task to complete a mail survey, 50
percent of the effort might happen in the first 25 percent of the duration
of the project: designing, printing, and mailing the survey. Nothing hap-
pens for two weeks while you wait for responses, and then there’s a
flurry of activity when the responses come back. So a straight calcula-
tion that 50 percent of the task is completed 50 percent of the way
through wouldn’t be accurate. If your projects have a lot of tasks like
this, you might consider changing your settings to use this method.
Then, you can display the Physical % Complete column in your Gantt
Chart sheet pane and enter what you consider more accurate percent-
complete information for each task.
The second setting in the Earned Value dialog box is the Baseline for Earned
Value Calculations drop-down list. As we mention earlier, earned value is the
value of work completed, expressed in dollars, according to the baseline: A
$2,000 task at 50 percent complete (for example) has a $1,000 earned value
of work performed. Therefore, the baseline against which you calculate this
value is hugely important. Choose any of the 11 possible baselines you might
have saved in your project here. After you make these two choices, click
Close to close the Earned Value dialog box.
You should explore one more option in the Options dialog box that concerns
earned-value calculations. The Edits to Total Task % Complete Will Be Spread
to the Status Date option, which isn’t selected by default, affects how Project
distributes changes in your schedule. If you leave this option deselected, cal-
culations go to the end of the duration of tasks in progress, rather than up to
the status date or the current date. If you select this option, calculations
spread changes across your plan up to the status date or the current date,
and no further. Selecting this choice helps you see changes to your project
in increments of time, rather than across the life of tasks in progress.
Our advice is to leave the Edits to Total Task % option not selected for the
most accurate reflection of progress on your project.
Examining Cost Data
After you assign all your resources to tasks and set all your fixed costs, it’s
time for sticker shock. Project will tally all those costs and show you the proj-
ect’s budget. First you have to look at your bottom line, which Project lets

Examining Cost Data
326
you do from several perspectives. Then you might have to get out a sharp
knife and trim those costs down.
Viewing cost information
Several views give you a good idea of what your project will cost and where
those costs are coming from:
✦Gantt Chart view with the Cost Table displayed shows you total cost by
task and a fixed cost column. Several of the columns in this table come
in handy when you begin to track spending on your project and need to
compare actual costs to projected costs.
✦Network Diagram view can also display the Cost Table, showing you a
neat snapshot of each task’s costs within its own task box (see Figure 4-4).
✦Resource Sheet view helps you to review the hourly and overtime rates
of resources currently assigned to your project.
✦Try using filters to display the highest-priced tasks in your project, a
logical place to start trimming your budget. (See Book VII, Chapter 1
for information about using filters.)

327
Customizing cost fields
When you display the Cost Table with fields, such as the Standard Resource
Rate, you can click in any cost column and enter a rate for each resource. A
neat shortcut is to customize those fields with a lookup table.
A lookup table allows you to create a drop-down list of values in a field to
select from. So, if your company has a few standard hourly rates or per-use
costs for materials, customizing these fields can make your information
entry faster and also help prevent data-entry mistakes that can occur when
you enter all rates manually.
To customize a field, follow these steps:
1. Display a table with the column you want to customize.
You display tables by choosing View➪Table and selecting one from the
list that appears.
2. Right-click the column heading and choose Customize Fields from the
shortcut menu that appears.
The Custom Fields dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-5.
3. Click the Lookup button.
The Edit Lookup Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-5:

4. Enter a value (if you’re filling in a cost field, this is a dollar amount) in
the Value column.
5. Enter a description (for example, plant worker or engineer for the cate-
gory of resource charged at this rate) in the Description column.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to enter additional values for this field.
7. If you want to restrict the field to accept only the values in this list,
make sure the Data Entry option Allow Additional Items to be Entered
into the Fields check box is not selected.
You might have to click the plus symbol to the left of Data Entry Options
to see this check box.
8. Click a radio button to select an order for the list (you might have to
click the plus sign to the left of Display Order for Lookup Table to see
these options):
• By Row Number: Lists the items as you’ve listed them in this 
dialog box
• Ascending: Lists them in ascending value order, lowest value first
• Descending: Lists them in descending value order with the highest
value first
9. Click Close and then click OK to save the list and close all dialog
boxes.

A good view to use if you want to see all of a resource’s work assignment
information is Resource Allocation view. You can display it by clicking the
Resource Allocation View button on the Resource Management toolbar, or
you can select it from the More Views dialog box.
The Value of a Project Summary Task
Just as a ship can have only one captain, only one task can summarize all
other tasks in each project. We strongly suggest that you create a project
summary task, which represents the highest (least detailed) level of informa-
tion and is often simply the title of the project, such as New Product Rollout
or Space Shuttle Launch.
A project summary task is created when every task in the project falls under
it in the outline, as shown in Figure 4-7. You can see in the figure that all proj-
ect phase summary tasks are subordinate to the project summary task.
See Book III, Chapter 1 for more about the outline structure of a project plan.

Working with budgets
Company: A medium-sized capital venture
company.
Project: Planning for an office move.
Challenge: The project manager has to budget
the cost of an office move. He wants a way to
track the entire budgeted cost for moving
against several individual costs that are tally-
ing up as he adds resources to individual tasks.
Solution: The project manager can specify a
resource as a budget resource by selecting the
Budget check box in the Resource Information
dialog box, shown in the following figure. He
can then assign these resources to the proj-
ect’s single summary task. Using budget
resources, he can display fields that allow him
to compare budgeted work with planned work.
(Believe us, there’s often a difference.) For
example, he might have $10,000 budgeted for
mover time, and he might have planned to use
$11,450 of resource work for the move. The
budget setting can help him compare these
amounts as you add and delete resources from
various tasks.
If you assign a budget resource, you can use
Task Usage view or Resource Usage view to
enter a work amount for that resource. You can
view budgeted work by displaying the Budget
Work field. Note that this field reflects only
Material and Work resource type costs. You
can use the Budget Cost field to view the bud-
geted amount for Cost resource types.

Book V
Chapter 4
Tallying Costs
The Value of a Project Summary Task
331
The highest-level headline in an outline reflects the sum of all the items
below it. The project summary task rolls up all the actual data from other
tasks into one line item. Thus, the project summary task’s duration reflects
the duration of the entire project. From a cost angle, the project summary
task’s total cost reflects the total costs for the entire project. Being able to
see your total bottom line costs at a glance is one of the things that make a
summary task so useful.
The length of your summary task can be a bit confusing. Remember that the
summary task duration is the difference between the earliest task start date
and latest task end date. However, nonworking days aren’t counted in the
summary task duration. The length of the summary task, therefore, equals
the number of days of work over the course of the subtasks, not the number
of calendar days between the start of the first task and end of the last.
Not everyone uses project summary tasks. You can simply create tasks
that summarize tasks within project phases — with subphases and sub-
tasks below them — and not create a project summary task. However,
there are two good reasons for creating a project summary task:
✦You can quickly view totals for both time and money for the project at
a glance in the columns of data in Gantt Chart view and other views.
✦You can place a link to your project summary task in another project
so that all data for one project is reflected in another. For example, if
you create five schedules for new product launches in your company,
you can easily create a master schedule for all company product launches
by linking to the project summary tasks in each of the projects.
As you build your project, you can easily create a project summary task
yourself by simply indenting other tasks beneath it. But if you neglect to do
this till later in your planning, you can use a Project feature to generate this
summary task automatically at any time — even after you build all the
phases of your project.
To have Project automatically create a project summary task, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Options dialog box appears.
2. Click the View tab to display it (see Figure 4-8).

iew is the term Project uses to describe a way for you to look at proj-
ect information; a view offers you a perspective of your project. As the
project manager, you’re actually going to want to look at your project from
many different perspectives, and Project contains a wealth of views to
accommodate you. If you can’t find what you want using one of the built-in
views, you can always create your own view. Project also lets you sort, filter,
and group information in views, which helps you focus on different issues.
Network Diagram view and Calendar view behave a little differently than all
the other Project views; you can customize these two views using tech-
niques described in Book IX, Chapter 2.
What’s a View?
When it comes to looking at the information in your project, you’re going to
want to look at it in a variety of ways so you can focus on particular issues.
For example, you’ll want to view the tasks in your project without concern
for the resources assigned to the tasks. Then you’re going to want to focus
on the resource assignments for the project. Also, you’ll find that you want
to look at different information concerning tasks; for example, you might
want to look at baseline information, and then you might want to review
task costs. Similarly, you’ll want to look at different types of information for
resources.
Of course, you can try to look at all the information using only one view, but
that would result in confusion instead of clarity. So, Project provides 28

What’s a View?
336
built-in views to let you look at your project from a variety of perspectives. If
one of these built-in views doesn’t meet your needs, you can create your
own view.
Book II, Chapter 3 contains a lot of really good information that should help
you decide what view to use, depending on the circumstances.
You can classify the views in Project into three types:
✦Chart or graph views
✦Form views
✦Table or sheet views
Chart or graph views present information by using pictures. Relationship
Diagram view, shown in Figure 1-1, is a chart view.
Form views present information the same way that a paper form presents
information. A form displays information about a single item (or task) in
your project. The Task Form shown in Figure 1-2 is a form view.
Figure 1-1:
Relationship
Diagram
view is a
chart view.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Working with
Views
What’s a View?
337
Table or sheet views present information in rows and columns, similar to the
way that a spreadsheet program presents information. Resource Sheet view,
shown in Figure 1-3, is a table view. Each row of the table contains all the
information about one resource in your project, and each column represents
a field that identifies the information that you’re storing about the resource.
Shortcut menus are available in many views; right-click anyplace on the view
to see a shortcut menu.
Each table view actually comprises a variety of tables, and you can easily
switch to any of these variations. In Chapter 2 of this minibook, you find out
more about tables.
Finally, Project contains combination views, like the Task Entry view shown
in Figure 1-4, that combine two of the types of views just described. In a com-
bination view, one view appears in the top half of the screen while another
appears in the bottom half. Later in this chapter, you discover how to work
with combination views.

Making a View Handy to Display
339
Selecting the Startup View
By default, the first view you see when you open Project is Gantt Chart view.
But suppose, after working in Project awhile, that you discover you really
work most in Task Usage view. Can you make that view appear when you
open Project? Yes. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the View tab shown in Figure 1-5.
3. In the Default View drop down list, click the view you want to use as
your default view.
4. Click OK.
Project displays the view you select the next time you open Project.
Making a View Handy to Display
Even though you can select a default view, you probably have several views
that you use regularly, and you want an easy way to display those views. You
can easily add those views to the View menu or the View bar that can appear
down the left side of the Project window (see Figure 1-6).
Figure 1-5:

Displaying the View bar is a matter of personal preference; the View bar
appears when you choose View➪View Bar. When you hide the View bar, the
name of the current view appears on a thin bar at the left edge of the view.
Suppose that you’ve taken a real liking to Relationship Diagram view
because you like its visual presentation of predecessor and successor tasks.
To easily display it by adding it to the View menu and the View bar, follow
these steps:
1. Choose View➪More Views.
The More Views dialog box appears (see Figure 1-7).

You can remove any views you seldom use from the View menu and the View
bar. To remove a view from the View menu and the View bar, repeat this pro-
cedure but deselect the Show in Menu check box.
Sorting Tasks in a View
Different people find different techniques work well when they’re trying to
organize large sets of information. And, planning a project can be an exercise
in organizing large sets of information.
Sorting tasks in your project schedule is one technique you can use to organ-
ize a project’s information to help you focus on particular aspects of the
project. You can sort a project from most views in almost any way that you
want. For example, in Gantt Chart view, Project automatically sorts tasks by
ID (see Figure 1-9). But you might find it easier to view your project informa-
tion if you sort by cost. Choose Project➪Sort➪By Cost, and Project reorders
Gantt Chart view so that tasks are ordered by cost, and row numbers
become nonsequential (see Figure 1-10).

Filtering a View
343
The five most common sort keys appear when you choose Project➪Sort, but
if you choose the Sort By command at the bottom of the submenu, the Sort
dialog box appears (see Figure 1-11). From this dialog box, you can select
from a wide variety of fields on which to sort your project. And, you can set
up three sort keys so that Project can break any “ties” it finds while sorting.
For example, if Project finds a tie at the first level, it uses the second sort
that you specify to break the tie. Project uses the third sort key to break ties
at the second level.
Using the check boxes at the bottom of the dialog box, you can make your
sort choices permanent by reassigning Task IDs, and you can choose to
retain the outline structure of the project.
Filtering a View
Filtering is another technique you can use to help you focus on a particular
aspect of your project. When you filter, you specify criteria, and Project
either limits the information that appears in the view or highlights the infor-
mation that meets the criteria. For example, you can view only the tasks
assigned to a certain resource, or you can highlight the tasks on the critical
path of your project.
The filters available to you in a particular view are dependent on the view’s
primary purpose. For example, Gantt Chart view is primarily a task-oriented
view, so you can apply task-related filters to the view. On the other hand, the
Resource Sheet is a resource-oriented view, so the only filters available to
you are resource filters. Table 1-1 lists alphabetically each task filter and the
information Project displays when you apply one of these filters. Table 1-2
lists similar information for the available resource filters.

Applying a filter to a view
Because you can apply task filters to task views only and resource filters to
resource views only, the filters you can select depend on the view that you
display before starting these steps:
1. Display the view that you want to filter.
2. Choose Project➪Filtered For.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Working with
Views
Filtering a View
347
Project displays a list of the most commonly used filters.
3. Choose the filter that you want to apply.
Project applies the filter you selected.
You can quickly determine that Project is filtering information by looking at
the ID column. The ID numbers for hidden tasks or resources don’t appear.
To apply a filter that doesn’t appear on the list or to apply a highlighting
filter, follow these steps:
1. Display the view that you want to filter.
2. Choose Project➪Filtered For➪More Filters.
Project displays the More Filters window (see Figure 1-12).
3. Select a filter name from the list.
4. Click Apply to apply the filter or click Highlight to apply a highlight-
ing filter.
If the filter that you want to apply requires additional information, such
as a date range, type the information Project requests.
5. Click OK.
Project applies the filter.
If you highlight tasks or resources that meet the criteria, Project displays the
information that meets the criteria in blue.
To turn off a filter, choose Project➪Filtered For. Then choose All Tasks or All
Resources, as appropriate for the filtered view.

You can use
the More

Creating custom filters
Yes, you guessed it: You can create a new filter or modify an existing filter.
Because creating and editing a filter are very similar activities, follow these
steps to edit an existing filter, and after the steps, we tell you the changes to
make to create a new filter:
1. Display the view that you want to filter.
2. Choose Project➪Filtered For➪More Filters.
Project opens the More Filters window.
3. Highlight the filter that you want to modify.
4. Click the Copy button.
Project displays the Filter Definition dialog box (see Figure 1-13).
Any changes that you make to a filter are permanent. For this reason, we
suggest that you click the Copy button to make a copy of a filter that you
want to modify, rather than clicking the Edit button to edit the original
filter.
5. Click in the Name box and type a new name for your filter.
6. Click in the Field Name column.
Project displays a list box arrow to the right of the field.
7. Select a field from the list.
8. Click in the Test column and select a comparison operator from the
list.
9. Click in the Value(s) column and supply a filtering value.
10. Repeat Steps 6 through 9 for each criterion that you want to create.
Figure 1-13:
Use this
dialog box
to edit an

Also supply an And/Or operator if you supply additional criteria.
If you use “And,” Project displays information only if the task or
resource meets all criteria. If you use “Or,” the filter displays information
if a task or resource meets any of the criteria.
11. Click OK.
Project redisplays the More Filters window.
12. Click Apply.
Project closes the More Filters window and applies the filter.
To create a new filter, click the New button in Step 4 above. In the Filter
Definition dialog box, the name Filter 1 appears in the Name box and no
information appears at the bottom of the box. Type a name for the new filter
and enter some filtering criteria using the techniques described in Steps 5–10.
To have your new filter appear in the Filtered For list, select the Show in
Menu check box.
Each line that appears in the Filter Definition dialog box is called a statement.
To have Project evaluate certain statements together, but separate from
other statements in your filter, group the statements into a set of criteria by
leaving a blank line between sets of criteria. On the blank line, select either
operator in the And/Or field.
If your filter contains three or more statements within one criteria group,
Project evaluates all And statements before evaluating Or statements. Across
groups, Project evaluates And statements in the order in which they appear.
Using AutoFilters
AutoFilters are a way to filter information on any table view by selecting a
value for any table column directly on the table. When you turn on Auto-
Filters, Project displays a list box arrow at the right edge of each column
heading (see Figure 1-14). You can turn on AutoFilters by clicking the
AutoFilters button on the Formatting toolbar.
When you click an arrow, Project displays a list of values available for that
column. When you select a value, Project filters the information in the table
to display only those tasks that meet the filter’s criteria. In Figure 1-13, we fil-
tered by a Finish Date of This Week, and Project displayed only those tasks
scheduled to finish during the current week. First, notice that the task num-
bers are no longer in numerical order. Then look at the timescale in the
Gantt Chart portion of the window; you can see that all the tasks end within
a short window of time.

Filtering a View
350
Project displays the column heading by which you’re filtering in blue,
whereas other column heading titles are black — the difference is difficult to
see in this black-and-white book.
If you decide that you really like AutoFilters, you can have Project display
them automatically for each new project you create. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the General tab.
3. Select the Set AutoFilter On For New Projects check box (see 
Figure 1-15).
4. Click OK.
The next time you create a new project, AutoFilter list box arrows auto-
matically appear.

Grouping Information
351
Grouping Information
Grouping is a variation on sorting and filtering. When you use grouping in
Project, you tell Project to group tasks based on criteria you select. Grouping
differs from sorting because grouping doesn’t assign an order to the tasks or
hide any tasks from view.
Using a predefined group
You can group tasks in a variety of predefined ways, but the predefined
groups are based on the type of view; that is, the available predefined groups
differ, depending on whether you start in a task view or a resource view. To
group tasks based on whether they’re on the critical path, follow these
steps:
1. Display a task view that you want to use to group tasks.
2. Choose Project➪Group By.
Project displays a list of predefined groups (see Figure 1-16). By default,
Project doesn’t group tasks, so No Group is selected.
Figure 1-15:
Set up
Project to
auto-
matically
display

whenever
you start a
new project.

Grouping Information
352
You also can open the Group By list on the Standard toolbar.
3. Click the group that you want to apply.
In this example, we chose Critical.
When you establish groups, Project adds headings for each group in yellow
highlighting that you can’t see in this black-and-white book; in Figure 1-17,
we’ve grouped the tasks based on whether they’re critical in the project.
To turn off grouping, choose Project➪Group By. Then choose No Group.
Alternatively, select No Group from the Group By list on the Standard 
toolbar.
Grouping and usage views
If you start in a usage view, you also can group on assignment fields. In the
steps that follow, we started working from Resource Usage view, where you
have the option of grouping by assignment or by resource. If you start work-
ing from Task Usage view, the names of some of the options change to refer
to tasks instead of resources. In addition, you have the choice of grouping by
assignment or by task.

Do-it-yourself groups
As you might suspect, you’re not limited to using the groups that come pre-
defined with Project; you can create your own groups. Follow these steps:
1. Display the view that you want to use to group tasks.
2. Choose Project➪Group By➪More Groups.
Project displays the More Groups dialog box (see Figure 1-20).

4. Select a group name from the list.
5. Click Copy.
Project displays the Group Definition dialog box (see Figure 1-21), which
contains a copy of the settings of the group you selected in Step 4.
Because any changes that you make to a group are permanent, we sug-
gest that you make a copy of a group and modify the copy instead of
editing the original group.

7. Open the Field Name list box and select a field on which you want
Project to group.
8. In the Order column, choose Ascending or Descending.
You can select a font for the grouping title information and change the
cell background and the pattern that Project displays for the field. You
also can include summary tasks in the grouping by selecting the Show

12. Click OK.
Project saves your choices and redisplays the More Groups window.
13. Click Apply to apply the group you just defined or click Close.
Using Combination Views
In addition to the 28 views that exist in Project, you can create combination
views, where Project splits the screen horizontally and displays one view in
the top pane and another in the bottom pane. In fact, Task Entry view, shown
in Figure 1-23, is a combination view by default.

From this
dialog box,

When you work in a combination view, the bottom pane displays the infor-
mation about the task or resource you select in the top pane. So, click a task
or resource in the top pane to select it; then, click the bottom pane to make
it the active pane and make changes to the task or resource as needed.
The name of the view appears in a bar that runs down the left side of the
screen; the active pane’s bar is darker than the inactive pane’s bar.
You can easily display a combination view by following these steps:
1. Display the first view you want to see by using the View bar or View
menu.
2. Choose Windows➪Split.
Project splits the window (see Figure 1-24), displaying either Task Form
view or Resource Form view in the bottom pane.
Project selects the appropriate form for the bottom pane based on the
view in the top pane. If the view in the top pane is a task view, Project
displays Task Form view in the bottom pane. Similarly, if a resource view
appears in the top pane, Project displays Resource Form view in the
bottom pane.

While you work in a combination view, Project assumes you want to con-
tinue working in a combination view. So, if you switch views, Project displays
the view you select in whichever pane was active at the time you made the
switch.
To return to viewing only one view on-screen, choose Window➪Remove
Split. Project hides the view in the bottom pane and fills the screen with the
view that appears in the top pane.
Shortcut to display a combination view
Are you the type of person who prefers to
avoid menus? Here’s a quick and easy way to
create a combination view. Move your pointer
to the split bar, which is in the lower-right
corner of the Project window, just below the
vertical scroll bar. When the pointer becomes
two horizontal lines with arrows, the way it
appears in the figure, double-click. Or, you can
also drag the split bar toward the top of your
screen. You can return to a single view by
double-clicking the split bar again.

Customizing a View
360
Customizing a View
Suppose that you work regularly in the default Gantt Chart view, but you find
that you really want to see the Baseline table instead of the Entry table the
majority of the time that you use Gantt Chart view. You can change the
default table that Project displays for the view each time you display the
view. You also can change the grouping and filtering displayed with the view.
For example, if you know you always want tasks grouped as complete and
incomplete, you can assign that grouping to the view. Or, if you know you
want to view only critical tasks, you can assign that filtering to the view.
You can approach this process from two perspectives:
✦You can make changes to one of the default views in Project and save
those changes so that they appear each time you select that default
view.
✦You can make a copy of a default view, give it a name that describes
what it shows, and then make the changes to the copy.
We prefer the second approach for the following reasons:
✦The default views continue to display the information designed by the
folks who wrote the program — and they tend to be folks who consider
what most people need most of the time.
✦You can create several versions of the same view and use the appropri-
ate version when needed. For example, you might want to be able to
quickly view both the default Gantt Chart view and a version of Gantt
Chart view that uses the Baseline table. If you assign your new version
to the View menu and View bar, you can quickly switch between the two
versions of Gantt Chart view.
✦If you don’t assign the views to the View menu or View bar, you can
quickly and easily find the version of the view that you want to use,
because you’ve given it a name that is meaningful to you.
So, in the steps that follow, we show you a hybrid process that you can use
to create a new view by making changes to a copy of an existing view:
1. Choose View➪More Views.
The More Views dialog box appears.
2. Click the view you want to change.
3. Click Copy.
The View Definition dialog box appears (see Figure 1-26).

to select the view from the View menu. Be careful not to select any of the
letters that Project already uses on the View menu: C, G, D, K, N, A, S, U,
M, O, B, T, V, H, and Z.
5. If the view you copied permits, select a table from the Table list box.
6. From the Group list box, select a group to apply to the view.
7. From the Filter list box, select a filter to apply to the view.
If you apply a filter, you can have Project highlight filtered tasks without
hiding tasks that don’t meet the filter criteria. Select the Highlight Filter
check box at the bottom of the View Definition dialog box.
8. Select the Show in Menu check box to add the view to the View menu
and the View bar.

Printing Your Project
Project contains many reports that you can print that format the information
in your project in a variety of ways. However, many times, you simply want
to print what you’re looking at on-screen. Well, here’s some good news: You
can print any view of your project.
If you’re printing a sheet view, the number of columns that you see on-screen
determines the number of columns that print. If your project view doesn’t fit
on one page, Project prints down first and then across; that is, the entire left
side of your project prints before the right side prints.
To print a particular view, display that view on-screen. Then click the Print
button on the Standard toolbar to print using default settings.
And what are the default settings? They appear in two dialog boxes that
appear if you don’t use the Print button.
You can also preview before printing by clicking the Print Preview button on
the Standard toolbar.
Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box. From the Print dialog box,
shown in Figure 1-29, you can
✦Select a printer to use.
✦Specify the number of copies you print.
✦Select pages to print.
✦Specify portions of the timescale to print.
✦Indicate whether Project should recognize and use manual page
breaks.

Printing Your Project
364
When you save the project file, Project saves the settings that you make in
the Print dialog box.
The Page Setup dialog box controls a wide variety of print settings for a view.
You can display the dialog box by choosing File➪Page Setup. From the Page
tab, shown in Figure 1-30, you can set orientation and scaling. Using scaling,
you might be able to fit the printed text onto one page.
Suppose that your project is ten pages long, but you intend to print only
pages 5 and 6. Typically, you want to number those pages as 1 and 2. To do
that, enter 1 in the First Page Number box.
From the Margins tab, shown in Figure 1-31, you can change the margins for
your printed text and specify whether a border should appear.

Views and pagination
Project automatically inserts page breaks in a
view based on the amount of information in the
view and the paper size you select. However,
sometimes you might want to insert a manual
page break. For example, you might want to
insert a manual page break to start each sum-
mary task and its subtasks on a new page.
You can insert manual page breaks by follow-
ing these steps:
1. Select the task (or resource) that should
appear at the top of a new page.
2. Choose Insert➪Page Break.
Project inserts a manual page break, which
appears as a dotted line in the view.
To make sure that Project uses these manual
page breaks, select the Manual Page Breaks
check box in the Print dialog box.
You can remove manual page breaks by select-
ing the task below the page break and choos-
ing Insert➪Remove Page Break.

Using the Header tab, shown in Figure 1-32, you can define and align informa-
tion to appear on the top of every page. Use the General list box at the bottom
of the Header tab to add information that Project updates automatically,
such as page numbers. Using the Project Fields list box, you can include
Project fields in the header.
The Footer tab looks and works just like the Header tab. You can align and
include the Project fields and updating information such as page numbers in
the footer on each page of your printed text.
The Page Setup dialog box changes just slightly, depending on the view that
you displayed before opening the dialog box. For example, the Legend tab,
shown in Figure 1-33, is available only when you’re printing a Calendar, Gantt
Chart, or Network Diagram view. The Legend tab works just like the Header

and Footer tabs; you can align and include Project fields and information
that updates such as page numbers, and you can specify how and where the

The View tab, shown in Figure 1-34, enables you to control what Project
prints; for example, you can choose to print all or only some columns.
The Print Row Totals For Values Within Print Date Range and Print Column
Totals check boxes appear on the View tab in Task Usage view and Resource

columns of data, before any Notes pages.
In many cases, you can add a column to a table that gives you the same
information that you can get in the row totals. The column prints where you
place it, whereas the row totals print on a separate page.

you display a view; you can switch to a different table to see different infor-
mation. You also can control the fields that Project displays in a table and
even create your own tables.
Understanding Tables
If you use a spreadsheet program like Excel, tables should remind you of a
spreadsheet. Project presents information in a row/column format, and you
make changes to project information by using the fields on the table. Each
table in Project helps you focus on and change different kinds of informa-
tion. The default table that appears in Gantt Chart view, for example, is the
Entry table (see Figure 2-1). Using the Entry table, you can set up basic
information (such as the task name and estimated duration) as you add
tasks to your project.
Take a look at some of the commonly used task tables. The Cost table,
shown in Figure 2-2, helps you focus on the estimated, baseline, actual, and
remaining costs associated with your project.
Use the Schedule table (see Figure 2-3) when you’re trying to resolve alloca-
tion issues. The Schedule table helps you identify tasks with slack that can
afford to slip; you might be able to change those tasks to help alleviate over-
allocation issues.
Use the Tracking table (see Figure 2-4) to record information that describes
when tasks start and finish. As you record information in some of the fields
in this table, Project calculates the other fields for you. Project also uses the
“actual” information that you record to calculate the actual cost of a task.

372
The Variance table (see Figure 2-5) helps you compare baseline start and
finish dates with actual start and finish dates; using this table can help you
determine when a project fell behind schedule (or got ahead of schedule!).
The Summary table (see Figure 2-6) gives you a great overview of project
information, including estimated duration, start and finish dates, percent
complete, cost, and work for each task.
You can easily switch to the most commonly used tables for any particular
view if you right-click the Select All button, which is the gray square that
appears just above Row 1 in any view with a table (see Figure 2-7). The list of
“most commonly used tables” that appears for task views is different than
the list that appears for resource views. To switch to a different table, simply
click the table you want.
Clicking (instead of right-clicking) the Select All button selects all informa-
tion in the table portion of the view.

Understanding Indicators
373
As you would expect, Project contains more tables than those shown when
you right-click the Select All button. In fact, Project contains 17 tables that
you can use when viewing task information and 10 tables that you can use
when viewing resource information. If the table you want to use isn’t on the
menu that appears when you right-click the Select All button, choose More
Tables. Project opens the More Tables dialog box (see Figure 2-8). Click the
Resource option button to see the tables available in resource views.
Understanding Indicators
In the Entry table shown earlier in Figure 2-1, notice the Indicators column,
the second column in the table, appearing to the right of the ID column.
Indicators represent additional information about the row in which they
appear. For example, a Notes indicator like the one shown in Figure 2-9
appears in the Indicators column if you assign a note to a task or resource.
Figure 2-6:
The
Summary
table

Understanding Indicators
374
To determine the purpose of an indicator, point the mouse pointer at it.
Project tells you what the indicator means or displays additional information
to remind you of important details. See the Project Help topic, “About Indica-
tors,” for a complete list of each indicator icon and its meaning. The follow-
ing is a list of some of the more common indicators you’ll run across:
✦Constraint indicators identify the type of constraint that’s assigned to
a task. You see a constraint indicator if you assign any constraint to a
task other than As Soon As Possible. You also see a constraint indicator
if the task hasn’t been completed within the timeframe of the constraint.

375
You can read about constraints in Book IV, Chapter 4.
✦Task type indicators identify special conditions about a task, such as
whether the task is recurring or whether it has been completed. Task
type indicators also identify the inserted projects.
You can find out more about recurring tasks in Book III, Chapter 1 and
inserted projects in Book III, Chapter 4.
✦Workgroup indicators provide some information about the task and
its resources. For example, a workgroup indicator can tell you that a
task has been assigned but that the resource hasn’t yet confirmed the
assignment.
✦Contour indicators identify the type of contouring that is used to dis-
tribute the work assigned to the task.
✦Miscellaneous indicators identify items, such as a note or a hyperlink,
that you created; calendars that have been assigned to a task; or
resources that need leveling.

Making Changes to a Table
376
Making Changes to a Table
In addition to using the various tables, you can change tables by adding or
deleting fields, moving columns to different positions, and changing the
width of columns or the height of rows.
Inserting and hiding table fields
Each column in a table represents a field of project information. You can
temporarily remove a column from a table by hiding it.
To hide a column, place the mouse pointer on the right boundary of the
column heading. When the mouse pointer changes to a vertical bar with left-
and right-pointing arrows, drag the right column boundary to meet the left
column boundary. When you release the mouse button, the column disap-
pears. In Figure 2-10, we’re going to hide the Predecessors column.
When you hide a column, Project doesn’t remove the data in the column
from the file; instead, Project simply hides the data from view.
Figure 2-10:
You can
hide a
column by
dragging 
its right
boundary to
meet its left
boundary.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Working with
Tables
Making Changes to a Table
377
To see the column again or to add a different column to your table, follow
these steps:
1. Right-click the column heading that you want to appear to the right of
the column that you’re going to insert.
In Figure 2-11, we’re going to add the Predecessor column back into the
Entry table so that it appears to the left of the Resource Names column.
2. Choose Insert Column from the shortcut menu that appears.
The Column Definition dialog box appears (see Figure 2-12).
3. In the Field Name list box, select the name of the column that you
want to add.
If you leave the Title box blank, Project assigns the field name to the
column. You can supply a title for the column if you prefer something
other than the field name.
4. Click the Best Fit button.
Project inserts the column to the left of the selected column, and
because you clicked the Best Fit button, Project makes the column wide
enough to accommodate the column title. (If you don’t feel the need for
a neat and tidy column, click OK instead of Best Fit.)
Figure 2-11:
Project
inserts new
columns to
the left of
the selected
column.

Making Changes to a Table
378
Changing column width
In some cases, you might not be able to see all the information in a column.
In particular, if pound signs (#) fill a column, as they do in the Start column
in Figure 2-13, the column isn’t wide enough to display the information that
appears in it.
You can widen the column by dragging the right edge of the column heading
boundary to the right. When you move the mouse pointer over the column
heading boundary, it changes to a vertical bar with left- and right-pointing
arrows, as shown earlier in Figure 2-10.
Figure 2-13:
When you
see pound
signs (#) in 
a field, 
the column
isn’t wide
enough to

information

Chapter 2

Making Changes to a Table
379
To quickly and easily make a column wide enough to accommodate the
longest entry in the column, place the mouse pointer over the right bound-
ary of the column heading and double-click. Project automatically adjusts
the size of the column to display the longest entry in the column.
You might be tempted to try this technique on the Task Name column, but
we recommend, instead, that you read the next section. If you widen the
Task Name column to accommodate the longest entry in it, you might have
trouble viewing any other information.
Changing row height
Unless you’re using a wide monitor, it isn’t really practical to widen the Task
Name column to accommodate the longest entry in the column, because
you’ll have to scroll back and forth to see information. However, to see Task
Name information, you can increase the height of rows. When you change
the height of a row, Project wraps the data in the row to fit within the taller
row. In many cases, increasing row height makes all the information in the
Task Name column visible.
You can’t read the complete names of many of the tasks in Figure 2-13. But, if
you increase the row height, task names wrap so that they’re visible. In
Figure 2-14, we increased the height of all rows in the file.
Figure 2-14:
When you
increase
row height,
Project
wraps
information
in columns.

Making Changes to a Table
380
To change row height, follow these steps:
1. Move the mouse pointer into the Task ID number column at the
bottom of the row you want to change.
The mouse pointer changes to a pair of arrows pointing up and down
(see Figure 2-15).
To change the height of more than one row, select each row that you
want to change. Use Windows selection techniques to select the rows.
For example, to select two noncontiguous rows, click the ID of the first
row and then press and hold Ctrl while you click the ID of the second
row. To change the height of all rows, click the Select All button.
2. Drag down.
3. Release the mouse button.
Project increases the height of the selected row and wraps text in that
row to fill the new row space.
You can change row heights only in full row increments. That is, you can
make a row twice its original size but not one and a half times its original
size.

In this
figure, we’re
about to
change the
height of

Customizing Tables
381
Customizing Tables
Suppose that you want a table that compares baseline and actual informa-
tion, but you want the columns in the table to appear in the order of
Baseline Start, Actual Start, Baseline Finish, and Actual Finish. The tables
you’ve reviewed tend to list the information in the order of Baseline Start,
Baseline Finish, Actual Start, and Actual Finish. You can create your own
table that will display the information in the order you want it to appear.
And, you can make your table — or any table — appear on the shortcut
menu that appears when you right-click the Select All button.
As with views, you can approach this process from two perspectives:
✦You can make changes to one of the default tables in Project and save
those changes so that they appear each time you select that default
table.
✦You can make a copy of a default table, give it a name that describes
what it shows, and then make the changes to the copy.
We prefer the second approach for the following reasons:
✦The default tables continue to display the information designed by the
folks who wrote the program — and they tend to be folks who consider
what most people need most of the time.
✦You can create several versions of the same table and use the appropri-
ate version when needed.
✦If you don’t assign your table to the shortcut menu that appears when
you right-click the Select All button, you can quickly and easily find the
version of the table that you want to use, because you’ve given it a name
that is meaningful to you.
So, in the steps that follow, we show you a hybrid process that you can use
to create a new table by making changes to a copy of an existing table:
1. Choose View➪Table➪More Tables.
Project displays the More Tables dialog box, shown in Figure 2-16.
2. Click the Task or Resource option buttons at the top of the window to
display the type of table that you need.
3. Select a table from the list of tables.
4. Click the Copy button.
The Table Definition dialog box appears (see Figure 2-17).

Customizing Tables
382
If you clicked New in Step 4, no information appears in the bottom por-
tion of the dialog box.
5. Supply a meaningful name for the table in the Name text box.
6. Select the Show in Menu check box.
If you select this check box, Project lists this table in the shortcut menu
that appears when you right-click the Select All button.
7. To replace an existing field, click that field in the Field Name column.
You see an arrow on the right side of the field.
8. Click the arrow to display the drop-down list and select a field name.
To add a field to the table, click a blank space in the area under the Field
Name column. To add a field between existing fields, click the field
below the field that you want to add and click Insert Row. To delete a
field, click that field in the Field Name column and click Delete Row.

9. For the field you’re replacing or adding, click in the Align Data
column to display an arrow on the right side of the field.
10. Select Left, Center, or Right alignment for the data in the column.
11. Click OK.
Project redisplays the More Tables dialog box.
12. Click Apply and then close the More Tables dialog box.
A few other options in the Table Definition dialog box bear mentioning:
✦Enter a title for the column if you don’t want to use the default field
name.
✦If you have any columns that include dates, such as Start or Finish infor-
mation, you can modify the date format by using the drop-down list of
choices in the Date Format list box.
✦You can modify the height of all the rows in the table by using the Row
Height spinner box.
✦The Header Wrapping field, a Yes or No choice, controls whether long
titles wrap within the column heading. If you set the Header Wrapping
field to No, Project hides the portion of a column title that doesn’t fit
within the allotted space for the column.
✦You can select the Lock First Column check box if you want the first
column of your table to remain on-screen while you scroll across your
page.
If you want a table that you create or change to be available in all Project
files, click the Organizer button in the More Tables window to copy the table
to the Global.mpt file. See Book IX, Chapter 1 for more information about
using the Organizer.
Working with the Details of Usage Views
Project contains two usage views: Task Usage view and Resource Usage view.
Both views display assignment information that’s distributed over time, and
Project refers to this information as timephased information. The left side of
both views contains a table like the ones presented earlier in this chapter.
The right side of both views contains the timephased information; Project
refers to the right side of the view as the Details section. In Figure 2-18, you
see Task Usage view, and in Figure 2-19, you see Resource Usage view.

The tables on the left side of these views function just like the tables in any
other view; the Details portion of the view, however, is a slightly different
kind of table. You can display additional information in the Details section by
adding rows (instead of adding columns, like you do in other tables).
By default, the Work field appears in the Details section of both usage views.
As with other tables, you can add some commonly used fields to the Details
section if you right-click anywhere in the Details section and then choose the
appropriate field from the shortcut menu that appears (see Figure 2-20).
Instead of right-clicking the Details section, you can Choose Format➪Details
to display the commonly used fields.
Each field you add to the Details section of a usage view increases the size of
all of the rows in the table on the left side of the view.
Adding new fields to the Details section
In addition to the commonly used fields, you can add many other fields to
the Details section of a usage view. If you find yourself adding a particular
field on a regular basis, you can add that field to the shortcut menu that dis-
plays the list of commonly used fields.
Figure 2-20:
When you
right-click
the Details
section,

Working with the Details of Usage Views
386
You enter values for a budget Work resource or a budget Cost resource by
using a usage view. You can add these fields to the shortcut menu to have
easy access to them.
To add a field to the Details section that doesn’t appear on the shortcut
menu, follow these steps:
1. From either usage view, choose Format➪Detail Styles.
Project displays the Detail Styles dialog box (see Figure 2-21).
2. In the Available Fields list, click a field.
You can use Windows selection techniques to select more than one field
simultaneously. To select noncontiguous fields, click the first field and
then press and hold Ctrl while you click another field. To select contigu-
ous fields, click the first field and then press and hold Shift while you
click the last field.
3. Click the Show button.
The field then appears in the Show These Fields list.
4. Select the Show in Menu check box to make these fields appear on the
shortcut menu.
5. Click OK.
Project displays a row for the field in the Details portion of the view.
Hiding fields in the Details section
You hide fields in the Details section of a usage view the same way you dis-
play them: Right-click anywhere in the Details section and click the field you

want to hide. Project removes the field from the Details portion of the view.
Remember, the information remains in your Project file; it’s just hidden from
view.
The Work, Actual Work, Cumulative Work, Overallocation, Cost, and Remaining
Availability fields remain available from the shortcut menu even after you
hide them.
Other fields you add to the Details section of a usage view by using the Detail
Styles dialog box might behave differently, and their behavior is determined
by whether you select the Show in Menu check box mentioned in Step 4 in
the preceding section. If you select the Show in Menu check box, Project adds
the field to both the Details section and to the shortcut menu. If you then
hide the field, you can redisplay it by using the shortcut menu.
But, if you don’t select the Show in Menu check box when you add the field
to the Details section, Project adds the field to the Details section but not to
the shortcut menu. If you then hide the field in the Details section, you can’t
use the shortcut menu to redisplay it; you need to follow the steps in the
preceding section again to redisplay the field.

W
hat do we mean by “traditional” reports? Will you hear Tevye from
Fiddler on the Roof singing “Tradition” when you print them?
Although it’s a novel idea, we haven’t managed to convince Microsoft that
the musical accompaniment would be the way to go. We’ll keep working 
on that.
Meanwhile, we call them “traditional” reports only because they resemble
the types of reports you’re used to viewing. The reports you see in this
chapter are text-based reports, typically presenting information in rows and
columns. In the next chapter of this minibook, you see the visual reports
available in Project; visual reports present information by using pictures.
Both types of reports have a place in the reporting process; the text-based
reports you see in this chapter present details that aren’t obvious in visual
reports.
Preparing and Printing Reports
Project organizes text reports into categories of reports that are related to
the same subject; for example, all the cost reports cleverly fall into the
Costs category.

Preparing and Printing Reports

You can print all the reports in Project by using the same basic technique.
Follow these steps:
1. Open the Project file on which you want to report.
2. Choose Report➪Reports.
Project opens the Reports dialog box (see Figure 3-1).
3. Click the category of the report that you want to produce.
4. Click Select.
Project displays the reports that are available in that category.
5. Select a report.
6. Click Select.
Project displays the report on-screen in Print Preview mode (see

Use the scroll arrows to move around the report. The Zoom button
enlarges the image so that you can read the report’s content on-screen.
To zoom out again, click the Full Page button or click again on the
report.
You can click the portion of the report that you want to enlarge. To
zoom out again, click the report again.
To display more than one page at a time, click the Multiple Pages button.
7. Click the Page Setup button.
Project displays the Page Setup dialog box (see Figure 3-3) so that you
can review the page settings before printing. You can set orientation,

Preparing Big Picture Reports
The Overview category of reports in the Reports dialog box (refer to 
Figure 3-1) provides information about what’s happening in your project in 
a “big picture” way. Figure 3-5 shows the Project Summary report, which pro-
vides information about the start and finish dates of your project, along with
duration, work, and cost information. At the bottom of the report, you see an
overall status for tasks and resources.

Planned start and finish dates, baseline start and finish
dates, and variances for start and finish dates and succes-
sor task information for tasks that have been rescheduled
from their baseline start dates.
Reporting on Costs
As you’d expect, the reports in the Costs category in the Reports dialog box
(refer to Figure 3-1) focus on costs associated with your project. For exam-
ple, the Budget report shown in Figure 3-7 lists fixed cost, fixed cost accrual,
total cost, baseline cost, variance, actual cost, and remaining cost for each
task, in the order of the highest total cost to lowest total cost.

resource assigned to the task, the amount of planned work and delay, and
the task’s start and finish dates.

Preparing Workload Reports
The reports in the Workload category in the Reports dialog box (refer to
Figure 3-1) help you focus on task and resource usage in your project. The
Task Usage report (see Figure 3-9) lists tasks and the resources that are
assigned to each task, including the amount of work assigned to each
resource in weekly time increments.
The Resource Usage report (see Figure 3-10) lists the same information as
the Task Usage report, but it focuses your attention on resources because it
lists resources and the tasks to which they’re assigned.
Viewing Custom Reports
In addition to the reports described so far in this chapter, Project contains
some reports available in the Custom category in the Reports dialog box
(refer to Figure 3-1). The Custom Report dialog box contains the following
reports:
✦The Resource Usage (Material) report
✦The Resource Usage (Work) report
Figure 3-9:
The Task
Usage
report.

399
✦The Task report
✦The Resource report
✦The Crosstab report
The Resource Usage (Material) and Resource Usage (Work) reports are both
variations on the Resource Usage report.
The Task report (see Figure 3-11) shows task information, such as the ID
number, task name, indicator icons, task duration, planned start and finish
dates, predecessors, and (if resources have been assigned) resource names.
The Resource report shows similar information for resources, including
resource ID numbers; indicator icons; resource names, types, labels, initials,
and groups; maximum units; standard, overtime, and cost/use rate informa-
tion; accrual information; base calendar information; and code information.
The Crosstab report is a tabular report that shows task and resource infor-
mation in rows and time increments in columns. Much of the information on
the Crosstab report also appears on the Task Usage report and the Resource
Usage report, and the Task Usage and Resource Usage reports give you more
formatting options, such as the period that’s covered by the report and the
table that’s used in the report.

4. Scroll to select the report you want to print.
5. Click Print or Preview.
Project prints or previews the selected report.
Click Setup to display the Page Setup dialog box, described in detail in
Chapter 1 of this minibook.
You can print any of the reports found in the categories described previ-
ously in this chapter either from this dialog box or by using the method
described in the section, “Preparing and Printing Reports,” earlier in this
chapter. Remember, though, that you must use the Custom Reports dialog
box to print the custom reports.
Adapting Reports to Suit Your Needs
You can make changes to any of the reports described previously in this
chapter, and you can create new reports.
When would you modify a report? Well, for example, you can edit the Who
Does What report to select a filter for resources on the Definitions tab; the
default filter is for Work resources, but you can produce the same report 
for Cost resources or Material resources. Or, you might want to edit the
Definition tab for the Cash Flow report to select the information that you
want to appear on each row; the default information is Tasks and Cost. You
also can change the time increments; the default is one week.
Because the Cash Flow report is a Crosstab report, Project displays the
Crosstab Report dialog box when you edit the Cash Flow report.
You also might want to edit the Who Does What When report to change the
timescale from daily to some other increment, such as weekly. And, if you
see pound signs (###) in your report, you also might want to change the
date format on the Details tab to a wider format.
Although you can modify a report by using the Edit button that appears in
the report’s category window, you can create a new report only from the
Custom Report dialog box. Also, you also can modify an existing report from
the Custom Report dialog box.
To modify any report, follow these steps:
1. Choose Report➪Reports.
The Reports dialog box appears.
2. Click the Custom category.

Adapting Reports to Suit Your Needs
402
3. Click Select.
Project opens the Custom Reports dialog box.
4. Click the report you want to modify.
5. Click Edit.
What you see next depends on the report you chose to modify.
For a few reports, such as the Base Calendar report, the only item that you
can change is the font information that Project uses to print the report. In
this case, Project displays the Report Text dialog box (see Figure 3-13).
For other reports, however, you can change the table or the task or resource
filter to change the content of the report. For example, if you edit the
Slipping Tasks report, Project opens the Definition tab of the Task Report
dialog box (see Figure 3-14).

From the Details tab (see Figure 3-15), you can select the information that
you want to include on the report. The options on the Details tab change
from report to report.
From the Sort tab (see Figure 3-16), you can specify fields by which to sort
the report.
You also can create your own reports by clicking the New button in the
Custom Reports dialog box. When you define a new custom report, Project
offers you four formats (see Figure 3-17). Three formats are based on the
Task, Resource, and Crosstab reports discussed in the section, “Viewing
Custom Reports” earlier in this chapter. When you choose one of these for-
mats, Project displays a dialog box that contains Definition, Details, and Sort
tabs like the ones shown in Figures 3-15, 3-16, and 3-17.

 Customizing visual reports
I
f you install Excel 2007 and Visio Professional 2007 along with Project
2007, you can produce visual reports — graphic representations of infor-
mation in a Project file. Visual reports help you focus on the overview of the
situation, rather than on the details. And, often, a picture can drive home a
point better than the columns of numbers used to generate the picture.
Project contains a collection of Excel and Visio templates that you can use
to produce a variety of visual reports. Project uses Excel PivotTables and
Visio PivotDiagrams to present the information. After you produce a report,
you can modify the report in Visio or Excel; changes you make to the report
don’t affect Project data.
And, of course, if you dream up a report that you don’t find in Project, you
can create your own report template.
Preparing a Visual Report
You prepare all the visual reports in Project by using the same technique:
1. Open the Project file on which you want to report.
It doesn’t matter whether you open Excel or Visio before you create a
visual report.
2. Choose Report➪Visual Reports.
Project displays the Visual Reports – Create Report dialog box (see
Figure 4-1).

Preparing a Visual Report
408
3. Select the tab for the type of report you want to prepare.
4. Click the template for the report you want to prepare.
5. Click View.
Project prepares the report and displays it in the appropriate program —
Excel or Visio.
Working with an Excel visual report
We’re not going to spend a lot of time showing you how to fiddle with a visual
report in Excel; we’re just going to provide basics. Most of what you need to
know revolves around Excel PivotTables, so, we recommend that you take a
look at Excel 2007 Bible, by John Walkenbach (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
In Figure 4-2, you see a typical Excel-based visual report. Initially, you see the
chart Excel prepares using the project’s data, but if you look at the bottom of
the screen and figure, you’ll notice two tabs in the Excel file.
On the second tab, shown in Figure 4-3, you see the PivotTable that forms
the foundation of the chart displayed in Figure 4-2. On this sheet, you also
see the PivotTable Field List at the right side of the screen; using this pane of
information, you can change the information that appears in the chart.

For example, you can add or remove fields by selecting or deselecting fields
in the top portion of the pane. Using the information in the lower portion of
the pane, you can rearrange the information that appears in the chart. And,
using any list boxes that appear in the table portion of the chart, you can
filter the report to display less information.
Working with a Visio visual report
Once again, we’re not going to spend a lot of time showing you how to fiddle
with a visual report in Visio; we’re just going to provide basics. Most of what
you need to know revolves around Visio PivotDiagrams, so we recommend
that you take a look at Visio 2007 Bible, by Bonnie Biafore (Wiley Publishing,
Inc.).
In Figure 4-4, you see a typical Visio-based visual report in Print Preview that
we’ve enlarged by zooming.
Because the chart is a PivotDiagram, when you display the regular Visio
window, you also see the PivotDiagram tools in the left pane (see Figure 4-5).
You can use these tools and the PivotDiagram toolbar that Visio automati-
cally displays to add categories or totals to the PivotDiagram and modify it
in other ways.

Visually Reporting on Resource Usage
411
Visually Reporting on Task Usage
The Task Usage visual report category contains only one report template:
the Cash Flow Report. This Excel-based visual report template uses time-
phased data to show Cost and Cumulative Cost over time (see Figure 4-6).
Visually Reporting on Resource Usage
Using the report templates in this category, you can focus on various
aspects of resource usage. For example, the Resource Work Availability
Report shown in Figure 4-7 is an Excel-based visual report that shows work,
work availability, and remaining availability information over time.
In Table 4-1, you see a description of each report template available in the
Resource Usage category.

Visually Reporting on Assignment Usage
Using the report templates in this category, you can focus on various
aspects of assignment usage. For example, the Baseline Report shown in
Figure 4-8 is a Visio-based visual report that shows baseline and actual work
and costs for your project over time. The report flags tasks where planned
work exceeds baseline work and where planned cost exceeds baseline cost.
You can find both a metric and a U.S. version of the Baseline Report.
In Table 4-2, you see a description of each report template available in the
Assignment Usage category.

Preparing Visual Task Summary Reports
This category contains two versions of one report template: the Critical
Tasks Status Report (see Figure 4-9). This Visio-based visual report organizes
tasks by whether they’re critical and shows the work and remaining work for
both types of tasks, along with the percent of work complete.

Resource Remaining Work Report (see Figure 4-10). This Excel-based visual
report shows, as a stacked bar chart, work, remaining work, and total work
for each work resource on your project.
Preparing Visual Assignment Summary Reports
In the Assignment Summary category, you’ll find two Visio-based visual
report templates, and each report template comes in both a metric and a
nonmetric (U.S.) version.
The Resource Status Report (see Figure 4-11) shows work and cost values
for each of your project’s resources.

Customizing Visual Reports
Although Project provides you with a fairly good variety of visual reports,
it’s just possible that you won’t find the one you want. Or, you might want to
modify an existing visual report. The process you follow to modify an exist-
ing report is part of the process you follow to create a new report, so we
walk through creating a new report.
When you create a new report template, you base it on an existing template,
and you include the fields that you want to appear on your report. Each time
you run the report, it displays the fields you include on the report template,
but the information on the report might change because the data in your
Project file has changed.
To create a new visual report template, follow these steps:
1. Choose Reports➪Visual Reports.
Project displays the Visual Reports – Create Report dialog box (see
Figure 4-13).
Figure 4-12:

3. Choose Excel or Visio as the application that will display the report.
If you select Visio, choose between Visio (Metric) and Visio (US Units).
4. Open the Choose the Data on Which You Want to Report list box and
select an existing visual report.
The report you select serves as the foundation for your new report.
To include timephased data on your report, select Task Usage, Resource
Usage, or Assignment Usage. Timephased data is information that is dis-
tributed over time; Project displays this information in Task Usage view
or Resource Usage view.
5. Click the Field Picker button.
Project displays the Visual Reports – Field Picker dialog box (see 
Figure 4-15).
6. On the left side of the dialog box, click a field that you want to appear
on the report and then click the Add button.
Project displays the field on the right side of the dialog box.
The fields that appear in this dialog box change, depending on the
report template you selected in Step 4, but the dialog box always func-
tions the same way. The columns on the right show the fields currently
included in the report template, and the columns on the left shown the

the report, click it in one of the right-hand columns and click Remove.
7. Repeat Step 6 for each field you want to add to the report template.
8. Click OK twice.
Project builds the report; either an Excel window or a Visio window
appears to enable you to establish the PivotTable or PivotDiagram by
dragging fields.
9. Click Office➪Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears.
10. Navigate to and save the file in the default location where templates
are stored.
If you use the defaults established by Microsoft Office, navigate to
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates\1033.
If you save your template in the default location, it appears automati-
cally in the Visual Reports window in Project along with other visual
report templates.

Company: Software development firm with
more than 75 employees.
Project: Upgrade the operating system soft-
ware on all computers in the firm to Windows
Vista.
Challenge: Prepare reports on various phases
of the project but be able to reproduce a report
prepared at an earlier point in time, including
its data.
Solution: To avoid saving hard copies of visual
reports, you can save reporting data in an OLAP
(On Line Analytical Processing) cube or in a
Microsoft Office Access database. Using the
cube or the database, you can reproduce the
report at any time in Excel or Access. You also
can use the data to create other reports. When
you save an OLAP cube, you can select the
Project fields you want included in the cube,
including custom fields. When you save the
data to an Access database, you save all data
in the project at the time. On this book’s Web
site (www.dummies.com/go/project

 Modifying a filter
 Creating a custom filter
 Using filters to spot and resolve problems
 Working with groups
A
fter you take your best shot at creating your project plan, creating
each task, and assigning all your resources, you might think you’re
ready to start your project. However, that’s seldom the case.
Taking the time to review almost any plan reveals some issues that you
should resolve before you begin working on your first task. These issues
might include a schedule that runs a few weeks past your optimum deadline,
a person who is assigned to work on ten tasks on the same day in week 43,
or a budget overrun that has no way of making it past your accounting guy.
Even if you don’t see any obvious problems in the areas of time, workload,
or money, you should still take the time to make sure that your project is as
realistic as possible before you commit to it.
Filtering to Spot Resource and Schedule Problems
One of the most helpful things you can do to be sure there are no gotchas in
your plan is to look at it from a few different perspectives. It’s like walking
around a house to be sure you’ve spotted the mold in the basement and
chipped paint on the siding before you head to the closing. Filters help you
get that kind of perspective.
Two major problem areas that filters can help you examine at this stage are
✦Overallocated resources: These resources are working more than the
number of hours you specified.
✦Tasks on a critical path: A critical path consists of the series of tasks in
your project that must happen on time for the project to meet its final
deadline.

Filtering to Spot Resource and Schedule Problems
426
A task that has slack — that is, any length of time that it could be delayed
without delaying the project’s final deadline — isn’t on the critical path. If
your project has very little slack built in, any delays that occur are likely to
cause your project to finish late.
How filters work
Filters allow you to hone in on certain information about your project, weed-
ing out the data that isn’t of interest to you at the moment. They can help
you spot clues about problems (such as overallocated resources).
You can set a filter to work in one of two ways:
✦To highlight tasks or resources that meet certain criteria
✦To remove any tasks or resources from view that don’t meet specified
criteria
Project provides predesigned filters that you can simply turn on to filter for
task or resource criteria, such as
✦Tasks with a cost greater than a specified amount
✦Tasks that are on the critical path
✦Tasks that occur within a specified date range
✦Milestone tasks (tasks of zero duration)
✦Tasks that use resources in a specified resource group
✦Tasks with overallocated resources
Several filters, such as Slipping Tasks and Overbudget Work, help you spot
problems after you’ve finalized your plan and are tracking actual progress.
(See Book VIII for more about tracking.)
Applying filters
You can access filters by using the AutoFilter button. When you click this
button, you then choose from a list of built-in filters. Filters applied this way
remove any tasks from view that don’t meet specified criteria.
You can also choose from a list of filters from a drop-down list on the
Formatting toolbar. To turn on such filters, follow these steps:
1. Display a resource view (such as Resource Sheet view) to filter for
resources or a task view (such as Gantt Chart view) to filter for tasks.
2. Click the Filter drop-down list on the Formatting toolbar and then
choose the criteria.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Working with
Filters
Filtering to Spot Resource and Schedule Problems
427
When no filter is applied, All Tasks or All Resources appears in the Filter
drop-down list. If you choose a filter that requires input, you see a dialog
box such as the one in Figure 1-1. Otherwise, the filter is applied immedi-
ately and removes from view any resources or tasks that don’t match
your criteria.
3. If a dialog box is displayed, fill in the information and then click OK.
The filter is applied.
To display filters and choose whether they highlight tasks fitting the criteria
or remove tasks not fitting the criteria, follow these steps:
1. Choose Project➪Filtered For➪More Filters.
The More Filters dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-2.
2. Select either the Task or Resource option to specify which list of filters
you want the new filter to be included in.
3. Click a filter and then click either Highlight or Apply.
The Highlight choice applies a highlight; the Apply choice removes tasks
that don’t meet filter criteria.

This dialog
box lists all
available
filters, built-
in and
custom.
Figure 1-1:
Some filters
require that
you enter
parameters.

Filtering to Spot Resource and Schedule Problems
428
To redisplay all tasks or resources, click the Filter drop-down list on the
Formatting toolbar and then select either All Resources or All Tasks
(depending on whether a Resource or Task filter is currently applied).
Letting AutoFilters do the work
You can use an AutoFilter feature that filters on individual fields of data in
any view that includes a spreadsheet, such as Tracking Gantt Chart view.
When you turn on AutoFilters, drop-down lists of built-in filters appear at the
top of each column.
You can use the AutoFilter button on the Formatting toolbar to turn on the
AutoFilter feature; when you do, arrows appear at the head of columns in the
currently displayed sheet. Click the arrow for the Start Date column (for
example), and a list of filter criteria such as Today, Tomorrow, This Week,
Next Month, and so on appears.
You can also choose a Custom setting from each of these lists to customize
AutoFilter with certain criteria in a context-specific dialog box. For example,
the Start area in the Custom AutoFilter dialog box (shown in Figure 1-3) allows
you to specify that you want to view tasks with a start date greater than
(after) the baseline start date, but less than (before) the actual start date.
You can save a custom filter definition for future use by clicking the Save

3. Click the arrow on the column that you want to filter.
4. Click the criterion you want for your filter.
For example, if you are filtering for task duration, in the Duration
column, you can choose >1 day, >1 week, or a specific number of days
(such as 5 days or 10 days). All tasks or resources that don’t meet your
criteria disappear.
Creating your own filters
You don’t have to use predesigned filters: You can get creative and design
your own filters. To define a new filter, you specify a field name, a test, and a
value.
For example, the following qualifiers filter for any task on the critical path:
Critical (field name) Equals (test) Yes (value)
You can also include additional qualifiers to the filter. The following quali-
fiers filter for tasks that are both on the critical path and have a baseline
cost of more than $5,000:
Critical (field name) Equals (test) Yes (value)
and
Baseline Cost (field name) Is Greater Than (test) 5000 (value)
Here’s how to build your own filter definition:
1. Choose Project➪Filtered For➪More Filters.
The More Filters dialog box appears (refer to Figure 1-2).
2. Select either the Task or Resource option to specify which list of filters
you want the new filter to be included in.
3. Click New.
The Filter Definition dialog box appears.
4. In the Name field, type a name for the filter.
5. Click the first line of the Field Name column and then click the down
arrow that appears to display the list of choices, as shown in Figure 1-4.
6. Click a field name to select it.

Filtering to Spot Resource and Schedule Problems

7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for the Test and Value(s) columns.
• Test is a condition that must be met, such as Does Not Equal or Is
Greater Than.
• Value(s) is either a value you enter (such as a specific date or cost)
or a predetermined value (such as baseline cost).
8. If you want to enter a qualifier, such as a dollar amount, click the
entry box above the column headings and then type the amount at the
end of the filter definition.
For example, if you choose Cost for the field name and Equals for the
test, you might enter the number 5000 at the end of the definition in the
entry box.
9. If you want to add another condition, choose And or Or from the And/
Or column and then make choices for the next set of Field Name, Test,
and Value(s) boxes.
Note that you can cut and paste rows of settings you’ve made to
rearrange them in the list, or you can use the Copy Row or Delete Row
button to perform those actions for filters with several lines of criteria.
10. If you want the new filter to be shown in the list when you click the
Filter box on the Formatting toolbar, select the Show in Menu check
box.
11. Click OK to save the new filter and then click Apply to apply the filter
to your plan.
You can click the Organizer button in the More Filters dialog box to copy fil-
ters you’ve created in one Project file to another file. Just click the filters you
want to copy from the file on the left and then click the Copy button to copy
them to the file on the right.

Filtering in Action
Book VIII covers tracking in detail, but because we’re focused on filtering
now, it might be helpful to cue you into some filters that can help you spot
problems after your project begins. Especially in larger projects, where it’s
not always easy to scan hundreds of tasks and notice which are running late
or over budget, filters can home in on exactly where your trouble lies.
You can choose to have tasks that don’t meet filter criteria removed from
your display or simply highlight tasks that meet the criteria on-screen.
Discovering some very useful filters
When things just don’t seem to be going the way you’d like, turn to Table 1-1.
It lists some filters that are useful when you’re trying to identify and solve
problems with your schedule.
Table 1-1
Filters to Isolate Problems
Filter Name
What It Displays
Cost Overbudget
Tasks that exceed budgeted expenditures
Critical
Tasks in the project that must be completed according to
schedule to make your final deadline (critical path)
Incomplete Tasks
Tasks that haven’t been marked as complete
Late/Overbudget Tasks
Tasks that are running later than their baseline estimate and
are over budget
Overallocated Resources
Tasks with resources assigned that are overbooked at some
point during the life of the task
Should Start By
Tasks that should have started as of a specified date
Slipping Assignments
Tasks that involve resource work that should have begun 
by now
Slipped/Late Progress
Tasks that are running late and have no progress recorded
Update Needed
A task that should have had progress tracked by now
Work Incomplete
Tasks that should have had all their work recorded by now
Work Overbudget
More work hours have been put in on the task than you had
estimated
If you don’t see all these choices in the More Filters dialog box, remember
that you have to enable the Task option to see task-related filters and the
Resource option to see resource-related filters.

Filtering in Action
432
Identifying the critical path
One of the most useful filters in Project is the one called Critical. This dis-
plays or highlights all tasks that are on the critical path. Remember that if a
path on the critical path slips, your project end date will slip.
If you’re running late, knowing which tasks can’t slip helps you identify
where there’s no room for delay — and, conversely, where you can delay
noncritical tasks and still meet your deadline.
You might also use the Critical filter to help you determine tasks that are
noncritical; then you can remove some resources from those tasks to put
them on other more critical tasks or avoid a resource overallocation 
scenario.
You can look at the critical path in any Gantt Chart or Network Diagram view.
Figure 1-5 shows Gantt Chart view of a project with the critical path high-
lighted. Figure 1-6 shows Network Diagram view with the same filter applied.

Working with Groups
Project lets you group like items together to help you keep track of all the
data you enter. The Group feature essentially allows you to organize informa-
tion by certain criteria.
For example, you can use the Group feature if you want to see resources
organized by their hourly rate, or you might organize tasks by their duration
or cost.
Organizing tasks or resources in this way can help you identify a potential
problem in your project. For example, say that you find that the majority of
your resources at project startup are unskilled and that most of the tasks at
the end of your project are on the critical path. In that case, you should
probably build in more time and money for training, build in more slack, and
move out your final deadline.
Like filters, groups come predefined, and you can create custom groups.

Applying predefined groups
Project has some built-in groups that are quick and easy to apply and cover
a host of common requirements in projects. These include groups such as
Resource Type and Task Constraint Type.
Follow these steps to apply a predefined group structure to your project:
1. Display either a resource view (such as Resource Sheet view) to group
resources, or a task view (such as Gantt Chart view) to group tasks.
2. On the Standard toolbar, click the Group By drop-down list and then
select a criterion.
The information is organized according to your selection. Figure 1-7
shows an example.
To redisplay all tasks or resources in their original order, click the arrow in
the Group By drop-down list on the Standard toolbar to display the list and
then click No Group. (When no group is applied, the Group By box displays
the words No Group.)

435
Coming up with your own groups
Custom groups include three elements that you can make settings for: a field
name, a field type, and an order. For example, you might create a group that
shows the field name (such as Baseline Work) and a field type (such as Tasks,
Resources, or Assignments) in a certain order (Descending or Ascending). A
group that shows Baseline Work for Tasks in Descending Order would list
tasks in order from the most work hours required to the least.
Other settings you can make for groups control the format of the group’s
appearance, such as the font used or a font color to be applied.
Follow these steps to create a custom group:
1. Choose Project➪Group By➪More Groups.
The More Groups dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-8.
2. Select either Task or Resource to specify in which list of groups you
want the new group to be included.
3. Click New.
The Group Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-9.
4. In the Name field, type a name for the group.
5. Click the first line of the Field Name column, click the down arrow
that appears to display the list of choices, and then click a field name
to choose it.
6. Repeat Step 5 for the Field Type and Order columns.
Note that if you want the Field Type option of grouping by assignment
rather than by resource or task, you must first select the Group Assign-
ments, Not Tasks check box to make that field available to you. Other-
wise the Field Type of Task or Resource appears by default.
Figure 1-8:
This dialog
box is

7. If you want to add another sorting criteria, click a row titled Then By
and make choices for the Field Name, Field Type, and Order columns.
8. If you want the new group to be shown in the list when you click
the Group box on the Formatting toolbar, select the Show in Menu
check box.
9. Depending on the field name you’ve chosen, you can make settings
for the font, cell background, and pattern to format your group.
For example, the font of each duration group heading in Figure 1-7 was
determined by making choices from these three lists.
10. If you want to define intervals for the groups to be organized in, click
the Define Group Intervals button.
This displays the Define Group Intervals dialog box; use the settings
here to set a starting time and an interval. For example, if the Group By
criterion is Standard Rate and you select a Group Interval of 1.00, group-
ings are in $1 intervals (those making $0–$1 an hour in one grouping,
those making $11–$20 in another, and so on).
11. Click OK to save the new group and then click Apply to apply the
group to your plan.
If you want to make changes to an existing predefined group, apply the
group and then choose Project➪Group By➪Customize Group By. This takes
you to the Customize Group By dialog box for that group. This dialog box —
whose options are identical to the Group Definition dialog box — allows you
to edit all those settings for an existing group.

W
hen you’ve used all your skills, experience, and data to create what
you consider to be a solid plan for your project, you might think
you’re ready to begin. But it’s always a good idea to take a step back and
examine your plan before you commit to it and proceed.
Taking the time to review almost any plan reveals some issues that you
should resolve before you begin working on your first task. It will be painfully
obvious if you have devised a schedule that runs a few weeks past your
target deadline, or if you have a budget overrun that puts your project in the
red soon after you start. But more subtle problems, such as a person who is
assigned to work for 24 hours a day for three weeks, also deserve your
attention.
In this chapter, you take a look at your resource planning to make sure that
your resource assignments are as realistic as possible before you commit to
your Project plan.
Keeping Resources in Line
Before you finalize your plan, you have to take into account your resources’
workload. When you assigned resources to tasks in your project, you might
have unknowingly created situations where your people were working many
more hours on a given day than it makes sense to ask somebody to work.
These resource overallocations can mean that nobody short of Superman
(or Superwoman) can actually perform the work, and if they can, they might
send your resource time budget through the roof.

Keeping Resources in Line
438
Your first step in solving these resource overbookings is to spot them. Then
you have to act to give those poor, overworked folks some relief.
Checking resource availability
You identify the times during your project when people are working more
than you want them to by taking a look at some of the views that focus on
resource assignments.
Resource Usage view (shown in Figure 2-1) and Resource Graph view (shown
in Figure 2-2) are useful in helping you to spot overbooked resources.
Resources are noted as overallocated in these views based on their assign-
ment percentage and calendars. A resource based on a standard eight-hour-
day calendar, assigned at 20 percent to a task, will work eight hours a day on
it. If you assign that same resource at 50 percent to another task that occurs
on the same day, that resource will be assigned to put in 12-hour days (8
plus 4). When that situation happens, Project marks the resource as overal-
located.
Figure 2-1:
Resource
Usage view
spells out
workflow,
resource by
resource.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Solving Resource
Conflicts
Keeping Resources in Line
439
If, on the other hand, you create a resource such as a piece of machinery and
designate the 24-hour calendar, a 20-percent assignment to a task equals 24
hours of work for a day-long task. If you assigned the same resource at 50
percent to another task the same day, the resource would be working 36
hours in a single day. Even for a piece of machinery, a 36-hour day just 
doesn’t fly.
In Resource Graph view, work is summarized in the Peak Units row. All work
in the portion of the bar graphic above the 20 percent mark is displayed in
red to indicate the resource is overallocated. All the work below the 20 per-
cent mark is blue and is in line with their calendar and assignment maximum
percentages.
In Resource Usage view, all the tasks to which a resource is assigned are
listed under the resource name in the Resource Name column. A yellow dia-
mond with an exclamation point in the indicator column indicates an over-
allocated resource. The total hours that the resource is working on a selected
task is summarized in the Work column.
You can use some of the collaboration features of Project Web Access to 
get resource availability information online, which can help you resolve
resource overallocation problems. See Book II for more about working with
Project Web Access.

Picking a method to resolve the conflict
After you review some of Project’s views to determine which resources are
overbooked, you should resolve the situation before finalizing your plan.
What exactly can you do if you discover that some of your resources are as
overbooked as an accountant in tax season?
You have a few options:
✦Remove a resource from a few tasks to free up some time.
✦Change the Resource calendar to allow the person to have a longer
workday (for example, 12 hours). Keep in mind that this means a 20
percent assignment will have a resource working 12 hours on any one
task in a day. If you stretch a resource’s workday, you should probably
reduce the resource’s assignments. For example, if someone frequently
puts in 16 hours on two tasks in one day (based on an 8-hour calendar)
for two 20-percent assignments, try changing to a 12-hour calendar and
50-percent assignments (6 hours on each of the two tasks, totaling 12
hours a day). However, if the person typically works an 8-hour day and
12- or 16-hour days are the exception, you shouldn’t change the resource’s
base calendar because that will have an effect on all assignments for
that resource.
Keep in mind that the two preceding options might lengthen the tasks
that the resource is assigned to, regardless of whether you remove the
resource or reduce the resource’s assignment.
✦Change the resource’s availability by increasing her assignment units
to more than 20 percent in the Resource Information dialog box. For
example, if you enter 150% as her available units, you’re saying it’s okay
for her to work 12 hours a day, and Project then considers that she isn’t
overallocated until she exceeds that 12 hours. The danger here is that
you won’t get any more alerts when she’s working more than 8 hours a
day, and most people won’t put up with 12 hour days throughout the life
of the project.
✦Ignore the problem. This is a real possibility: Sometimes someone work-
ing 14 hours for a day or two during the life of a project is acceptable. If
so, there’s no need to change the resource’s usual working allocation to
make that overwork indicator go away. But if you see that indicator pop-
ping up too often, use that notification to make some changes as your
project progresses.
See Book V, Chapter 3 for details on exactly how to modify resource 
assignments.

Chapter 2

Conflicts

441
Finding someone to help
If you find in reviewing your plan that you have resources who are over-
booked at various points in time, you have to find a way to cut their work-
load down.
One way to help your overbooked resources out is to assign someone to
help them on tasks. This can reduce the overbooked resource assignment so
that he or she doesn’t have to put in as many hours.
By adding resources to some tasks, you may also shorten the task duration.
That means you might free up your resource in time, which could eliminate a
conflict with a later task in the project. For example, if in the second week 
of a two-week task you have a resource overallocated, by shortening that
two-week task to be completed in one week, you get rid of the overallocation
in week two.
Another option is to reduce the resource’s work assignment on one or more
tasks — say, by reducing 20 percent assignments to 50 percent. You make
this change in the Task Information dialog box on the Resources tab, shown
in Figure 2-3, or by selecting the task and clicking the Assign Resources tool
to open the Assign Resources dialog box.
Note that you can quickly display a visual representation in the form of a
work graph for any resource by clicking the Graphs button in the Assign
Resources dialog box.
You can also change the work contour setting for the resource. By default,
Project puts a resource to work on a task at the same level of effort for the
life of the task. You can modify the work contour to set when the resource
Figure 2-3:
Changing
assignment
units for a
resource on
a particular
task.

Keeping Resources in Line
442
works the most and when they work fewer hours. For example, you can set a
contour such that a resource puts in the most effort at the start of a task;
this frees up the resource’s workload later in the life of the task when a con-
flict with another assignment might exist.
See Book V, Chapter 3 for information about how to apply a work contour to
a resource assignment.
Using task drivers to resolve problems
When you give a speech, many factors affect your presentation. You might
be getting a cold, the audience might be drowsy from a big lunch, or your
equipment might malfunction. In the same way, the timing of every task in
your project is likely to be affected by several conditions, which Microsoft
Project refers to as task drivers. The Task Drivers feature in Project helps
you recognize these conditions, including
✦Actual Start Date or Assignments: You’ve entered an actual start date,
or you’ve made a resource assignment to a task and the resource isn’t
available.
✦Leveling Delay: If you turned on leveling to deal with resource overallo-
cations, that feature might have caused a delay on a task.
✦Constraints: You apply a constraint to a task, such as forcing it to finish
on a certain date.
✦Summary Tasks: Summary tasks’ timings are driven by the timings of
their child tasks or subtasks.
✦Dependency Relationships: A predecessor or successor task can cause
changes in a task’s timing.
To display task driver information, simply click the Task Drivers button on
the Standard toolbar (it looks like a taskbar with an arrow and question
mark above it). The Task Drivers pane appears (see Figure 2-4). Here the var-
ious conditions driving a task’s timing are listed. You can click another task
to display its drivers; click the Close button in the Task Drivers pane to close
it when you’re done.
Change Highlighting
The Change Highlighting feature is useful to help you see how changes you
make to fine-tune your project schedule may have an impact on your proj-
ect. You can click the Show Change Highlighting/Hide Change Highlighting
button on the Standard toolbar to toggle this feature on and off. When you
turn on Change Highlighting and take any action that changes your project’s
schedule, a highlight appears on every task that has been impacted by that
change (see Figure 2-5).

How task drivers help pinpoint problems
Company:A Midwestern gourmet food company.
Project: Market research for a new soup prod-
uct line.
Challenge: To research the potential market
and competition for a new line of gourmet
soups.
The pivotal phase in this market research proj-
ect is the generation of a preliminary report for
senior management recommending whether
the company should proceed with the new
product line. Currently the task is finishing two
weeks late.
Solution: Before that report can be generated,
several other phases (but not all) must be com-
plete. By turning on the Task Drivers feature of
Project, you can see the following factors driv-
ing the timing of the Generate Preliminary
Report summary task:
Change Highlighting shows you only the results of the last change you
made and works only on scheduling changes.
Undoing again and again
Multiple Undo is a long-awaited feature finally appearing in Project 2007.
Although you’ve probably used multiple undo in several other software
programs, essentially allowing you to undo a series of actions rather than
just the last action, it took time to get this feature to work in Project.
What was the big challenge in implementing this feature? Because of the
complex nature of a Project plan with its series of tasks, resource assign-
ments, dependencies, and so on, individual changes to anything in your
project plan can have several results. For that reason, undoing several
actions in a row was a major technology challenge.
In the past, if you wanted to try out different scenarios that involved sev-
eral changes to your project, you had to do an action and then undo it,
then do the next action and undo it, and so on, which was time-consuming
and didn’t really allow you to see the cumulative effect of your actions.
With Multiple Undo, you can try out several changes and then undo the
whole list of changes or only a portion of them. Because you often need
to try out several changes when finalizing or making adjustments to a
project — for example, changing the timing of several tasks or the hourly
rates of several resources — Multiple Undo can be a very useful feature.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Solving Resource
Conflicts
Keeping Resources in Line
445
You do have to undo all changes in order. For example, if you made seven
changes and you want to undo the fourth change, you have to undo changes
one through four.
To undo a change or series of changes, click the down arrow of the Undo
button on the Standard toolbar and then choose the change you want to
undo (see Figure 2-6). That change and all others you performed subsequent
to it are undone.
 Dependencies exist between this task and
three other summary tasks: Competitive
Research, Market Assessment, and Pricing
Analysis.
 There’s a constraint on the task to finish no
earlier than the last day of the company’s
third quarter.
Resource leveling has been turned on and is
causing a two-day delay of the task.
Glancing at this project, you might surmise that
the most likely culprit is the task constraint. This
could force the task to end no sooner than the
end of the quarter, which is in fact the current
end date. Though the project planner was orig-
inally given that target date for the report, the
project is ahead of schedule. By forcing the
task to end no sooner than that date, Project is
actually delaying the end of the task to be two
weeks later than it could be if that constraint
were removed.

Keeping Resources in Line
446
If you choose a high number of Undo operations, it can slow down your com-
puter a tad because it then must keep that many actions in memory.
Leveling to fix resource problems
Resource leveling is a calculation that Project makes to try to resolve
resource overallocations in your project. The feature uses two approaches:
delaying a task until the overbooked resource frees up, or splitting tasks.
Splitting a task stops the tasks at some point, thereby freeing up the resource.
The task then resumes at a later time when the resource is available.
You can, of course, make such changes yourself, but leveling is a way to
automate the process, leaving the calculation to Project. Here’s how leveling
works:
1. Project first delays tasks that involve overallocated resources to use up
any available slack.
2. When no more slack is available on these tasks, Project makes changes
based on any priorities you’ve entered for tasks, dependency relation-
ships that are affected, and task constraints (such as a Finish No Later
Than constraint).
Figure 2-6:
Undo
several
changes,
sequentially.

Book VII
Chapter 2

Conflicts
Keeping Resources in Line
447
You can turn on leveling to see what changes Project would make and then
clear the leveling to reverse those actions if you don’t like the results. Or, if
you like some of the changes but not others, turn off leveling and manually
implement only the changes you prefer. Do be aware that if you leave on the
automatic leveling setting mentioned in the following steps, it may make dra-
matic changes to your schedule that you may or may not notice!
To level the resources in your project, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Level Resources.
The Resource Leveling dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-7.
2. Make a choice between allowing Project to do Automatic or Manual
leveling:
• Automatic tells Project to level every time you change your plan.
• Manual requires that you go to the Resource Leveling dialog box and
click Level Now.
3. If you choose to level automatically, be sure to enable the Clear
Leveling Values Before Leveling check box if you want previous 
leveling actions reversed before you level the next time.
4. Set the leveling range to either
• Level Entire Project
• Level: <a date range>
5. If you chose Level: <a date range>, fill in a date range by making
choices in the From and To boxes.
Figure 2-7:

6. From the Leveling Order drop-down list, click the down arrow and
make a choice:
• Standard considers slack, dependencies, priorities, and constraints.
• ID Only delays or splits the task with the highest ID number; in other
words, the last task in the project.
• Priority, Standard uses task priority as the first criterion in making
choices to delay or split tasks (rather than using up slack).
7. Select any of the four check boxes at the bottom to control how
Project will level:
• Within Available Slack: No critical tasks are delayed, and your cur-
rent finish date for the project is retained.
• Adjusting Resource Assignments: This allows Project to remove or
change assignments.
• Splitting Tasks Only for Unstarted Work in the Project: This can put
some tasks on hold for a period of time until resources are freed up
for work.
• Relative to Booking Type: Booking Type (proposed or committed)
relates to how firm you are in using that particular resource.
Allowing resource leveling to consider a resource’s booking type
means that committed resource assignments are considered more
sacred than proposed assignments when Project goes about making.
8. Click the Level Now button to have Project perform the leveling 
operation.
It’s a good idea to display Leveling Gantt view to see what changes leveling
has wrought. If you don’t like what you see, to reverse leveling, go to the
Resource Leveling dialog box (Tools➪Level Resources) and click the Clear
Leveling button.
Combining Solutions
We have one more point to make about all the solutions suggested in this
chapter that can help you deal with time, cost, and overallocation problems.
In many cases, you’ll probably have to use a combination of all of these
methods to get to a usable project plan.

Although you might initially look for one quick fix (you’re only human), in
reality, the best solution might come through making a dozen small changes.
And even then, solving these problems is often a trial-and-error process.
Take the time to find the best combination of solutions for your project to
make your plan the best it can be before you launch it.
Making the leveling choice
Resource leveling has its pros and cons. It can
make changes that you might not want it to
make — for example, taking a resource off a
task where you absolutely need that person to
supervise the other resources’ work. Leveling
frequently delays your project’s finish date,
which might not be acceptable to you (or your
client).
For that reason, the safest setting for Resource
Leveling — that is, the one that makes the least
drastic changes to your project’s timing — is to
level only within slack. This setting might delay
some tasks, but it won’t delay your project com-
pletion date.
If you just can’t live with everything Resource
Leveling did, the capability to turn Resource
Leveling on and off is your best ally. You can
turn on the feature and look at the things it did
to resolve resource problems. When you turn it
off, any changes it made are reversed.
Still, if you’re absolutely stuck as to how to
resolve resource problems in a complex proj-
ect, leveling can be a handy, quick way to make
all those problems go away.

 Keeping your schedule realistic
T
he two key issues for most people when trying to finalize their project
plan are time and money. When that finish date is staring back at you, a
full three months later than the date your boss gave you, it gives you pause.
If the total project costs are 50 percent higher than you’d hoped, you still
have some work to do (if costs are lower, count your blessings and send
your plan off to your boss right away).
In this chapter we explore some steps you can save to trim time and dollars
from your plan before you hand it in to the powers that be.
Timing is Everything
The weekly staff meeting has just ended. As you linger over your last bit of
donut, you realize you and your boss are the only two left in the room. Your
boss turns to you and asks you, after weeks of planning, if you’re finally
ready to commit to a final project date. Your palms sweat, you gulp down
the last bit of donut, add a week to the last finish date Project gave you to
cover yourself, and then you promise to deliver the impossible.
Before you go to your boss and make any promises, make sure you’re com-
fortable with two things: the total time it takes to complete the project and
the critical path (the longest series of tasks that must be completed on time
in order for you to meet the overall project deadline).
Project allows you to feel much more confident about committing to a time-
frame because you can see how long all your tasks will take to complete.
You can use a variety of views and tables of data to get as much detail as
you like about your task and project timing.

Doing It All in Less Time
452
On a macro level, the timing data for your project summary task tells you
how long the entire project will take. Just display Gantt Chart view and look
at the Duration, Start, and Finish columns for the project summary task (see
Figure 3-1).
To get into the details of your task timing, you can examine the chart pane of
Gantt Chart view, Task Usage view (shown in Figure 3-2), which shows you
the hours of work on tasks week by week, or even Calendar view, shown in
Figure 3-3. For many people, seeing tasks laid out on a calendar is the easiest
way to visualize how many months or even years a project is taking.
Doing It All in Less Time
If you do your homework and make your plan realistic, the price you pay
might be that you end up with a really long project. What happens when
your project finish date just isn’t acceptable to your manager? That’s when
you have to try a few tactics that might help you keep your schedule under
control.

Check your dependencies
The timing of your plan is determined, to a great extent, by the timing rela-
tionships you build among tasks: that is, by dependencies. When you review
your plan to see whether you can save some time, take a look at those
dependencies to see whether you built them in the most logical way possible.
Perhaps you didn’t start one task until another was completely finished, 
but could you actually start the second task two days before the end of its
predecessor?
Here are some examples of dependencies that could do with some tweaking:
✦You delayed the start of your office move until new office furniture
arrived. But could you start moving smaller boxes and supplies three
days before all the furniture is in place? Building in that little bit of over-
lap between these two tasks might save you some time.
✦You created a finish-to-start relationship for the Do Research and Write
Speech tasks, such that you couldn’t start writing the speech until your
research was finished. But is that true? Can’t you do a first draft of the
speech when you’re three-fourths of the way through the research?
Getting a second task going before the first is complete can save you
time, especially when you have two different resources working on 
those tasks.
Use the Task Drivers feature, covered in Chapter 2 of this minibook, to spot
what’s driving the timing of tasks.
Over the life of a project with hundreds of tasks, adding overlap to even a
few dozen tasks might save you a month of time or more! If you have a very
large schedule and reviewing all the dependencies is daunting, start by
reviewing any dependencies between just the summary tasks and milestones.
You can take a refresher course in creating and changing dependencies in
Book IV, Chapter 3.
Rethinking your resource needs
Another factor that drives timing in your project is the availability of
resources. Sometimes you set a dependency relationship to deal with the
fact that one task can’t start before another is over because the resources
aren’t available until the predecessor task is over. When finalizing your plan,
you might find that those provisions for resource schedules are no longer
needed or that you can rearrange your resources or call in outside help to
save time.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Reviewing Timing
and Costs
Doing It All in Less Time
455
Here are a few things to look for with resource-dependent timing:
✦Maybe you delayed the start of a task because a resource wasn’t avail-
able. But can some other resource do the work? If so, switch resources
and let the task start sooner.
✦Project calculates the duration of some tasks (fixed work and fixed units
with effort-driven scheduling) according to the number of resources
available to do the work. If you add resources to those tasks, Project
shortens their duration.
✦If you assign a more skilled resource to some tasks, you might be able to
shorten the hours of work required to complete the task because the
skilled person will finish the work more quickly.
✦Can you hire an outside vendor to handle the work? If you have money
but no time or resources, that’s sometimes a viable option.
Book V, Chapter 3 covers the mechanics of making and changing resource
assignments.
Modifying task constraints
Task constraints have a great impact on a task’s timing. By default, all tasks
start with the As Soon As Possible constraint, meaning that as soon as all
dependency obligations are met, the task will start. Other task constraints,
such as No Earlier Than or No Later Than essentially force your task timing
to align with a particular date.
Display task drivers and look for any task whose timing is being controlled
by a constraint that you might just be able to do without. For example, say
you created a task called Publish Annual Report and you set a No Earlier
Than constraint such that you couldn’t publish the report before you
announced your earnings to the press. In reviewing your project, you realize
that you can publish the report, but you just can’t distribute it. If you ditch
that constraint, you might find that the task gets completed earlier, which
lets another task finish earlier . . . and so on. The overall impact on timing
might surprise you!
Delete the tasks you don’t need
If you really have to squeeze your schedule and you can’t find anything
about the dependencies or resources to help you do it, consider cutting
back on tasks. Can you skip that final quality check, the one that occurs after
the other three you built in? Would it be okay to hold two focus groups
instead of three?

Getting It for Less
456
Maybe you can find a new home for some of the tasks. For example, can you
get some other project manager to handle some of your tasks for you with
different sets of resources? If your buddy has a project that involves the mar-
keting launch for a new printer, can you convince him to also write the in-
box glossy assembly instructions, which was your responsibility to begin
with? It’s worth a shot.
If you think a major shift is necessary to make your project fly, see Chapter 4
of this minibook for information about redefining the project’s scope.
Getting It for Less
Here are some tips for trimming that bottom line:
✦Use cheaper resources. Do you have a high-priced engineer on a task
that can be performed by a junior engineer? Did you assign a high-priced
manager to supervise a task that could be handled by a lower-priced line
supervisor?
✦Lower fixed costs. If you allowed for the travel costs associated with
four plant visits, can you manage with only three? Can you book flights
ahead of time and get cheaper airfares? Can you find a cheaper vendor
for that piece of equipment you allocated $4,000 to buy? Or can you
make do with the old equipment for just one more project?
✦Cut down on the overtime. Are resources that earn overtime overallo-
cated? Try cutting down their hours or using resources on straight
salary for those 14-hour days.
✦Do it in less time. Resource costs are a factor of task durations, hourly
wages, or number of units. If you change tasks so that fewer work hours
are required to complete them, they cost less. However, don’t be unreal-
istic about the time it will really take to get the work done.
Making Your Project Timing Realistic
Up till now, we’ve been talking about reviewing your project to save time or
money, but after you’ve done all that corner-cutting to meet expectations for
your project, you should perform a reality check. That means taking a look
at the tasks on your critical path and building in some slack to allow for
inevitable delays and problems.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Reviewing Timing
and Costs
Making Your Project Timing Realistic
457
Reviewing the critical path
Remember that the critical path is the longest series of tasks in your project
that can’t be delayed without delaying your end date. If every task in your
project is critical, absolutely nothing can change without causing you to
miss your target finish date. If, however, you have plenty of noncritical tasks,
you have already built some spare time into your plan.
You can use filters and groups to identify the critical path in, for example,
Gantt Chart view or Network Diagram view. If you judge that too many tasks
are on the critical path, it’s wise to add some slack to the plan to allow for
inevitable delays (see the section “Giving yourself some slack,” later in this
chapter).
Figure 3-4 shows Network Diagram view of a project with way too many tasks
on the critical path for comfort. (See Book VII, Chapter 1 for more about
applying filters such as the one for critical path.)
Figure 3-4:
With all
tasks on the
critical path,
there’s no
room for
error.

Making Your Project Timing Realistic
458
How many critical paths are enough?
A group of settings on the Calculation tab of the Options dialog box con-
cerns how Project handles critical path calculations.
The Inserted Projects Are Calculated Like Summary Tasks option is straight-
forward. If you insert another project as a task in your project, having 
this setting selected allows Project to calculate one critical path for your
entire project. If you don’t select it, any projects you insert are treated like
outsiders — that is, they’re not taken into account in the master project’s
critical-path calculations. If an inserted project won’t have an effect on your
project’s timing, you might want to clear this option.
If following one project’s critical path is too tame for you, try getting critical
with multiple paths. By selecting the Calculate Multiple Critical Paths option,
you set up Project to calculate a different critical path for each set of tasks in
your project. Doing so can be helpful if you want to identify tasks that, if
delayed, will cause you to miss your final project deadline or the goals of a
single phase in your project.
Finally, you can establish what puts a task on the critical path by specifying
the number of days of slack critical tasks might have. By default, tasks with
no slack are on the critical path. However, you can change this situation if
you want to be alerted that tasks with only one day of slack are critical —
figuring that one day isn’t much padding and that these tasks are still in
jeopardy.
If you want all the settings on the Calculation tab to pertain to all projects,
click the Set as Default button before clicking OK to save the new settings in
the Options dialog box.
Giving yourself some slack
How many tasks should be on the critical path in your project, and how
many should have some slack — that is, some time that they can be delayed
without delaying the entire project? We wish we could give you a formula,
but sadly, it’s not a science. Ideally, every task in your project should have
slack because things can come up that you never expected (shortages of
vital materials, asteroid strikes, management turnover that places you in an
entirely different department). If you add slack to each and every task, 
however, your project is probably going to go on into the next millennium.
Figure 3-5 shows a more typical scenario, with a mix of noncritical and criti-
cal tasks.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Reviewing Timing
and Costs
Making Your Project Timing Realistic
459
Some tasks have slack naturally because they occur during the life of a
longer task with which they share a dependency. The shorter task could
actually be delayed until the end of the longer task without delaying the 
project.
Think about this example: You can start installing the plumbing and electri-
cal elements of a new office building as soon as the framing inspection is
complete. The plumbing takes two weeks, and the electrical work takes one
week. The next task, mechanical inspection, can’t happen until both the
plumbing and electrical tasks are finished. The shorter of the two (electrical)
has a week of slack because nothing else can happen until the dependent
task, plumbing, is finished (as in Figure 3-6). However, if electrical runs one
week late, the electrical task becomes critical.
Never, we repeat, never get rid of all the slack in your schedule. Otherwise, it
will come back and haunt you like the Ghost of Christmas Past. Just tell your
boss we said so.

view.

Making Your Project Timing Realistic
460
These natural cases of slack occur in any project. In many cases, though,
you have to build in slack. Slack can be added in a couple ways.
First, you can simply inflate task durations. Add two days to the duration of
all the tasks in your project, or go in and examine each task to figure out the
risk of delay and pad each duration accordingly. This method is a little prob-
lematic, however, because when changes occur, you might have to go into
many tasks and adjust durations to deal with a schedule that’s ahead or
behind. You also have to keep track of exactly how much slack you built into
each task.
The second method of building in slack is the one we like best. You build one
slack task or several slack tasks that occur throughout your project — say,
one at the end of each phase of the project.
As things slide in your project (and they will, trust us), you’ll spot that slack
is being eaten up because the slack task is suddenly ending later than the
date you’d wanted the phase to end. You can change the duration of the
slack task, reflecting the fact that your slack is being used up. The duration
of that task gives you a good indication of how much more time you have
before the entire phase goes critical.

Slack by any other name
Now, there’s one must-do here, even if it seems
obvious: Don’t call this task Slack. Nobody in a
position of responsibility would be caught dead
approving slack time for anybody. Give slack
tasks appropriately respectable names that
reflect useful (but admittedly, somewhat generic)
activities — say, Engineering Analysis, or
Debriefing, or CYA Meeting. Then give the task
a duration that provides breathing space for the
other tasks in that phase. For example, at the
end of a two-month phase of designing a new
product package, you might add a task called
Design Debriefing and make it one week long.
(That way, if a sudden mandate for design
tweaks comes out of nowhere, you’re covered.)
Then create a dependency between that task
and the last “real” task in the phase. We’re not
talking dishonesty here — just reality. In the
real world, slack is indispensable.

Changes into Place

 Redefining the scope of your project
 Breaking off a piece of your project
 Selling changes to shareholders
 Cutting corners: Quality versus cost
I
n the preceding chapters in this minibook, we explore specific changes
you can make to your tasks and resources to fine-tune your Project plan.
In this chapter, we tackle the sometimes-painful, big-picture changes that
are occasionally necessary to get to a plan you and your management can
live with.
We explore some more comprehensive changes to the scope, timing, and
quality of your project, and then we tell you how to pitch your final project
and any changes to it to your management.
Getting to a Final Project Plan
Say that you’ve done everything you can to tweak the timing and costs on
your project, and you still end up with a finish date that’s one month too
late, and you’re $10,000 over budget. What can you do on a strategic level to
get to a final project plan that you can get buy off on and begin to implement?
You can try several tactics, including redefining your project scope, splitting
off a piece of the work to become a different project, and cutting some seri-
ous corners on quality of your deliverables.
Redefining the scope of your project
When you’ve pushed and pulled and tried every single thing you can think
of to get your project plan to work, it might be time to revisit the project
scope. In essence, you’re analyzing whether you bit off more than you can
chew and still meet the schedule and budget requirements for the project.

Getting to a Final Project Plan
464
In Book I, Chapter 3 we introduce the concept of a project goal and project
scope. In brief, the scope of your project should define both what a project
will involve and what it won’t involve, and should include specifics about the
project budget, timeframe, and deliverables in a scope statement.
So, first revisit a sample scope statement from Book I:
This project will involve all the steps involved to design and implement
a new shopping cart feature (but does not include maintaining or refin-
ing it once launched). The cost of the project will not exceed $25,000
and implementation must be completed before October 1st to accommo-
date holiday sales traffic. The new shopping cart feature should help to
increase sales by allowing customers more options to review their orders,
give them more frequent opportunities to shop for more items after they
have added a product to the cart, and allow them to save their cart con-
tents and come back to complete the sale at a future date. The new fea-
ture must function on our existing Web technology infrastructure.
How might you revise this if you find your schedule is running long or you’re
overbudget? In this case, you have a few options:
✦Can the project include just design and not implementation of the 
feature? Or can it include design and a prototype, but not the final 
implementation?
✦Could you revise the cost of the project to total $30,000 instead of
$25,000?
✦Can you change the final implementation date from October 1st to
December 1st?
✦Is there one aspect of the new shopping cart feature that you can leave
to a future project? For example, what if you didn’t include the ability for
customers to save contents for future visits but add that on at a later
date?
Product scope versus project scope
Projects involve two kinds of scope: product scope and project scope. Here’s
how they differ:
✦Product scope addresses the feature set and quality of whatever it is
your project will deliver. If you can sacrifice a product feature or a bit
of quality without any serious impact, you might want to change the
product scope.

Book VII
Chapter 4
Putting Final
Changes into Place
Getting to a Final Project Plan
465
✦Project scope concerns how many tasks you can accomplish. You
might choose to keep the original product scope, but just not get as far
in the process as you thought you would, and hence modify project
scope. This might mean that you handle the product launch or develop-
ment or testing, but you leave it to somebody else to handle some other
aspect of the project in another timeframe and budget.
Give careful thought to which of these you might want to modify. Either will
have an impact on your final result, but one might be more acceptable than
the other to you, your management, or your client.
In Project, consider using the linking feature discussed in Book III, Chapter 4
to link any split-off project to your project so you can keep tabs on its progress.
Cutting corners: The quality factor
If you decide that it’s product scope you want to change, you’re facing the
challenge of sacrificing quality. You have decided that to save time and money,
you will end up with a lesser product. That product might be a literal prod-
uct that you manufacture, such as shoes, or it might be a service you pro-
vide or a procedure you’re performing, such as a new drug test.
Take into account your internal or external client’s priorities and any safety
or regulatory requirements in taking this path. If the FDA says you have to
perform a certain number of tests on a new drug to ensure its quality, skip-
ping a test isn’t an option. If your client wants to produce the very best 
gourmet food on the market, skimping on quality won’t meet her needs. If,
however, one less focus group or a slightly lower-quality ingredient will do
just as well, you might consider modifying product scope.
Breaking off a piece of your project
If you decide that project scope is where you want to cut, you can take a dis-
creet portion of your project, such as the packaging design phase shown in
Figure 4-1, and either have somebody else handle it or turn those tasks into
another project that you’ll deal with down the road. You’ll still get every-
thing done, but not within the current budget or time period.
Modifying project scope typically means getting your client’s or manage-
ment’s buy-in. They have to agree to more time to deal with a portion of the
tasks later on and more money to fund a split-off project.

Selling Changes to Shareholders
466
Selling Changes to Shareholders
One of the biggest challenges in making drastic changes to make your 
project plan workable is selling your solution to your management.
Your task at this point is to document why it’s impossible to meet a particu-
lar schedule or budget and to suggest alternatives. We hate to say it, but
sometimes presented with this evidence, management says do the impossi-
ble anyway. Documenting your concerns is your best hedge against that fate-
ful day when you fail. It’s a corporate version of “I told you so,” but you
might find that it has you looking like the smart guy instead of the loser.
The following sections discuss some tools you can use to document your
concerns.
Using Project’s tools to close the “sale”
Project offers several useful features to help you at this point:

✦The ability to make changes to a project easily allows you to try out vari-
ous What If scenarios. Cutting costs by taking resources off of tasks
results in a longer schedule. Adding resources to save time costs more,
and so on.
✦Use Change Highlighting (see Figure 4-2) to show how certain changes
affect the schedule. If you changed the duration for a certain task in
your project, you can highlight how that change had an impact on sev-
eral others.
✦Use reports or print views to show your management these various sce-
narios or alternative project plans (see Figure 4-3). Project Visual
Reports can help you make a strong impact on your audience.
✦Use filters to help your bosses focus on areas such as the critical path
(see Figure 4-4). Being able to see the critical path helps you to demon-
strate how little spare time your plan provides, and hence how unrealis-
tic forcing you to stick to it might be.

Creating a compression table
A compression table is a good tool to use when your management has
insisted that you save time or money on your project, and you want to show
the tradeoffs involved in either action. This isn’t a feature of Project, it’s just
a useful way that project managers have found to document change for your
bosses, so it’s worth knowing about.
A compression table such as the one shown here might show more aggres-
sive dates alongside the current plan, highlighting the proposed compressed
duration for the project and the potential cost savings.

C
reating tasks, assigning resources, and establishing task dependencies
describe the planning phase of creating a project schedule. The plan-
ning phase can help you clarify what you need to do and what resources
you’ll need to do it. But using Project doesn’t stop there. When you move
into the phase of actually doing the project, Project can continue to help you.
If you set a baseline for your project, Project can help you compare your
original estimates with what actually occurs and to alert you to shifts in
timing. As you see in this chapter, you can set more than one baseline, and
you can use interim plans to capture dramatic timing shifts in your project.
Finally, you can use the critical path to identify the tasks that will cost you
the most, both in time and expense, if they slip.
Understanding Baselines and Interim Plans
As you prepare to track actual progress on a project (discussed in the next
chapter of this minibook) you should establish a baseline for your project.
The baseline is the detailed project plan against which actual work is tracked.
Setting a baseline is like taking a picture of your project schedule at the
moment your planning is complete but before you begin to record actual
information about the progress of your project.
Why set a baseline? Because, by setting a baseline in Project, you give 
yourself the opportunity, with no added work, to compare the estimates 
you established during the planning phase of creating your Project schedule
with what actually happens as the project progresses. Good project man-
agers use these comparisons to become better project managers. The 

Setting a Baseline
474
comparisons present you with the opportunity to learn from your successes
and your mistakes — and, face it, none of us is infallible. In our opinion, the
worst mistake anyone can make is to not learn from a mistake.
You set a baseline when you finish the planning phase of your project, and,
sometimes, you also set a baseline at the end of various phases. The base-
line is a set of your project data saved in the same Project file where you
track actual progress data.
An interim plan is really very similar to a baseline; the major difference
between them is that a baseline stores much more information than an interim
plan stores. An interim plan stores a set of task start and finish dates that you
can compare with another interim plan’s start and finish dates or with a base-
line plan’s start and finish dates, so the focus of an interim plan is to keep an
eye on progress or slippage. A baseline, on the other hand, contains much
more information; along with start and finish dates, a baseline contains dura-
tion, work, and cost information about tasks, resources, and assignments.
Setting a Baseline
You can set up to 11 baselines in your project. Saving baselines increases 
the size of your Project file; for each baseline you save, Project adds a set of
fields to store the baseline information. So, saving 11 sets of baselines can
create a really large Project file and slow down Project’s calculation of
changes to the project schedule.
In addition to slowing down Project’s ability to calculate your schedule,
saving too many sets of baselines can make the analysis work confusing and
more difficult.
That said, when would you need to set more than one baseline? On a shorter
project — one that lasts only a few weeks or even a couple of months — you
might set one baseline at the end of the planning phase and things might
proceed closely enough to your estimates that you won’t need any other
baselines. On longer projects, you might need to set several baselines along
the way, particularly if your original estimate is no longer useful because it
differs so much with what’s actually taking place. You might want to con-
sider setting a different baseline for each major milestone in your project.
You should always save a baseline at the end of the planning phase of your
project, before you start to record actuals. To save a baseline for the entire
project, follow these steps:

You can compare baseline information with actual information. See the next
chapter of this minibook for details.
Saving an Interim Plan
You can use interim plans when the only information you need to track is
timing information. You can save up to ten interim plans for your project.
Saving interim plans, like setting baselines, increases the size of your Project
file. However, setting an interim plan doesn’t affect the file size as much as
setting a baseline because interim plans store only task start and finish
dates, whereas baselines store much more information.
When you save an interim plan, you copy a set of start and finish dates into
one of ten other sets of start and finish dates. You can select certain tasks to
save in the interim plan, or you can save an interim plan for the entire proj-
ect. If you want to include only certain tasks in an interim plan — such as
future tasks — select those tasks before you start the following steps. To
save an interim plan, you follow the same basic steps, with a few changes:
1. Choose Tools➪Tracking➪Set Baseline.
Project displays the Set Baseline dialog box (see Figure 1-4).
2. Click the Set Interim Plan option.
3. Open the Copy drop-down list box and select the set of data you want
to copy to the interim plan.
4. Open the Into drop-down list box and select the start and finish fields
in which you want to store the interim plan information.

Don’t forget to save your project to save your interim plan information.
You can compare interim plan information with actual information. See the
next chapter of this minibook for details.
Changing a Baseline or Interim Plan
Sometimes you want to change the baseline or interim plan for some but 
not all tasks. For example, if you’re six months into your project and it’s put
on hold for three months, you might want to retain the baseline for tasks
completed up to this point, modify the timing of future tasks, and reset the
baseline only for tasks going forward; that way, you retain the ability to accu-
rately assess, for the entire project, how well you estimated. Or, suppose
that you find you need to add a task to the project. For example, you might
decide to break one task into two. In this case, you want to save that one
task along with the original baseline.
When you add a task to a baseline or an interim plan, you select the task
before you open the Set Baseline dialog box. And, Project presents you with
some options when you add selected tasks to a baseline. You can choose to
roll up baselines to all summary tasks and from subtasks into their parent
summary task(s). The relationship between the tasks in the project and the
task(s) that you select before you open the dialog box determine the effect
of these options.
Suppose that you have a project set up like the one shown in Figure 1-5. Also
suppose that you select Task 3, a child of Task 1 and the parent of Tasks 4
and 5, before you open the Set Baseline dialog box. If you select only the
From Subtasks into Selected Summary Task(s) check box in the Set Baseline
dialog box, Project rolls up the information from Tasks 4 and 5 to Task 3. If
you select only the To All Summary Tasks check box, Project rolls up base-
line information from Task 3 without regard to the baseline information that
is stored for Tasks 4 and 5. Finally, if you select both check boxes, Project
rolls up baseline information from Tasks 4 and 5 to Task 3 and then rolls up
that information to Task 1.

You add a task to an interim plan the same way that you add a task to a base-
line; since you have additional options to set when you add a task to a base-
line, let’s look at the steps to add a task to a baseline:
If you want to save changes to an existing task, make those changes and then
select the task.
1. Set up the new task.
2. Select the new task.
3. Choose Tools➪Tracking➪Set Baseline.
The Set Baseline dialog box appears (see Figure 1-6).
4. From the Set Baseline drop-down list, select the baseline that you
want to update.
5. Choose the Selected Tasks option button.
6. Choose the appropriate Roll Up Baselines settings (described earlier
in this section).
7. Click OK to save the baseline.
The baseline now includes the new task.

Clearing Baselines and Interim Plans
480
If you want Project to roll up baselines or interim plans for selected tasks the
same way every time you work with baselines or interim plans for selected
tasks, you can select the appropriate rollup setting and then click the Set as
Default button.
Clearing Baselines and Interim Plans
Although you really want to try to keep your baselines and interim plans,
you might have valid reasons to clear them. For example, suppose that you
complete the planning phase of your project, set the baseline, and then
receive word that your project is on hold. When you actually start work six
months later than you planned, you should set a new baseline so that you’ll
ultimately have good information for comparison when you review your esti-
mated and actual data.
To clear a baseline, choose Tools➪Tracking➪Clear Baseline. Project displays
the Clear Baseline dialog box (see Figure 1-7). Using this dialog box, you can
clear a baseline plan or an interim plan for the entire project or for selected
tasks.

Viewing the Critical Path
481
If you want to clear a baseline or interim plan for only part of the project,
select the affected tasks before you open the Clear Baseline dialog box.
Viewing the Critical Path
The critical path of your project is composed of those tasks that will cause
your project to take longer if any one of the tasks doesn’t finish on time.
Completing these tasks on time is critical to maintaining the project end
date. So, knowing which tasks are critical is important to you as a project
manager; you want to monitor those tasks closely.
You can view the critical path of your project in a number of ways; we find
filtering Gantt Chart view for critical tasks as the most effective way. In
Figure 1-8, you see all the tasks in the project, and in Figure 1-9, we filtered to
display only critical tasks. You use the Filter drop-down list box (shown in
the margin) on the Formatting toolbar to filter for critical tasks.
Figure 1-8:
A project
before
filtering for
critical
tasks.

Viewing the Critical Path
482
If you like to see all the tasks in your project but want to be able to identify
critical tasks, you have a couple of choices:
✦You can use Tracking Gantt view. In this view, the top bars of critical
tasks are red while the top bars of noncritical tasks are blue.
✦In Network Diagram view, boxes for critical tasks are red, and boxes for
noncritical tasks are blue.
✦You can use the Gantt Chart Wizard, discussed in Book IX, Chapter 2, to
color critical task Gantt bars in red in Gantt Chart view.
Noncritical tasks typically have some slack time. Slack time is the amount of
time that a task can slip before it affects another task’s dates or the finish
date of the project. Noncritical tasks with slack can start late without affect-
ing the schedule. But remember, a noncritical task can become critical if you
use up all of its slack by allowing it to start late or run longer than planned.

Viewing multiple critical paths
Company: Medium-sized firm specializing in
managing larger projects.
Project: Manage a larger project with several
networks of tasks.
Challenge: Ensure that the project finishes on
schedule.
Solution: Larger projects often contain several
networks of tasks; within any given network,
you can see tasks driving other tasks. The firm
can see the project’s critical path but has some
concerns because the project contains several
networks of tasks. From experience, the firm
knows that today’s task with slack can become
tomorrow’s critical task.
For this reason, the firm wants to identify not
only the project’s critical path but also the crit-
ical path of each network of tasks. That way,
the firm can identify, within a network of tasks,
the ones that are critical to finishing the net-
work on time. Finishing a network of tasks on
time helps ensure that the project won’t slip
because a noncritical task becomes critical.
In the figure, you see a project composed of
four networks of tasks:
 Network 1: Tasks 1, 2, and 3
 Network 2: Tasks 4 and 5
 Network 3: Tasks 6 through 10
 Network 4: Tasks 11 through 16
(continued)

Viewing the Critical Path
484
We’ve formatted the Gantt bars so that the bars
of critical tasks appear with a cross-hatched
pattern. (On-screen, they’re also red, as you
see if you open CS080101.mpp, the Project
file for this case study found on this book’s Web
site.) Notice that the project’s critical path
involves the tasks in the first two networks.
Although none of the tasks in Network 3 and
Network 4 are on the project’s critical path,
determining which tasks within each network
are critical helps you identify the tasks within
each network that cannot slip if the network of
tasks is to remain on schedule. You can display
multiple critical paths — one for each network
of tasks — by following these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
Project displays the Options dialog box.
2. Click the Calculation tab.
3. Select the Calculate Multiple Critical
Paths check box.
4. Click OK.
Project displays a critical path for each net-
work of tasks.
(continued)

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Working with

For each task, Project sets its late finish date
equal to its early finish date. When a task has
no links, it is critical because its late finish is
equal to its early finish. If a network of tasks
contains slack, like Networks 3 and 4, some
tasks are not critical while others are critical.
When you view multiple critical paths, you can
determine which tasks within a network of
tasks must be completed on time to avoid
delaying the network.

 Checking the progress
A
lthough our book isn’t linear in nature, some things about working
with projects are linear. You initially identify the project’s tasks and set
them up, creating dependencies between them and, if necessary, imposing
constraints. Next, you work with resources — defining them and then
assigning them to project tasks. You typically follow that exercise by focus-
ing on ironing out the kinks in the schedule caused by overallocations or 
by the schedule predicting that you won’t finish on time or within budget.
Finally, you hit the magic day when you set a baseline and the project starts.
At this point, you enter a new phase in the project management life cycle
that can make you a better project manager. Noting what actually happens
during the life of a project — called tracking or recording actuals — holds the
key to obtaining lots of different kinds of valuable information. For example,
setting a baseline and recording actuals gives you the ability to compare
estimates to actuals. You can use this information to revise your plan to
better fit reality, minimizing potential problems or avoiding them altogether.
After your project ends, comparing estimates with actuals helps you become
a better estimator, and making better estimates makes you a better future
project manager.
What’s Involved in Tracking?
Mostly, tracking is exactly what you think it is — finding out from those
working on the project just where things stand and then entering the infor-
mation in your Project file. What kind of information do you enter? Well, you
enter details such as the actual start date, the actual finish date, and the
actual duration of a task. You enter actual time that is worked by resources
and actual costs that are incurred. Project uses the information you provide
to adjust both the schedule and the project’s costs, and you can see the

Collecting Tracking Information
488
adjustments by using various views. If Project determines that you’re run-
ning late on a task, you see dependent tasks moved into the future. And,
Project adjusts projected total costs using a combination of actual costs and
remaining estimates.
You can read more about monitoring progress later in this chapter in the
section “Viewing Progress.”
After you enter actual information, you can produce reports that show man-
agement where your project stands, providing a foundation for requests for
more time, more resources, or a shift in strategy if things aren’t going as you
expected.
Don’t wait until the end of a task to enter tracking information. Tracking on a
regular basis helps you to identify changes from the estimated schedule. The
earlier you spot a delay, the more time you have to make up for it. Wise proj-
ect managers track activity on a regular basis, such as once a week or every
two weeks. Postponing the task of tracking simply makes the task take longer.
You can enter a “Tracking” task in your schedule to help you remember to
track. Set it up as a recurring task, and don’t forget to estimate the time to
collect the tracking information along with the time to enter it.
Collecting Tracking Information
Most of the time, collecting the information isn’t a “computer thing.” You get
tracking information pretty much however you can — having staff meetings,
using forms, and getting off-the-cuff updates at the water cooler.
Although it might sound obvious, you should determine exactly what infor-
mation you need to collect before you dive into collecting information.
Information may be power, but too much information is chaos. Besides, if
you ask folks for tons of information, you’re not likely to get any information.
So, how do you decide what information to collect? The information you
need to collect depends on the information you need to track. For example,
you might need to track only the timeline of a particular project, and there-
fore you didn’t assign resources to tasks. In this case, you need to collect
information that identifies how far along a task is — a percent complete
value for the task at a given point in time, along with an estimate of remain-
ing work if the task is ahead or behind the original schedule.
In other cases, you might need to manage resources, but you might not need
to track whether resources actually perform the amount of work you esti-
mated; that is, you can simply monitor the progress on tasks and let Project

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Entering Actuals
Setting Up to Track
489
assume that the resources assigned to the task split the work evenly. In this
case, you can still collect a Percent Complete value for the task at a given
point in time, along with an estimate of remaining work if the task is ahead of
or behind the original schedule.
But suppose that you need to track exactly how many hours each resource
works on a task on a given day to manage resource allocation, to precisely
record the work performed, and to determine, at any point in time, whether
your project is within budget. In this case, your best bet is to collect time-
sheets from resources, along with their best estimates concerning the
amount of work remaining to complete a task.
When you exceed your budget on one task, you might be able to make up
the difference on another task. So, although you might be overbudget this
week, you might be back on track next week.
As you probably expect, Project contains views that make entering actual
information easy, regardless of the type of information you collect.
After you identify the information you need to collect, create a short form —
the word “short” being the operative word — that asks for the information
you need. At a minimum, the form should ask each person whether the task
is on schedule and how much of the task is complete. The form should also
request a revised estimate of the task’s duration and a revised estimate of
the work required to complete the task. And, if you need more detail, such as
hours worked each day, request a timesheet be attached to your form.
If your organization uses Project Server, each person working on a project
can report all this information online, and you can use the information to
update your project.
Remember to specify how often you need to receive update information.
Setting Up to Track
Before you start recording tracking information in Project, you should
1. Check your calculation options.
2. Set the status date.
3. Select a tracking view.
The following sections discuss these steps in greater detail.

Setting Up to Track
490
Checking calculation options
Project contains several calculation options that affect the way Project cal-
culates your project’s schedule and costs. You can set these options by
choosing Tools➪Options and, in the Options dialog box that appears, click-
ing the Calculation tab (see Figure 2-1).
We cover some of these options in other places in the book, so we won’t
repeat them here. Instead, we focus on the calculation options that affect the
way recording actuals affects your project.
You can read about Project’s overall calculation options — the first two on
the Calculation tab — in Book V, Chapter 4. And, you can read about earned-
value calculations in Chapter 3 of this minibook. You can read about critical
path calculations in Book VII, Chapter 3, and Book III, Chapter 4 covers
inserted projects and how Project calculates them.
Updating resource status using task status
When you select the Updating Task Status Updates Resource Status check
box, Project updates the resource status to correspond with any updated
task status. This option works in reverse, too. If you update a resource’s
Figure 2-1:

491
status, Project also updates the task status accordingly. For example, if 
you select this check box and update the percentage of completion for a
task, Project also updates the % Complete field for the resource and the
assignment.
Adjusting task start dates
By default, when tasks begin late or early, Project doesn’t change the task
start dates or adjust the remaining portions of tasks. You can change this
behavior so that Project updates the tasks in relation to the Status Date. The
following check boxes affect how Project adjusts for late or early starts:
✦Move End of Completed Parts after Status Date Back to Status Date
✦And Move Start of Remaining Parts Back to Status Date
✦Move Start of Remaining Parts before Status Date Forward to Status Date
✦And Move End of Completed Parts Forward to Status Date
The first two check boxes work together, and the second two check boxes
work together, so we review them as two pairs.
You read about setting the status date in the section “Setting the status
date,” later in this chapter.
Suppose that you set the Status Date to February 7 and you have a task with
a Start Date of February 12 and a duration of 4 days. If the task actually starts
on February 5 and you select the Move End of Completed Parts after Status
Date Back to Status Date check box, Project moves the task start date to
February 5, sets the percent complete to 50%, and schedules the start of the
remaining work for February 14, creating a split task. If you also select the
And Move Start of Remaining Parts Back to Status Date check box, Project
makes the changes that we just described and moves the start of the remain-
ing work to February 7.
To understand the effects of checking the second pair of boxes, suppose,
once again, that the Status Date is February 7 and you have a task with a
Start Date of February 1 and a duration of 4 days. Furthermore, suppose 
that the task actually starts on February 5. If you select the Move Start of
Remaining Parts before Status Date Forward to Status Date check box, Project
leaves the task start date at February 1, sets the percent complete to 50%,
and schedules the remaining work to start on February 7 (the status date),
again creating a split task. If you also select the And Move End of Completed
Parts Forward to Status Date check box, Project makes the changes that we
just described but also moves the task’s actual start date to February 5.

Setting Up to Track
492
These options apply only when you make total actual value edits, including
task total actual work, task actual duration, total percent complete, and per-
cent work complete. These options don’t apply when you record actual
information on summary tasks or if you use timesheet information from
Project Server to update your project.
Spreading changes to Total Task % Complete
By default, the Edits to Total Task % Complete Will Be Spread to The Status
Date check box is not selected, so Project distributes percent completion
changes to the end of the actual duration of the task. If you select this check
box, Project distributes the changes evenly across the schedule to the proj-
ect status date.
Setting cost calculation options
Select the Actual Costs Are Always Calculated by Microsoft Office Project check
box to have Project calculate actual costs instead of you entering actual
costs. If you select this check box, Project overwrites any costs that you
enter prior to the task being 100% complete as Project recalculates costs.
You use the Default Fixed Costs Accrual list box to specify the way Project
accrues fixed costs for new tasks. Project can accrue fixed costs at the start
of a task or at the end of a task, or Project can prorate the costs throughout
the duration of the task.
Setting the status date
When you get ready to start recording tracking information, you want to set
the Status Date field — the “as of” date for the information you’re recording.
For example, although today may be March 30, you might want to record
information as of March 23.
To set the status date, choose Project➪Project Information, and Project 
displays the Project Information dialog box for the current project (see
Figure 2-2).
Open the Status Date list box, select the date you want to use when record-
ing actuals, and click OK.
If you don’t set the status date, Project uses the current date to recalculate
your project when you record actuals.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Entering Actuals

493
Selecting a tracking view
You’ll find it easiest to enter actuals in a view that matches the information
you plan to record. Earlier in this chapter, in the section, “Collecting
Tracking Information,” we talk about the kind of information you’ll be col-
lecting, and we mention that Project has a view that supports entering actu-
als, regardless of the information you collect.
You can record actuals by indicating total work or costs for a task or for a
resource assignment. The view that you choose depends largely on the level
of detail you plan to record.
When you record tracking information for a task, Project allocates the work
performed evenly among the resources assigned to the task — even if the
resources contributed different amounts of work to achieve the level of com-
pleteness you record. To record actuals for tasks without concern for
resource assignments, we suggest that you use Task Sheet view with the
Tracking table (see Figure 2-3).
You can assign the Tracking table to any task-oriented view. We’re using Task
Sheet view to keep things simple, but if you like working in Gantt Chart view,
that’s fine — use the Tracking table in Gantt Chart view.
If you want to record information by task but you also want an accurate
record of the amount of work completed by each resource assigned to the
task, we suggest that you use Task Usage view with the Tracking table (see
Figure 2-4). In this view, Project lists each task and, below the task, displays
a line for each resource assigned to the task. You record actual information
in the Actual Work column for each resource assigned to the task, and
Project calculates and displays the totals for the task in the Actual Work
column across from the task name.

If you don’t care about work by specific resources, you can record tracking
information by entering the value on the same row as the task, rather than
on the individual rows for the resources. Project divides the actual and
remaining work among the resources.
If you want to work from resource timesheets and record hours worked on a
task on specific days, you can use Project’s timephased fields, available on
the Details portion — the right side — of Task Usage and Resource Usage
views. As you can see in Task Usage view shown in Figure 2-5, these views
show, by default, one row — the Work row — along with fields for each day
of the week. You can add the Actual Work row to the Details view by right-
clicking anywhere on the Details portion of the view and choosing Actual
Work from the shortcut menu that appears. Then you can record information
on the Actual Work row beside the appropriate resource and in the column
of the day on which the work occurred.
In addition to selecting the view and table that best matches your need to
enter tracking information, take advantage of the Tracking toolbar (see
Figure 2-6). You can display this toolbar by right-clicking in the toolbar area
at the top of the screen and choosing Tracking from the shortcut menu that
appears.

496
Using buttons on the Tracking toolbar, you can display the Project Statistics
dialog box, the Collaborate toolbar, and progress lines; you can read more
about progress lines later in this chapter, in the section, “Viewing Progress.”
You can use other tools on the toolbar to mark a task 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or
100% complete. When you select a task and click the Update As Scheduled
tool on the Tracking toolbar, Project updates the task to the percent com-
plete the task should be based on the status date. The Reschedule Work tool
reschedules all tasks that begin after the status date. The Update Tasks tool
opens a dialog box that you can use to record tracking information. And,
clicking the Set Reminder tool opens a dialog box that you can use to play a
sound a specified number of minutes before a task should begin. You might
find the sound useful to set a reminder for tasks that represent meetings you
need to attend.
Ways to Record Actuals
Project provides you with many ways to record actual information. Typically,
when you enter tracking information in one field, Project calculates values
for other fields. For example, if you enter a percentage complete for a task,
Project calculates and supplies an actual start date, an actual duration, a
remaining duration, and an actual work value.
As you record tracking information, Project adjusts your project’s cost to
reflect the effect of higher-than-expected costs. And, if Project determines
that you’re running late on a task, it automatically moves dependent tasks
into the future.

Estimating the Percent Complete
You can establish the progress of a task by assigning a Percent Complete
value to the task. Enter any value less than 100 to indicate that the task is
not complete. You can enter a Percent Complete value using Task Sheet view
and the Tracking table (see Figure 2-7), and you can use the tools on the
Tracking toolbar to enter Percent Complete values.
To display the Tracking table, right-click the Select All button and choose
Tracking.
If you prefer to enter the percent of work complete on a task, use Task Sheet
view (the one shown in Figure 2-7) but use the Work table instead of the
Tracking table, and enter the percentage value in the Percent Work Complete
field (see Figure 2-8).
Entering the values isn’t difficult; deciding what values to enter is a bit trick-
ier. We typically recommend that you enter your best guess, based on your
experience and the information you get from the resources who provide you
with information about a task’s progress.
Select All button

Ways to Record Actuals
498
When a task produces something measurable, estimating percent complete
is easier. For example, if the task calls for setting up ten servers and you’ve
set up five, the task is probably 50% complete. Or, if the task calls for train-
ing 100 employees and 75 have completed the training, the task is probably
75% complete.
But sometimes estimating completeness isn’t that straightforward. If you
estimate that a task should take eight days to complete and your resources
report spending two days on the task, the task might be 25% complete, but
just because resources have put in 25% of the time you estimated doesn’t
mean that they’ve completed 25% of the work.
You might also be tempted to use costs to estimate completeness. If you esti-
mate that two resources assigned to a two-day task will cost $2,000, you
might be tempted to estimate that a task is 50% complete when the task’s
costs reach $1,000. But, once again, just because costs have reached the 50%
mark, it doesn’t mean that 50% of the work on the task is complete.
In cases where progress is less obvious, you need to use your intuition when
you make your estimate. Remember, you didn’t get to be a project manager
without demonstrating some good management skills.

What happens when you enter a Percent Complete value? Project assigns an
Actual Start Date (unless you entered one previously) and calculates the
Actual Duration and Remaining Duration values. If you set Calculation
options to update resources when you update tasks, Project also calculates
the Actual Cost and Actual Work values.
If you enter 100 in the Percent Complete column, Project assigns the planned
finish date to the Actual Finish Date column. If the task doesn’t finish on the
planned finish date, don’t enter a Percent Complete value; instead, enter an
Actual Finish Date.
Using start or finish dates
You can update task start or finish dates to record actuals in Project. If you
mark a task as 100% complete and don’t record an actual start date or an
actual finish date, Project assumes that the task started and finished on
time.
Because real life rarely matches estimates, you should enter an actual start
date if the task didn’t start on time so that your schedule reflects actual
timing. Similarly, if the task didn’t finish on the estimated finish date, you
should enter an actual finish date so that your schedule reflects actual
timing.
If you enter an actual finish date that is earlier than the estimated finish date
and you don’t adjust the task duration, Project assumes that the task started
earlier than planned.
% Complete versus Physical % Complete
Although they sound like they’re related, the
relationship is tenuous at best. Project’s %
Complete field represents exactly what it
sounds like — the percentage of a task that is
complete. If you don’t enter a value in the %
Complete field, Project calculates it for you
based on Total Duration or Actual Duration
values you enter, and Project uses these dura-
tion fields to calculate the budgeted cost of
work performed (BCWP), which is a budget
value that you can read about in the next chap-
ter of this minibook.
Project uses the Physical % Complete field as
an alternative way to calculate BCWP. The
Physical % Complete field is independent of the
Total Duration and Actual Duration fields. Use
the Physical % Complete field when the %
Complete value would not accurately represent
the real work performed on a task. You can read
more about having Project calculate BCWP
using Physical % Complete in the next chapter
of this minibook.

Ways to Record Actuals
500
The Actual Start and Actual Finish fields appear on the Tracking table of any
view, or you can use the Update Tasks dialog box, shown in Figure 2-9, to
record actual start or actual finish dates.
Select the task you want to update and click the Update Tasks button on the
Tracking toolbar.
Using Windows selection techniques, you can select more than one task
simultaneously. Press Ctrl and click each task you want to select, or, if the
tasks appear contiguously in the schedule, click the first task, press Shift,
and click the last task you want to select.
In the Actual section, click the Start list box arrow to display a calendar and
select the task’s start date. When you enter an actual start date, Project
changes the task’s estimated start date. When you enter an actual finish
date, Project changes several fields: the estimated finish date, the Percent
Complete field, the Actual Duration field, the Remaining Duration field, the
Actual Work field, and the Actual Cost field. If you set only an actual finish
date and not an actual start date, Project changes the actual start date also.
Recording actual and remaining durations
You can use Task Sheet view and Tracking Table to record both actual and
remaining duration. And, when you record actual and remaining duration
values, Project updates the Actual Start, Actual Cost, Actual Work, Percent
Complete, and Remaining Duration fields. In some cases, Project also
updates the Actual Finish field.
The actual duration of a task is the amount of time that was needed to com-
plete the task. When you record an actual duration, Project calculates a
value for the Percent Complete field using this formula:
Percent Complete = Actual Duration / Duration
Figure 2-9:

actual start
and finish
dates for
tasks that
don’t start
or finish on
the planned
dates.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Entering Actuals

501
and a value for the Remaining Duration field using this formula:
Remaining Duration = Duration – Actual Duration
When you set an actual duration that’s less than or equal to the planned
duration, Project assumes that the task is progressing on schedule and sets
the actual start date to the planned start date unless you previously set the
actual start date. In that case, Project leaves the actual start date alone.
When you set an actual duration that is greater than the planned duration,
Project assumes that the task is finished but that it took longer than
expected to complete. Project fills in the Actual Finish field using the
planned finish date, adjusts the planned duration to match the actual dura-
tion, and changes the Percent Complete field to 100% and the Remaining
Duration field to 0%.
Suppose that you set calculation options (on the Calculation tab of the
Options dialog box) so that Project updates the status of resources when
you update a task’s status. When you supply an actual duration, Project also
updates the work and cost figures for the resources.
The Remaining Duration field shows how much more time you need to com-
plete a task. If you enter a value in only the Remaining Duration field that’s
higher or lower than the existing figure, Project assumes that you’re chang-
ing the planned duration of the task instead of tracking actual progress for
the task. In this case, Project adjusts the schedule based on the new planned
duration.
But, if you enter a value into the Remaining Duration field after entering a
value in the Actual Duration field, Project assumes that the work for the task
will be completed based on the remaining duration value. Therefore, Project
sets the Percent Complete value based on a combination of the remaining
duration value that you supplied and the original planned duration. Entering
0 in the Remaining Duration field is the same as entering 100% in the Percent
Complete column. Project assigns the planned finish date to the Actual
Finish Date field. If this value isn’t correct, change the Actual Finish Date.
Project makes a similar adjustment if you enter information into the Percent
Complete field and the Remaining Duration field. In this case, Project adjusts
the Actual Duration field using a combination of the remaining duration
value and the original planned duration.
Recording Actual Work
When you schedule tasks based on the availability of certain resources,
tracking progress on a task is easiest if you update the Actual Work field —
typically, you use timesheet information to make your entries.

Ways to Record Actuals
502
You can record total actual work by resource by following these steps:
1. Choose View➪Task Usage.
Project displays the Task Usage view.
2. Right-click the Select All button.
A shortcut menu appears.
3. Choose Tracking.
Project applies the Tracking table to the view.
4. Drag the divider bar almost completely to the right edge of the screen
to reveal the Actual Work column (see Figure 2-10).
5. Under the appropriate task, find the appropriate resource.
6. Enter a value for the resource in the Actual Work column.
You can record actual work for the task by entering the value in the Actual
Work field on the Tracking table (instead of using the Details portion of the
view) and entering the value on the same row as the task, rather than on the
individual rows for the resources. Project divides the actual and remaining
work among the resources.
Figure 2-10:
Task Usage

the Tracking
table.

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Entering Actuals
Ways to Record Actuals
503
You can also use this view to enter a resource’s work on a task on the day
the work occurred; when you use this approach, Project calculates total
actual work — the value in the Actual Work column — for you. Follow Steps
1–3 in the preceding list. Then right-click anywhere in the Details portion of
the view (the right side) and choose Actual Work from the shortcut menu
that appears. In the Details portion of the view, beside the appropriate
resource, record tracking information on the Actual Work row in the column
of the day on which the work occurred (see Figure 2-11).
You also can use Resource Usage view, shown in Figure 2-12, to enter a
resource’s work on a task on the day the work occurred. Project automati-
cally displays the Usage table on the left side of the view, but if you’re
recording actuals from timesheets, this view might work better for you than
Task Usage view because it lists resources and then the tasks assigned to
them.
Make sure that you record actual work in the Details portion of the view on
the appropriate day. Be aware that the Work column in the Usage table on
the left side of the view displays planned work, not actual work. You can add
the Actual Work column to the view and record actuals in that column; if you
do, Project assumes that the actual work you record occurred on the days
estimated in the baseline plan.

Speeding up recording actuals
You can update several tasks or even your entire project at one time by
using the Update Project dialog box shown in Figure 2-13. To open this dialog
box, start in any task-oriented view. If you plan to update only selected tasks,
select them before you open the dialog box by choosing
Tools➪Tracking➪Update Project.

This technique works well if you have several tasks that are on schedule or
were completed on schedule. Select the Update Work As Complete Through
option and select a date. Then select an option:
✦Select the Set 0% – 100% Complete option to let Project calculate the
percent complete on every task that should have begun by that date.
When you select this option, Project assumes that tasks started and pro-
gressed as planned.
✦Selecting the Set 0% or 100% Complete Only option tells Project to
mark as finished all tasks that the baseline plan indicates would have
been complete by the date you selected and to leave all other tasks as
0% complete.
The Update Project dialog box also helps you ensure that no remaining work
for partially completed tasks is scheduled for dates that have already
passed. Select the Reschedule Uncompleted Work To Start After option and
select a date; Project reschedules the portions of tasks that aren’t complete
to start after the date you selected.
For either option, you can select to update your entire project or only
selected tasks. When you update the entire project, Project sets the project
status date to the date that you selected in the dialog box.
When you reschedule a partially completed task, Project automatically splits
the task between the completed portion and the remaining portion. If the
completed portion of the task finished sometime before the remaining por-
tion is scheduled to start, you see a split task on the Gantt chart. In addition,
Project places constraints on all tasks you reschedule; you’ll see indicators
in the Indicators column of many views.
Tracking materials usage
As Book V, Chapter 1 describes, you can create Material resources and
assign them to tasks. You update actual work for Material resources the
same way you update actual work for Work resources. You can work in Task
Usage view and record total work for the Material resource in the Actual
Work column. Or, if you want, use the time-phased fields in the Details por-
tion on the right side of the view. Make sure you display the Actual Work row
by right-clicking anywhere in the Details portion and choosing Actual Work.
Then, on the appropriate day, across from the resource under the appropri-
ate task, record the amount of the Material resource that was used.
Although it might not seem important to track the use of Material resources,
they do affect the cost of your project.

Viewing Progress
506
Viewing Progress
Project provides some visual cues when you record tracking information for
your project. For example, in Gantt Chart view, a check mark appears in the
Indicator column beside tasks that are 100% complete (see Figure 2-14). In
addition, a black bar extends inside the Gantt bar of each task that has
started, providing a visual cue that represents how far along the task has
progressed.
Figure 2-14:
You can

Tracking consolidated projects
Book III, Chapter 4 covers inserting and linking
projects to create a consolidated project.
When you create a consolidated project, you
can choose to link the projects. If you link the
projects, Project retains, in the subproject files,
updates you make when recording actuals in
the consolidated project (and vice versa). If you
don’t link the projects, changes made to the
consolidated project don’t affect the individual
subproject files (and vice versa).

Using progress lines
You can add progress lines to your project to provide additional information
about tasks that have started. A progress line zigzags between tasks, and the
direction of the left- or right-pointing line identifies late or early tasks. A
progress line that points to the left of a task identifies a task that is running
behind schedule, and a progress line pointing to the right of a task identifies
a task that is running ahead of schedule (see Figure 2-15).
To add progress lines to your schedule, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Gantt Chart.
2. Choose Tools➪Tracking➪Progress Lines.
Project displays the Dates and Intervals tab of the Progress Lines 
dialog box.
3. Select the Display Selected Progress Lines check box.
The Progress Line Dates list becomes available.
4. Click once in the Progress Line Dates list.
Project displays a list box arrow.

5. Click the list box arrow.
A small calendar appears (see Figure 2-16).
6. Select a date for the progress line.
7. Select either Actual Plan or Baseline Plan in the Display Progress
Lines in Relation To section.
8. Click OK.
Project adds the progress line to your Gantt chart (refer to Figure 2-15).
You can use the Line Styles tab of the Progress Lines dialog box to change
the shape, thickness, and color of progress lines.
If you decide that you like progress lines, you can display them at varying
intervals, in relation to the Baseline plan or the Actual plan, and from the
Line Styles tab you can add a date to each progress line. If you display more
than one progress line, consider using the Line Styles tab of the Progress
Lines dialog box to format the lines so that you can tell them apart.
You can delete any single progress line by selecting it in the Display Selected
Progress Lines list and clicking the Delete button. To stop displaying all
progress lines, reopen the Progress Lines dialog box and remove the check
mark from the Display Selected Progress Lines check box on the Dates and
Intervals tab.

Using Tracking Gantt view
After you set a baseline — and maybe even an interim plan — and record
actuals, you can compare your baseline or interim plan to what’s happening
in your project now. You can see the differences between your plans and
what’s actually happening both graphically, using Tracking Gantt view, and
through data that appears in various tables.
Tracking Gantt view helps you view actual progress compared to a baseline
estimate. To display Tracking Gantt view, click its icon in the View bar or
choose View➪Tracking Gantt.
The default table for Tracking Gantt view is the Entry table, but you can
change the table and you can insert and hide fields (columns) to display
other information. In Figure 2-17, you see Tracking Gantt view and the
Tracking table.
The bars on Tracking Gantt view vary in appearance slightly from the task
bars on standard Gantt Chart view; the Tracking Gantt bars indicate
progress on tasks in the project. At the top of Tracking Gantt view, you see
the summary task for the project, and below it, you see a black-and-white
hatched bar. That hatched bar represents progress on the summary task. On
Tracking Gantt view, noncritical tasks appear in blue, and critical tasks
appear in red.
Figure 2-17:
Tracking

Viewing Progress
510
On all tasks that aren’t summary tasks, you see two bars. The top bar repre-
sents expected duration based on actuals you enter, and the bottom bar rep-
resents baseline duration.
The percentage indicator at the edge of a task bar identifies the percentage
complete for that task. Although you have to look very closely, the bars of
partially completed tasks are solid on the left and patterned on the right.
The solid part represents the completed part of the task, and the patterned
part represents the incomplete part of the task.
Using tables to review progress
The Variance, Work, and Cost tables help you review progress by showing
you the details associated with your project’s progress. The numbers you
find in these tables help you determine whether you’re on schedule and
within budget.
To review these tables, we suggest that you start in Task Sheet view, which
lets you focus strictly on table information.
The Variance table
To display the Variance table, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪More Views.
The More Views dialog box appears.
2. Select Task Sheet from the list.
3. Click Apply.
Project displays Task Sheet view.
4. Right-click the Select All button and choose Variance.
Project displays the Variance table (see Figure 2-18).
The Variance table highlights the variance in task timing between the base-
lines and actuals. You can easily compare the Baseline Start and Baseline
Finish and the actual Start and Finish columns that show actual data for
tasks on which you have tracked progress as well as baseline data for tasks
with no progress. The Start Variance field shows you how many days late or
early the task started, and the Finish Variance field shows you how many
days late or early the task ended.

Viewing Progress
511
If you save several baselines or interim plans, you can view the information
in them by adding columns to the table. The baseline fields that appear on
the Variance table are associated with the first baseline, which Project calls
Baseline. If you saved information to Baseline 1, add the fields for Baseline 1
to the table. To view interim plan information, add information for Start 1
through Start 10.
Interim plans store only start and finish dates, whereas baselines store much
more information, including cost, budgeted costs, budgeted work, duration,
and more. For details on interim plans and baselines, see Chapter 1 of this
minibook.
To add a field to the table, insert a column. Right-click the column that you
want to appear to the right of the column you plan to insert. Then choose
Insert Column from the shortcut menu. In the Field Name list, select the field
for which you want to add a column and click OK.

The Cost table
Project contains two versions of the Cost table: the Cost table associated
with task-oriented views, and the Cost table associated with resource-ori-
ented views. To view the Cost table associated with tasks (see Figure 2-19),
start in any task-oriented view (we like Task Sheet view), right-click the
Select All button, and choose Cost.
The Cost table is most useful for pointing out variations in money spent on
the project. Project takes the following factors into account when calculating
cost variations:
✦The estimate of resource time still to be expended to complete the task
✦Actual resource time worked
✦Actual costs (such as fees and permits) that have been tracked on the
task

The Cost table for resources is similar to the Cost table for tasks, with the
breakdown of costs being displayed by resource rather than by task (see
Figure 2-20).
To display this table, begin with a resource view such as Resource Sheet
view. Then right-click the Select All button and choose Cost from the short-
cut menu that appears.
The Work table
Like the Cost table, Project contains two variations of the Work table — one
for tasks and one for resources. You display the Work table for tasks (see
Figure 2-21) by starting in a task-oriented view such as Task Sheet view,
right-clicking the Select All button, and selecting Work from the shortcut
menu.The Work table focuses on the number of work hours put in by
resources that are working on tasks. The Variance field shows the difference
between the baseline hours of work and the actual hours spent; if the
amount in the Variance field is negative, fewer hours were used than were
estimated in the baseline.

 The basics of Earned Value fields
 Examining cost variance
 Using Physical % Complete or % Complete in Earned Value calculations
A
fter you save a baseline for your project, assign resources with costs to
tasks in your project, and complete some work on the project, you can
begin to analyze the progress of your project based on the costs that you
incur — or the Earned Value of your project.
Project managers use Earned Value information to measure the progress 
of a project based on the cost of work performed up to the project status
date. Project calculates Earned Value by comparing your original cost esti-
mates to the actual cost of work performed to show whether your project is
on budget. This chapter explains Project’s Earned Value fields and shows
you how to compare budgeted to actual costs.
The Basics of Earned Value Fields
Earned Value fields in Project are currency fields, and Project uses acronyms
to represent the various Earned Value fields in tables, but three Earned Value
fields are at the heart of the analysis when Project calculates Earned Value:
✦BCWS (Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled): Measures the budgeted
cost of individual tasks based on the resources and fixed costs that are
assigned to the tasks when you schedule them.
✦BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed): Indicates how much of a
task’s budget should have been spent given the actual duration of the
task. For example, suppose that you have a task budgeted at $1,000 and
work has been performed for one day. You find that, after one day, 40
percent of the work has been completed. The BCWP for the task at this
point is $400.
✦ACWP (Actual Cost of Work Performed): Measures the actual cost
that’s incurred to complete a task. Before you complete the process,
ACWP represents the actual costs for work performed through the 
project’s status date.

The Basics of Earned Value Fields
518
In addition to these three Earned Value fields, you also find the following
fields:
✦SV (Schedule Variance)
✦CV (Cost Variance)
✦BAC (Budgeted at Completion)
✦EAC (Estimate at Completion)
✦VAC (Variance at Completion)
✦CPI (Cost Performance Index)
✦SPI (Schedule Performance Index)
✦CV% (Cost Variance %)
✦SV% (Schedule Variance %)
✦TCPI (To Complete Performance Index)
✦Physical % Complete
Project calculates BCWS, BCWP, ACWP, SV, and CV through the project status
date or through today. SV represents the cost difference between current
progress and the baseline plan, and Project calculates this value as BCWP
minus BCWS. CV represents the cost difference between actual costs and
planned costs at the current level of completion, and Project calculates this
value as BCWP minus ACWP. BAC represents baseline cost, and Project cal-
culates this field as the sum of planned fixed costs plus planned costs for all
assigned resources. EAC shows the planned costs based on costs that are
already incurred plus additional planned costs, and Project calculates this
field using the following formula: ACWP + (BAC – BCWP) / CPI. VAC repre-
sents the variance between the baseline cost and the combination of actual
costs plus planned costs for a task.
You find task fields, resource fields, and assignment fields as well as time-
phased versions of each field for BCWS, BCWP, ACWP, SV, CV, and BAC. EAC
is a task field only, and VAC is a task field, resource field, and assignment
field but there are no timephased versions of this field.
Project calculates CPI, a timephased field, by dividing BCWP by ACWP.
Project calculates SPI, a timephased field, by dividing BCWP by BCWS.
Project calculates CV%, a timephased field, by dividing CV by BCWP and
multiplying the result by 100.

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Reviewing Your
Budget
Examining Cost Variance
519
Project calculates SV%, a timephased field, by dividing SV by BCWS and mul-
tiplying the result by 100.
Project calculates TCPI by using the following formula: (BAC – BCWP) / 
(EAC – ACWP). This field is not a timephased field.
The Physical % Complete field represents your estimate of the progress of a
task, regardless of actual work or time. Project calculates Physical % Complete,
not a timephased field, by rolling up BCWP on subtasks to BCWP on associ-
ated summary tasks.
The section “Physical % Complete Versus % Complete,” later in this chapter,
describes the difference between these two fields and how you can use them.
Examining Cost Variance
Project contains four Earned Value tables that you can use to compare your
expected costs with your actual costs and evaluate the relationship between
work and costs:
✦Earned Value for tasks
✦Earned Value for resources
✦Earned Value Cost Indicators
✦Earned Value Schedule Indicators
You can use the Earned Value tables to forecast whether a task will finish
within the budget based on the comparison of the actual costs incurred for
the task to date and the baseline cost of the task.
Using the Earned Value table for tasks (see Figure 3-1), you can compare the
relationship between work and costs for tasks and evaluate your budget to
estimate future budget needs and prepare an accounting statement of your
project.
To display the Earned Value table for tasks, follow these steps:
1. Start in any task view, such as Task Sheet view.
2. Right-click the Select All button and choose More Tables from the
shortcut menu that appears.
3. In the More Tables dialog box that appears, select Earned Value.
4. Click Apply.
Project applies the Earned Value table for tasks to the view.

Examining Cost Variance
520
All the fields on this sheet are calculated, except BAC. You can type values
into the BAC field to change information in the table.
The Earned Value table for resources (see Figure 3-2) displays the same
fields as the Earned Value table for tasks, helping you compare the relation-
ship between work and costs for resources.
To display the Earned Value table for resources, follow the preceding steps,
but in Step 1, start in any resource view, such as Resource Sheet view.
The Earned Value Cost Indicators and Earned Value Schedule Indicators
tables are similar to their cousin, the Earned Value for tasks table. Using the
Earned Value Cost Indicators table (see Figure 3-3) you can compare the vari-
ous cost factors related to tasks in your project. Using the Earned Value
Schedule Indicators table for tasks (see Figure 3-4), you can focus on the
effects of scheduling variances on the cost of your project.
To display either table, follow the preceding steps, but in Step 4, select
either the Earned Value Cost Indicators table or the Earned Value Schedule
Indicators table.

522
In addition to using Earned Value tables to examine how the costs of your
project are progressing, you can use Excel to analyze the data by using the
Earned Value Over Time visual report. You also can export your project to
Excel and create a PivotTable to analyze the information. See Book VI,
Chapter 4 for details on visual reporting, and turn to Book IX, Chapter 5 for
information on exporting Project information.
Physical % Complete Versus % Complete
Although % Complete and Physical % Complete sound like they’re related,
they really aren’t. Project’s % Complete field represents exactly what it
sounds like — the percentage of a task that is complete. If you don’t enter a
value in the % Complete field, Project calculates it for you by dividing actual
task duration by total duration. Project uses % Complete to calculate the
budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP).
Physical % Complete is your estimate of where a task stands and has no con-
nection to duration. You enter Physical % Complete estimates, and Project
applies Physical % Complete to assignment data or Fixed Costs data for the
associated summary task.

You can use the Physical % Complete field as an alternative way to calculate
BCWP when the % Complete value wouldn’t accurately represent the real
work performed on a task.

method for all new tasks in your project by following these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
The Options dialog box appears (see Figure 3-5).

tion method on a task-by-task basis using these steps:
1. Select the task(s) for which you want to set the Earned Value calcula-
tion method to Physical % Complete.
2. Click the Task Information button on the Standard toolbar.
Project displays the Multiple Task Information dialog box.
3. Click the Advanced tab.
4. From the Earned Value Method list box, select Physical % Complete
(see Figure 3-7).

To record Physical % Complete, add the field as a column on a table view;
Figure 3-8 shows the field in the Earned Value for Tasks table. Then type in
appropriate amounts for tasks. You see other Earned Value fields update
accordingly.
To insert a column, click the heading of the column to the right of the
column that you are inserting. Then choose Insert➪Column.
You saw when you established Physical % Complete as the Earned Value cal-
culation method that the Earned Value calculation method is associated with
a particular baseline, and you can clear baselines. Because the preceding
section explained how to enter Physical % Complete values, you might be
wondering what happens to your Physical % Complete estimates if you clear
a baseline. You can quit worrying; clearing a baseline after entering Physical
% Complete values for it doesn’t clear the Physical % Complete values.

You probably feel more comfortable in your own home than any other
place. After all, you decorate your home to reflect your personality and
make it a comfortable place for you to be. You choose the colors, the fur-
nishings, the carpet, the tile . . . you get our drift.
You can make Project comfortable by customizing it to reflect the way you
work. For example, you can choose to display the Project Guide each time
you open Project, and you can decide whether you want the Standard and
Formatting toolbars to take up one line or two on-screen. You can even build
your own toolbars. So, this chapter explores the things you can do to make
the Project working environment suit your needs.
Lots of settings can change Project’s behavior; in this chapter, we cover the
ones we think can help you most and impact your daily work.
Controlling the Project Guide’s Behavior
The Project Guide is a tool that can guide you through the process of setting
up a project. When visible, the Project Guide appears in a task pane on the
left side of the screen (see Figure 1-1). In the Project Guide, you see links
that you can click to walk you through actions necessary to set up a project.

Controlling the Project Guide’s Behavior
530
When the Project Guide appears on-screen, the Project Guide toolbar also
appears; each button on the Project Guide toolbar changes the links that
appear in the Project Guide pane to focus on setting up different project
information.
When you first start working with a project, having the Project Guide visible
can be handy, helping to remind you of the things you need to do. But, as
you get into working with a project, you might not want the Project Guide
taking up valuable screen real estate. You can control whether the Project
Guide appears on-screen from the View menu. Choose View➪Turn On
Project Guide (see Figure 1-2); when the Project Guide appears in the task
pane, you can hide it by choosing View➪Turn Off Project Guide.
For the technically curious, selecting or deselecting the Display Project
Guide check box on the Interface tab of the Options dialog box has the exact
same effect as using the command on the View menu.

How Many Times Can You Undo?
531
How Many Times Can You Undo?
Project fell behind its Office cousins when it came to undoing actions — until
Project 2007. Now, Project also has the capability to undo more than just
your last action. You can set the number of actions that you can undo to any
number between 1 and 99; Project sets the number to 20 by default.
We can hear you thinking (it was our first thought, too), “Why not set it to
99?” Yes, you’re right — there’s a reason.
Each action you take while working in Project requires Project to track a rel-
atively large or small amount of data. For example, changing the task names
of 20 different tasks isn’t really a lot of changes for Project to track. But,
tracking the information associated with ten baselines is a much larger 
set of data.
Project tracks everything in memory, and some processes use more memory
than others. By increasing the number of actions to track to 99, you’re actu-
ally asking Project to use more memory to track your actions, in case you
need to undo. If you change the Undo level to 99, Project’s performance
might go down enough for you to notice.
That said, if you prefer to have Project track more than 20 actions, you can
do it. Choose Tools➪Options and click the General tab. Then change the
number that appears in the Undo Levels box (see Figure 1-3).

Switching Between Open Projects
By default, Project displays a Windows taskbar icon for each open Project
(see Figure 1-4). Depending on the number of open files, you might not nec-
essarily be able to identify the file from the icon on the Windows taskbar, 
but you can see a few letters of the filename on the icon. In addition, if you
point the mouse at the icon, you see a ToolTip that shows the entire path
and filename.
This behavior works well for people who like to switch between projects by
clicking an icon on the Windows taskbar. But, suppose that you’re one of
those people who places a premium on Windows taskbar real estate and you
really don’t want to see each project in the Windows taskbar; you prefer to
see one icon per open program — not open file — in the Windows taskbar.
You can change Project’s behavior by following these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
Project displays the Options dialog box (see Figure 1-5).

2. Click the View tab.
3. Remove the check from the Windows in Taskbar option.
4. Click OK.
Project saves your changes and closes the Options dialog box.
Project changes the appearance of the Windows taskbar to display only one
icon for the project you’re currently viewing. But all open projects appear on
the Window menu (see Figure 1-6), and in fact, you use the Window menu to
switch to a different open project by clicking the name of the project you
want to view.
Regardless of the behavior that you choose in the Options dialog box, all
open Project files appear at the bottom of the Window menu, and you can
use the Window menu to switch among Project files.
Customizing the Way You Open
This setting is one of our favorites. Quite frequently, we find ourselves work-
ing with the last six or eight files we opened. We really like being able to find
them quickly to reopen them. You can quickly open a file if it appears at the
bottom of the File menu (see Figure 1-7).
By default, Project displays the last four files we opened at the bottom of the
File menu. That’s a good start, but we want more.

2. Click the General tab.
3. Change the number in the Recently Used File List box.
4. Click OK.
Project saves your changes and closes the Options dialog box.
As you open other projects, Project expands the number of files that appear
at the bottom of the File menu to display the number of files you chose in
the Options dialog box.
Don’t forget that you can turn on the display of the project summary task
from the View tab.
Customizing the Way You Save
When you set the File Locations option, you actually help yourself when it
comes to both saving and opening files because you establish a default
folder in which Project saves files. And, when you open a file, Project always
looks for it first in the default folder where you save files.
By default, Project saves files to the My Documents folder. Some orderly
folks prefer to save Project files in a folder created to store only Project files.
Other folks set up folders by subject and store all files related to a particular
subject in a folder. So, you might have one or more Project files, Word docu-
ments, and Excel spreadsheets in a folder that contains all the information
related to a particular project.
Whatever your method of organization, you can set a default folder where
Project saves files and then looks when you want to open them by following
these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
Project displays the Options dialog box (see Figure 1-9).
2. Click the Save tab.
3. Click Projects in the File Types section.
4. Click the Modify button.
The Modify Location dialog box appears (see Figure 1-10).
5. Open the Look In list and navigate to the folder where you want to
save Project files by default.
6. Click OK twice.
Project saves your changes and closes the Options dialog box.

A few other options on the Save tab bear mentioning:
✦Auto Save: The Auto Save feature is particularly valuable if you tend to
work extensively and forget to save regularly. By setting the Auto Save
option, you can avoid becoming a victim of power failures or server
Figure 1-10:

crashes. Select the Save Every check box and specify the number of min-
utes that should elapse between saves. You also can choose to save only
the project you’re viewing or all open projects, and you can have Project
prompt you before saving.
Although Auto Save works in the background, it can slow down Project’s
performance with large files.
✦Default file format: You can specify the default file format for each new
Project file that you save. This option comes in handy, for example, if
you regularly share files with someone who uses another version of
Project.
The Project 2007 format is different from Project 2003, Project 2002, and
Project 2000, all of which share the same file format. You can no longer save
a file to the Project 98 format.
You might lose information if you save a file created in Project 2007 in the
format of Project 2000 – 2003. For example, background cell formatting 
doesn’t exist in any version of Project prior to Project 2007. If you apply
background formatting to cells in a file and then save the file in Project 
2000 – 2003 format, you lose the background cell formatting.
Customizing the Toolbars
Toolbars provide a quick and easy way to avoid opening menus and choos-
ing commands. To make the most of this high-tech tool, you have some
options.
One line or two?
By default, Project displays the Standard toolbar and the Formatting toolbar
on the same row. On most monitors, you can’t see all the buttons on either
toolbar because there simply isn’t enough room. Initially, Project displays
the buttons that Microsoft thinks you’ll use most often, and you use the
Toolbar Options button to display the hidden buttons when you need to use
one of them. As you work, Project personalizes the toolbars to your work
habits, displaying the buttons that you use most often and hiding others that
you don’t use as often.
If you’re like us, you want to see all the buttons on each toolbar all the time,
and you don’t want to bother using the Toolbar Options button. To display
each toolbar on its own line, click the Toolbar Options button and choose
Show Buttons on Two Rows (see Figure 1-11).

Book IX
Chapter 1
Working Your

Customizing the Toolbars
539
Project displays the two toolbars on separate rows and all of the buttons on
each toolbar are visible.
Change your mind? Click the Toolbar Options button and choose Show
Buttons on One Row.
Creating your own toolbar
Eventually, you’ll find that you regularly use certain buttons on a variety of
toolbars. You might even come to the conclusion that you’d really like one
toolbar that contains all the buttons you use regularly instead of working
with a bunch of different toolbars. No problem — create your own custom
toolbar.
You can add buttons to an existing toolbar without creating a new toolbar.
Perform Steps 1, 5, 6, and 7 in the following list.
You create custom toolbars and add buttons to them by following these
steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Customize➪Toolbars.
Project displays the Customize dialog box (see Figure 1-12). While the
Customize dialog box remains open, Project enables you to add or
delete buttons on toolbars and create new toolbars.
2. Click the Toolbars tab.
Project displays a list of the toolbars that currently exist.
3. Click the New button.
The New Toolbar dialog box appears (see Figure 1-13).
Figure 1-11:
You can

Standard
and
Formatting
toolbars on

4. Type a toolbar name and click OK.
A small, empty toolbar appears.
You can drag this floating toolbar to any location on-screen that’s 
convenient for you.
5. Click the Commands tab of the Customize dialog box.
6. From the Categories list, select a category of commands.
7. From the Commands list, drag commands from the Customize dialog
box onto the new toolbar.
Project places the button on the toolbar where you drop it. Figure 1-14
shows the new toolbar we created.
f you’re satisfied with your toolbar, click Close to close the Customize dialog
box. If you want to make changes to the toolbar, leave the Customize dialog
box open and read the next section.
Modifying a toolbar
You can make changes to the appearance of any toolbar — not just one that
you created. But, for this example, we focus on the toolbar we just created in
the preceding section.

Customizing the Toolbars
541
IFirst, make sure that the Customize dialog box is open. When this dialog
box is open, Project assumes that you’re making changes to a toolbar and
not trying to use a button on a toolbar to perform a command. If the
Customize dialog box isn’t open, choose Tools➪Customize➪Toolbars.
The preceding section shows you how to add buttons to the toolbar. Simply
follow Steps 5 through 7 in the preceding section to add buttons to toolbars
while the Customize dialog box is open.
Changing the position of the buttons on a toolbar is easy. To move a button
to a new position on the toolbar, drag it to its new position. And, if you
change your mind about a button and want to remove it from the toolbar,
simply drag it off the toolbar and drop it on any white space in your project.
You can organize the buttons on your toolbar into groups of buttons by plac-
ing dividers — thin gray lines — on either side of the group. For example,
you might want to group buttons that perform actions related to printing.
Follow these steps:
1. With the Customize dialog box open and displaying the Commands
tab, select the button that you want to place to the right of the divider.
2. Click the Modify Selection button on the Commands tab.
The menu shown in Figure 1-15 appears.

3. Select the Begin a Group command from this menu.
Project inserts a divider to the left of the selected button on your tool-
bar (see Figure 1-16).
4. Click Close.
Project closes the Customize dialog box, enabling you to click the but-
tons on all toolbars to perform actions.

To delete a divider, make sure that the Customize dialog box is open. Then,
select the tool to the divider’s right and click Modify Selection. From the
menu that appears, select Begin a Group again to deselect that command.
Messing with button images
Even if you’re not particularly adept at drawing, you can personalize 
a button image by selecting from a set of button image designs that 
includes everything from smiling faces to musical notes. If you are adept 
at drawing . . . well, first, we envy you, and second, you can change a
button’s default image to one you personalize.
If anyone else uses your copy of Project, be careful about changing button
images. You can confuse even the most advanced user by assigning a well-
known button image like the scissors on the Cut button to a button that
doesn’t perform the well-known action of cutting.
To change the images that appear on tools, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Customize➪Toolbars.
The Customize dialog box appears.
2. If the toolbar containing the button isn’t visible, click the Toolbars tab
and select the toolbar.
3. Click the Commands tab.
4. Click a button on any toolbar that you have displayed.
5. Click the Modify Selection button.
6. Select Change Button Image.
A pop-up palette of images appears (see Figure 1-17).
7. Click the image that you want to use.
8. Click Close to close the Customize dialog box after you finish.
ToolTips still work with modified buttons and are a great help in remember-
ing what function a button performs. Just hover your mouse pointer on any
tool, and its original name appears.
You can return a button image to its original setting. With the Customize
dialog box open and the button you want to restore selected, choose Modify
Selection➪Reset Button Image.

Customizing the Toolbars
544
If you’re artistically inclined, you can edit an existing button picture by mod-
ifying the pattern and colors on it. For example, if two buttons seem similar
to you, you can differentiate them by applying a bright red color to either
one. Button images consist of many tiny squares called pixels. By coloring in
the pixels, you can form an image. You can use a color palette and the indi-
vidual pixels to modify button images or even draw an entirely new image.
To edit a button image, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Customize➪Toolbars.
The Customize dialog box appears.
2. Click a button on any displayed toolbar.
If the toolbar containing the button isn’t visible, click the Toolbars tab
and select the toolbar.
3. Click the Commands tab.
4. Click Modify Selection.
5. Select the Edit Button Image command.
Project opens the Button Editor dialog box (see Figure 1-18).

6. To change a pixel’s color, click a color block in the Colors palette and
then click an individual pixel.
7. To remove color from a pixel, click the Erase block in the Colors
palette and then click the pixel.
You can operate on a large area of pixels, either to color the area or to
erase it. Click a pixel and then drag the mouse in any direction to color
or erase multiple pixels in one motion. Release the mouse button to stop
coloring or erasing the pixels.
8. To see more of a large button that doesn’t fit in the Picture box, click
the Move arrows.
9. Click OK to save your changes and to return to the Customize 
dialog box.
10. Click Close to return to your Project screen.
The changes you made appear on the button image.
Customizing the Menus
Okay, so, you’re a menu person. You like menus. You want to use them. But,
you really wish you could set up the menus the way you want them so that
your menu or menus contain the commands you use and they appear in the
order you want them to appear. Once again, no problem. Or, mostly no prob-
lem. You can create and customize menus just like you can create and cus-
tomize toolbars. However, the same caveat applies: If you share your copy of
Project with others, be aware that they might prefer to use the menus in
Project as they appear by default. Still, that shouldn’t stop you from person-
alizing menu behavior and even creating your own menu that others don’t
need to use.

546
Personalizing menu behavior
You have some choices about the way menus behave in Project:
✦You can have Project display all commands on the menu when you 
open it.
✦You can have Project display only the most frequently used commands,
and you then take action to display all commands.
✦You can have Project initially display only the most frequently used com-
mands and, after a pause, display all commands.
When you choose the second option and open a menu, the expand arrows
appear at the bottom of the menu (see Figure 1-19).
When you click the expand arrows, the rest of the commands on the menu
appear. The gray bar that runs down the left side of the menu is lighter for
commands that don’t appear initially than for commands that do appear ini-
tially (see Figure 1-20). If you select a command that didn’t appear initially,
that command becomes a frequently used command and appears on the
abbreviated menu the next time you open the menu.

547
When you choose the behavior described in the third option, Project initially
displays the most frequently used commands (refer to Figure 1-19), but you
don’t need to click the expand arrows to see the rest of the commands; if
you just wait a few seconds, Project automatically displays them (refer to
Figure 1-20).
You can control menu behavior in Project from the Options tab of the
Customize dialog box, shown in Figure 1-21. Choose Tools➪Customize➪
Toolbars and then click the Options tab.
If you select the Always Show Full Menus check box, Project displays all
commands on the menu when you open it — the first bullet option in the
preceding list. And, the Show Full Menus After a Short Delay check box
becomes unavailable.
If you don’t select either check box, Project displays only the most fre-
quently used commands, and you then click the expand arrows to display 
all commands — the second bullet option.
If you select the Show Full Menus After a Short Delay check box, Project ini-
tially displays only the most frequently used commands and, after a pause,
displays all commands — the third bullet option.
Creating your own menu
The process of creating a new menu is a three-part process. First, you drag a
new, blank menu to the menu bar, then you assign it a name, and finally you
drag commands onto it.
Figure 1-21:

Customizing the Menus
548
Project adds new menus to your Global template file, the default file on
which Project bases all files. So, changes that you make to menus or the
menu bar affect all files — new or existing — that you create with this copy
of Project.
Follow these steps to create a new menu:
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize.
Project opens the Customize dialog box.
2. Click the Commands tab.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the Categories list and click the New Menu 
category.
New Menu appears in the list of commands.
4. Drag New Menu in the Commands list up to the menu bar. When the
dark vertical line of your mouse pointer appears where you want to
place the new menu, release the mouse button (see Figure 1-22).
Project places the new menu on the menu bar.

Naming a new menu you created
After you create a new menu, Project gives it the clever name “New Menu,”
which isn’t very meaningful. But, you can name the menu whatever you want
by using these steps:
1. With the Customize dialog box open, select New Menu on the menu bar.
2. Click the Modify Selection button on the Commands tab.
A pop-up menu appears (see Figure 1-23).
3. Select the text that appears in the Name text box.
The default name is New Menu.
4. Type a new name for the menu.
5. Click outside the Modify Selection menu to close it.
Figure 1-23:

550
Adding commands to a menu
After you create and name a new menu, you’re ready to add commands to it.
You can use the following steps to add a command to any menu — not just a
new menu that you created:
1. With the Customize dialog box open and displaying the Commands
tab, select a category of commands that you want to place on the 
new menu.
You can place a macro you created on the menu. Select the All Macros
category and then continue with these steps.
2. Drag an item in the Commands list up to the menu.
Project automatically opens the menu. When you drag the first com-
mand onto the menu, a small, blank box appears under the menu 
heading.
3. Place the mouse pointer in that blank area and release the mouse
button.
Project places the command on the menu.
After you place the first command on the menu, commands you previ-
ously dragged onto the menu appear. You place a command on the menu
by positioning the horizontal bar attached to the mouse pointer where
you want the new command to appear. In Figure 1-24, we’re adding a
command between two existing commands.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to add more commands to the menu.
5. When the menu contains all the commands you want to add, click
Close.
Project closes the Customize dialog box.
You can divide the menu into groups of commands the same way that you
divide buttons on a toolbar into groups. With the Customize dialog box open
and displaying the Commands tab, select the command on the menu that
should appear just after the group starts. Then choose Modify Selection➪
Begin a Group to add a dividing line.
Deleting commands and menus
It’s possible that, at some point, you’ll want to remove a particular command
from a menu or even an entire menu. But, you’d like to make the change
without resetting all the menu changes that you’ve made. Follow these steps:

Using the Organizer to Share Project Elements
551
1. Open the Customize dialog box.
2. Click a menu name or open the menu and click a particular command.
3. Drag the item off the menu bar and drop it someplace away from any
menu or toolbar.
Project removes the command from the menu or the menu from the

4. Close the Customize dialog box.
Using the Organizer to Share Project Elements
Using the Organizer, you can share toolbars, the Menu Bar, views, tables,
forms, reports, and more among projects. The Organizer makes it easy for
you to copy something you customized in one Project file to other Project
files or to the Global template so that all new Project files will contain the
element you copied.
To display the Organizer dialog box shown in Figure 1-25, choose Tools➪

Use the various tabs in the Organizer dialog box to copy elements from the
Global template (Global.mpt) to the current project. You also can copy ele-
ments from the current project to the Global template or simply between
projects.
All elements in the Global template (Global.mpt) file are available to every
file that you create based on the Global.mpt file, which is the default file
Project uses when you create a new, blank project.
To copy an element between projects, follow these steps:
1. Open the Project file that contains the information you want to copy.
2. Open the Project file into which you want to copy the information.
3. Choose Tools➪Organizer.
The Organizer window appears.
If you have other files open besides the ones described in Steps 1 and 2,
make sure that the names of the files described in Steps 1 and 2 appear
in the list boxes at the bottom of each tab.
Global.mpt also appears in both list boxes. If you select it, you can
copy an element to the Global template, making the element available to
all new files you create.
4. Click the tab of the element you want to copy.
5. Click the element you want to copy.
6. Click Copy.
7. Repeat Steps 4 to 6 for each element you want to copy.
You can rename or delete elements using the Organizer and the same
steps you use to copy elements; in Step 6, click Delete or Rename.

If you delete an element from the Global template, it won’t be available
to any project. Deleting is risky at best, and you should avoid it unless
you really need to do it. Backing up the Global template before you
delete any element is a very wise idea. You can back up the Global tem-
plate by searching your computer for Global.mpt and copying it to
another folder.
8. When you’re finished, close the Organizer dialog box, and Project will
save your changes.
You can read about creating custom tables in Book VI, Chapter 2.
Sharing a customized table
Company: Company with more than 75 employ-
ees and several project managers using their
own copies of Project.
Project: All projects created by the company.
Challenge: Enable all company project man-
agers to use a table created by one project
manager without re-creating the table in each
copy of Project.
One of the project managers at the subject
company has created a customized table that
all project managers agree would be an effec-
tive one for their organization to use as part of
the progress-tracking process. Each project
manager can sit down and create the table in
Project, but they’d prefer not to reinvent the
wheel.
Solution: To meet the challenge, the project
manager who created the table provides a copy
of the file containing the table to each of the
other project managers either via a network, in
e-mail, or on disc. Then, each of those project
managers follows these steps to copy the table
into their individual Global.mpt files, which
will make the table available in every new proj-
ect they create. They also can open existing
projects in which they want to use the table and
copy the table into those projects.
1. Open the file containing the table.
2. Choose Tools➪Organizer.
The Organizer window appears.
3. Click the Tables tab.

4. Make sure that Global.mpt appears in
one of the Tables Available In lists and the
file containing the table appears in the
other.
5. Click the customized table.
6. Click Copy.
The customized table appears in the
Global.mpt file.
Each project manager then opens an existing
project in which they want the table to appear
and follows the preceding steps, making sure,
in Step 4, that an existing project appears in 
the Tables Available In list in place of the
Global.mpt file.
On the Web site for this book, you can find the
CS0901.mpp file, a file containing a cus-
tomized table. You can practice copying it into
one of your files by using the Organizer.

Chapter 2: Changing 
the Look of a Project
In This Chapter
 Changing fonts in tables
 Formatting Gantt Chart view
 Formatting Network Diagram view
 Formatting Calendar view
You can change the look of a project in a variety of ways. For example,
you can use different fonts for task names in views containing tables.
And, Project contains special formatting that you can apply to Gantt Chart,
Network Diagram, and Calendar views. In this chapter, we look at these dif-
ferent ways to change the appearance of a project.
Changing Fonts
In views that contain tables, such as Gantt Chart view, Task Usage view, and
Resource Usage view, you can make changes to the fonts that appear in the
table cells to highlight pertinent information. You change font information
for selected tasks or for tasks that fall into a particular category, such as
external tasks in an inserted project.
See Book III, Chapter 4 for more information on inserting and linking projects.
Don’t go overboard with multiple fonts or colors on a single schedule. You
can make a project harder to read by using too many fancy fonts. Try to use
only one or two fonts or colors in your schedule, and vary the text by using
bold or italic between categories. Using too light a color, such as yellow, for
a font face can make the text very difficult to read, and in print, the schedule
won’t look much better. If you really want to use color, set the background
color of the cell to any color other than black. Also, try to set up company
standards for formatting so that all your project schedules have a consis-
tent, professional look.

Changing Fonts
556
Changing fonts for selected tasks
Suppose that you’re preparing a report for your boss and you need to call
attention to one particular task because you want to focus your boss’s atten-
tion on that task. You can change the font, font style, point size, and even the
font color of that task’s name.
You can change other fields besides a task’s name. For example, if you want
to focus on the number of hours of Work assigned to a task or a resource,
select that field.
1. Display a view that contains a table.
In Figure 2-1, we displayed the Task Usage view.
2. Click the name of the task that you want to change.
You can apply the changes to more than one task if you select the tasks.
To select a contiguous list of tasks, press and hold Shift while clicking
the names of the first and last tasks. To select noncontiguous tasks,
press and hold Ctrl while clicking each task.

3. Choose Format➪Font.
Project displays the Font dialog box (see Figure 2-2).
4. From the Font list, select a new font.
5. From the Font Style list, select Italic, Bold, or Bold Italic formatting.
The Regular font style applies neither italic nor bold font styles to text.
6. From the Size box, change the font size.
7. Select the Underline check box to apply underlining to text.
8. Select a color from the Color and Background Color drop-down lists.
A preview of your selections appears in the Sample area.
You can apply a background pattern to a cell, but be careful because a
background pattern can make text harder to read.
9. Click OK.
Project applies your changes to the selected task name.
You can click Undo to reverse the results of changes to fonts and other for-
matting features if you don’t like what you see.
Changing fonts for a task category
Suppose that you’re preparing slides for a presentation where you want to
show all tasks in your project’s schedule but call attention to critical tasks.
You can, for example, display the names of all critical tasks in bold, red text.
To make these changes, follow these steps:

Using the Gantt Chart Wizard
The Gantt Chart Wizard is an interactive series of dialog boxes that prompt
you for information. Project uses your input to modify the appearance of the
Gantt chart.
You can use the Gantt Chart Wizard from either Gantt Chart view or Tracking
Gantt view. The formatting applied by the Gantt Chart Wizard affects only
the Project file you’re viewing when you run the wizard. To use the Gantt
Chart Wizard to apply formatting to Gantt Chart view, follow these steps:
1. Choose Format➪Gantt Chart Wizard.
Project displays the first dialog box of the Gantt Chart Wizard, a dialog
box that simply greets you and tells you what the wizard does.
2. Click Next.
The second wizard dialog box appears (see Figure 2-5).
3. Select an option for the kind of information that you want to display.
• Standard shows blue taskbars, black summary taskbars, and a black
line inside the taskbars to indicate progress on tasks.
• Critical Path uses the same settings as Standard, except that critical-
path tasks appear in red.
Figure 2-4:
This figure
shows the
changes
made to the

• Baseline displays baseline taskbars and progress taskbars sepa-
rately, rather than displaying progress bars inside taskbars the way
that the Standard option does.
• Other offers a drop-down list that contains several alternative chart
colors and styles for the Standard, Critical Path, and Baseline
options, along with some additional styles; you can select each from
the list and watch the preview to see its effect.
• Custom Gantt Chart enables you to create a highly customized Gantt
chart; when you select this option, the Gantt Chart Wizard displays
several additional screens.
4. Click Next.
The third wizard dialog box appears (see Figure 2-6).
If you select Custom Gantt Chart, several additional dialog boxes appear
before the box shown in Figure 2-6.
5. Select an option to describe the type of task information to display
with your Gantt bars.

• If you choose Resources and Dates, Project displays resource names
to the right of each task and milestone date.
• If you choose Resources, Project displays resource names to the right
of each task.
• If you choose Dates, Project displays the task start date and end date
at the beginning and end of each taskbar.
• If you choose None, Project displays no information beside taskbars.
• If you choose Custom Task Information, Project adds a dialog box to
the wizard that prompts you for the type of information you want to
display to the left, right, and inside each taskbar.
6. Click Next.
Project displays the wizard dialog box shown in Figure 2-7.
7. Select an option to show or hide link lines between dependent tasks.
8. Click Next.
Project displays a box that congratulates you on selecting your options.
You can use the Back button to go back and make changes.
9. Click the Format It button.
Project formats the Gantt chart and displays a final dialog box to tell you
that your formatting is complete.
10. Click the Exit Wizard button.
Project closes the dialog box and you can see the changes.
If you don’t like the changes you made to the project using the Gantt Chart
Wizard, you can click the Undo button before you save your project to
remove the changes that the Gantt Chart Wizard applies to your project.

Changing individual taskbars
You can change the appearance of a taskbar’s shape and its text. When you
change the shape of a taskbar, you can control the appearance of the start,
middle, and end of the taskbar.
You can apply the changes to more than one task if you select the tasks. To
select a contiguous list of tasks, press and hold Shift while clicking the
names of the first and last tasks. To select noncontiguous tasks, press and
hold Ctrl while clicking each task.
To change a taskbar’s appearance, choose Format➪Bar. Project displays the
Format Bar dialog box shown in Figure 2-8.
The Format Bar dialog box contains two tabbed sheets called Bar Shape and
Bar Text. On the Bar Shape tab, use the Start and End sections to select a
shape, type, and color for the beginning and end of the selected taskbar. The
shapes you select appear at either end of the taskbar. The Type list contains
Dashed, Framed, and Solid choices that affect the appearance of the shape
you select. And, of course, the Color list lets you control the color of the
shape.
In the Middle section of the Bar Shape tab, you control the shape, pattern,
and color of the middle portion of the taskbar. From the Shape list, you can
determine the size for the middle of the taskbar; if you make the middle thin-
ner than the default size, you can set the vertical alignment of the taskbar so
that it aligns with the top, middle, or bottom of the shapes on either end of
the taskbar. From the Pattern list, you can change the selected taskbars from
solid colors to a variety of hatched patterns. And, once again, the Color list
controls the color of the selected taskbars.
From the Bar Text tab, shown in Figure 2-9, you can select text to appear to
the left, right, top, bottom, or inside each taskbar. The Sample area allows
you to preview your selection.

Changing taskbar styles for categories of tasks
Rather than changing individual taskbars that you select, you can control
the appearance of taskbars for categories of tasks. For example, you can set
up the taskbars for critical tasks to appear as thin red bars aligned to the
center of shapes that appear at the beginning and end of each bar, and dis-
play the start and end dates of the task at the beginning and end of each crit-
ical bar.
To set the appearance of a category of taskbars, choose Format➪Bar Styles.
Project displays the Bar Styles dialog box shown in Figure 2-10.
Like its cousin, the Format Bar dialog box, the Bar Styles dialog box has two
tabs that you can use to control the appearance of taskbars. On the Text tab,
you control the text that appears to the left, right, top, bottom, or inside the
Figure 2-10:

dialog 
box to

564
taskbar. On the Bars tab, you control the shapes of the beginning, middle
and end of taskbars.
The Bar Styles dialog box differs from its cousin because of the table that
appears at the top of the dialog box. You select a category of task in the
table at the top of the dialog box to display the settings for that category’s
taskbars, and then you use the Bars and Text tabs to change the settings for
the selected category. If the category of task you want to modify doesn’t
appear in the Name column of the table, you can add it by using the Insert
Row button above the table. Table 2-1 describes the purpose of each column
in the table at the top of the Bar Styles dialog box.
Table 2-1
Understanding the Table at the Top of the Bar Styles Dialog Box

Purpose
Name
Identifies the taskbar category. This name appears in a legend for
your chart when you print it.
Appearance

Show For . . . Tasks
Defines the types of tasks that the specified formatting affects. 
Row
Indicates how many rows of bars (up to four) that Project displays
for each task. 
From and To
Defines the time period that is shown by the bar. 
It’s possible that a particular task can fit into more than one category for
which you’ve defined formatting. For example, a regular (Normal) task can
also be in progress. When a task fits into more than one category, Project
tries to display multiple formatting settings. If Project can’t display the for-
mats together, the category that appears closer to the top of the table in the
Bar Styles dialog box takes precedence. To modify the formatting prece-
dence, you can reorder the categories in the table by using the Cut Row and
Paste Row buttons to rearrange the rows in the Bar Styles dialog box.
Suppose that you want to define the appearance of critical taskbars — and
you don’t see critical tasks listed in the table at the top of the Bar Styles
dialog box. Follow these steps:
1. In the Name column, click the task category that you want to appear
below the task category you intend to insert.
2. Click the Insert Row button.
Project inserts a blank row in the table.
3. Click in the Name column of the blank row and type a name for the
category of task you’re defining.
4. Click in the Appearance column.

Project displays a default bar style for the new category.
5. Click the Bars tab.
6. Make changes by using the list boxes in the Start, Middle, and End
sections.
7. Click in the Show For . . . Tasks column of the task category you’re
defining.
A list box arrow appears (see Figure 2-11).
8. Select the category of task to affect from the drop-down list.
To specify more than one category, add a comma (,) after the first cate-
gory you select and then select or type a second category. For example,
to define critical tasks that are in progress as a new category of taskbar
style, choose Critical, type a comma (,), and then choose In Progress.
9. Click in the Row column for the task category you are defining.
A list box arrow appears.
10. Select the number of rows to allot for the task category you’re defin-
ing: 1, 2, 3, or 4.
If you allot only one row and you show bars for both the baseline timing
and progress, the bars might overlap each other. To display two sepa-
rate bars, allot two rows. You also can add extra rows to accommodate
text above or below taskbars.
11. Click in the From column for the task category you’re defining and
select, from the drop-down list that appears, a date for the beginning
of the taskbar.

12. Repeat Step 11 in the To column for the task category you’re defining.
13. Click the Text tab and add appropriate text to the left, right, top,
bottom, or inside of the task category you’re defining.
14. Click OK.
Project applies the formatting you defined to tasks that fit into the speci-
fied category.
Changing the Gantt chart layout
When you make changes to the layout of a Gantt chart, you can modify the
appearance of link lines, date formats displayed near taskbars, the height of
taskbars, and how Project displays certain characteristics of taskbars.
In views other than Gantt Chart view, layout changes affect different ele-
ments. For example, in Calendar view, layout changes affect the order in
which Project lists multiple tasks on one calendar day and how it splits date
bars. And, in Network Diagram Chart view, layout changes affect link lines
and how Project handles page breaks.
To modify the layout of Gantt Chart view, display Gantt Chart view and then
choose Format➪Layout. The Layout dialog box appears (see Figure 2-12).
Use Table 2-2 to understand the layout choices you can make in Gantt Chart
view; when you click OK, Project applies your choices.
You can click the Undo button to remove changes that Project applies to
your schedule when you use the Layout dialog box.

Two interesting date formats include a week number (W5/1 and W5/1/02
12:33 PM) of the year and the day of the week. Therefore, W49/2/06 is
December 4, 2006 (the second day of the 49th full week of 2006). Your
nation’s or industry’s conventions for numbering weeks might be different
from what Project produces.
The Round Bars to Whole Days option works well on longer schedules but
not as well on schedules with tasks that tend to run in hourly or half-day
increments. If you have a short schedule with many tasks running only hours
in length, don’t round taskbars to whole days.
Split tasks are tasks that start, then stop for a time, and then start again. For
example, if you expect to start creating a mailer for a talent show but not
complete the mailer until you receive final confirmation on who will ulti-
mately serve as emcee, you can create a split task. The Show Bar Splits
option in the Layout dialog box simply enables you to show the split task as
separate taskbars or as one continuous taskbar.
Changing Gantt chart gridlines
Gridlines mark off periods of time, rows and columns, pages in your sched-
ule, and regular intervals in the Gantt chart and the Gantt table. For exam-
ple, in Figure 2-13, gridlines mark off every other row in the chart portion of
the view, helping you read across the page on a long schedule.
To modify gridlines, choose Format➪Gridlines. The Gridlines dialog box
appears (see Figure 2-14).

Applying Special Formatting to Gantt Chart View
568
In the Line to Change list, the options Gantt Rows, Sheet Rows, and Sheet
Columns enable you to set gridlines at regular intervals. For example, the
project in Figure 2-13 has the Gantt Rows set to show at an interval of every
two rows. You can change the line type and color only (not the interval) for
the other choices in the Line to Change list. To modify these settings, high-
light the kind of line that you want to change and then select the desired set-
tings from the Type and Color drop-down lists.
You can click the Undo button on the Formatting toolbar to cancel the
effects that you apply in the Gridlines dialog box.

Working with the Network Diagram
You can make changes to any view using the techniques described in Book
VI, Chapter 1, but the Network Diagram bears some special attention because
you can make changes to it in a way that doesn’t apply to any other view.
The Network Diagram, shown in Figure 2-15, provides a visual representation
of your project using boxes — sometimes called nodes — to represent each
task. Each box contains a variety of information about each task. The box
shapes and colors have meaning. For example, square boxes designate tasks,
and angled boxes designate summary tasks. Red boxes identify tasks on the
critical path, and blue boxes identify noncritical tasks. Lines entering and
leaving boxes help you identify dependencies.
You can change much of the information that appears on the Network
Diagram. In particular, you can control
✦The layout of the Network Diagram
✦The color, line style, and shape of Network Diagram boxes
✦The contents of Network Diagram boxes, including the style of text,
number of fields per node, and the horizontal and vertical alignment of
text within the box

You can use the Network Diagram toolbar (see Figure 2-16) to make many of
the changes you read about in this section. To view this toolbar, right-click
any toolbar and then choose Network Diagram.
Suppose that you like the default Network Diagram, but you also find your-
self changing it to display other information. Consider creating a second
Network Diagram view with different settings. Use the information in Book
VI, Chapter 1 to create a copy of the Network Diagram and then apply the
techniques in the following sections to the copy.

Working with the Network Diagram
571
In the Layout Mode section, you can tell Project to let you manually position
boxes on the diagram instead of positioning them for you.
In the Box Layout section, you can use the Arrangement drop-down list to
change the order in which Project displays the boxes; the arrangement you
choose changes the number of pages Project needs to print your Network
Diagram. You can arrange the boxes in any of the following ways:
✦Top Down From Left
✦Top Down By Day
✦Top Down By Week
✦Top Down By Month
✦Top Down - Critical First
✦Centered From Left
✦Centered From Top
In the same section, you can change the row and column alignment and
spacing along with row height and column width. Using the check boxes at
the bottom of the Box Layout section, you can hide or display summary
tasks, keep tasks with their summaries, and tell Project to adjust the
Network Diagram for page breaks.
In the Link Style section, you can control the style of the link lines, and you
can choose to show arrows and link labels. When you show link labels on
the Network Diagram, Project displays abbreviations such as FS, which
stands for Finish-to-Start, for the type of link dependency that exists
between two tasks.
In the Link Color section, you can select different colors for both critical and
noncritical links; by default, Project colors noncritical links in blue and criti-
cal links in red. If you select the Match Predecessor Box Border option,
Project doesn’t color link lines to distinguish between critical and noncritical
tasks. Instead, link lines assume the same color as the box of the predeces-
sor task.
Finally, you can use the choices in the Diagram Options section to change
the appearance of the Network Diagram as a whole. For example, you can set
a background color and pattern for the Network Diagram.
To choose a background color or pattern for individual boxes, use the
Format Box or Format Box Styles dialog box described in the following 
sections.

Working with the Network Diagram
572
You can also choose to show page breaks, which appear as dotted lines on-
screen in Network Diagram view. A page break appears in Figure 2-15. When
you select the Mark In-Progress and Completed check box, Project marks in-
progress tasks with half an X and completed tasks with an entire X.
If you select the Hide All Fields Except ID check box, Project eliminates all
the information on a box except for the task ID, reducing the size of the
boxes on your Network Diagram and the number of pages Project needs to
print the Network Diagram. Figure 2-18 shows a Network Diagram that
includes link labels and hides all task information except the ID. A page
break appears at the right side of the diagram.
If you select the Hide All Fields Except ID check box, you can still view any
task’s information by pausing your mouse pointer over the task.
Controlling the appearance 
of Network Diagram boxes
You can change the appearance of Network Diagram boxes, either individu-
ally or of a particular category of boxes. Project contains a set of previously
defined templates that define the shape, color, and content of each box,
based on the type of task the box represents. You can override the settings
of these templates.

boxes for a particular type of task, such as all Critical tasks. Follow these
steps:
1. Choose Format➪Box Styles.
Project displays the Box Styles dialog box (see Figure 2-20).
2. From the Style Settings For drop-down list, select the type of task box
that you want to format.
The current appearance of the box appears in the Preview window.
You can display actual task data in the Preview box if you provide a task
ID number in the Show Data from Task ID box.
3. In the Border section, open the Shape drop-down list to select one of
ten shapes for the box.
4. In the Border section, open the Color drop-down list to select the

9. Click OK to save the changes.
Controlling the content in Network Diagram boxes
The boxes on the Network Diagram are actually divided into cells, and each
cell displays the information in a particular field. The following fields appear
on the Network Diagram by default:
✦Task Name
✦Duration
✦ID
✦Start and Finish Dates
✦Percent Complete
✦Resource Name, if assigned
You can change the fields that appear on a Network Diagram box, and you
can display up to 16 fields of information. For example, to focus on project
costs, you might include Task Name, Baseline Cost, Actual Cost, Remaining
Cost, and Cost Variance information in the boxes of the Network Diagram. If
you’re trying to focus on scheduling issues, you might want to include infor-
mation like Task Name, Critical, Free Slack, Early Finish, and Late Finish in
the boxes of the Network Diagram.
Just because you can do something, that doesn’t mean you should do it.
Although you can display up to 16 pieces of information, providing too much
information in a box makes the Network Diagram difficult to understand, and
your reader might miss your point.

Working with the Network Diagram
576
You can change the information that appears in a box, the font that Project
uses to display the information, and the horizontal and vertical alignment of
the information. The steps that follow show you how to change the template
for a particular type of task.
You can customize a view by making changes to one of the existing views or
by making a copy of the view and then changing the copy. The same con-
cepts apply to the templates that define the appearance of Network Diagram
boxes: You can change the template or you can copy the template and
change the copy. We prefer to copy the template so that we retain the origi-
nal settings of the template.
So, in the steps that follow, we once again show you a hybrid process that
you can use to change the appearance of Network Diagram boxes, by making
changes to a copy of an existing Network Diagram box template:
1. Choose Format➪Box.
Project displays the Format Box dialog box.
2. Click the More Templates button.
Project displays the Data Templates dialog box (see Figure 2-21).
3. Select the template that you want to change.
4. Click the Copy button.
Project displays the Data Template Definition dialog box.

5. To change the contents of a cell of the box, click the corresponding
cell in the Choose Cell(s) section of the dialog box (see Figure 2-22).
A list box arrow appears to the right of the cell.
6. Open the list box to choose a field for the selected cell.
You can change the font for a particular cell. Select that cell and click
the Font button. A dialog box appears from which you can select a new
font, font size, and font attributes, such as boldface or italics.
7. Open the Horizontal Alignment drop-down list and select an align-
ment for the text within the cell.
8. Open the Vertical Alignment drop-down list and select an alignment
for the text within the cell.
9. Open the Limit Cell Text To drop-down list and select the number of
lines for each cell.
A cell can have as many as three lines.
10. Select the Show Label in Cell check box to include an identifier in the
cell for the type of information.
In Figure 2-22, the cell containing the task’s start date also contains the
field label.
You also can change the label text that appears in the box after you click
the Show Label in Cell text box. For example, instead of “Start,” you can
display “Start Date.”

11. To increase or decrease the number of cells in the box, click the Cell
Layout button.
Project displays the Cell Layout dialog box (see Figure 2-23).
The picture at the top of the Data Template Definition dialog box pres-
ents a preview of the structure of the box. In Figure 2-22, you see six
fields of information, but the box actually contains eight cells; because
the top and bottom row of the box each contain only one piece of infor-
mation, the template merges the blank cells on those rows with the non-
blank cells.
12. Specify the number of rows and columns and click OK.
Project redisplays the Data Template Definition dialog box, with the
appropriate number of cells available for formatting.
13. Click OK.
Project closes the Data Template Definition dialog box.
14. Click Close.
Project closes the Data Templates dialog box.
15. Click OK.
Project closes the Box Styles dialog box and displays your updated

Modifying Calendar View
Calendar view in Project 2007 (see Figure 2-24) now looks and acts more like
Calendar view in Outlook. Although you can’t format the text of individual
items in Calendar view, you can use the Text Styles dialog box, described in
the section “Changing Fonts” at the beginning of this chapter, to format cate-
gories of text. And, you can apply color to the text, but you cannot apply
background color to the bars on the calendar.

In the following sections, we explore the changes you can make to the layout
and entries in Calendar view.
Changing the time period displayed 
in Calendar view
The Project 2007 Calendar view now supports daily, weekly, and monthly for-
mats, and you can create your own format to focus on the tasks for a specific
timeframe.
You can use the three new buttons at the top of the view to see your project
a month at a time or a week at a time, or you can create a custom format.
Click the Month button or the Week button to view your project in those
increments. You can then use the arrows below the buttons to move forward
or backward by the selected increment.
In Figure 2-25, we created a custom format that shows two weeks.
To create a custom view, click the Custom button; the Zoom dialog box
appears (see Figure 2-26). In the Zoom dialog box, indicate the timeframe to
display in Calendar view.

Changing Calendar view layout
Use the Layout dialog box (see Figure 2-27) to change the layout of tasks in
Calendar view. By default, Project displays tasks in Calendar view using the
currently sorted order of tasks. To open this dialog box, choose
Format➪Layout.
You can select the Attempt to Fit As Many Tasks As Possible option button
to change the sorted order of tasks in Calendar view. Project sorts tasks by
Total Slack and then by Duration (longest task first) to try to fit the maxi-
mum number of tasks into the rows for a week without overlapping bars.

You can read about sorting tasks in Book VI, Chapter 1.
By default, Project identifies split tasks in Calendar view; you can change
this behavior if you remove the check mark from the Show Bar Splits 
check box.
When you select the Automatic Layout check box, Project automatically
adjusts Calendar view to accommodate new tasks that you add or tasks that
you delete.
Formatting Calendar view entries
When you display Calendar view, entries for tasks appear in boxes that
Project calls bars, and you can change the appearance of these bars by using
the Bar Styles dialog box. For example, you can make all critical tasks appear
on the calendar in red. Follow these steps:
1. From Calendar view, choose Format➪Bar Styles.
Project displays the Bar Styles dialog box (see Figure 2-28). From this
dialog box, you can assign different font colors to different task types or
use a line instead of a bar to represent the task’s duration in Calendar
view.
2. From the Task Type list on the left, select a type of task.
3. Open the Bar Type drop-down list and identify the way you want to
display tasks.
The choices are Line, Bar, or None. Choosing None hides the selected
task type from Calendar view. When you choose Line, Project uses lines
instead of bars to represent each task’s duration, and the Pattern drop-
down list and the Shadow check box aren’t available. When you choose
Bar, Project displays bars that represent each task’s duration.
Figure 2-27:

4. Open the Pattern drop-down list and select a pattern.
Project displays the pattern inside the bar.
5. Open the Color drop-down list and select a color for the bar or line.
6. Open the Split Pattern drop-down list to choose a pattern for Project
to display between split tasks.
7. Select the Shadow check box to display a shadow behind a bar.
This option is available only if you select Bar from the Bar Type drop-
down list.
As you make changes in the Bar Shape area and the Text area, watch the
Sample window at the bottom of the box for the effects of your changes.
8. Select the Bar Rounding check box to tell Project to draw the bar or
line for tasks that take less than one day so that the task’s duration is
implied.
Bar rounding works well for tasks with durations of less than one day.
For these tasks, Project draws a bar that extends that portion of the day
that represents the task’s duration. If you don’t use bar rounding,
Project doesn’t imply the duration of the task by the length of the bar.
9. In the Text area, open the Field(s) box to include Project fields for
each task type.
To include more than one field, separate fields with a comma (refer to
Figure 2-28).
10. From the Align drop-down list, select an alignment for the text.
You can select Left, Center, or Right.
11. If you chose Bar as the bar type in Step 3, you can select the Wrap
Text in Bars check box.
Figure 2-28:
Pull up a
seat at the
Bar Styles
dialog box.

When you select this check box, Project wraps text so that it fits within
the bar. So, for shorter tasks with longer names, wrapping text enables
you to read all the displayed information about the task. But, the task
takes more than one row when it appears on the calendar. If you don’t
select the Wrap Text in Bars check box, Project displays only as much
information as it can fit in a bar that’s sized to match the task’s duration.
12. Repeat Steps 2 to 11 for each item in the Task Type list that you want
to format.
13. Click OK.
Project saves your settings and redisplays Calendar view using them.

Chapter 3: Using Macros
In This Chapter
 Understanding macros
 Creating a macro
 Using a macro
M
acros help you save time. And anything that helps you save time is
worth discussing. So, this chapter explains what macros are, how to
create them, and how to use them.
Understanding Macros
A macro is a small program that helps you save time whenever you need to
perform a repetitive task. For example, suppose that you use the Delay table
fairly often. You’ve already added the Delay table to the menu using the steps
you found in Book VI, Chapter 2, but suppose that you’re a toolbar button
kind of a person, and it annoys you greatly to have to display the Delay table
by going through menus. What you really want to do is just click a button on a
toolbar to display the table. You can create a macro that selects the Delay
table and then assign the macro to a toolbar button — and then you can just
click a button on a toolbar to display the table.
Don’t let the word “program” scare you, because you won’t actually have to
write any program code to create a macro.
The more you use Project, the more you’ll notice the things you do over and
over, and those things are candidates for macros. For example, we create
macros for every combination view we use regularly that involves views
that don’t appear automatically when we split the view.
See Book VI, Chapter 1 for details on combination views.
Creating a Macro
You can easily create a macro by having Project memorize the steps you
take to complete any repetitive action. See — no programming required. 
You just do whatever it is you want Project to do. Project then converts the

Creating a Macro
586
actions you take into Visual Basic statements and stores the statements in a
macro. Later, when you want to take that action again, you run your macro,
which you read about in the next section.
Knowing your macro’s steps
Before you record a macro, we suggest that you run through the steps that
you want to take and maybe even write them down. That way, you gain a
clear idea of what you’re going to do, and you’ll be less likely to make (and
record) mistakes.
We suggest that you not include a step in a macro that saves your project. If
you do and the macro causes unexpected results, you won’t be able to undo
the effects of the macro.
These steps walk you through displaying the Delay table to give you a clear
idea of the steps you’re going to record:
1. Open the View menu.
2. Point at Table.
3. Click More Tables.
Project displays the More Tables window.
4. Click Delay.
5. Click Apply.
Project displays the Delay table.
If your repetitious steps involve using a particular view, select that view as
your first step of your macro. That way, when you run your macro, it forces
Project to start by displaying that view, regardless of the view that you were
using before you ran your macro.
Recording the macro
When you know what you’re going to record, use the following steps to
record the macro:
1. Choose Tools➪Macro➪Record New Macro.
Project opens the Record Macro dialog box (see Figure 3-1).
2. Type a name for the macro in the Macro Name text box.

Book IX
Chapter 3
Using Macros
Creating a Macro
587
You can’t include a space in a macro name, so try capitalizing the 
first letter of each word or using an underscore character as a word 
separator.
The first character of the macro name must be a letter, but the other
characters can be letters, numbers, or underscore characters.
3. Type a description of the function that the macro performs in the
Description box.
This description appears whenever you run the macro from the Macros
dialog box, so it can help you remember the purpose of a macro.
4. If your macro selects rows and columns, make appropriate choices in
the Row References and Column References sections.
See the information that appears after these steps for an explanation of
these options.
5. Click OK.
Project redisplays your project. You don’t notice any differences, but
Project is now recording each action that you take.
6. Take all the actions that you want to record.
7. Choose Tools➪Macro➪Stop Recorder (see Figure 3-2).
Project stops recording your macro.
Some notes about recording a macro:
✦Using keyboard combinations: You can run a macro by using a key-
board combination that you define. In the next section, we explain more
about using a keyboard combination, including how to set one up after
you’ve recorded a macro.
Figure 3-1:
The Record
Macro
dialog box.

Creating a Macro
588
✦Storing macros: You can store macros in any Project file, but storing
them in the Global File — also called the Global Template file — makes
the macro available to all projects.
✦Selecting rows and columns: The options in the Row References and
the Column References sections control the way that the macro selects
rows and columns. By default, a macro always selects rows in relation to
the position of the cell selected when the macro begins. If you want a
macro to always select the same row, regardless of which cell is selected
when you start the macro, select Absolute (ID). For columns, the macro,
by default, always selects the same column each time you run the macro,
regardless of the cell that’s selected when the macro begins. If you want
a macro to select columns in relation to the cell that is selected when
you run the macro, select Relative in the Column References section.
Effectively, these two options combine to determine where the cell
pointer will appear when the macro begins. To always start the macro in
a specific cell, select that cell before you start recording the macro and
then select Absolute in both the Row References and Column References
sections.

Use this
command 
to finish
recording a
macro.

Book IX
Chapter 3
Using Macros
Using a Macro
589
Using a Macro
To use a recorded macro, you run it. You have four ways that you can run a
macro. You can
✦Use the Macros dialog box.
✦Assign a keyboard shortcut to the macro.
✦Assign a menu command to the macro.
✦Assign a toolbar button to the macro.
In the following sections, we look at each of these methods of running a
macro.
Running a macro from the Macros dialog box
Before you run a macro, it’s a good idea to save your project, especially if
the macro makes substantial changes to your project. Although unlimited
Undo capabilities let you undo a macro’s effects, we don’t think you’d find
that fun. Closing the project and reopening it would be much easier. To run a
macro from the Macros dialog box, follow these steps:
1. Open the project that contains the macro.
If you stored the macro in the Global template file, you can open any
project.
2. Choose Tools➪Macro➪Macros.
Project displays the Macros dialog box (see Figure 3-3).
Figure 3-3:
The Macros
dialog box.

Using a Macro
590
3. Select the macro that you want to run from the Macro Name list.
4. Click Run.
Project performs the steps that you recorded in the macro.
In most cases, your macro finishes before you have a chance to stop it. But,
if your macro is long enough and you want to stop it while it’s still running,
press Ctrl+Break.
Using a keyboard shortcut to run a macro
Suppose that you decide that you really want to run your macro from a 
keyboard shortcut and you didn’t set a shortcut when you created the
macro. Follow these steps to add a keyboard shortcut to the macro after 
you create it:
1. Open the project that contains the macro.
If you stored the macro in the Global template file, you can open any
project.
2. Choose Tools➪Macro➪Macros.
Project displays the Macros dialog box (refer to Figure 3-3).
You can also press Alt+F8 to display the Macros dialog box.
3. Highlight the macro to which you want to add a keyboard shortcut.
4. Click the Options button.
Project displays the Macro Options dialog box (see Figure 3-4).
5. Click in the Shortcut Key text box and type a letter.
You can assign any letter key on your keyboard except a number or a
special character.
Figure 3-4:
You can set
a keyboard
shortcut for
an existing
macro from

dialog box.

Book IX
Chapter 3

591
6. Click OK.
If Project isn’t using the combination that you selected, Project displays
the Macros dialog box again. If Project is using the combination that you
selected, even for another macro, Project asks you to try a different
combination.
7. Click Close.
Project closes the Macros dialog box.
To run a macro to which you’ve assigned a keyboard shortcut, press and
hold Ctrl while pressing the key that you assigned.
Using a menu command to run a macro
You might want to use a menu command to run a macro. And, you can assign
a hotkey to the menu command so that you can choose the command by
using the keyboard. If you plan to assign a hotkey, open the menu on which
you intend to place the command and take note of all underscored letters on
the menu. You should not choose one of those letters as the hotkey for your
command; if you do, the hotkey won’t work.
If you have lots of macros, you might want to create a menu just for macros
and then set up commands on that menu for all your macros. To create that
menu, see Chapter 1 of this minibook.
Follow these steps to add a command that runs a macro to a menu:
1. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize.
Project displays the Customize dialog box.
2. Click the Commands tab (see Figure 3-5).
Figure 3-5:
You can add
commands

Using a Macro
592
3. From the Categories list, select All Macros.
Project displays a list of macros in the Commands list on the right.
4. Drag the macro that you want to add to the desired menu (see 
Figure 3-6).
As you drag, the mouse pointer image changes to include a small button
and a plus sign (+). As you move the mouse pointer over a menu, the
menu opens. On the mouse pointer, a large horizontal insertion point
marks the location where the menu command will appear when you
release the mouse button.
5. Release the mouse button.
The macro appears on the menu (see Figure 3-7).
6. To change the name of the macro on the menu, click Modify Selection
in the Customize dialog box.
Project opens a pop-up menu (see Figure 3-8).
7. Type the name in the Name box, exactly as you want it to appear on
the toolbar button.
When you type this name, you can include spaces in the command’s
name.

8. To provide a hotkey character for the new command, place an amper-
sand (&) immediately before the character that you want to be the
hotkey, making sure that Project isn’t using the letter you select for
some other command on the same menu.
Hotkey characters contain underscores on menus, and you can choose the
command by using the keyboard letters for the command. In Figure 3-8,
we placed an ampersand before the l in Delay. To use the hotkey in our
example, we can press Alt+V+L. Alt+V opens the View menu, and L selects
Delay Table, the item in the View menu with L as the hotkey.
9. Press Enter.
The pop-up menu disappears, and Project renames the menu command.
As Figure 3-9 shows, the command includes your hotkey if you added an
ampersand.
10. Click Close.
Project closes the Customize dialog box.

When you add a command to one of the default menus, Microsoft Project
saves the command and the menu in your Global template file. Any other
project file that you open on your computer using that Global template file
contains the new menu command.
You can remove the command from the menu by opening the Customize
dialog box and then simply dragging the command off the menu and drop-
ping it anywhere on your project. The command disappears, but the macro
is still available.
Using a toolbar button to run a macro
Earlier in this chapter, we suggest that you might be a fan of toolbar buttons,
and you’d like one for a macro you’ve created. Follow the steps in this sec-
tion to add a button for a macro to a toolbar.
You also can add toolbar buttons for macros to a custom toolbar that you
create. Chapter 1 of this minibook explains how to create a custom toolbar.
1. If the toolbar to which you want to add a button doesn’t appear on-
screen, display it by right-clicking any toolbar button and choosing
the toolbar from the shortcut menu that appears.
If the toolbar already appears on-screen, skip this step.
2. Choose View➪Toolbars➪Customize.
Project displays the Customize dialog box.
3. Click the Commands tab.
4. Scroll down the Categories list, and select All Macros.
Project displays a list of macros in the Commands list on the right side
of the dialog box (see Figure 3-10).

5. Drag the macro that you want to add onto the desired toolbar (see
Figure 3-11).
As you drag, the mouse pointer image changes to include a small button
and a plus sign. As you move the mouse pointer over a toolbar, a large
vertical insertion point marks the location where the button will appear
when you release the mouse button.
6. Release the mouse button.
A new button, using the name of your macro, appears selected on the
toolbar (see Figure 3-12).
7. To change the name of the toolbar button, click Modify Selection in
the Customize dialog box.
Project opens a pop-up menu (see Figure 3-13).

The Rollup Formatting macro
Company: Local Theater Group.
Project: Organize and present a talent show.
Challenge: View a summary of the project
schedule that helps focus on important task
dates.
A local theater group is putting together a talent
show and has created a project schedule to
manage the tasks associated with presenting
the talent show. In addition to viewing task
details, the group members would like to view
the project in a summarized format, with some
way of identifying tasks along the summary bars.

meets this need. To use the Rollup Format-
ting macro, you must identify the tasks in your
project that you want to roll up and display as
summary tasks. Typically, you roll up subtasks
only. Then, when you run the macro, you select
the way you want rolled up tasks to appear and
Project formats the schedule so that you get a
summarized view.
To identify tasks to summarize, follow these
steps:
1. Select tasks in Gantt Chart view.
Typically, you select subtasks, not summary
tasks.
2. Click the Task Information button on the
Standard toolbar.
Project displays the General tab of the
Multiple Task Information dialog box.

3. Select the Roll Up Gantt Bar to Summary
check box.
4. Click OK.
Now that you’ve identified the tasks you want 
to roll up onto summary bars, you can run 
the Rollup Formatting macro. Choose Tools➪
Macros. In the Macros dialog box, click Rollup_
Formatting and then click Run. You see a dialog
box that asks you whether you want rolled up
tasks to appear as bars or as milestones. In the
Project file for this case study — found on this
book’s Web site — we formatted rolled up tasks
as milestones, and Project displays the project
using the Milestone Rollup view.
After you run the macro, you can use two other
views to view rolled up information: Bar Rollup
view and Milestone Date Rollup view. Choose
View➪More Views to switch to either of these
views.
When you use the Rollup_Formatting macro,
you might run into an issue. The macro displays
task names for rolled up tasks above and below
the summary bars, and often the text for the
names overlaps, making the names unread-
able. You can see an example of this in the case

study file if you choose the Milestone Date
Rollup view. You can remove the text that
appears on the bars by using the Bar Styles
dialog box: Choose Format➪Bar Styles and
select Rolled Up Task in the Name list at the top
of the box. Then, on the Text tab at the bottom
of the box, delete Name wherever it appears;
in the case study file, it appears in the Top box.
For more information on using the Bar Styles
dialog box, see Chapter 2 of this minibook.
To remove rollup formatting from your project,
click the Show button and then select All
Subtasks. Then repeats Steps 1–4.

W
hen you import information, you bring information created by
another program into a Project file. In addition to importing informa-
tion from Outlook, Excel, and Access into Project, you can insert drawings
and objects into a Project file. In this chapter, we look at how you insert
graphic images such as photos, illustrations, and diagrams into various
parts of a Project file, and then we cover how to import information from
Outlook, Excel, and Access.
Using Graphic Objects in Project
Images can reinforce the information about your project and lend a profes-
sional look to your reports. For example, you might want to add your com-
pany logo to the header of your schedule. Or, if a particular task involves a
schematic or diagram of a product, you might want to place a copy of the
diagram in the task notes for reference. You might even consider adding
photographs of each resource in his or her resource note to help you get to
know all the team members in a large-scale project so that you can address
them by name when you see them.
Placing graphics in a schedule makes your file larger. Bigger Project files
need more time to calculate.
To insert an object into a header, footer, or legend, choose File➪Page Setup
and click either the Header tab or the Footer tab. Then click the Insert Picture
button to open the Insert Picture dialog box (see Figure 4-1); you can use this
dialog box to navigate to the picture file you want to insert. When you find 
the picture, select it and click Open to insert it in the header of your project
schedule.

Using Graphic Objects in Project
604
Suppose that you have Visio diagram that provides information that you
need for a task involving resource assignments. You can insert a graphic
image of your Visio file on the Notes tab of the Task Information dialog box
for the task. Follow these steps:
1. Double-click the task to which you want to add the graphic object.
Project displays the Task Information dialog box.
2. Click the Notes tab.
3. Click the Insert Object button.
The Insert Object dialog box appears (see Figure 4-2).

4. Select the Create from File option.
5. Click the Browse button to select the file.
6. Click the OK button.
The information appears as a graphic on the Notes tab (see Figure 4-3).
You can place any image directly on the Gantt chart. Don’t open the Task
Information dialog box. Instead, copy the image to the Windows Clipboard,
switch to Project, and click the Paste button. You can also use the Copy and
Paste method to import Microsoft Office Word information into Project.
Getting Tasks from Outlook
Okay, it happens: You’re diligently recording tasks in Outlook’s To-Do List
when you realize that your list of tasks is really a project, and you need the
scheduling and cost features in Project. Good news — you don’t need to
start over. You can import the Outlook Task List into Project by following
these steps:
1. Open Project.
If you want the tasks to appear in an existing project, open that project.
If the tasks make up a new project, use a blank Project file.
Outlook doesn’t need to be open.
2. Choose Tools➪Import Outlook Tasks.
Project displays the Import Outlook Tasks dialog box (see Figure 4-4).

If the open project was blank, the tasks appear starting on Row 1. If the 
open project already contained tasks, Project adds the Outlook tasks to the
bottom of the Project file’s Task List.
If you assign Total Work values to the tasks in Outlook, Project imports those
values as durations. If you don’t assign Total Work values, Project imports
the tasks with an estimated duration of one day.
If you included notes in the Outlook tasks, Project includes those notes
when it imports the tasks, and an icon appears in the indicator column for
tasks with notes.
Importing Excel and Access Information into Project
You can import information from Excel or Access into Project by using an
import/export map, which helps you match fields from Excel or Access with
fields in Project.
If you’re importing information from Excel and you know in advance that
you’re starting a Task List in Excel with the intent of moving the information
to Project, use a special template in Excel to create the Task List (as we dis-
cuss later).
You can import all or part of an Access 2003 database or an earlier database
into Project, and the process to import an Access database is the same as the
process we describe to import an Excel file. You can import Excel files into
Project 2007 as long as you aren’t trying to import an Excel PivotTable into
Project and as long as you save the Excel file in Excel 97–2003 file format.
To import either type of file, you need to set Project’s security settings to
allow importing files from versions of Office earlier than Office 2007 or files
that don’t use the Project file format; the steps for this task appear in the
next section.
Changing Project’s security settings
By default, Project doesn’t allow you to import Excel files from Excel
97–2003. But, Project also can’t read the new format of Excel files in Excel
2007. So, you need to change settings in Project to permit importing Excel
97–2003 files. To set Project’s security settings, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options.
Project displays the Options dialog box (see Figure 4-6).
2. Click the Security tab.

Importing Excel and Access Information into Project
608
3. Select the Allow Loading Files with Legacy or Non Default File
Formats option.
4. Click OK.
Project now permits you to import non-Project files in formats older
than Office 2007.
Using an import map
You’re an Excel person. Your friends call you “guru.” You do everything in
Excel, even when you probably should use some other software program. So,
you started a Task List in Excel that you now realize is really a project. If you
save the Excel file as an Excel 97–2003 file, you can import the tasks into
Project using Project’s Import Wizard. This process works with Access data-
bases, too; just save your Access database in Access 2002/2003 format or
Access 2000 format.
Project uses import/export maps that define the information that you want
to import or export and help you match the information in the other pro-
gram’s file with the fields in a Project file. Using an import/export map as a
template, Project can correctly translate information from one program to
another.

Be sure that you save your Excel file in Excel 97–2003 format and complete
the steps in the section “Changing Project’s security settings,” earlier in this
chapter, before you begin the following steps.
For this example, use these steps to import an Excel 97–2003 file into Project:
1. In Project, choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Click the list box beside the File Name box and select Microsoft Excel
Workbooks.
3. Use the Previous Locations list box to navigate to the folder that con-
tains the Excel workbook that you want to import.
4. Select the workbook and click Open.
Project starts the Import Wizard.
5. Click Next.
The Map dialog box of the Import Wizard appears (see Figure 4-7).
6. Select New Map and click Next.

11. Open the Source Worksheet Name list and select the Excel worksheet
that contains the data you want to import.
The dialog box updates to show each field in the Excel worksheet. In the
To: Microsoft Office Project Field column, “(not mapped)” appears in red.
12. Click in the To: Microsoft Office Project Field column and select a
Project field to represent the information in the Excel worksheet.
As you match fields, the Preview portion of the dialog box compares
Excel fields to Project fields. Repeat this step for each field.
13. Click Next.
If you selected the Resources and the Assignments check boxes in the
Map Options dialog box (shown previously in Figure 4-8), the Import
Wizard displays additional dialog boxes that are almost identical to the
Task Mapping dialog box so that you can map these data types.
14. Click Next.
The End of Map Definition dialog box appears and gives you the oppor-
tunity to save your map. If you expect to import Excel files in this same
format on a regular basis, click Save Map, supply a map name, and click
Save. In most cases, you don’t need to save the map.
15. Click Finish.
Project imports the Excel file information into a new Project file (see
Figure 4-10).
The tasks in the imported file all contain a Start No Earlier Than constraint
that you probably want to change to As Soon As Possible when you start
working with task dependencies.
Creating a Task List in Excel using 
a Project-related template
You can start a project Task List in Excel and then import it into Project at
the point where you begin to need Project’s scheduling and project manage-
ment tools. To make the job easy in both programs, use a specially designed
Excel template to create your Task List. Follow these steps to create your
Task List in Excel:
1. In Excel, click the Office button.
2. Click New.
The New Workbook dialog box appears (see Figure 4-11).

7. Save your workbook as an Excel 97–2003 workbook.
Project 2007 cannot import an Excel 2007 workbook, but it can import an
Excel 97–2003 workbook.
Importing the Excel Task List into Project
After you’ve saved your Task List in Excel 97–2003 format in Excel, importing
it into Project is a fairly simple matter. You first need to tell Project that you
want to be allowed to import files from earlier versions of Office or files that

don’t use the Project file format. Then, you can use the Import Wizard to
import the Task List into a new project or an existing project. Follow these
steps in Project:
1. Choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears (see Figure 4-13).
2. Click the list box beside the File Name box and select Microsoft Excel
Workbooks.
3. Use the Previous Locations list box to navigate to the folder that con-
tains the Excel workbook that you want to import.

Importing Project Exchange Files into Project
616
Importing Project Exchange Files into Project
You can simply open Project files created in Project 98, Project 2000, Project
2002, and Project 2003. But suppose you have some files from older versions
of Project, like Project 4.0, Project 4.1, or Project 95, that you want to use in
Project 2007. Or suppose that you created an MPX file in Project 98 that you
want to use in Project 2007. You can import files using the MPX file format —
used by Project 4.0 and Project 4.1 and available in Project 98 — into Project
2007.
Some other project management software packages also support the MPX
file format, so if you need to import information from another project man-
agement software package, you can save it as an MPX file and import it into
Project.
Importing an MPX file is similar to opening any project. Follow these steps to
import an MPX file:
1. Choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Click the list box beside the File Name box and choose MPX.
3. Use the Previous Locations list box to navigate to the appropriate file.
4. Click Open.
The currently recommended file format for exchanging Project data with
other products is XML.
Importing Text or Comma-Separated Files into Project
Project can read text (tab-delimited) and comma-separated value (CSV) files.
If you have project data in a program that can create either a text file or a
comma-separated value file, you can import information from that program
into Project. Using the other program, save the information that you want to
import into Project as either a text file or a CSV file. Then follow these steps
in Project to let the Import Wizard walk you through the process. If the map
that you need doesn’t exist, you need to create it.
Follow these steps in Project to import the information:
1. Choose File➪Open.
The Open dialog box appears.
2. Click the list box beside the File Name box and choose Text (Tab
delimited) (*.txt) or CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv).

You can export Project information in a variety of ways so that you 
can use it in Microsoft Office applications. You also can export some
Project information to graphic images that you can use in a graphics pro-
gram or as an image on a Web page. And you can export information to
XML, text (.txt) files, or comma-separated value (.csv) files.
Although you can’t export Project data directly into Word, you can copy
images from a Project Schedule into Word, as you see in the next section. You
can copy table information from Project to Word using the Windows Copy and
Paste commands. When you copy the columns in any table to a Word docu-
ment, they appear as tab-separated columns. Using Word’s Convert Text to
Table feature, you can convert the columns into a Word table.
Copying Pictures into Office Programs
Here’s the situation: You’ve just written a great report in Microsoft Word
about your project and you really want to include your Gantt chart in the
report. Although you can print the Gantt chart on a separate page and 
manually insert it in the appropriate place in the report, you’d really rather
include it as part of the report file in Word. Using the Copy Picture to 
Office Wizard, you can send an image and fields you select to Word,
PowerPoint, or Visio.
The Copy Picture to Office Wizard button appears on the Analysis toolbar,
along with the Adjust Dates button and the PERT Analysis button, but the

Saving Visual Reporting Information

Saving Visual Reporting Information
Book VI, Chapter 4 describes how to create Visual Reports in Project —
reports that use Project data to create reports in Excel or Visio. When
Project generates the data for these visual reports, Project temporarily cre-
ates OLAP (On Line Analytical Processing) cubes and an Access database.
You don’t have direct access to the data, and when you close your project,
Project automatically deletes these OLAP cubes and Access databases.
OLAP cubes help answer analytical queries that are up to six dimensions in
nature. Two-dimensional data typically appears in rows and columns. To
analyze more than two dimensions, think “cube”; each dimension that you
analyze is assigned to one face on the cube. For example, you can use an
OLAP cube to evaluate the sales data of three items for five stores located in
four different regions over a period of several years — and you still haven’t
used up all the sides of the cube.
You can save the OLAP cube and the Access database information and use it
outside of Project. Follow these steps in Project:
1. Open a project and choose Reports➪Visual Reports.
The Visual Reports – Create Report window appears.
2. Click the Save Data button.
The Visual Reports – Save Reporting Data dialog box appears (see 
Figure 5-8).
To copy the picture to the Windows Clipboard,
select the For Screen option button in the
Render Image section and click OK. If the
image that you’re copying will fit well into
another document, Project simply copies the
picture to the Windows Clipboard. But, if the
picture that you’re copying is particularly large,
Project warns you and displays a dialog box
that gives you the opportunity to scale the pic-
ture before saving or pasting it.
After you’ve copied the picture, simply switch
to another program in which you want to place
the picture and click the Paste button in that
document to place a graphic in your document.
To create a graphic image file that you can use
on a Web page or in a document, select the To
GIF Image File option in the Copy Picture dia-
log box.
When you render the image for a printer,
Project copies the image to the Windows
Clipboard but formats the image by using your
printer driver. If you have a black-and-white
printer, the image appears in shades of gray
rather than in the colors that you see on-
screen. If you have a color printer, the image
appears in color, like it looks on-screen. You
can view the image by pasting it into another
application.

3. Open the first drop-down list to select the type of OLAP cube you want
to create.
You can create six different OLAP cubes: Task Usage, Resource Usage,
Assignment Usage, Task Summary, Resource Summary, and Assignment
Summary.
4. Click the Field Picker button.
Project displays the Visual Reports – Field Picker dialog box (see 
Figure 5-9). The fields available and already selected in the Field Picker
dialog box depend on the type of cube you selected.
5. Click a field in the Available Fields list or the Available Custom Fields
list.
6. Click Add.
Project displays the field in the appropriate list box on the right side of
the dialog box.
To remove a field from the cube, select it in the appropriate list on the
right and click the Remove button.

10. Navigate to the location where you want to save the cube, assign it a
name if you don’t like the default name provided by Project, and click
Save.
Project redisplays the Visual Reports – Save Reporting Data dialog box,
builds the cube, and saves it.
11. Click Close twice.
Project redisplays your project.
Creating an Access database file follows basically the same procedure, but
it’s a bit less complicated because you don’t select a cube or fields; instead,
the database file will contain all reporting information in your Project file.
Follow these steps:
1. Open a project and choose Reports➪Visual Reports.
The Visual Reports – Create Report window appears.
2. Click the Save Data button.
The Visual Reports – Save Reporting Data dialog box appears (refer to
Figure 5-8).
3. Click the Save Database button.
Project displays the Save As dialog box.

5. Click Close twice.
Project redisplays your project.
Exporting Project Data to Excel
You can export Project information — tasks, resources, and assignments —
to Excel workbooks using the Export Wizard. You can export the information
to an Excel workbook or to an Excel PivotTable. When you export to an Excel
PivotTable, Project creates two sheets in the Excel workbook for each type
of data that you export. One sheet contains the data that is used in the
PivotTable, and the other sheet contains the PivotTable. Project uses the 
last field in each map as the default field for the PivotTable, and all the other
fields appear as rows in the PivotTable.
The Export Wizard lets you export specific Project data or all data in your
Project file using an Excel template. The Excel template approach makes it
easy to export Project data to Excel and then send it back again to Project,
and the steps that follow show you how to use the Excel template:
1. Open the Project file that contains the information that you want to
export.
2. Choose File➪Save As.
Project opens the Save As dialog box.
3. In the File Name text box, type a name for the file that you want to
export.
4. In the Save As Type drop-down list, select Microsoft Excel Workbook
or Microsoft Excel PivotTable.
5. Click Save.
Project starts the Export Wizard.
6. Click Next.
The Data screen of the Export Wizard appears (see Figure 5-10).
7. Choose Project Excel Template.
8. Click Finish.
Project creates the Excel file using the settings you provided.

You can open the file in Excel; the Excel workbook that Project creates
resembles the one shown in Figure 5-11. Notice that the workbook contains
four worksheets: one for each type of data you can export from Project to
Excel and, on the fourth tab — the Info_Table tab — you find a brief adver-
tisement of Project’s purpose.

If you want to start your project in Excel and later export it to Project, use
the Microsoft Project Plan Import Export Template in Excel. That template
contains all the fields shown in Figure 5-11.
If you choose to export specific Project data (and not use the Excel tem-
plate), you can find the steps you need in the next section because exporting
specific Project data to Excel is very much like exporting Project data to a
text file. You can find only a few differences:
✦You can simultaneously export task, resource, and assignment data to
an Excel workbook; you can export only one type of data at a time to a
text file. If you choose to export more than one type of data, the Export
Wizard displays Mapping dialog boxes for each type of data.
✦While mapping fields, you can specify the name of the destination 
worksheet.
✦Although you can quickly add all the fields in the Project file by clicking
the Add All button, be aware that you can export a maximum of 255
fields to Excel for each type of data. Project contains over 700 task fields
and over 400 resource or assignment fields. So, if you choose Add All,
you’ll have to delete some of the fields before Project will allow you to
proceed to the next step in the wizard.
Exporting Project Data to Text Files
You can use Project information in any program that can open either text
(.txt) files or comma-separated value (.csv) files by exporting Project
schedule information using the Export Wizard.
Follow these steps to export information to a text or comma-separated 
value file:
1. Open the Project file that contains the information that you want to
export.
2. Choose File➪Save As.
Project opens the Save As dialog box.
3. In the File Name text box, type a name for the file that you want to
export.
4. In the Save As Type drop-down list, select Text (Tab Delimited)
(*.txt) or CSV (Comma Delimited) (*.csv).

6. Click Next.
7. Choose New Map or Use Existing Map.
If you choose Use Existing Map, you see the Map Selection dialog box,
from you which can select a predefined set of Project fields to export to
Excel. If you choose New Map, the Map Selection dialog box doesn’t
appear. In this example, we use the New Map option.
8. Click Next.
The Export Wizard displays the Map Options dialog box.
9. Select the type of data to export (see Figure 5-12).
To include assignments that are listed under tasks or resources, similar
to Project’s Task Usage or Resource Usage views, select the Include
Assignment Rows In Output check box.
10. Click Next.
One of the Mapping dialog box appears (see Figure 5-13).
11. Use the Export Filter drop-down list to select the tasks that you want
to export.
By default, Project assumes that you want to export all tasks, but you
can export, for example, only critical tasks.

12. In the Microsoft Office Project Field column, click any blank cell to
select a field to export.
After you click, a list box arrow appears; open the list to select a 
field.
13. Click in the To: Text File Field column next to the field that you 
added.
Project suggests a column heading for the field in the text file; you can
change this heading.
Although you can quickly add all the fields in the Project file by clicking
the Add All button, be aware that the program to which you are export-
ing might have limitations on the number of fields it can hold. Project
contains over 700 task fields and over 400 resource or assignment fields,
and exporting all of them could create a very large file that would take a
long time to open.
14. Repeat Steps 12 and 13 until you’ve selected all the fields you want to
export.
15. Click Next.
The final box of the Export Wizard appears.
16. If you expect to export the same data frequently, click the Save Map
button to save your map settings.
Project displays the Save Map dialog box (see Figure 5-14).

B
ecause you’re reading this book, we can safely assume that the prod-
ucts or services your organization provides are best accomplished in a
project environment. We can also safely assume that you have a limited staff
available to complete all your projects. In an organization where most of the
work happens in a project environment using the same resources, the organ-
ization needs to manage the management of projects to maximize productiv-
ity and profit.
Enter Project Server. Project Server answers the needs of an enterprise to
manage multiple projects that draw their resources from a common resource
pool. This chapter describes the basics of how Project Server functions and
how to approach using Project Server.
What Is Project Server?
Project Server provides your organization with one central database,
located on a Web server or in a server farm on your company’s local area
network (LAN) or intranet, in which you store all projects and all resources
for your organization. Using Project Server, you can
✦View a project’s Gantt chart
✦Enter and view timesheet information
✦Update assignments with progress and completion information
✦Send status reports to the project manager
✦Receive notices about task status
✦Receive, refuse, and delegate work assignments

What Is Project Server?
638
✦Manage resource allocation across your organization
✦Carry out basic issue and risk management
✦Attach supporting documentation, such as budget estimates or feasibil-
ity studies, to a task or project
Although Project Server works in conjunction with Project Professional, only
project managers need to install Project Professional; the project manager
uses Project Professional to create projects using the techniques we’ve
described throughout this book. In the Project Server environment, your
organization can create projects that use identical custom settings to help
you manage projects in a consistent manner because Project Server uses the
Enterprise Global template the same way that Project uses the Global.mpt
template file. The Enterprise Global template contains all the fields, maps,
views, tables, reports, filters, forms, groups, and calendars that are stored in
the Global.mpt template file that’s included in Project Professional, along
with additional enterprise-only fields. You can define whether fields are
required, and you can create look-up tables and value lists for fields.
In addition to setting up the Enterprise Global template, use Project
Professional to create a resource pool that contains all the resources avail-
able in your entire organization using the same techniques described in
Book III, Chapter 4. Because the resource pool contains all the resources
available in your entire organization, it’s aptly named the Global Resource
Pool in Project Server.
You then publish (that’s “upload” in Project Server lingo) the resource pool
and all the organization’s projects to the Project Server database. To work
with the information in the Project Server database, you can use Project
Professional or Project Web Access, an Internet Explorer browser-based
client-side interface that installs when you install Project Server. Figure 1-1
shows you a typical home page in Project Web Access.
The way in which you use the Project Server database depends on your role
in your organization, because different people have different needs for proj-
ect information. For example, project team members can use Project Web
Access to see the assignments that they’ve received, enter time spent on
various project tasks, update work assignments, send status reports to the
project manager, and even set up to-do lists. Chapter 4 of this minibook
describes how a team member might use the Project Server database.
Project Server can exchange information with Outlook. Resources can
import tasks from Project Server and export work information from Outlook
to Project Server.

Book X
Chapter 1
Understanding
Project Server
What Is Project Server?
639
Project managers can receive updates to tasks and status reports from team
members. Project managers also can use the Global Resource Pool when
assigning resources while setting up new projects or tasks within an existing
project. The Global Resource Pool helps project and resource managers
avoid overallocating resources and also contains a matching feature you can
use to match the skills you need for a task to a person in the resource pool
with those skills. Chapter 3 of this minibook describes how a project man-
ager might use the Project Server database.
Clearly, security becomes a serious issue when you decide to place all the
information about your organization’s work into a central repository. Not
only do you need to secure the LAN or intranet from the outside world, but
you also need to secure the various projects within the Project Server data-
base because everybody doesn’t need to see everything. In fact, two team
members working on the same project might need access to different infor-
mation. Along with other jobs, the Project Server administrator sets up the
Project Server database security. The Project Server administrator doesn’t
typically decide that John gets to see financial data and Mary doesn’t;
instead, the Project Server administrator works with others within the
organization to develop security profiles that describe the varying levels of
security needed in your organization. And, the Project Server administrator

Do You Need Project Server?

sets up new users in the Project Server database with the privileges that
organization management deems appropriate. The next chapter of this mini-
book describes the role of the Project Server administrator in more detail.
Do You Need Project Server?
You might have been managing multiple projects for a long time now, and
you might have been managing them effectively, too. So, the question might
arise, “Do I really need Project Server?”
To determine whether Project Server can help you, ask yourself the follow-
ing questions:
✦Has your organization identified a need to track projects more accu-
rately or use resources more efficiently?
✦Does your organization manage many different projects using the same
resources?
✦Has your organization determined that the time of project managers and
resources would be used more efficiently if resources could record their
time directly in the project schedule instead of providing it to the proj-
ect manager, who then updates the schedule?
✦Do your users need access to project data anywhere in the world?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, Project Server can help you.
The more “yes” answers you gave, the more likely it us that your organiza-
tion can benefit from using Project Server.
Planning the Implementation of Project Server
To successfully implement Project Server, you need to plan for the needs of
your organization. You need to assess where your organization is today and
where it plans to go. You need to identify the players, their needs, and their
roles in the process. You need to figure out what needs to be done, who has
the skills and availability to do it, when it needs to be done, and what else
depends on it getting done.
To summarize, implementing Project Server is a project. You should treat it
as such, identifying the tasks that you need to accomplish, estimating the
work needed to accomplish them, identifying task dependencies, and assign-
ing resources to the tasks.

Book X
Chapter 1
Understanding
Project Server
Planning the Implementation of Project Server
641
To successfully implement Project Server, you should treat the project the
same way you would treat an information technology project. You should
assess requirements, design the system, and develop an implementation
strategy.
Defining requirements
When you assess requirements for an information technology project, you
focus on determining your organization’s direction and needs; the Project
Server design ultimately depends on the information that you gather.
On the team you set up to implement the system, you need people who are
good at gathering information, making design decisions, and managing imple-
mentation. You’ll find it helpful to include people who are experienced in using
enterprise project management systems. You need a mix of business people
and technical people to address the various facets of implementing Project
Server. The business people should include senior project managers and staff
with experience using Project. The technical people should include those 
who are experienced in your company’s network architecture and hardware
configuration. To customize or automate Project Server functions, you should
include a technical person with skills in developing object models for Project.
Everyone on the team should be familiar with your company’s standards.
The team needs to set milestone dates and task durations for each of the fol-
lowing activities:
✦Identify the people who will approve the Project Server design
✦Identify staff members to interview
✦Create a requirements definition questionnaire
✦Conduct interviews
✦Calculate return on investment
As with any project, it’s important to identify the decision-makers as soon as
you start. If possible, include one or more of them on the team so that they
are a part of the process and they feel ownership for the system that you
ultimately design.
For interviews, identify staff members who fill the following roles:
✦Administrators: People who manage changes and access to the Project
Server database. The people who start the administrator job might ulti-
mately phase out of the job because the job functions change over time.
Initially, the administrator installs and sets up Project Professional,
Project Server, and SQL Server and may use both Project Server and SQL

Planning the Implementation of Project Server
642
Server tools to meet the needs of users. Eventually, the administrator
role migrates to a maintenance function, where knowledge of Project
Server administrative functions is the only prerequisite.
✦Executives: People who view reports on projects and resources.
✦Portfolio managers: People who are familiar with company standards
and can manage the Enterprise global template.
✦Project managers: People who prepare project plans and monitor proj-
ect progress.
✦Resource managers: People who delegate work to team members and
monitor project progress and resource utilization.
✦Team members: People to whom work is assigned.
To effectively interview, the team should create a questionnaire that focuses
on obtaining information about how people work. To gather information for
your questionnaire, evaluate the reports that your company currently uses to
record project performance. Analyze these reports to identify the resources
and projects that are or should be included on the report. Evaluate how tasks,
projects, and resources are categorized on the reports and note who uses
each report.
When you conduct interviews, make sure that you include more than one
person in each role because two people filling the same role do things differ-
ently and potentially have different needs.
Implementing Project Server will require software and role-based training 
for resources, and it might also require investments in hardware. Because of
the investment required to implement Project Server, you should calculate
your return on investment to assess the costs and benefits of implementing
Project Server.
Designing the system
Using the information that you gathered while defining requirements, you
should be able to identify the features in Project Server that you want to
implement. In addition, the implementation team must also address issues
that aren’t directly related to the design of the Project Server database. For
example, the team should
✦Evaluate the technology environment
✦Address special needs
✦Establish and/or enforce organizational standards
✦Plan for training

Book X
Chapter 1
Understanding
Project Server
Planning the Implementation of Project Server
643
The team must evaluate the organization’s technology environment because
Project Server requires certain software, and the hardware that you use
affects the performance of Project Server.
The requirements definition might highlight some special needs. For exam-
ple, your organization might want to use Windows SharePoint Services,
which comes with Project Server, to build and maintain document libraries
for projects and deal with issues in a collaborative way.
The team should customize the Enterprise Global template to reflect the
standards of your organization so that everyone uses the same terminology
and applies the same processes and procedures to their projects. In the
Enterprise Global template, you can create custom fields, outline codes,
views, and calendars. The team can also set up the Enterprise Resource Pool
so that your organization can share resources between projects and identify
conflicts between assignments in different projects.
We can’t stress strongly enough how important training is. Suffice it to say
that without proper training for those who will use Project Server, implemen-
tation will fail.
Developing an implementation strategy
Because the scope of implementing enterprise project management affects
your entire organization, doing it “all at once” is very risky. Using a phased
approach reduces the risk considerably and increases your chances for 
success.
Start by creating a prototype of the system. Identify a few projects and proj-
ect teams to participate in the prototype test, making sure that you select
users who represent all the various roles that the team identified so that you
can fully test the system. Also, select projects that don’t depend on other
projects that won’t be a part of the prototype. Design and develop the proto-
type system and demonstrate it to the project teams that will use it. Make
modifications to the prototype design based on input from these project
teams and demonstrate the prototype to senior management, once again,
making changes as needed.
Then develop training materials and begin a pilot phase. Reset the Project
Server database and load the pilot projects that include users who represent
all the various roles that the team identified. During this pilot phase, you
should include at least one project that has external dependencies to another
project to test that aspect of using Project Server, and then you can make
adjustments as needed. Train the pilot group and allow the group members 
to use Project Server for at least four reporting cycles. Solicit feedback and
address all the issues that arise.

Planning the Implementation of Project Server
644
When you’re satisfied that you’ve ironed out any kinks identified during 
the prototype and pilot phases, expand the user base of the system again,
adding projects to the Project Server database, and train the new group that
is to begin using the system. Allow each new group of users to work through
at least three reporting cycles before you add more projects and users.
Reviewing software needs
As you’d expect, Microsoft has established certain basic software and hard-
ware requirements needed to support Project Server. On the software side,
you need to meet requirements for both client machines and server machines.
Client machines used by the project manager need Project Professional and
Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher. The client machines of other resources need
only Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher. And, if you intend to exchange task
information with Outlook, client machines also need Outlook 2007.
Servers that will host Project Server need, at a minimum, Windows Server
2003, Standard or Enterprise Edition, 32-bit or 64-bit, with Service Pack 1 or
later. You need to enable Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 6.0 or
above, and for the Project Server database engine, you need SQL Server 2000
with Service Pack 3 or higher or SQL Server 2005. If you want to use the port-
folio modeling features that are available in Project Web Access, you need
SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Reporting Services, which are
included with SQL Server but must be installed separately. In addition,
Project Server depends on the Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (WSS) plat-
form, which comes on the Project Server 2007 CD and installs automatically
when you install Project Server. To use e-mail notifications, both the server
and client machines need Internet SMTP/POP3, IMAP4, or MAPI-compliant
messaging software.
Reviewing hardware needs
Microsoft recommends that each client machine have, at a minimum, a 
300-MHz processor, have 192MB of RAM, and use Windows XP Professional
as the operating system. The minimum processor on a client machine is a
Pentium 133-MHz. Each client machine should have a Super VGA (800 x 600)
or higher resolution monitor with 256 colors and a Microsoft Mouse–
compatible pointing device.
Typically, you install Project Server on your company’s server or in a server
farm. If you’re planning to use the bare-minimum hardware, you should load
only Project Server on that computer. Other components, such as SQL
Server, should run on separate computers to help you balance the load.
You can read more about load balancing in the next section.

Book X
Chapter 1
Understanding
Project Server
Planning the Implementation of Project Server
645
Microsoft recommends that you install Project Server on a computer with a
minimum Pentium III processor that runs at 700 MHz and has 1GB of RAM, a
DVD-ROM drive, a Super VGA (800 x 600) or higher resolution monitor, and 
a Microsoft Mouse–compatible pointing device.
To install Project Server, you need 200MB of available hard drive space. To
install WSS, you need another 70MB of hard drive space and a minimum of
256MB of RAM, but 512MB of RAM is recommended.
To install SQL Server 2000, you need 250MB of hard drive space and 128MB
of RAM. If you also intend to install SQL Analysis Services, you need another
130MB of hard drive space and another 128MB of RAM.
You might want to plan to upgrade your network infrastructure. The amount
of traffic that you can expect on your network is directly related to the 
total number of users, the number of concurrent users updating the Project
Server databases, and the number and size of projects that you store in the
Project Server database. Using older network architecture (10Base-T) in a
heavily trafficked environment will undoubtedly result in complaints that the
system is slow.
Considering software and hardware configurations
The overall performance of Project Server is affected by the features of
Project Server that you want to use, the total number of users and concur-
rent users, and the number of projects that you want to store in the Project
Server databases.
As you read earlier in this chapter, you’re loading a lot of software to use
Project Server. But, because Project Server 2007 depends on Windows
SharePoint Services 3.0, you have some choices about how you configure
the hardware on which you will load the software, and your choices will
affect the performance of Project Server. You can use a single server or a
server farm.
If you use a single server, you load all the software that Project Server needs 
to run onto that one server. But, if you choose to use a server farm, you can
place various components and services on several networked computers to
balance the load. The server farm has a few advantages. Using a server farm
improves your ability to easily expand to meet growing needs while simultane-
ously limiting the impact created when a single component or service fails.
You can set up Project Server 2007 in a small farm, a medium farm, or a large
farm. There are many ways that you can set up each server farm size, and
Microsoft makes some recommendations about the various server farm con-
figurations. In each of these configurations, Microsoft classifies the servers

Planning the Implementation of Project Server
646
in the farm as Web front-end servers, application servers, and SQL servers
and recommends placing different components of Project Server on the dif-
ferent classifications of servers. Typically, here’s how things work:
✦You place Windows SharePoint Services and Project Web Access on Web
front-end servers.
✦You put applications such as the Project Server Interface, Project Server
business objects, and Project Server reporting and queuing services on
application servers.
✦You place Project Server SQL databases, SQL Analysis Services, and SQL
Reporting Services on SQL servers.
In a small server farm, you load everything on two servers. You designate one
computer as the SQL Server, placing SQL 2000 or SQL 2005 and SQL Analysis
Services and SQL Reporting Services on that computer. Then use the other
computer as both a Web front-end server and an application server, where you
install Project Server and Windows SharePoint Services. This configuration
separates database processing from other processing and typically improves
performance.
In a medium server farm, you use three tiers of servers, installing each
Project Server component in a separate Web front end, application, and
database server tier. This approach works well when you need to accommo-
date more users because you can add more Web front-end servers, applica-
tion servers, and, if necessary, database servers.
In the large server farm configuration, you use three tiers and install each
component in a separate tier like you do in the medium server farm. In the
large server farm configuration, you might also be using other services 
available through SharePoint Server 2007, such as Search, Index, or Excel
Calculation Services. In this case, you set up each of these services on its
own server.

nitially, the Project Server administrator needs information technology
(IT) skills to install Project Server. When the design and implementation
processes described in Chapter 1 of this minibook are complete, setting up
the Project Server database for use in your organization requires both IT
skills and the skills of a person familiar with project management and your
organization’s needs while managing projects. This chapter describes the
administrative tasks involved in customizing the Project Server database.
Understanding the Structure of 
the Project Server Database
Using the term “Project Server Database” is a bit misleading because each
installation of Project Server actually consists of four databases: the Draft
database, the Published database, the Archive database, and the Reporting
database.
We continue to refer to the collection as “the Project Server database”
throughout this book, just to make things easier.
You can think of the Draft database as a holding tank area where project
managers can store projects created in Project Professional that they don’t
yet want the general public to view. Only users of Project Professional can
view draft projects.

Reviewing Defaults
648
Projects that are available to Project Web Access users reside in the
Published database. For these projects, team members can update
timesheets, update project information, and view reports, based on their
Project Web Access credentials.
The Archive database contains older and backed-up versions of published
projects.
Project Server uses the Reports database, which holds the data used in
reports, to generate reports and OLAP cubes. Project Server updates the
information in the Reporting database almost as soon as information
changes.
Reviewing Defaults
The Project Server database contains many useful default values and set-
tings that you can double-check, using Project Web Access, to make sure
that they’re right for your organization.
Launch Project Web Access by starting Internet Explorer and entering the
URL for your Project Server database.
Your organization can set up access to the Project Server database by 
using one of two types of authentication: Windows authentication or Forms
authentication. If your organization uses Windows authentication, you see
the Project Web Access home page of the account you used to log onto the
computer. If your organization uses Forms authentication, you’re prompted
to log onto Project Web Access by supplying a username and password.
The Quick Launch pane runs down the left side of the Project Web Access
home page, and the Project Web Access home page for the administrator
contains an additional link in the Quick Launch pane: the Server Settings
link. When the Project Server administrator clicks the Server Settings link,
Project Web Access displays the Server Settings page (see Figure 2-1) from
which the Project Server administrator can manage and customize the
Project Server database and Project Web Access.
By clicking the Additional Server Settings link in the Operational Policies
section of the Server Settings page, you can make changes to a variety of fea-
tures available for use in Project Server. For example, the Project Server
administrator can confirm whether your organization will allow projects to
use a local base calendar instead of the Enterprise base calendar. Also from
this page, the Project Server administrator can change settings that help
manage the size of the reporting database.

Project Server uses Windows SharePoint Services technology as its founda-
tion, and the Project Server administrator can manage Windows SharePoint
Services settings by clicking the Site Actions tab in the upper-right corner of
the Project Web Access window and choosing Site Settings to display the
Site Settings. For example, you can set your time zone, select a calendar
type, define your workweek, and select a time format.
To manage security settings, Project Server uses security templates, groups,
and categories.
Security templates are sets of permissions; you use security templates to
assign a set of permissions to a user or a group of users. Groups are collections
of users, such as administrators, project managers, and team members. And,
using categories, you can map users and groups to the projects, resources,
views, and custom fields the users and groups can see in Project Web Access.
The Project Server database contains default security templates, groups,
and categories; you can modify any of these security elements or create your
own. To add or modify security templates, click Security Templates in the
Security section of the Server Settings page. To add or modify groups, click
the Manage Groups link in the Security section of the Server Settings page.

You can create a new category or modify any of the existing categories by
clicking the Manage Categories link in the Security section of the Server
Settings page.
Working with Users
People in your organization can’t open the Project Server database until you
add them to it as users. From the Server Settings page, click the Manage
Users link in the Security section of the Server Settings page to display the
Manage Users page (see Figure 2-2). From this page, the Project Server
administrator can add, modify, or deactivate user accounts. In addition, the
administrator can merge two usernames into one account if a user appears
twice in the Log On list under two different names.
To add a user, click New User at the top of the list of users. To edit a user, click
the user’s name. When you add or edit a user, you see a page on which you
specify the user’s name and other identification information, the type of
authentication to use (Windows Authentication or Forms authentication), the
user’s assignment attributes, resource custom fields, security groups, security
categories, global permissions, group fields, team details, and system identifi-
cation data. In Figure 2-3, you see the top of the Edit User page.

Working with Views
651
Working with Views
Views enable users to examine project information in different ways, because
a view contains a set of fields and filters that Project Web Access uses when
displaying project information. Through views, the administrator controls
what you see in Project Web Access.
As you’d expect, the Project Server database contains many default views,
and the Project Server administrator can use the Manage Views page to
create new views and modify or delete existing views. To display this page
from the Server Settings page, click the Manage Views link in the Look and
Feel section of the Server Settings page.
You can specify the type of view, the view name, the tables and fields that 
you want to appear in the view, view format options, including outline levels,
grouping and sorting options, filter options, and security categories. The type
of view that you select determines the choices that appear as you create the
view. For example, for some views, you can choose a Gantt Chart format that
isn’t available for other views.
We suggest that you load a project into the Project Server database before
you create a view or if you want to modify an existing view. With a project 
in the database, you can view that project using each default view that
Figure 2-3:

Working with the Enterprise Global Template
652
Microsoft provides, and you might find that the view that you want or one
close to it already exists.
Working with the Enterprise Global Template
The Enterprise Global template and the Global template in Project Profes-
sional serve the same purpose. They store all the default settings used by
projects across your organization. The Project Server administrator cus-
tomizes the Enterprise Global template to set up the custom fields and 
calendars that meet the needs of your organization. When you customize 
the Enterprise Global template, it opens in Project Professional (note the
title bar in Figure 2-4), where you can customize fields, groups, and filters,
just to name a few elements.
To open the Enterprise Global template from the Server Settings page in
Project Web Access, click the Enterprise Global link in the Enterprise Data
section to display the Configure Project Professional page. Click the
Configure Project Professional button.
When you finish, choose File➪Close. You’ll be prompted to check in the
Enterprise Global template. Click Yes to save your settings and make the
Enterprise Global template available in Project Web Access.

Creating Enterprise Custom Fields
653
Creating Enterprise Custom Fields
You can use Enterprise custom fields for many purposes. For example, if your
organization opts to use generic resources and wants to be able to match the
skills of a generic resource with a real resource that possesses those skills,
you can create a custom field and establish a value list for the field where each
value represents a set of skills. After you assign the appropriate value to each
resource by using the custom field, you can use the custom field to match
skills that are required by generic resources with skills that are possessed by
real people when project managers run the Team Builder.
You set up enterprise custom fields essentially the same way that you set up
Project custom fields, but you use Project Web Access. On the Server Settings
page, click the Enterprise Custom Field Definition link in the Enterprise Data
section of the Server Settings page. The Custom Fields page (shown in Figure
2-5) lists all custom fields that currently exist in the Enterprise Global tem-
plate. Below the list of custom fields, you also see a list of defined lookup
tables; you can identify the lookup table assigned to a given custom field in
the Lookup Table field at the right edge of the Enterprise Custom Fields table.
Figure 2-5:
The list of
existing
custom
fields.

Establishing Enterprise Calendars
654
You can edit an existing field by clicking its name. To create a new custom
field based on the definition of an existing custom field, click anywhere on
the row of the existing custom field and then click the Copy Field button that
appears above the list of fields. Or, you can click the New Field button to
create a new custom field.
Establishing Enterprise Calendars
When you assign a calendar to the Enterprise Global template, you establish
common workdays and work times across all projects. Resources in the
Enterprise Resource Pool can use the calendar in the Enterprise Global tem-
plate unless you override that calendar by assigning a resource-specific 
calendar.
You set up the calendar for the Enterprise Global template the same way
that you set up a calendar for a project, but you start in Project Web Access.
On the Server Settings page, click the Enterprise Calendars link in the
Enterprise Data section. The Enterprise Calendars page appears, listing the
calendars defined in the Enterprise Global template.
You can edit an existing calendar by clicking anywhere on the line where its
name appears and then clicking the Edit Calendar button above the list of
calendars. If you want to create a new calendar based on an existing calen-
dar, click anywhere on the row of the existing custom field and then click the
Copy Calendar button. Or, you can click the New Calendar button to create a
new calendar. When you edit or create a calendar, Project Web Access opens
the Change Working Time dialog box in Project Professional (see Figure 2-6).

Working with Enterprise Resources
The Enterprise Resource Pool is a single repository that project and
resource managers can use when assigning resources to their projects. To
assign a resource to a project, a project manager checks out the resource
from the Enterprise Resource Pool (much like checking a book out of a
library).
You can easily create the Enterprise Resource Pool using a project that con-
tains the resources that you want to store in the Enterprise Resource Pool.
Make sure that the project containing the resources is closed or checked in,
and then follow these steps to create the Enterprise Resource Pool:
1. Open Project Professional and connect to the Project Server database
by logging in.
2. Choose Tools➪Enterprise Options➪Import Resources to Enterprise.
The Open dialog box appears.
3. Select the project that contains the resources and click Open.
4. If you’ve set up any custom fields for resources, click the Map
Resource Fields link in the Project Guide pane.
The Map Custom Fields dialog box appears, and you can match custom
fields that you’ve set up for resources to enterprise resource fields.
5. Click Continue to Step 2 in the Project Guide.
6. Identify the resources that you want to upload to the Enterprise
Resource Pool by choosing Yes in the Import column (see Figure 2-7).
7. Click Validate Resources in the Project Guide pane.
Project compares the selected resources to those in the Enterprise
Resource Pool and displays any errors.
8. Correct the errors and click Save and Finish in the Project Guide
pane.
Project sends the resources to the Enterprise Resource Pool in the
Project Server database. In the Project Guide pane, Project Professional
gives you the opportunity to optionally set booking types — Proposed
or Committed — for selected resources.
9. Click Done.

Working with Enterprise Resources
656
After you have stored a resource in the Enterprise Resource Pool, you can
make a change to that resource by checking it out, making the change, and
then checking it back in. While resources are checked out, others can’t make
and save changes to the resources. Follow these steps to check out
resources from the Enterprise Resource Pool:
1. Open Project Professional and connect to the Project Server database.
2. Choose Tools➪Enterprise Options➪Open Enterprise Resource Pool.
Project displays a temporary project called Checked-Out Enterprise
Resources that lists the resource pool; notice the title bar in Figure 2-8.
3. Place a check mark next to the resource(s) that you want to edit.
4. Click the Edit Details button above the list of resources.
The Edit Resource window appears.
5. Make changes to the resource.
6. Click Save and Continue.
Project saves your changes to the Enterprise Resource Pool.
7. Click the Save button on the Standard toolbar to check the resource
back in to the Enterprise Resource Pool.

Loading Projects into the Project Server Database
You will, no doubt, have projects already created and in progress that you
want to load into the Project Server database. You can use the Project Guide
in Project Professional to walk you through loading these projects. While
connected to the Project Server database, choose Tools➪Enterprise
Options➪Import Project to Enterprise. Use the Open dialog box that appears
to navigate to the .MPP file that you want to import into the Project Server
database. Project opens the project and displays the Import Project Wizard,
a five-step process, in the Project Guide pane. As a part of the process, you
✦Map resources in the project to resources in the Enterprise Resource Pool
✦Validate the resources in the project
✦Match local task custom fields to Enterprise task custom fields

Managing Timesheet and Task Settings
658
✦Confirm the tasks that Project will import to Project Server
✦Save the project to the Project Server database
When you close the project in Project Professional, you see a dialog box that
asks you if you want to save changes to the project and if you want to check
the project in to Project Server. Save the changes and check in the project so
that others can use it.
Managing Timesheet and Task Settings
Project Server contains a variety of timesheet and task settings that you can
manage through Project Web Access. For example, you can
✦Establish fiscal periods that match your business’s fiscal periods from
the Fiscal Periods page. To display this page, click the Financial Periods
link in the Time and Task Management section of the Server Settings
page.
✦Create reporting periods for timesheet entries from the Timesheet
Periods page. When users want to record time spent on project tasks,
they select a time period. You can create 52 weekly time periods, 26
biweekly periods, 12 monthly periods — create periods that match the
way project managers want users to report time spent. To display the
Timesheet Periods page, click the Timesheet Classifications link in the
Time and Task Management section of the Server Settings page.
Ways to record actual work
Project offers three possible ways for users to
record actual work in Project Server:
 The Percent of Work Complete method is
the fastest way for resources to record time,
but it’s also the least accurate because it’s
based on the resource’s estimate of the total
amount of work to be done, along with the
amount that’s actually completed. Resources
enter the percentage amount.
 The Actual Work Done and Work Remain-
ing method is the “middle of the road”
method because it’s both moderately fast
and moderately accurate. Resources enter
the amount of work done and the amount of
work remaining to be completed in hours,
days, weeks, and so on.
 The Hours of Work Done per Time Period
method is the most accurate method but
also the most time-consuming. Resources
enter the actual hours worked on each task
for a specified time period, such as a day.

✦Set up classifications that match account codes or cost codes that your
company uses in its general ledger so that you can match lines that
appear on timesheets with account codes or cost codes in your general
ledger to help you track project costs. To display the Edit or Create Line
Classifications page, click the Timesheet Classifications link in the Time

✦Set a variety of default settings related to timesheets, such as whether
users enter data against projects or against assignments. To display 
the Settings and Defaults page, click the Timesheet Settings and Defaults
link in the Time and Task Management section of the Server Settings
page.
✦Set a variety of options that control the way tasks function and display
in Project Web Access. For example, you can set the default tracking
method for projects that are published to the Project Server database
and permit project managers to select different tracking methods when
creating their projects. To display the Task Settings and Display page,
click the Task Settings and Display link in the Time and Task Manage-
ment section of the Server Settings page.
The sidebar, “Ways to record actual work,” describes each method and
its pros and cons.
✦Lock down tasks so that resources cannot report time for those tasks.
To display the Close Tasks to Update page, click the Close Tasks to
Update link in the Time and Task Management section of the Server
Settings page.
✦Set up administrative time categories that users can use to record admin-
istrative time on timesheets. These categories represent reasons why a
resource might not be available for work, such as vacation, sickness, jury
duty, or bereavement. To display the Edit or Create Administrative Time
page, click the Administrative Time link in the Time and Task Management
section of the Server Settings page.
Customizing Project Web Access
The administrator can customize Project Web Access. For example, from the
Edit Quick Launch page (see Figure 2-9), you can control the appearance of
the Quick Launch pane. To display this page, click the Quick Launch link in
the Look and Feel section of the Server Settings page. Working in the Quick
Launch pane default behavior, all choices appear in each section. You can
change the behavior to display only the main headings. Then, if you click a
main heading, the subordinate headings for that section appear. You also 

Customizing Project Web Access

can reorganize or hide default menu items in the Quick Launch pane, and if
you click the New Link button, you can add a new menu item to the Quick
Launch pane.
You also can choose to hide or display menu items from Windows
SharePoint Services in the Quick Launch pane. Simply select or deselect 
the check box that’s aptly named Show Menu Items from Windows
SharePoint Services.
The Project Server administrator can control the appearance of Gantt
taskbars on the timescale of Gantt charts for some or all Gantt charts that
team members and managers view in Project Web Access using the Gantt
Chart Formats page. To display this page, click the Gantt Chart Formats link
in the Look and Feel section of the Server Settings page.
Finally, using the Grouping Formats page, the Project Server administrator
can format the appearance of grouped information on the timesheet and
define the appearance of up to ten groups for views in the Projects Center
and the Resource Center. To display this page, click the Grouping Formats
link in the Look and Feel section of the Server Settings page.

Checking in Enterprise Projects and Resources
661
Checking in Enterprise Projects and Resources
When a project manager works on an enterprise object (like a project)
stored in the Project Server database, Project Server checks out that enter-
prise object to the project manager. While the object is checked out, nobody
else can make changes to it.
If somebody leaves work without closing a checked out object and you need
to perform some maintenance on the Project Server database, you need to
check in the object, and you can do that from the Force Check-in Enterprise
Objects page (see Figure 2-10). To display this page, click the Force Check-in
Enterprise Objects link in the Database Administration section of the Server
Settings page.
From this page, you can check in Enterprise projects, resources, custom
fields, calendars, lookup tables for Enterprise custom fields, and resource
plans. Use the drop-down list at the top of the page to select the type of
object you want to check in. Then check the object and click the Check-In
link.

Managing Information in the Project Server Database
662
Managing Information in the Project Server Database
Response time from the Project Server database increases as the database
grows in size. Therefore, periodically, the Project Server administrator
should delete old information from the Project Server database using the
Delete Enterprise Objects page (see Figure 2-11). To display this page, click
the Delete Enterprise Objects link in the Database Administration section of
the Server Settings page.
Backing Up and Restoring
Backing up and restoring the Project Server database is one of the most
important actions you can take to protect your data. The backups you 
create in Project Web Access are item-level backups designed to work 
with SQL Server database backups — not in place of SQL Server database
backups.

From the Daily Backup Schedule page (see Figure 2-12), you can set up a
schedule for backing up items in the Project Server database, and you can
specify the number of versions of the backup you want to keep. Project
Server stores the backups in the Archive database, and the more versions
you keep, the larger the Archive database becomes.
To display this page, click the Schedule Backup link in the Database
Administration section of the Server Settings page.
Alternatively, the Project Server administrator can back up items in the
Project Server database outside of the daily schedule by using the Backup
page. To display this page, click the Administrative Backup link in the
Database Administration section of the Server Settings page. Select the items
you want to back up and click the Backup button.
Use the Restore page to restore a backup. To display this page, click the
Administrative Restore link in the Database Administration section of the
Server Settings page. From the Item drop-down list, select the type of object
you want to restore. If you want to selectively restore projects, click a proj-
ect and then click the Restore button.

Managing the Queue
To improve performance, Project Server uses a service to queue work
requests until the server becomes available to act on the request. You can
control the behavior of the queue. Using the Queue Settings page, you can
establish or change settings for the Project queue or the Timesheet queue.
To display this page, click the Queue Settings link in the Queue section of the
Server Settings page.
Using the Manage Queue Jobs page (see Figure 2-13), you can view the cur-
rent status of queued jobs and, if you want, retry or cancel jobs. To display

lthough the project manager can use Project Web Access, typically, the
project manager uses the Project Server database in conjunction with
Project Professional. This chapter describes how the project manager logs
into the Project Server database while using Project Professional and then
how to create and work with projects that you load into the Project Server
database.
You can’t use Project Standard with Project Server. You must use Project
Professional.
Logging onto Project Server
You can work with a project as though you weren’t connected to the Project
Server database, or you can connect to the Project Server database and
work with the project. You make that choice when you start Project
Professional. To be able to make that choice, however, you need a Project
Server account to connect to the Project Server database. You can create 
a Project Server account by using Project Professional after your Project
Server administrator gives you the URL for your Project Server database. 
To create a Project Server Account, follow these steps:
1. Start Project Professional.
2. Choose Tools➪Enterprise Options➪Microsoft Project Server
Accounts.
The Project Server Accounts dialog box appears (see Figure 3-1).

Logging onto Project Server
666
3. Click the Add button.
The Account Properties dialog box appears (see Figure 3-2).
4. In the Account Name text box, type a name for the account.
You must use a name that doesn’t already appear on your computer.
There are no other rules about this name, so your own name is a good
choice, or, if your company uses multiple servers, you could assign 
the name of the server to help you identify the server to which you are
connecting.
5. In the Project Server URL box, type the URL for the location of your
Project Server database.
You can click the Test Connection button to ensure that you type the
URL correctly.
6. In the When Connecting section, choose the type of connection that
your organization uses; your Project Server administrator can tell you
the type of connection:

• Use your Project Server account, which uses Forms authentication,
by selecting the Use a Project Server Account option button. In the
User Name text box, type your name.
7. Click OK.
The Project Server Accounts dialog box reappears.
8. At the bottom of the box, choose whether you want to log on automati-
cally or manually control the connection state.
• If you choose the Automatically Detect Connection State option
button, Project attempts to detect the Project Server when you open
Project in the future.
• If you choose the Manually Control Connection State option button, a
Login dialog box appears when you open Project in the future, and
you’ll have the opportunity to choose the account that you want to
use to log on to Project Server.
You also can choose to make this account the default account for logging on
to Project Server.
Working with Web-based Projects
Building the project schedule for a project you intend to work on with Project
Server database isn’t all that different from setting up any project. You use
Project to create the schedule and make assignments to team members to
track their activities pretty much the same way we describe in the other mini-
books, with two new tasks: You need to set the project’s options to use Web
communication, and you need to publish the project to the Project Server
database. Publish is Project Server lingo for “upload and make the project vis-
ible to other Project Server users.”
To set a project’s options to use Web communication, log on to the Project
Server database, open the project for which you want to set Web-based
options, and choose Collaborate➪Collaboration Options. Project displays
the Collaborate tab of the Options dialog box (see Figure 3-3).
To review a project’s options for Web communication, use the Collaborate
tab in the Options dialog box. Choose whether resources can delegate tasks
in Project Web Access.

Working with Web-based Projects
668
If your organization didn’t select a tracking method for you, you can select a
tracking method. If your organization has locked down the tracking method
in Project Server, none of the options will be available. If the options are
available, you can choose to use the default method set up in Project Server
or you can select a method for the current project:
✦The Percent of Work Complete method is the fastest way for resources
to record time, but it is also the least accurate because it is based on the
resource’s estimate of the total amount of work to be done, along with
the amount that is actually completed. Resources enter the percentage
amount.
✦The Actual Work Done and Work Remaining method is the “middle of
the road” method because it is both moderately accurate and moderately
fast. Resources enter the hours, days, weeks, and so on of the amount of
work done and the amount of work remaining to be completed.
✦The Hours of Work Done per Time Period method is the most accurate
method but also the most time-consuming. Resources enter the actual
hours worked on each task for a specified time period.
Before you can place a copy of a project into the Project Server database for
public consumption, you need to save a draft version of it to the Project
Server database. You can continue to work with the draft project in Project
Figure 3-3:

Professional and modify it, and the project won’t be visible to other users.
To save a draft version, open Project Professional and log on to Project
Server. Then open the project that you want to store in the Project Server
database and choose File➪Save As. The Save to Project Server dialog box
appears (see Figure 3-4); any custom fields stored in the Enterprise Global
template appear at the bottom of the box. Click the Save button, and Project
Professional uploads the project to Project Server.
When you want the world see your project, you publish it. Choose File➪
Publish; the Publish Project dialog box appears (see Figure 3-5). If your
organization uses the Windows SharePoint Services features that help
manage documents, issues, and risks associated with projects, you might
want to select the Create a Workspace for This Project option button. 
Project fills in all the information for you, and there really isn’t any reason 
to change any of it. Click Publish, and you can watch the status bar to 
monitor progress while Project updates Project Server.
If you choose not to create the project workspace, the Project Server admin-
istrator can create it later.

Working with Web-based Projects
670
At this point, two versions of your project reside in the Project Server 
database — the draft version and the published version. You can continue
to work with your project in Project Professional; typically, you’ll work with
the draft version and ultimately republish it to update the version that
everyone else sees.
Opening and closing a project
You can open the original project schedule stored on your hard drive, or 
you can open either the draft version or the published version stored in the
Project Server database. Click the Open button on the Standard toolbar. You
see the Open dialog box (see Figure 3-6).
The first time you display the Open dialog box, no projects appear in it.
Instead, you see only one item — the Retrieve the List of All Projects from
Project Server item — because you haven’t opened a project stored in the
Project Server database yet. The situation we’re about to describe sounds
very much like trying to answer the question “Which came first — the
chicken or the egg?” (and makes our heads hurt).
Lightweight projects
No, these aren’t inconsequential projects.
Instead, they might be ideas for future projects
or lists of things you don’t want to slip through
the cracks. But, you know that you don’t need
the full capabilities of Project Professional yet.
You can use Project Web Access Proposals or
Activity Plans to manage these simple lists. To
create a proposal or activity plan, click the
Proposals and Activities link in the Quick Launch
pane of Project Web Access.
There isn’t a lot of difference between a pro-
posal and an activity plan, unless your organi-
zation uses Microsoft Office SharePoint Server
(MOSS). In this case, MOSS enables you to 
set up workflow values such as “Proposed,”
“Accepted,” and “In Progress” that MOSS
assigns automatically to a Project Server 
proposal. In this way, you can monitor the state
of a proposal’s workflow; otherwise, proposals
and activity plans are the same.
If your organization doesn’t use MOSS, you can
still use workflow states for proposals; you
simply need to manually assign them.
For both proposals and activity plans, you can
set up tasks, identify them as milestones if
appropriate, and link the tasks to each other.
You also can attach a document to a proposal
or activity plan and even assign resources
using the Team Builder in Project Web Access.
When the time comes, you can convert both
activity plans and proposals into projects and
then use Project Professional and Project Web
Access to manage them.

When you’re connected to the Project Server database and you open a proj-

in the local cache; the local cache is new to Project 2007 and serves the 
purpose of improving performance when exchanging information between
Project Professional and the Project Server database. The Open dialog box
lists projects stored in the local cache. So, you won’t see any projects listed
in the Open dialog box until you’ve opened a project. And, the next time you
display the Open dialog box, that project will appear in the list, along with
the Retrieve the List of All Projects from Project Server item. See what we
mean about the chicken or the egg?
So, to open the original Project .mpp file, use the buttons on the left side of
the dialog box to navigate to the location where you stored the .mpp file on
your hard drive, click the file, and then click Open.
To view all the draft or published projects in the Project Server database,
double-click the Retrieve the List of All Projects from Project Server entry 
in the list. The Store options and Mode options at the bottom of the Open
dialog box affect both the projects that appear in the Open dialog box and
the way in which you can work with those projects, and these options work
together.
The Store options determine whether you open a draft version or a pub-
lished version of a project. When you select the Working option, draft proj-
ects appear in the Open dialog box. When you select the Published option,
published projects appear in the Open dialog box. By default, Project dis-
plays draft projects in the Open dialog box.

If you don’t see any difference between the two lists, all draft projects have
been published.
The Mode options, in combination with the Store options, determine whether
you can save changes to a project you open. When you select Working as the
Store option, you can choose either Read/Write or Read Only as the Mode
option. But, when you select Published as the Store option, you can select
only the Read Only option for the mode. That means that you can save
changes only to a project stored in the draft database, which is the default
database from which to open projects. To save changes to a published proj-
ect, make the changes to the draft project, save it, and then publish it.
So, why bother opening a published version if you want to change it? Well,
you can use a published version to create a draft version with which to
work. Open the published version, which will be a read-only copy, and then
save a draft version using the same filename as the published version.
You can use the same technique to create a local .mpp version of a draft or
published project. Open a draft or published project from the Project Server
database and, then choose File➪Save As. In the Save to Project Server dialog
box, click the Save as File button.
When you open a Web-based project, you check it out (Project Server term).
While a project is checked out, nobody else can open it in Project Profes-
sional and work on it. So, when you close the project, Project Professional
prompts you to check the project in, and you should check it in.
Managing the local cache
The local cache is new to Project 2007 and streamlines the process of updat-
ing the Project Server database with changes from Project Professional. You
can manage the local cache from Project Professional. Choose Tools➪Local
Project Cache➪Cache Settings to display the Cache Settings dialog box (see
Figure 3-7).

Choose Tools➪Local Project Cache➪View Status to view the status of
updates you sent to the Project Server database from the Status tab of the
Active Cache Status dialog box (see Figure 3-8). If errors occur, they’ll appear
on the Errors tab.
If you clean up the local cache, you can free up cache space and improve
performance between Project Professional and the Project Server database.
Choose Tools➪Local Project Cache➪Clean Up Cache to display the Clean Up

By default, Project displays projects in the local cache that aren’t checked
out to you; you can open the Project Filter list box and change the view to
projects that are checked out to you.
To remove a project from the cache, click it in the bottom portion of the
window and click Remove From Cache. When you finish, click the Close
button.
Adding Enterprise resources to a project
When you’re ready to add resources to a Web-based project, you can use the
Build Team dialog box to view the resources in the Enterprise Resource Pool
and assign them to your project. In Project Professional, choose Tools➪
Build Team from Enterprise. Project displays the Build Team dialog box (see
Figure 3-10).
By default, you see all resources you have permission to view, but you can
apply filters to limit the resources that you see. Use the Existing filters drop-
down list and click the plus sign (+) that appears next to Customize Filters to
choose fields by which to filter. Figure 3-10 shows the additional space for
selecting filters. You also can filter by available hours to work for a given
time period.
After you select resources and click OK, the resources appear on the
Resource Sheet of your project, and you can assign tasks to them. When you
republish your project, the Enterprise Resource Pool is updated to reflect
the assignments. At a minimum, the team members receive announcements

of new or updated assignments on the home page in Project Web Access. If
your organization chooses, team members may also receive e-mail notifica-
tions of assignments.
Replacing generic resources with real resources
Think of generic resources as job descriptions rather than people. When you
use a generic resource, you’re really using a set of skills, and it’s possible
that, in your organization, you have several people with the required skills.
So, you can take advantage of the Team Builder feature, which helps you
match the skills defined for a generic resource in your project to a real
resource that has the same skill set of the generic resource.
To use the Team Builder feature, your organization must create a custom
field with a value list where each value in the list represents a set of skills.
Then the outline code must be assigned to each resource in the Enterprise
Resource Pool, with the appropriate value from the value list selected, so
that each resource’s skill set is described. Project can then match generic
resources with specified skills to real resources in the Enterprise Resource
Pool with the same skills.
To replace generic resources with real resources, use the Team Builder to
filter the Enterprise Resource Pool so that it displays only those resources
that match the generic resource. Follow these steps:
1. In Project, open the published version of the project containing
generic resources that you want to replace.
2. Choose Tools➪Build Team from Enterprise.
Project displays the Build Team dialog box.
3. In the list on the right side of the dialog box, click the generic
resource for which you want to search for a replacement.
4. Click the Match button.
On the left side of the dialog box, Project displays those resources that
match the selected generic resource.
5. Click the resource that you want to use in your project from the list on
the left.
6. Click the Replace button.
Project replaces the resource in the Team Resource list with the
Enterprise resource that you selected.
7. Click OK.
Project also updates the project by replacing the generic resource with
the one that you selected.

Using the Resource Substitution Wizard
When you have available more than one resource that can do a particular
job, you want to try to set up work assignments so that you minimize over-
allocations. In a smaller environment, you probably know off the top of your
head that both John and Mary are qualified to do the job. So, you simply
review John’s schedule and Mary’s schedule to determine who has the most
time available for the assignment.
But, in a larger environment, with many resources and many projects, it’s
harder to determine who has the skills and the availability. But the Resource
Substitution Wizard can help you smooth assignments.
The Resource Substitution Wizard can use different criteria to substitute
resources. For example, the wizard can simply consider the resources in the
projects that you select and reallocate them to better utilize their time. Or,
the wizard can use the custom field that represents skill sets to match skills
required by resources that are already assigned to tasks and then substitute
other resources with the same skill set.
To run the Resource Substitution Wizard, open the project(s) for which you
want to substitute resources and choose Tools➪Substitute Resources. The
Resource Substitution Wizard begins.
As you walk through the wizard, you select the project(s) that you want the
wizard to consider — the wizard displays all open projects, and you select
the ones you want to use. You also select the resources for the wizard to
consider, and you specify options for the wizard to use, such as substituting
resources from the Enterprise Resource Pool or simply shuffling resources
already on the project.
After you run the wizard, a grid of proposed assignments that the wizard has
changed appears (see Figure 3-11). You can review the results, and if you
want, back up and change the wizard’s options to try again.
You can let Project update the projects with the wizard’s proposed changes.
Assigning resources using Project Web Access
As a resource manager, you might not have Project Professional, but you can
manage resources, including building a team for your project, using Project
Web Access. Log on to Project Web Access. In the Quick Launch pane on the
left side of the page, click Project Center. Then click the link of the project
for which you want to build a team. Project Web Access displays the Project
Details page for the project in the Project Center, which closely resembles
Gantt Chart view in Project Professional.

To begin building a team for a project, click the Build Team button above 
the list of tasks. On the left side of the Build Team page, Project Web Access
displays the list of resources that you have permission to view (see 
Figure 3-12). On the right side of the page, you see resources that already
work on your project.

Creating Status Report Layouts
678
In the list on the left, select the resources that you want to add to the project
and click the Add button. You can create a filter to find resources with speci-
fied skills by clicking the Settings button at the top of the page and choosing
Filter to display the area where you can use enterprise outline codes to
define and apply a filter.
You also can replace generic resources. Select the generic resource on the
right, and then click the Match button. On the left side of the page, Project
Web Access displays real resources with the same skills as the selected
generic resource. To replace the generic resource, select it on the right side
of the window and select the real resource that you want to use on the left
side of the window. Then click the Replace button.
You can view an availability graph of a resource before you add it to your proj-
ect. Place a check mark beside the resource in the list on the left and then
click the View Availability button. Project opens a separate page to display the
Resource Availability graph. You also can view the resource’s assignments by
placing a check mark beside the resource in the list on the left and then click-
ing the View Assignments button. Project Web Access again opens a separate
page that shows all the selected resources’ assignments.
To assign a resource, click the Save button on the Build Team page.
Creating Status Report Layouts
As a manager, you can use Project Web Access to create the layout for the
status report that you want to view from your team members. You can spec-
ify how often you want status reports, when reporting should begin, which
resources should report, and the sections you want included in the report.
To create a standard layout for a status report, log on to Project Web Access
and, in the Quick Launch pane, click the Status Reports link to display the
Status Reports page, which lists existing status report layouts and status
reports you need to submit.
Click the New button and then click New Request. The Status Report Request
page appears. On the top of the page, you assign a name to the status report,
establish a frequency and a start date, and identify the resources you want to
submit the report (see Figure 3-13).
At the bottom of the page, select the sections that should appear in the
report. You can create a new section by clicking the Insert Section button.
Project Web Access adds blank lines in which you type the section names.
Click Send when you finish, and Project Web Access creates the status

report and sends a skeleton of the status report to the selected team mem-
bers, requesting a status report. The team members can then use the skele-
ton to fill in the information that you want to see.
Receiving Task Updates from Team Members
If you approve the time reported by resources and you don’t use Project
Professional, you’ll see the number of task updates from resources that
await your approval when you log on to Project Web Access; the information
appears on the Project Web Access home page in the Approvals section.
To view the task updates, you can click the link in the Approvals section or
you can click Task Updates in the Approvals section of the Quick Launch
pane. The Task Updates page appears (see Figure 3-14).
Accept or reject any update by clicking in the leftmost column to select an
update. Then click the Accept button or the Reject button above the list of
updates. If, after reviewing updates, you want to accept all updates you
received, you can click the Select All button and then click the Accept button.

Project Server and Windows SharePoint Services
Windows SharePoint Services provides a way
for users to share information and collaborate.
As the foundation for Project Server, your organ-
ization might decide to take advantage of
Windows SharePoint Services to manage
issues, risks, and deliverables through Windows
SharePoint Services. In this case, the project
manager or the Project Server administrator can
create the Windows SharePoint Services work-
space for the project, where collaboration takes
place. Project workspaces appear at the bottom
of your home page.
Issues are unexpected things that occur on
projects. They might be problems, or they might
be opportunities. When they arise, you can
create an issue, let others on the team review
the issue, assign the issue to someone to
address, and monitor the progress of the issue.
Risks are possible events or conditions that
could negatively impact a project. Essentially,
a risk is an issue before it happens.
Deliverables are, typically, work products that
you deliver as a function of completing a task or
a project. Deliverables can be documents such
as financial reports or the birthday cake for the
CEO’s retirement party. Because the deliver-
ables of one project can affect another project,
deliverables need to be tracked and possibly
even linked to tasks. After you have published a
project and created a workspace for it, you can
set up its associated deliverables in Project
Professional and manage their dependencies.

You can set up rules to automatically accept changes from selected users for
selected projects. Click Task Update in the Quick Launch pane. Then click
the Actions button and choose Manage Rules.
Project managers can view updates and approve them in Project Web Access
or in Project Professional. When you open Project Professional, you see a
message indicating that updates are awaiting approval and asking whether
you want to review the updates. If you choose Yes, Project opens the project
and displays the updates in Project Professional using the same Task Updates
window that appears in Project Web Access. Using the information that
appears in the Project Guide pane on the left side of the screen, you can 
preview the updates, accept or reject the updates, and apply the updates 
to the plan.
Just like the Task Updates window that appears in both Project Web Access
and Project Professional, you can view the Project Web Access Project
Center and the Resource Center without leaving Project Professional. 
Open the Collaborate menu and choose either Project Center or Resource
Center.

T
he way in which you use Project Server and Project Web Access
depends on your role in the project. Chapters 2 and 3 of this minibook
describe how the Project Server administrator and the project and resource
manager use Project Server and Project Web Access, respectively. This
chapter describes how the team member uses Project Web Access to 
work with project tasks, submitting work information on either tasks or
timesheets and report status. You also read about how you can integrate
Outlook 2007 and Project Web Access to exchange project information
between these programs.
Understanding the Project Web Access Home Page
To log on to Project Server by using Project Web Access, you need the URL
for the Web database, and your project manager or the Project Server
administrator can give you the URL. In addition, if your organization uses
Forms authentication, you need the username and password that the
Project Server administrator set up for you.
If your organization uses Forms authentication, you see a page you use to
log on to Project Web Access after you type the URL. If your organization 
set up Project Server to use Windows user account logons, the logon page
doesn’t appear; instead, your Project Web Access home page appears 
immediately.

Understanding the Project Web Access Home Page
684
To log on to Project Server, open Internet Explorer and, in the Address box,
type the URL of the Web database.
Save the URL in your Favorites list, or if you use Project Web Access more
than any other Web page, set it up as your home page so that Project Web
Access appears when you open Internet Explorer.
The Project Web Access home page serves the same introductory function
as most home pages on the Web (see Figure 4-1). In the Reminders section,
you see summary information such as the number of new tasks that have
been assigned to you and the number of unsubmitted timesheets and over-
due status you have.
Use the Quick Launch pane that appears on the left side of the screen to 
navigate to other areas of Project Web Access and to Windows SharePoint
Services support tools for Project Server if your organization uses these
tools.

Customizing the Home Page
You can customize the appearance of your Project Web Access Home
page either temporarily or permanently by using the Web Part menu that
appears on the Home page beside each part. Each Web Part menu is a small
downward-pointing carat at the right edge of a section on the Home page;
in Figure 4-2, the mouse pointer is pointing at a Web Part menu.
To temporarily close a section of the Home page, click the section’s Web
Part menu and choose Minimize. To redisplay the information, click the
Web Part menu and choose Restore.
If you want to remove a section from the Home page on a more permanent
basis, click the Web Part menu and choose Close.
You can edit or add sections to the Home page. To edit a particular section,
click the section’s Web Part menu and choose Modify My Web Part. Project
Web Access displays the Home page in Edit Mode with the details of the sec-
tion you want to change appearing in the pane on the right side of the screen
(see Figure 4-3).
Figure 4-2:
You can

Customizing the Home Page
686
If you want to reorganize Home page elements, drag the title of a section to a
new location.
Make changes in the right pane and click OK at the bottom of the pane;
Project Web Access exits Edit Mode and redisplays your home page, incor-
porating the changes.
If you change your mind and don’t want to make any changes, click the Exit
Edit Mode command just above the right pane.
To add a Web part, click the Add a Web Part button in the area where you
want to add the Web part. For example, you can add a Web part above
Reminders or below Reminders; if you add a part below Reminders, you can
add it on the left, in the middle, or on the right side of the page. When you
click Add a Web Part, Project Web Access displays a dialog box showing you
the parts you can add (see Figure 4-4).

Working with Your Tasks
You can record work you’ve performed using either the My Tasks page or
the My Timesheets page; the difference between the methods is simply a
matter of focus. Using the My Tasks page (see Figure 4-5), which you display
by clicking My Tasks in the Quick Launch pane, you select tasks to record
work performed. Using the My Timesheets page, described later in this chap-
ter in the section “Working with Your Timesheet,” you select a timesheet and
then record work on tasks for the selected time period.
If you use the My Tasks page to record work, you can import the work values
to your timesheet by clicking the Import Tasks button on the My Timesheets
page.
You probably work on more than one project at a time, and you’ll see each of
your projects, indented, and each task assigned to you on the project. Beside
each project, you’ll see either a plus or a minus sign; you can click the symbol
to toggle between hiding and displaying the tasks for a particular project.

Recording time
If you click a task name, Project Web Access displays the Assignment Details
page (see Figure 4-6). From this page, you can see the details of the task,
including the planned work, and, if you scroll down the screen, any transac-
tion comments and task history, attachments, contacts, related assignments,
and notes.
Use the Attachments section to attach a document, an issue, or a risk to a
task.
Above the grid that displays planned, work, and overtime hours, a set of dates
with arrows pointing in either direction appears. Click the arrows to display
the timeframe that you want to update. Then click in the cell that represents
the intersection of the date that you worked and the type of hours you want to
record — typically work hours — and type the hours you want to record. Click
the Recalculate button to refresh the page. When you click Save, Project Web
Access saves your updates and redisplays the My Tasks page.
If you use the My Timesheets page to record work, you can import the work
values from your timesheet to tasks by clicking the Import Timesheet button
on the My Tasks page.

Saving a task update doesn’t send it to the project manager. The My Tasks
page provides a visual cue — an exclamation point beside the task title —
when you’ve recorded work but haven’t yet submitted the update. If you point
the mouse at the exclamation point, a tip appears, indicating that you haven’t
yet submitted the update. To submit the update, click in the leftmost column
beside the task to select it and then click the Submit Selected button. In the
Submit Changes dialog box that appears, you can type a comment to the proj-
ect manager. Click OK, and Project Web Access sends your updates.
You can send several task updates simultaneously without selecting them if
you click the Save All button.
Adding a task
Suppose that you discover that what you’re doing requires more work than 
the manager anticipated and probably calls for tasks that the manager didn’t
assign to you. If you have sufficient Project Web Access privileges, you can add
a task from the My Tasks page. Click the New button and choose Task. Project
Web Access displays the Add Task page, where you describe the new task (by
identifying the project associated with the task), supply a task name and esti-
mated start and end dates, and optionally add a comment about the task. If
you want, you can assign the task to yourself. When you finish, click the
Submit button and Project Web Access adds the task to your My Tasks page.

Select the Add Task to Timesheet check box to make the task appear on your
timesheet.
To notify the project manager about the additional work, you need to select
the task on the My Tasks page and click the Submit Selected button, or you
can click the Save All button, which submits all updates you’ve recorded in
the Task Center.
Working with Your Timesheet
You can record the time you work on tasks by using a timesheet. Timesheets
for appropriate periods appear on the My Timesheets page, which you can
see if you click the My Timesheets link in the Quick Launch pane (see
Figure 4-7).
If you don’t have any timesheets in progress, click the Click to Create link
beside the appropriate timesheet period. Otherwise, click the In Progress
link. Project Web Access displays the timesheet for the period you selected
(see Figure 4-8).
If your organization set up administrative time for you, it appears on the
timesheet, as do any tasks planned for the timesheet working period. Depend-
ing on your organization’s defaults, you might be able to view planned time
for the task. If you click the task name, you see the Assignment Details page
shown earlier in Figure 4-6.
Reassigning work
If you can’t possibly complete everything that
you’ve been assigned and as long as your
Project Web Access permissions permit, you
can reassign some of your tasks and keep your
project manager informed of the change in
assignments. On the My Tasks page, click the
Reassign Work button to display the Task
Reassignment page. On the line of the task you
want to reassign, in the last column, select a
resource. Provide a start date for the new task
and, if you want, any comments about the
assignment. Then click the Submit button.
When Project Web Access redisplays the My
Tasks page, the reassigned task still appears in
your task list, but it appears with a line drawn
through it. Select the task and click Submit
Selected or simply click Save All to send the
reassignment to your project manager. After
the project manager approves the reassign-
ment, the reassigned task appears on the My
Tasks page of the affected recipient and
remains on your My Tasks page, but you can
delete the task if your permissions allow you to
delete.

You can replace actual work values with planned work values for an entire
row. Select the task by clicking in the leftmost column. Then click the
Replace Actual with Planned button.
Finally, you can import work values you entered on the My Tasks page.
Select the task for which you want to import work values and click the
Import Task Progress button.
If you don’t see the tasks on which you need to report on your timesheet,
click the Add Lines button to add a new line to your timesheet.
You don’t typically finish recording all information on a timesheet at one
time. You can click the Save button on the Timesheet page to save your
entries but keep the timesheet available for further updating; you’ll want to
take this approach as long as your working dates fall in the period covered
by the timesheet. When the timesheet period no longer covers your working
period, click the Save and Submit button to save your work and submit your
timesheet for approval.
Administrative time
You can plan administrative time off from work if
you’re aware in advance that you need the time.
For example, suppose that you were just
selected for jury duty and you’re scheduled to
work on a project at the same time. From the My
Timesheets page, click the Plan Administrative
Time button to display the Administrative Time
dialog box. From the Category list, select the type
of administrative time, such as sick leave,
vacation, or jury duty, and, from the Period list,
select the appropriate period. Then, identify the
days and hours of planned or committed time.
To report actual administrative time that you
take, use the pre-established administrative
time tasks that appear on your timesheet; you
fill in these tasks the same way you report work
you performed on a task.

Integrating the Outlook Calendar 
with Project Web Access
If you use Outlook 2003 or later, you can get a better handle on all the things
you need to do by viewing them all in one place if your Project Server admin-
istrator has enabled Outlook integration. With Outlook integration enabled,
you can import assignments from Project Web Access to your Outlook calen-
dar. You can choose to import assignments automatically at regular inter-
vals, or you can import them when you choose. And, when you work on
tasks, you can record the information in Outlook and then upload the infor-
mation to Project Web Access.
You can exchange information between Project Web Access and either the
Outlook Task List or the Outlook Calendar.
You’ll notice some visual changes in Outlook if Outlook integration is set up.
The Project Web Access toolbar appears in the main window, and on the
Tools menu you see a menu for Project Web Access. In Figure 4-9, we’ve
moved the Project Web Access toolbar so that you can see it; it typically
appears anchored below the Standard toolbar.

click Yes. Then click the Install button and, when the integration finishes,
click OK.
You might need to edit your Project Web Access logon information in Outlook.
In Outlook, choose Tools➪Options. On the Project Web Access tab, click the
Advanced Options button. In the Advanced Options dialog box that appears,
click the Enter Login Information button to display the Enter Login Information
dialog box, where you supply the URL for your Project Server database and
select a connection method.
You have some choices about the way that updating occurs. By default, you
control all the information exchange, manually importing all assignments
from Project Web Access to the Outlook To-Do List and all updates from
Outlook to Project Web Access. You can import assignments to the Outlook
Calendar, choose to import for a specific time period, and set up the updat-
ing process to occur automatically by changing your Assignment Import set-
tings. In Outlook, choose Tools➪Options and then click the Project Web
Access tab (see Figure 4-10).

Sending Project Web Access assignments to Outlook
While you’re working in Outlook, you can launch Project Web Access by
choosing Tools➪Project Web Access➪Project Web Access Home Page.
When you have assignments in Project Web Access and you click the Import
New Assignments button on the Project Web Access taskbar in Outlook, you
see a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 4-11.
If you import the assignments to your calendar, they appear on your calen-
dar on the start date of the assignment, but not associated with a particular
time. If you import the assignments to the Outlook task list, they appear as
dated list items, and Outlook imports both the start and due dates of the
assignment.
Sending Outlook information to Project Web Access
You record work on a task that you imported to Outlook from Project Web
Access by double-clicking the task in Outlook to open a dialog box similar to
the one shown in Figure 4-12.
As you fill in time worked in the grid, Outlook saves the updates and updates
the status of the task, but you need to click the Save to Project Web Access
button to transfer your updates to Project Web Access. You can, simultane-
ously, submit the updates to the project manager if you leave the And
Submit to Project Manager check box selected. If you deselect this check
box, Outlook transfers the updates to your Project Web Access timesheet
but doesn’t send them to the project manager.

Reporting Status
696
Reporting Status
Your project manager sets up, in Project Web Access, a status report that
describes the information your project manager wants and the frequency
you should use to submit the information. These status reports encourage
collaboration and help things continue to run smoothly on your project.
You can create an issue or a risk if you’ve run into something unexpected
that you want to report; other team members, as well as your project man-
ager, can see and comment on the issue or risk. You can attach the issue to a
specific task or to the project in general.
Click the Status Reports link in the Quick Launch pane. The Status Reports
page lists status reports requested by your project manager.
To open and fill out the report, click the status report link; the Status Report
Response page looks like the page shown in Figure 4-13. If you need to
include information that doesn’t fit in any of the existing sections, you can
add a section at the bottom of the report. When you’re ready to submit the
report, click the Send button at the bottom of the page.

Glossary
Actual: The cost of the percentage of work that has been completed on a
task.
Actual Cost of Work Performed: See ACWP.
ACWP (Actual Cost of Work Performed): Cost of the actual, real work done
on a project to date, plus any fixed costs.
ALAP (As Late As Possible): A constraint put on a task’s timing to make the
task occur as late as possible in the project schedule, taking into account
any dependency relationships. See also dependency.
ASAP (As Soon As Possible): A constraint put on a task’s timing to make the
task occur as early as possible in the project schedule, taking into account
any dependency relationships. See also dependency.
BAC (Budget at Completion): The sum total of all costs involved in complet-
ing a task. See also baseline cost.
base calendar: The default calendar on which all new tasks are based,
unless a resource-specific calendar is applied.
baseline: The detailed project plan against which actual work is tracked.
baseline cost: The total planned costs for a project’s tasks, before any
actual costs are incurred.
BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed): Also called earned value, this
term refers to the value of work that has been completed. For example, a
task with $1,000 of costs accrues a baseline value of $750 when it’s 75 per-
cent complete.
BCWS (Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled): The percentage of the plan
that’s completed multiplied by the planned costs. This calculated value
totals a task’s completed work and its remaining planned costs.
booking type: A category for resources that specifies whether they are com-
mitted to the project or simply proposed to be involved.
budget at completion: See BAC.

budgeted cost of work performed
700
budgeted cost of work performed: See BCWP.
budgeted cost of work scheduled: See BCWS.
calendar: The various settings for hours in a workday, days in a workweek,
holidays, and nonworking days on which a project schedule is based. You
can set Project, Task, and Resource calendars.
Change Highlighting: A feature that highlights the most recent change you
make in your project and any other changes that action caused in your
schedule.
circular dependency: A timing relationship among tasks that creates an end-
less loop that can’t be resolved.
collapse: To close a project outline to hide subtasks from view.
combination view: A Project view with task details appearing at the bottom
of the screen.
constraint: A parameter that forces a task to fit a specific timing. For example,
a task can be constrained to start as late as possible in a project. Constraints
interact with dependency links to determine a task’s timing.
cost: The amount of money associated with a project task when you assign
resources, which are equipment, materials, or people with associated fees or
hourly rates.
Cost resource: A type of resource whose total cost doesn’t depend on the
amount of work on a task or the task’s duration. Airfare or lodging are exam-
ples of Cost resources.
critical path: The series of tasks that must occur on time for the overall proj-
ect to meet its finish date.
critical task: A task on the critical path. See also critical path.
crosstab: A report format that compares two intersecting sets of data. For
example, you can generate a crosstab report showing the costs of critical
tasks that are running late.
cumulative cost: The planned total cost to date for a resource’s effort on a
particular task. This calculation adds the costs already incurred on a task to
any planned costs remaining for the uncompleted portion of the task.

effort-driven
701
cumulative work: The planned total work of a resource on a particular task.
This calculation adds the work completed on a task to any planned work
remaining for the uncompleted portion of the task.
current date line: The vertical line in a Gantt chart indicating today’s date
and time. See also Gantt chart.
CV (Cost Variance): The difference between the baseline costs and the 
combination of actual costs to date and estimated costs remaining (sched-
uled costs). The cost variance is either positive (overbudget) or negative
(underbudget).
deadline date: A date you assign to a task that doesn’t constrain the task’s
timing. However, if a deadline date is assigned, Project displays an indicator
symbol if the task runs past the deadline.
demote: To move a task to a lower level in the project outline hierarchy.
dependency: A timing relationship between two tasks in a project.
dependency link: Causes a task either to occur before or after another task,
or to begin or end at some point during the life of the other task.
detail task: See subtask.
duration: The amount of calendar time it takes to complete a task.
duration variance: The difference between the planned (baseline) task dura-
tion and the current estimated task duration, based on activity to date and
any remaining activity still to be performed.
EAC (Estimate at Completion): The total planned cost for resource effort on
a specific task. This calculation combines the costs incurred to date with
costs estimated for a task’s remaining work.
earned value: A reference to the value of work completed. A task with $1,000
of associated costs has a baseline value of $750 when it’s 75 percent com-
plete. See also BCWP.
earned-value cost variance: See CV.
effort-driven: A type of task that requires an assigned amount of effort to be
completed. When you add resources to an effort-driven task, the assigned
effort is distributed among the task resources equally.

elapsed duration
702
elapsed duration: An estimate of how long it will take to complete a task.
enterprise custom fields: Custom fields stored in a global file; these fields
can be used to standardize Project plan content across an organization.
enterprise resources: A feature that allows you to save all resource informa-
tion for resources used across an organization in one location.
estimated duration: A setting that indicates that you’re using a best guess of
a task’s duration. When you enter an estimated duration for a task, a ques-
tion mark appears next to the duration in the Duration column. You can also
apply a filter to displays only tasks with estimated duration, which reflects
the fact that they have questionable timing.
exception: A specified date or date range that isn’t governed by the default
working time calendar.
expand: To open a project outline to reveal both summary tasks and subtasks.
expected duration: An estimate of the actual duration of a task, based on
work performance to date.
external task: A task in another project. You can set links between tasks in
your project and external tasks.
finish date: The date on which a project or task is estimated to be completed.
finish-to-finish relationship: A dependency relationship in which the finish
of one task determines the finish of another task.
finish-to-start relationship: A dependency relationship in which the finish of
one task determines the start of another task.
fixed cost: A cost that doesn’t increase or decrease based on the time a
resource spends on a task. A consultant’s fee or permit fee are examples of
fixed costs.
fixed date: A task that must occur on a certain date. Fixed-date tasks don’t
move earlier or later in the schedule because of dependency relationships.
fixed duration: The length of time required to complete a task remains con-
stant no matter how many resources are assigned to the task. A half-day
seminar is an example of a fixed-duration task.

milestone
703
fixed-unit: A type of cost for which the resource units are constant; if you
change the duration of the task, resource units don’t change. This is the
default task type.
fixed-work: A type of task for which the number of resource hours assigned
to the task determine its length.
float: See slack.
Gantt chart: A standard Project view that displays columns of task informa-
tion alongside a chart that shows task timing in bar chart format.
gap: See lag.
generic resources: A type of resource that allows you to make skill-based
assignments based on a skill/code profile.

costs or other factors.
ID number: The number automatically assigned to a task by Project based
on its vertical sequence in the project list.
indent: To move a task to a lower level of detail in the project’s outline 
hierarchy.
lag: The amount of downtime that can occur between the end of one task
and the beginning of another. Lag is built into a dependency relationship
between tasks when you indicate that a certain amount of time must pass
before the second task can begin.
leveling: A calculation used by Project that modifies resource work assign-
ments for the purpose of resolving resource conflicts.
linking: (1) To establish a connection between tasks in separate schedules
so that task changes in the first schedule are reflected in the second. (2) To
establish dependencies among project tasks.
Material resources: The supplies or other items used to complete a task
(one of three resource categories; the other categories are Cost and Work
resources).
milestone: A task of zero duration, which marks a moment in time or an
event in a schedule.

to work on any task in a project.
outdent: To move a task to a higher level in a project’s outline hierarchy.
outline: The structure of summary and subtasks in a project.
overallocation: When a resource is assigned to spend more time on a single
task or a combination of tasks occurring at the same than that resource’s
work calendar permits.

resource leveling to resolve project conflicts, priority is a factor in the level-
ing calculation. A higher-priority task is less likely than a lower-priority task
to incur a delay during the leveling process. See also resource leveling.
progress lines: Gantt Chart View bars that overlap the baseline taskbar and
allow you to compare the baseline plan with a task’s tracked progress.
project: A series of tasks that achieves a specific goal. A project seeks to
meet the triple requirements of timeliness, quality, and budget.
project calendar: The calendar on which all new tasks are based; the built-in
project calendars are Standard, 24 Hour, or Night Shift, though you can
create custom calendars.

rolled up into a higher-level summary task. Also called a subordinate task.
See also roll up.
successor: One task in a dependency relationship, in which there is always a
predecessor (often, but not always the earlier task) and a successor (often,
but not always, the later task). See also dependency.
summary task: In a project outline, a task that has subordinate tasks. A sum-
mary task rolls up the details of its subtasks and has no timing of its own.
See also roll up.
task: An individual step performed to reach a project’s goal.
template: A format in which a file can be saved. The template saves ele-
ments such as calendar settings, formatting, and tasks. New project files can
be based on a template to save the time involved in reentering settings.
timescale: The area of Gantt Chart view that displays units of time; when
