FOREWORD

n the preface to his lyric drama “Hellas”
(1821), written the year before he died, the
poet Percy Bysshe Shelley declared to readers
throughout the English-speaking world that:
“We are all Greeks. Our laws, our literature, our
religion, our arts, have their root in Greece.” For
citizens of the West, Shelley’s statement is as true
now as it was then. Take, for example, the evi-
dence from our everyday language. Nouns in
common usage such as “democracy,” “tragedy,”
“odyssey,” “tyrant,” “theater,” and “poet,” as well
as the adjectives “spartan,” “stoic,” “comic,”
“olympic,” “epic,” and “platonic,” testify to the
enduring influence of the Hellenic past.
At no time in recent history have the peoples
of Europe and of Western civilization in general
been as engaged as they are today in areas of the
globe that were involved for centuries in repeat-
ed conflicts and continuous cultural exchange
with the Greeks. Scarcely a day passes in which
an event in the Near East, western Asia, or South
Asia does not make up some aspect of the daily
news cycle. Looking back to the last century, the
British invasion of Iraq during the Anglo-Iraqi
War in May 1941 marked the first time since
Alexander the Great’s siege of the island city Tyre
in 333 BCE that armed forces of any nation had
marched east from the eastern shores of the
Mediterranean Sea to the Mesopotamian city of
Babylon. That invasion occurred roughly 70
years ago. How little the world changes!
Covering the major periods of Greek histo-
ry, Ancient Greece:An Illustrated History brings the
past alive to a new generation of students and
gives them the background needed to interpret
current circumstances. Such background is sore-
ly needed, for the past has always served as the
prologue to the future. Beginning with a survey
of Stone Age culture from the Paleolithic era and
a study of the life of the island peoples inhabit-
ing Crete and the Cyclades, this book then
introduces its readers to the Bronze Age warrior
culture populated by the men and women who
were made immortal by the poet Homer in the
Iliad: Agamemnon, Helen, Hector, and Achilles,
among others.When the Mycenaean hegemony
fell apart, there followed a prolonged period of
decline, from whose ruins rose a system of city-
states such as those of Sparta, Corinth, Thebes,
and Athens. These cities in turn created eco-
nomic engines, forms of art and architecture,
structures of government, techniques of diplo-
macy, methods of warfare, and systems of philos-
ophy, religion, and law that are now applied
worldwide. The successes, failures, biases, and
shortcomings of these systems remain of great
consequence to us. The warning made by the
Greek historian Herodotus to his audience in
the fifth century BCE still pertains: the divinities
who sanction prosperity will just as frequently
destroy it.
Over time, this pan-Hellenic network of
Greek-speaking city-states absorbed and was
itself absorbed by neighboring cultures. The 
network became truly multicultural as it spread
westward throughout the Mediterranean region
into Sicily, portions of Italy, southern France,
and the Iberian Peninsula,southward into Africa,
4

and eastward as far as the Hindu Kush and
northern India—where Alexander the Great
made the final thrusts of his military campaign.
Alexander’s death in Babylon in 323 BCE
marked the beginning of the Hellenistic Age.
It may indeed be no exaggeration to say that we
are still living in the Hellenistic Age, because 
the Greek cultural diffusion, quickened by
Alexander’s wide reach and later extended by
the Romans and the Byzantines, has not yet
ended.
Ancient Greece:An Illustrated History has many
merits and is a commendable asset to the 21st-
century classroom. Its prose is clear and well-
paced, and its pagination and format are visually
attractive. In addition to the neat summations of
information arranged in time lines and the valu-
able details of geography conveyed by the vol-
ume’s many maps, a positive boon is the book’s
illustrations.
The images are large, mostly in color, and
their varied arrangement—depicting actual 
artifacts as well as presenting modern views of
ancient sites—sustains the reader’s interest.
Instructors will enjoy teaching from this book
and students who learn from it will come away
with a strong sense that “the glory that was
Greece,” vis-à-vis Edgar Allan Poe’s poem “To
Helen” (1845), is no frothy sentiment of poetic
hyperbole,but in fact an assertion well worth the
scrutiny and analysis of every generation.

FOREWORD

BRONZE AGE 
GREECE 
I
n the third millennium BCE, a relatively sophisticated culture
grew up on both the Greek mainland and the surrounding
islands. In particular, the inhabitants of the Cyclades began to
produce beautiful works of sculpture.
Greece consists of mainland Greece on
the Balkan Peninsula and a mass of
islands, large and small, scattered over the
Aegean Sea and extending as far south as
Crete in the Mediterranean.The climate
is volatile, with extreme fluctuations in
temperature, strong winds, and sudden
downpours of torrential rain. The main
agricultural products are olives, grapes,
and figs. In ancient times, both cattle and
horses were grazed in the eastern central
regions of mainland Greece.
Greece in the Stone Age
There is evidence of Stone Age hunters
living in mainland Greece in the
Paleolithic Age, and by the seventh mil-
lennium BCE it seems that farming
communities were established. These
early farmers lived in villages of circular
mud huts, grew grains, peas, and lentils,
and kept animals, such as pigs, cattle,
goats, and sheep, for meat and milk.The
farmers supplemented their diet by
hunting and fishing and made stone tools
such as axes and chisels.By the end of the
Neolithic Age, people were living in
walled towns, in which some large hous-
es had a central hall—indicating that
some individuals had now become
wealthier than others, or had even
become chieftains.
On the mainland, metalworking
invaders arrived in the first part of the
third millennium BCE. In addition to a
knowledge of bronze, the invaders intro-
duced the swing-plow, which greatly
improved farming methods. The period
between around 2800 and 2600 BCE
(called Early Helladic I) was a time of
great change. Walled hilltop villages
appeared, with a chief who ruled over
the surrounding farmland. Trading with
other communities, some of them over-
seas, led to the emergence of a wealthy
class, who built their houses of stone
rather than mud bricks. Along with the
rise of this merchant class came the
craftsman class and the use of symbols to
mark goods and seal containers.
During the period called Early
Helladic II (c. 2600–2100 BCE), this civ-
ilization peaked, building settlements
surrounded by towering stone walls and
containing houses with several rooms.
Excavations at Lerna have uncovered
what was probably an important civic
building, the massive House of Tiles,
which was built two stories high with a
balcony on the upper story. The house
takes its modern name from a number of
small, flat tiles of baked clay that were
found in its ruins. The tiles may have
covered a sloping roof and are thought to
be the earliest roof tiles ever discovered.
From 2100 BCE onward, successive
waves of hostile migrants from central
Asia swept through the Balkan Peninsula

and destroyed most of the fortified
towns. In their place, the invaders built
dwellings of more primitive, one-storied,
houses.The invaders brought with them
a new kind of pottery, which was made
on a wheel and whose angular shapes
seemed to imitate metal pots. This pot-
tery was first discovered by the German
archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who
uncovered it in the late 19th century CE
when he was excavating at Orchomenus,
a city in Boeotia that rose to prominence
in the Mycenaean era. Schliemann
named both the pots and the people who
had produced them Minyan. These
Minyans spoke an Indo-European lan-
guage and have since come to be consid-
ered the first Greeks.

BRONZE AGE GREECE

The Cyclades get their name from
the Greek word kyklos, meaning “circle,”
because they are arranged roughly in a
circle around the island of Delos, which
was considered sacred to the god Apollo
(see box, page 11).The islands have been
inhabited since very early times.There is
evidence of settlements on the larger
islands, such as Kythnos, Mykonos,
Naxos, and Milos, dating from the sixth
millennium BCE.
These early Neolithic settlers proba-
bly came from southwestern Anatolia
(present-day Turkey), and as they were
seafaring people, they settled near the
coasts on the chosen islands.The settlers
grew barley and wheat, raised pigs, sheep,

This gold goblet
dates to around
2100 BCE, an 
era known to
archaeologists 
as the Early 
Helladic II period.
The invaders eventually integrated
with the indigenous inhabitants and
learned from them seafaring skills that
had been notably lacking. The general
level of culture remained low, however,
for the Minyans. They lived in simple
“long houses” arranged in villages, and
some of the villages were enclosed 
within walls.
Island cultures
Prior to the Early Helladic I period on
the Greek mainland, another culture had
started to develop on the Cycladic
islands. Located in the southwestern
Aegean Sea, the Cyclades are a group 
of more than 30 major islands formed
from the peaks of mountain ranges sub-
merged long ago. The islands are rocky
and volcanic and are rich in miner-
als such as gold, silver, obsidian, and 
marble, as well as the ores of lead, iron,
and copper.

and goats, and caught fish, particularly
tuna, in the Aegean. There is evidence
from some excavated sites that these peo-
ple were familiar with copperworking
from around 4000 BCE.
Cycladic art
From around 3000 BCE, the Cycladic
islanders began to develop a distinct cul-
ture of their own. They became expert 
at carving small, elegant figurines in 
the pure white marble that they found
on the islands of Paros and Naxos.
Archaeologists have discovered these
statuettes in burial chambers.To achieve
a smooth surface, the figures were
rubbed with emery stones, a dark, very
hard rock that the sculptors obtained
from Naxos. Details were then often
picked out in red and blue paint.
The figurines are extremely distinc-
tive in their style. To begin with, they
almost always portray women rather than
men.The elongated figures stand upright
with the head tilted back, while the arms
are usually folded across the chest, with
the left arm above the right.The legs and
feet touch one another.The statues vary
in size enormously; the smallest are only
2 inches (5 cm) tall, while the largest are
almost life-size.
Archaeologists are unsure about the
purpose of these statuettes. Because
many of these figurines were found in

tombs, and because the form was usually
female, it is thought they may represent
goddesses who would protect the dead.
They could also have been votive fig-
ures (objects of prayer).
The first modern discoveries
of Cycladic figurines were made
in the 1880s CE. In the early 20th
century CE, the statuettes became 
fashionable with art collectors who
admired them for their purity and
simplicity of form.
Cultural developments
This Early Cycladic era is divided
into two separate periods: Early
Cycladic I (c. 3200–2700 BCE) and
Early Cycladic II (c. 2700–2400
BCE), based on significant burial-site
finds at Grotta-Pelos and Keros-Syros,
respectively. Besides the female figurines,
other artifacts found in tombs of this
Early Cycladic period include a seated
male marble figure, depicted playing a
musical instrument, plus items such as
bowls, bottles, and vases. Because the
quality and quantity of goods vary from
grave to grave, archaeologists believe that

different levels of society were beginning
to be seen on the Cyclades at this time.
As well as the beautiful white marble
of the Cyclades, another substance of
benefit to the whole region was obsidi-
an. This black, glassy volcanic rock was
found on Milos and was prized for mak-
ing knives or scraping tools. The
islanders were able to profit by trading
in obsidian.
Moving inland
A significant shift in the population of
the Cyclades took place around 2500
BCE.The communities that had been
living in simple villages close to the
coasts to facilitate their fishing activities
started to move into the central parts of
the islands and to build citadels,
making the people less vulnera-
ble to attack. One particular
citadel, found at Kastri on
Syros, was encircled by a wall
with six towers.
From around 2000 BCE, the
grave goods become more
sophisticated, and it is thought
that the Cycladic islanders may
have had contact with, and been
influenced by, the Minoan civiliza-
tion that was developing on the
nearby island of Crete. In more than
500 tombs excavated near Kastri,
terra-cotta, marble, and gold vessels
have been found, along with pins
made of bronze and silver that were
probably used to fasten garments.
The fact that these pins are engraved
with designs also found in Egypt and
mainland Greece suggests that the
Cycladic islanders were regularly trad-
ing with those countries.
Volcanic eruption
Some time around 1500 BCE (or possi-
bly earlier; see box, page 12), a volcano
on the southerly island of Thera (present-
day Santorini) erupted with cataclysmic
results. Ash and volcanic debris
rained down on Thera and the sur-
rounding islands.The explosion was
so violent that it actually split Thera
into several pieces, resulting in one
large island and several smaller ones;
much of the original island disap-
peared into the sea. Volcanic debris
was lifted high into the atmosphere
and deposited thousand of miles away.
One town that was devastated by
the eruption was Akrotiri. As the vol-
The island of Delos figures in many Greek legends.The
very creation of the island was the subject of a myth.
Poseidon, the god of the sea, together with Zeus, king of
the gods, was supposed to have used
columns made of diamonds to secure
an enormous rock to the sea bed; this
rock became Delos. Delos was des-
tined to be the birthplace of the
moon goddess Artemis and her twin
brother, the sun god Apollo, who was
also the god of poetry and music and
is often depicted holding a lyre (a form
of small harp).
When the Ionians occupied the
Cyclades, they designated the
island of Delos as their reli-
gious capital, because they
believed themselves to be
descended from Apollo. By
the eighth century BCE, a large
religious festival dedicated to
Apollo was being held annually
on Delos.

Cycladic art is highly distinctive.This
statuette from around 2600 BCE depicts a
woman standing with her arms folded.

12
ANCIENT GREECE
T
he volcanic eruption on the island of Thera
was one of the major events to occur in the
Mediterranean region in the second millennium
BCE.Ash from the explosion was thrown so far
into the sky that some of it has been found in
Greenland and North America.The eruption
would have caused huge tidal waves to crash into
other Aegean islands, including Crete, which is
why the aftereffects of the explosion have some-
times been blamed for the downfall of the
Minoan civilization.
Traditionally, the date of the Thera eruption has
been placed at around 1500 BCE.That date was
originally put forward in 1939 because pottery
found buried by the eruption on Thera closely
resembled Egyptian pottery from 1500 BCE. For
several decades, this theory was acknowledged to
be true. However, from the 1970s onward,
archaeologists increasingly began to dispute the
date, as radiocarbon evidence began to suggest
that the disaster may have occurred much earlier,
around 1625 BCE.
In 2006, a new theory was proposed in an article
published in the magazine Science. Research by
Danish geologist Walter Friedrich suggested that
the eruption occurred between 1627 and 1600
BCE. Friedrich’s conclusion was based on radio-
carbon dating of an olive branch that was buried
in the lava. Friedrich’s theory did not settle the
argument, however.While many geologists and
archaeologists have supported his claims, others
have questioned his findings.
The island of
Santorini, called
Thera in ancient
times, is now a
popular tourist
destination.

cano exploded, enormous boulders came
crashing down on the town and the 
sky darkened with ash. Next, tons of
molten lava engulfed the hapless town,
which was buried under 16 feet 
(5 m) of debris and so preserved almost
intact, rather like the later Roman town
of Pompeii.
Cycladic life
When the town of Akrotiri, on Thera,
was eventually excavated, it gave a very
clear picture of what life was like in the
Cyclades before around 1500 BCE.The
people lived in houses consisting of sev-
eral rooms, arranged on either two or
three stories. The narrow streets of the
town were equipped with a simple
drainage system for removing sewage.
The houses contained wooden furniture
and pottery and, on the ground floor,
large earthenware jars for storing food-
stuffs such as grain, vegetables, dried fish,
wine, and oil.
One room in each house was
arranged as a shrine and decorated with
wall paintings (frescoes) showing land-
scapes with animals, birds, and flowers
such as lilies and crocuses. In other hous-
es excavated at Phylakope on Milos, fres-
coes have been found depicting battles,
festivals, and, in one famous painting, a
school of flying fish.
Because no human remains have
been found at Thera, it is thought that
the inhabitants may have had time to
escape, but where they went is a mystery.
Another mystery linked to Thera is that
of the lost world of Atlantis, which was
the subject of later Greek legends. It has
been thought that these legends may
refer to Thera.
End of Cycladic culture
From around 1500 BCE, the Cyclades
came increasingly under the influence of
the Mycenaeans on mainland Greece,and
Cycladic culture was gradually absorbed
into that of the Mycenaeans.The Cyclades
were also in contact with the Phoenicians,
who visited the islands to trade for pre-
cious metals. By around 1000 BCE, the
Cycladic culture had completely disap-
peared. Most of the islands had been set-
tled by Ionians from Anatolia, while
Dorians from northwestern Greece had
occupied Milos and Thera.

This mosaic depicts the Greek hero Theseus
killing the Minotaur.According to legend, the
Minotaur lived in a maze on Crete.
THE
MINOANS
T
he Minoan culture, which flourished on Crete between around
2500 and 1450 BCE, was one of the first major cultures to
emerge in Europe. Much of what is known about the Minoans has
been gained through excavations at Knossos.
In the spring of 1900 CE,there was great
excitement on the island of Crete in the
Mediterranean Sea. British archaeologist
Arthur Evans and his team had just
unearthed the first signs of a sophisticat-
ed Bronze Age civilization on the island.
The excavations were centered on a large
mound, called Kephala (or Knossos), in
the north of the island. Local legend had
it that this was the site of a great palace
belonging to the mythical King Minos.
According to the legend, Minos’s palace
was home to a monster known as the
Minotaur, which lived in a labyrinth and
devoured young men and women as sac-
rificial victims (see box, page 20).
The first finds were fragments of pot-
tery decorated with images of sea crea-
tures such as starfish,dolphins,sea urchins,
and octopuses.The subject matter of the
designs suggested that the pottery was
produced by a seagoing people. Even
more exciting were the fragments of a
wall painting that showed a man in a
loincloth carrying a vase. Similarly
clothed figures had been painted on the
walls of ancient Egyptian tombs, where
they were identified as the Keftiu (island
people) paying tribute to the pharaoh. It
seemed that the Cretans and the Keftiu
could have been one and the same.
Very soon, evidence of walls, floors,
and columns came to light, indicating
the presence of an enormous palace
extending over 6 acres (2.4 ha). Evans
named it the Palace of Minos (see box,
page 18). The 1,400 rooms, which
included ceremonial chambers, were
connected by corridors and staircases,
and many of the walls were decorated
with elaborate paintings showing young
men and women and more sea creatures.
There were also paintings of bulls, sug-
gesting that the palace was indeed the
source of the Minotaur legend.
The site that Evans had discovered
was the center of a Bronze Age culture
that flourished on Crete from around
2500 to 1450 BCE. It was the first
sophisticated civilization to develop in
Europe; it was a civilization centered on
trade and an efficient bureaucracy, and
unlike most other early civilizations, it
seemed entirely unwarlike. Prior to the
Minoans (as Evans called these people),
life on Crete had been primitive.
The Neolithic period
Before around 6000 BCE, Crete may
have been uninhabited, but in the sixth
millennium BCE, groups of people 
from Anatolia settled in mainland Greece
and on Crete, bringing with them a
knowledge of farming. These early

Cretan settlers found a large island (the
fifth largest in the Mediterranean) with
mountains covered in trees and a large
fertile plain in the center.The warm cli-
mate made it a favorable
area for growing crops.
The farmers grew 
barley, oats, and
wheat, as well
as pulses and
peas. They kept
goats, sheep, cattle, and pigs
and supplemented their diet by
hunting and fishing.They fashioned pots
out of clay by hand and made axes and
chisels from stones that they ground to
a sharp edge.
The Bronze Age
Around 3000 BCE, people living in
the region of the Aegean discovered
how to make bronze by mixing cop-
per with tin, so beginning the peri-
od known as the Bronze Age.
The people living on Crete in the
early Bronze Age built houses of
mud bricks.The houses had sepa-
rate living rooms, kitchens, and
workrooms.The Cretans became
skilled metalworkers, producing
beautiful jewelry in gold and 
silver.
At the same time that the
Minoan civilization was devel-
oping on Crete, other cultures
were developing in different parts
of the Mediterranean region. One cul-
ture arose on a group of islands in the
Aegean called the Cyclades. The early
inhabitants of the Cyclades are most
famous for the finely wrought figurines
that they carved out of stone.The Greek
mainland saw the rise of another culture,
the Helladic, which in its later stages was
known as the Mycenaean civilization.
When Arthur Evans was excavating
the palace at Knossos,he divided Minoan
history up into three main periods:
Early Minoan (3000–2000)
BCE),
Middle Minoan 
(2000–1600 BCE), and 
Late Minoan (1600–1050
BCE). However, other
historians have chosen
to divide Minoan his-
tory into three alternate periods
spanning a shorter time: First Palace
(1900–1700 BCE), Second Palace (1650–
1540 BCE), and Third Palace (1450–
1200 BCE).
During the Early Minoan period, the
Minoans started to use bronze to make
metal tools such as daggers, adzes, and
double-headed axes. They grew olives
and grape vines and traded the resulting
olive oil and wine with neighboring
peoples in the Aegean, taking to the sea
in ships propelled by a combination of
oars and square sails attached to masts.
The Minoans used seals to stamp
impressions on wet clay, possibly to seal
storage jars to guard against theft.
They also began building extensive
settlements, although few traces of
them now remain.
The age of the palaces
It was in the Middle Minoan
period that the Minoans started
to build great palaces at sites such as
Knossos, Phaistos, Mallia, and Zakro.
These palaces consisted of a complex of
buildings surrounding a large open court
and the main royal residence.The build-
ings, which served as the island’s admin-
istrative center, included workshops for
craftsmen and artisans, plus special stor-
age rooms for oil, wine, grain, and other
farming produce.
The first palaces have disappeared
almost completely, but there have been
numerous smaller finds from this period.

This ivory figurine was found in the
palace at Knossos. It dates to around the
17th century BCE.

17
THE MINOANS
One of the most striking of these finds is
a type of thin-walled pottery called
Kamares ware, which was produced on a
potter’s wheel and decorated with spirals
and plant motifs in red, orange, yellow,
and white on a blue-black background.
This refined pottery was crafted by spe-
cialized potters both for the domestic
market and for export.
A collection of small plaques found 
in the palace at Knossos gives a good 
idea of the architecture of this period.
The plaques are made of faience (a fine
grade of pottery covered with a glaze)
and depict city houses built of stone,
bound together with large wooden
beams. All the houses have a least two
floors and a flat roof, and many appear to
have a small central court that possibly
served as an air and light shaft. Some of
the houses are shown with window
openings painted bright red, which
might indicate that the early inhabitants
of Crete used oiled parchment as an early
type of windowpane.
The palace at Knossos
Around 1700 BCE, all the Minoan
palaces were destroyed, either by earth-
quakes or invaders. They were all soon
rebuilt, however. The new palace at
Knossos became even more elaborate
than its predecessor, with at least three
stories and many rooms, including a
magnificent throne room. The kings of
Knossos reached the peak of their power

T
he Palace of Minos excavated by Arthur Evans
at Knossos is one of the most fascinating
archaeological sites of the ancient world.The site
covers a vast area around 3 miles (5 km) from
the north coast of Crete, and it is thought that as
many as 30,000 people lived and worked there 
in its heyday.
Digging down, Evans discovered a palace five sto-
ries high in places, with the floors connected by a
grand staircase.The whole palace was skillfully
designed to let light in and allow air to circu-
late—and to protect the occupants from the
fierce summer heat. In winter, the doors would be
closed so that fireplaces could provide warmth.
One very grand room was the throne room,
which opened off the central courtyard. Inside
was a stately throne carved out of gypsum and
backed by a colorful mural depicting griffins (a
kind of mythical animal). Evans thought that this
room might have been used by the king to
receive visitors, although others have suggested it
might have been used for religious ceremonies.
The eastern side of the palace contained the
royal apartments.The king’s room was a large
double room with a light well at one end and a
veranda facing east. Motifs of double axes were
carved on stone blocks found in the room, and
for this reason it was named the Hall of the
Double Axes.The queen’s hall was decorated with
paintings of dolphins and a dancing girl. It con-
tained a bathroom in one corner, with an earth-
enware bathtub that was probably filled by ser-
vants.A hole in the floor leading to the drains
made emptying it simple. In an adjoining room,
there was a toilet.This was simply a hole in a
stone slab with a drain beneath that carried the
waste away to a stream.
As well as these grand rooms, there was a multi-
tude of smaller rooms, all connected by corridors
and staircases, together with vast numbers of
underground storage rooms for the goods
brought in from the surrounding countryside.The
palace was a hive of activity. In addition to the
king, queen, and nobles, there were priests, store-
keepers, accountants and scribes, plus many ser-
vants and slaves. In the workshops around the
palace, there were craftspeople such as jewelers,
painters, potters, and carpenters busily plying
their trade to produce the wonderful artifacts of
the Minoan culture.
A pithos, or storage jar, stands amid the excavated 
ruins of the palace at Knossos.The palace complex at
Knossos contained many storage rooms that would
have contained pithoi such as this. Pithoi were
usually used as containers for wine and olive oil.
THE PALACE OF MINOS

THE MINOANS
between around 1550 and 1500 BCE,
dominating the Aegean region and trad-
ing extensively with the Greek mainland,
the Aegean islands, Anatolia (present-day
Turkey), Egypt, and the Canaanite 
Syrian coast.
The basic plan at Knossos—which
was echoed in the other palaces—was
that of a large central courtyard sur-
rounded by reception halls, living quar-
ters, workshops, and storerooms. The
palace was not protected by fortifica-
tions, and its western side looked out
over wide agoras (public courtyards used
for ceremonies and gatherings). The
whole palace was supplied with water
through an elaborate system of pipes,
while drains and conduits removed waste
water and sewage from the site. The
storerooms at Knossos are particularly
striking. They were long, narrow base-
ment rooms containing rows of enor-
mous storage jars called pithoi in which
grain, oil, and wine were kept.
Social structure
Minoan society was divided into several
regions and groups. Presiding over the
country as a whole was the king. Below
the king were the nobles, who were
provincial rulers living in country man-
sions. A group of officials controlled the
operations of the merchants, who con-
tributed to the region’s wealth through
trade. In particular, merchants supplied
imported materials such as ivory to the
craftsmen who lived and worked in the
palace. Below these classes came the
farmers, who produced the agricultural
goods that were so important for the

ANCIENT GREECE
This drinking
vessel made in the
shape of a bull’s
head was found at
Knossos. It was made
between around 1900
and 1400 BCE.
According to Greek mythology, the
god Poseidon sent a snow-white bull
to King Minos of Crete, intending
that the king should sacrifice the bull
to Poseidon.When Minos refused 
to do this, Poseidon, in revenge,
made Pasiphaë, the wife of Minos
and queen of Crete, fall in love with
the bull.As a result of this affair, she
bore a child—a monster with a
human body and a bull’s head—
that was called the Minotaur.
To keep the Minotaur
safe, Minos commis-
sioned the architect
Daedalus to build a
labyrinth so complex
that nobody could find
the way through it.When
the maze was complet-
ed, the Minotaur was
locked inside.
When the son of Minos was mur-
dered by the king of Athens, Minos
demanded that every nine years
Athens should send seven young
men and seven young women to
Minos in compensation.These 
young people were fed to the
Minotaur. Finally, the Athenian hero
Theseus decided to put an end to
this practice. He offered himself as
one of the victims and sailed with
the others to Crete.Ariadne, the
daughter of Minos, fell in love with
Theseus and offered to help him
escape his fate. She gave him a ball
of thread, which he tied to the
entrance to the maze and unwound
as he went.At the center of the
maze, he found the Minotaur asleep
and killed him.Then, with the help
of the thread,Theseus made his
escape, together with the intended
victims he had rescued.
THE LEGEND OF THE MINOTAUR
Minoans’ wealth.There was also a class of
scribes, who were kept busy recording
stocks of produce on clay tablets.
The Minoans had a highly developed
religious life, and many priests and
priestesses lived in the palaces. Rather
than building temples to their gods, the
Minoans held religious ceremonies in
their houses, at hilltop shrines, or in 
special rooms in the palaces. Many gods
and goddesses were worshipped, but it
seems that one goddess, the mother (or
earth) goddess, was supreme. She watch-
ed over animals and plants and symbol-
ized fertility. Every year, she married a
young god who died when winter came
around but who came back to life in the

spring. Another important goddess was
the snake goddess. Usually portrayed
holding a snake in each hand, she was
seen as the guardian of the house.
Many replicas of bull’s horns carved
in stone have been found in Crete, sug-
gesting that the bull played an important
part in some religious cult.There are also
several wall paintings that show young
men and women somersaulting over a
charging bull. This sport possibly took
place in the palace courtyard and may
have been part of a religious ritual.
Minoan towns and villas
Minoan palaces were encircled by large
cities, which were connected to each
other and to other Cretan towns by
paved roads. One famous Minoan town
is Gournia,which stands on a ridge over-
looking the sea around 38 miles (60 km)
east of Knossos. This town, excavated at
around the same time as Knossos, con-
sisted of a maze of winding streets con-
necting small square houses and court-
yards.The houses were up to three stories
and had flat roofs.The first floor usually
contained workshops or storerooms,
while the living quarters were on the
second floor, which was reached by an
outside staircase. From the tools found in
the workshops, it is clear that the town’s
inhabitants included potters, weavers,
metalsmiths, and carpenters, as well as
fishermen and farmers.
A number of villas have also been
excavated on Crete, and they were all
built to the same plan as the palaces,

albeit on a smaller scale. Some historians
believe that these villas, which are all
located within 7 to 10 miles (11 to 16
km) of each other, were the regional
offices of a central power.
Minoan art
The interiors of the palaces were deco-
rated with colorful murals, some made
up of abstract patterns, others depicting
plants, animals, and people.These paint-
ings are often called frescoes, but true
frescoes are painted on wet plaster,
whereas the Minoan murals were paint-
ed on dry plaster walls. The so-called
House of the Frescoes at Knossos is
famous for its murals showing a park
where various flowering plants are com-
plemented by high-spouting fountains
and a blue bird. Murals showing dolphins
and flying fish have been found in sever-
al other places.
The paintings of men and women
provide a clear idea of how the Minoans
looked and dressed.When taking part in
rituals, men often covered their bodies
with a type of red powder for ceremoni-
al purposes, so the men are often shown
22
Knossos was just one of the many locations where
Minoan palaces were built.Another location was Phaistos,
in the south of the island.The site was occupied by
around 4000 BCE, but the first palace at Phaistos was
not built until around 2000 BCE, roughly the same time
as the palace at Knossos.What is now known as the
“old palace” at Phaistos was destroyed by fire around
1700 BCE.Another palace was built in its place.
Like the palace at Knossos, the “new palace” at Phaistos
was built around a magnificent central courtyard, lined
with pillars.The royal quarters stood to the north.
Workshops were found to the east, while storerooms
were located to the west.The west wing also contained
rooms that were used for religious purposes; religious
figurines were found there and pictures of double
axheads (a religious motif) were carved into the walls.
Like the other great palaces, the palace at Phaistos was
destroyed around 1450 BCE when the Minoan civiliza-
tion came to an end.
THE PALACES AT PHAISTOS
The remains of the Minoan town of Gournia are extremely well
preserved. Like a number of other Minoan towns, Gournia was the
site of a large palace.

This fresco probably
shows a Minoan
priestess.The
woman depicted is
sometimes known as
La Parisienne
because she
resembles the
subjects of paintings
by French artist
Henri Toulouse-
Lautrec.
No large statues from the Minoan
civilization have survived, but the
pedestals of what were presumably
wooden statues have been preserved. A
number of small statues have been found.
These are made of ivory (sometimes
inlaid with gold), bronze, or faience, and
they depict goddesses or priestesses,pray-
ing figures, acrobats, animals, and a few
tableaus, such as a stable with cattle or a
group of dancers. Occasionally, children
are portrayed.
23
THE MINOANS
painted red. Men usually wore their hair
long, but were clean shaven. In some
paintings, men are shown wearing just a
leather belt and a loincloth, while in 
others they wear a kilt. Women wore
dresses with a long flounced skirt and 
an open bodice that left their breasts 
and arms bare, their jewelry consisted 
of rings,
bracelets,
necklaces,
and 
earrings, and they had elaborate hair-
styles with strings of beads braided into
their long hair.
Women often occupy a prominent
position in these paintings. They are
shown dominating ceremonies from a
place of honor and performing dances in
beautiful costumes. In the famous bull-
leaping fresco at Knossos, two young
women are shown taking equal part with
a young man in the ceremony.
The Minoans were one of the earli-
est peoples to develop writing.
From around 2000 BCE onward,
they began using a system of hiero-
glyphic or pictographic writing, with
signs in the shape of animals or
objects.This form of picture writing
may have originated through con-
tact with the Egyptians, who were
also writing in hieroglyphics at this
time. Nevertheless, very few of the
Minoan signs resemble those of 
the Egyptians.
Around 300 years later, the Minoans
started writing in a simplified linear
script, which used signs to repre-
sent the different syllables in a
word.This script was usually
scratched on clay tablets, although
there is evidence that some kind of
paper (perhaps similar to the
papyrus of the Egyptians) was also
used, together with a form of ink.
Tablets in this script found at
Knossos bear stockkeeping records
of textiles, grain, animals, oils, and
spices.Arthur Evans named this
script Linear A.
MINOAN WRITING

The pots and ceramic ware from this
period show that there was a great tech-
nical and artistic tradition. Motifs from
the plant kingdom, inherited from the
earlier Kamares ware, were mingled with
images of marine creatures.These deco-
rations were painted in dark colors on a
light background.
It is obvious from a number of other
found items that sections of Minoan
society were very affluent. Beautiful jew-
elry was wrought in gold, while elegant
stone vases were made of rock crystal,
obsidian (a kind of volcanic glass),
alabaster, or marble. Gold signet rings
engraved with scenes of rituals have also
been found.
Other important sources of informa-
tion on Minoan life are the numerous
seals that have been found. They were
engraved with many designs, including
geometric patterns and representations
of human beings and animals.After 2000
BCE, the seals bear a type of writing that
Arthur Evans termed hieroglyphic.Three
24
ANCIENT GREECE
It seems clear that some religious rituals practiced 
by the Minoans involved the slaughter of animals as a
sacrifice to the gods. However, there may have been 
an even more dramatic and sinister practice. In 1979,
a major sanctuary was excavated in the mountains
around 4.5 miles (7.2 km) south of Knossos.Among 
the items found were a cult statue and a number of
votive offerings.What caused the greatest excitement
was evidence that when the sanctuary was destroyed 
by an earthquake, a human sacrifice had been in
progress.The body of a young man found tied to a low
altar had died as a result of having his throat cut. Other
finds in Knossos have included children’s bones that
show knife marks, suggesting that child sacrifice took
place—or even cannibalism.There have been further
archaeological indications to support the idea that 
these were not isolated instances.
HUMAN SACRIFICE
This ivory figurine depicts a Minoan acrobat taking part in a 
bull-leaping ritual.The figurine was found in the palace at Knossos
and was made around 1550 BCE.

THE MINOANS
This fresco depicts a
Minoan ship
entering a port.The
Minoans were highly
successful traders.
centuries later, this writing was replaced
by a simplified script called Linear A (see
box, page 23). Seals were used for placing
a personal or official stamp on objects as
a signature.They were also used as orna-
ments and charms.
The Third Palace period
Around the 15th century BCE, the
Minoan people suffered a series of disas-
ters.At the beginning of the century, the
volcano on the island of Thera in the
Cyclades erupted violently, causing cata-
strophic destruction over a wide area.
Around 50 years later, many Minoan
centers were destroyed by fire, and the
palaces and other settlements may have
been ransacked before being put to the
torch. Whatever the reason, the existing
social order was overthrown.
Invaders, probably Greek-speaking
Mycenaeans from the mainland, came to
dominate Crete. They made Knossos,
which had suffered relatively little 
damage, their administrative center,
but by 1300 BCE, the town appears 
to have been destroyed by unknown
attackers. Occupied by the Mycenaeans,
Crete became a Greek city-state, and 
the Minoan civilization that had flour-
ished for more than 1,000 years was at 
an end.

MYCENAE 
AND TROY
T
he Mycenaean civilization was the first major culture to
develop on the Greek mainland. It flourished from around
1600 BCE until around 1250 BCE. According to legend, a major
rival of the Mycenaean kingdoms was the Anatolian city of Troy.
Around the same time that the Minoan
civilization was flourishing on Crete,
another culture was developing on the
Greek mainland. This new culture was
the Mycenaean culture, which was
named after the ancient city of Mycenae,
one of the culture’s centers. The
Mycenaean civilization was not a single
kingdom; it consisted of a group of city-
states united by a common language and
way of life. Other great centers of
Mycenaean society were the cities of
Athens,Thebes, Pylos,Tiryns, and Gla.
Unlike the Minoans, the Mycenaeans
were a warlike people. However, they
were also successful traders and skillful
craftsmen. Their origins are still a mys-
tery. Some historians believe they were a
Greek-speaking people from the north-
east who migrated to mainland Greece
around 2000 BCE. Other experts, while
accepting that such people did arrive in
Greece, remain unconvinced that they
were the Mycenaeans. Wherever they
came from, the Mycenaeans had become
a major power in the Aegean region by
1600 BCE. They were to dominate the
region for the next 400 years. Around
1450 BCE, they invaded Crete, where
they made the city of Knossos their
administrative center.They also occupied
many other Aegean islands and their
commercial empire extended through-
out the Mediterranean region.
Most of the knowledge about the
Mycenaeans is of fairly recent origin.
The obsession of a German archaeolo-
gist, Heinrich Schliemann (1822–1890),
with the story of Troy led to the city of
Mycenae being discovered in the 19th
century CE. That Mycenaeans spoke
Greek was only established in 1952,
when a cryptographer succeeded in de-
ciphering the script on clay tablets that
had been found at Pylos and Mycenae
(see box, page 30).
Schliemann and Homer
The epic poems the Iliad and the
Odyssey, attributed to the Greek poet
Homer, describe a Greek world in which
Agamemnon ruled Mycenae, the para-
mount Greek city, while his brother
Menelaus was king of Sparta and Pylos
and Ithaca were ruled by Nestor and
Odysseus respectively.Both of these epics
were once regarded as complete fiction,
but historians now accept that they give
some very valuable glimpses into the
Mycenaean civilization of the 12th cen-
tury BCE.
In the late 19th century CE, nothing
was known about Greek history prior to
800 BCE, but Heinrich Schliemann
became convinced that the world
described by Homer was based on fact
and that Troy and Mycenae had really
existed. In 1876, Schliemann set out to

MYCENAE AND TROY
prove that Mycenae was the city of
Agamemnon. While excavating a burial
ground close to the ruins of Mycenae,
Schliemann came across a tomb contain-
ing many exquisite gold objects, includ-
ing a gold death mask—a replica of a
dead person’s facial features. Schliemann
was convinced he had found the tomb of
the Mycenaean king. “I have looked
upon the face of Agamemnon,” he
declared triumphantly in a telegram
written to the king of Greece.
Schliemann was mistaken, however. It
has since been established that the mask
dates from the 1550s BCE, around 300
years before the time of the Trojan War.
The city of Mycenae
Like many other cities in the ancient
world, Mycenae had been built on a hill
to make it easy to defend if attacked. At
the top of the hill was the upper city, or
citadel, which contained the royal palace.
During the Late Mycenaean period (c.
1550–1100 BCE), the citadel was sur-
rounded by a defensive wall almost half a

mile (805 m) long, 30 feet (9.1 m) high,
and at least 20 feet (6.1 m) thick. The
wall was constructed of massive lime-
stone blocks so heavy that later genera-
tions believed the wall must have been
built by the Cyclopes, a mythical race of
one-eyed giants. As a consequence, this
type of masonry is called Cyclopean.
On the west side of the fortress, the
Lion Gate, the main gateway into the
city, was an impressive structure, crowned
by two stone lions standing on their hind
legs on either side of a column.The lions
are thought to have been a symbol of
kingship.The gate was closed by a set of
double doors, and the spindle holes for
these doors can still be seen in the
threshold and the massive lintel. The
doors were hung on the spindle ends that
protruded from the holes. A feature of
the gate that seems to bring the ancient
city to life is the fact that the threshold
still shows traces of wear from the con-
stant passage of chariots and carts.
At the center of the citadel lies the
palace, which covers an area of 200 by
180 feet (61 by 55 m). Built on uneven
terrain, the palace probably gave the
impression of being a stepped or terraced
structure.The entrance to the palace was
approached by a grand staircase, some of
which still survives.
A royal residence
The palace was an enormously impor-
tant building. Besides housing the royal
family, it acted as a regional center and a
military headquarters. In addition to a
throne room, the palace contained halls,
storerooms, and workshops. The core
room was the megaron—a large rectan-
gular room where the king presided over
state business. This audience chamber
had a large central hearth where a fire
was kept burning, and the walls were
painted with colorful scenes of daily life.
The citadel, which contained several
houses as well as the palace, had many
underground vaults and a system of
underground drains. A reliable water
supply was crucial to the city, particular-
ly in time of siege, and Mycenae had a
secret underground reservoir outside the
wall of the citadel. Historians believe that
the water was brought into the citadel by
an underground channel.
In addition to the king and his rela-
tives, the citadel housed a number of
other noble families, probably in separate
houses. Most of the houses were spacious
and had two stories. In the late 1960s,
a sanctuary containing the remains of
terra-cotta figures 2 feet (0.6 m) high
was found within the walls.These figures
were possibly cult statues.
From the remains of a number of
dwellings found on the hillside outside

substantial town extended from the foot
of the city walls. In times of war, the
population of the town would have
taken refuge within the citadel.

Heinrich Schliemann, born in January 1822, in Germany,
was the son of an impoverished pastor. Schliemann left
school at 14 and, after a succession of odd jobs, sailed
for California, where he made a fortune during the 
Gold Rush. Schliemann next established himself in
Russia, where he became a successful businessman and
eventually grew rich enough to retire in his late thirties,
devoting himself to archaeology.
Schliemann had been obsessed with the stories of the
Trojan War since childhood, and he used the fortune
that he had amassed to pursue his dream. He not only
excavated the cities of Troy and Mycenae, but also the
city of Tiryns. Schliemann publicized his discoveries
through books and letters to British newspapers.
Schliemann died in Naples on December 26, 1890, as
the result of an ear infection.

Tombs
Two styles of Mycenaean tombs have
been discovered. When Schliemann was
excavating Mycenae, he found an exten-
sive burial site in the northwest corner of
the citadel. Archaeologists call this loca-
tion Grave Circle A.The site contains a
number of royal tombs dating from
around 1600 BCE. These tombs were
composed of simple shafts, which were
dug deep into the ground. Each tomb
contained the bodies of several genera-
tions of royalty, together with their pos-
sessions.When a tomb was full, it would
be covered with stones and the shaft
filled with earth. Later, a second circle of

shaft tombs, called Grave Circle B, was
discovered outside the citadel walls.
The treasures that were buried with
the deceased in these shaft tombs are a
testimony to the power and wealth of
Mycenae in those days. As well as gold
death masks, the graves yielded many
richly decorated weapons, including a
number of daggers inlaid with gold or
silver. Some of the daggers featured
entire scenes, including hunts and battles,
depicted in inlay work. The hilts of the
daggers were often made of wood or
bone to which reliefs of hammered gold
were applied.
The deceased were not only provid-
ed with weapons, however.A number of
other splendid objects have also been
found in the burial shafts.These objects
include vases, dishes, golden rhytons (an
ornate type of drinking vessel),beautiful-
ly crafted diadems, earrings, hairpins,
necklaces, and bracelets, as well as hun-
dreds of tiny gold disks, which were
probably used to decorate clothes.
Archaeologists have also found a number
of cylinder seals and signet rings.
Another type of Mycenaean tomb
was the tholos tomb,which was used from
around 1500 BCE.These more elaborate
tombs were built by master craftsmen.
Schliemann excavated many of these
tombs, which appear to have been
reserved for the elite. The tholos tomb
had a dome-shaped roof, and because of
the domed appearance, the tombs are
also known as beehive tombs.
In a tholos tomb, the burial space 
consisted of a round hole in the ground
covered by a dome of stone blocks.The
blocks were laid in such a way that each
layer protruded inward over the layer
below, leaving only a small opening 
at the top. The opening was then 
closed with an apex stone. The stone
blocks were covered with soil and peb-
bles, and the mound thus created was
given an identifying mark or gravestone.
Inside the tomb, the protruding portions
of the stone blocks were removed, and
the surface was smoothed, creating a
conical dome.
A tholos tomb was often built into the
side of a hill and was approached by a

ANCIENT GREECE
When archaeologist Arthur Evans was excavat-
ing the Minoan city of Knossos in the early 20th
century, he unearthed a number of clay tablets
inscribed with three distinct types of script.
Evans called these scripts hieroglyphic (the earli-
est form), Linear A, and Linear B. Evans never
succeeded in deciphering any of these scripts.
In 1939, excavations at the Mycenaean palace at
Pylos turned up many more Linear B tablets,
and thousands more were subsequently found
at Mycenae,Tiryns, and Thebes. Using the tablets
from Pylos and Knossos, a cryptographer,
Michael Ventris, set about deciphering Linear B
in the 1950s. Most people believed that the
script represented an unknown language of the
Minoans, because the signs of Linear B were
clearly based on those of Linear A.
Ventris tried to establish a phonetic value for
the syllable signs, based on assumptions about
the place names on the tablets. Starting from
such names as Konoso and Aminiso (Knossos
and Amnissos),Ventris was able to uncover an
archaic form of Greek. In 1953, together with
John Chadwick, a specialist in Greek historical
linguistics,Ventris published his findings.The ini-
tial article was controversial, but the decipher-
ment is now generally accepted—the language
of the Mycenaeans was Greek.

Other Mycenaean centers
Although Mycenae was the mightiest
center of the Mycenaean world, other
royal fortresses and palaces of similar or
even greater size were built at Tiryns,
Asine, Pylos,Athens,Thebes, and Iolkos.
At Tiryns, a fortress was built in three
stages some time after 1450 BCE. This
fortress has mighty walls that surpass
those of Mycenae both in height and in
the size of their stone blocks. Several
palace buildings, including a megaron,

most striking features of these buildings
are the covered corridors and casements
enclosing impressive galleries.
The floorplan of one building,
Nestor’s Palace at Pylos, has been partic-
ularly well preserved.Named after one of
the city’s semimythical kings, Nestor’s
Palace comprised several buildings,
which were not protected by massive
surrounding walls but were probably
guarded by fortresses along the coast. At
the gateway to the citadel, there was a
guardroom, as well as another room
where records were kept of the daily
business of the palace, produce received
in taxes, and work to be carried out by
officials. At the center of the citadel was

T
he so-called Treasury of Atreus was a huge,
handsome domed grave at Mycenae that
dates from the early 13th century BCE.Atreus
was a mythical king of Mycenae who was involved
in a bitter and tragic battle with his brother
Thyestes for the city’s throne.The identity of the
real-life king who was buried in the tomb remains
a mystery, however.
One of the most spectacular features of the
dome is its impressive dromos (entrance passage),
which measures 120 feet (36.6 m) long and 
20 feet (6.1 m) wide.This dromos leads up to a
majestic doorway that is 30 feet (9.1 m) tall and
would have been elaborately decorated.A gigantic
stone block weighing 120 tons (108,862 kg) 
closes off the top of the entrance. Inside the
tomb, the vast dome has a diameter and height of
approximately 45 feet (13.7 m) each and consists
of 33 layers of stone blocks fitted snugly together.
Remnants of bronze nails suggest that the inside
of the dome may well have been decorated with
bronze rosettes and friezes.
Using evidence from this and other tombs,
archaeologists have tried to imagine what a royal
funeral would have been like. It probably started
with the funeral procession—consisting of the
body of the king drawn on a chariot, followed by
priests and mourners—moving slowly along the
dromos toward the entrance to the tomb, where
great doors of bronze would open to admit the
procession. Inside the tomb, the king would be
laid to rest on a golden carpet. He would be
dressed in his robes of state, and around him
would be laid his provisions for after death—
food and wine, together with his weapons.
Animals would be sacrificed, roasted on fires 
lit within the tomb, and eaten by the mourners.
Everyone would then have withdrawn, the doors
would have been closed, and the entrance would
have been filled up.

anteroom, and state room (megaron), all
surrounded by pantries and storerooms,
together with the queen’s apartments,
which consisted of a smaller megaron, a
boudoir, and a large bathroom with a
terra-cotta bath.
Many clay tablets have been recov-
ered from the palace at Pylos.When the
palace was destroyed by fire around 1200
BCE, the fire may have actually pre-
served the tablets by baking them. The
tablets generally record administrative
matters, listing goods, palace personnel,
and other details of housekeeping. By
doing so,the tablets provide a snapshot of
the palace administration just before the
destruction. In addition, the tablets reveal
much information about Mycenaean
social life.
Mycenaean society
Despite its loose political organization,
the Mycenaean world was surprisingly
united in its social, religious, and linguis-
tic aspects. Each region had its own king
(wanax), who acted as its head. Under
him was the lawagetas (people’s leader),
who was possibly an army commander.
Then there were the telestai, who are
thought to have been wealthy landown-
ers. Freemen were referred to as damos.
Each class had its own kind of landown-
ership or tenancy.
Everything was controlled by the
palace—the ownership and use of land,
the labor employed, and the products of
craftsmen. The tablets that have been
recovered make it clear that most
Mycenaeans were poor farmers who
worked on land that was owned by the
king.They grew crops such as barley and
wheat and kept groves of olive trees to
produce olive oil. They raised animals
such as goats and sheep, which provided
both meat and wool, and grew flax to
make linen. Most of this produce had to
be taken to the palace. It was then sold to
help support the royal family, priests,
bureaucrats, and the army.
Another section of Mycenaean socie-
ty included the skilled craftsmen. The
most important of these were the
bronzesmiths, who made the weapons
for the army. There were also jewellers,
potters, carpenters, and cabinetmakers,
who carried out intricate inlay work.
Large-scale textile manufacturing was
carried out by spinners and weavers,most
of whom were women.Many slaves were
employed in Mycenaean society; most of
them had been bought in slave markets
in Anatolia.
The Mycenaeans were aggressive and
warlike, and each king kept his own
standing army, which he had to feed,
clothe, and arm.The commanders of the

T
here appear to have
been many similarities
between the Mycenaean 
and Minoan religions, but 
the two were not identical.
Still, it seems that both 
civilizations did worship a
mother goddess, whose
divine son died at the death
of the old year and was born
again in the spring. Many
Bronze Age paintings show
people making offerings to
this goddess.
Mycenaean tablets also 
mention the names of many
gods, including Zeus,Athena,
Artemis, Poseidon, and
Dionysus, who were wor-
shipped by later Greeks.At
Pylos, Poseidon, the sea god
who was the brother of
Zeus, was an important deity
who was depicted in the
form of a horse.The name of
Dionysus, the god of wine, is
also found on Mycenaean
tablets, which suggests that
he too may have been worshipped at this time.
The Mycenaeans tended not to build temples to
their gods. Instead, the people worshipped the
gods at small shrines, some of which may have
been located outdoors but most of which were
found inside houses. Small terra-cotta idols in the
shape of female figures have been recovered from
Mycenae and other places, suggesting that the cult
of the goddess was widespread. However, larger
idols of both female and male figures have also
been found, and it is possible that these idols rep-
resent the Greek gods.
Priests were an important part of Mycenaean
society, and they would have carried out the reli-
gious rituals, which included sacrificing animals to
the gods.The priests would also have conducted
burials, and it is evident from the grave goods
found in royal tombs from the period that the
Mycenaeans believed that their kings would have
a life after death.
These Mycenaean terra-cotta figures date to
between 1400 and 1200 BCE.Archaeologists believe
that the figures’ flattened headdresses indicate that
they depict goddesses.
MYCENAEAN RELIGION

army wore heavy armor made of bronze
and leather helmets made fearsome with
the addition of boar’s tusks.The infantry
wore tunics of leather and carried
shields, swords, and daggers. Chariots,
which usually carried two men and were
drawn by two horses, played an impor-
tant role in the army. Chariots were used
both to lead charges in battle and to
carry information back to headquarters.
The Mycenaeans came to dominate
most of the Aegean area, subjugating
Knossos on Crete and occupying other
parts of the island. The influence of the
Mycenaeans reached to all corners of
their world—Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt,
southern Italy, and the Mediterranean
islands of Sicily, Cyprus, and Sardinia.
From the 1600s BCE onward, the
Mycenaeans dominated sea trade in the
Mediterranean.Trading posts were set up
in southern Italy and Anatolia, and
Mycenaean merchants traded goods such
as cloth, pottery, grain, and oil with
countries as far away as North Africa,
Scandinavia, and the Middle East.
Decline and fall
Over the course of the 13th century
BCE, the Mycenaeans carried out a 
significant amount of construction in
their territory. Many new buildings
were erected, and the fortresses 
of Tiryns, Mycenae, and
Athens were expanded
and reinforced. Even in
Pylos,
where there
were no surrounding
walls, the palace was
modified to make it
less open. Storerooms
were enlarged and
measures were taken to
secure supplies of drink-
ing water.
At the same time, in central
Greece, a gigantic fortress was
being erected near Gla, which is locat-
ed on the edge of Lake Kopaïs in
Boeotia. This fortress had walls 2 miles
(3.2 km) long and covered a total area of
50 acres (202,343 m2). In comparison,
Mycenae had walls slightly over 0.5 miles
(0.8 km) long encircling an area of 7.5
acres (30,351 m2).The fortress at Gla was
probably intended to be a central refuge
for the entire surrounding area, at a time
when Mycenaeans all over Greece were
apparently feeling a threat of invasion.
This theory is borne out by clay
tablets found at Pylos, which mention
sending sentinels to the coast, drafting
soldiers, and hiring rowers. One of the
tablets refers to an unprecedented sacri-
fice of 13 golden vases and 10 people,
obviously an attempt to secure the favor
of the gods at a time of great emergency.
That the threat was not imaginary
was proved by the widespread destruc-
tion that took place after 1250 BCE.
This destruction has frequently been
explained as the result of an invasion by
the Dorians, a tribe from the Balkans and
northern Greece.The Dorians are said to
have annihilated the Mycenaean civiliza-
tion, but this idea is flawed.There is no
gap in the archaeological record that
would correspond to the arrival of a
huge group of newcomers. On the
contrary, the overall impression is
one of continuity after the
destruction. Many of the
former settlements were
rebuilt, and the existing
Mycenaean 
culture
simply 
continued.
However, the size 
of the population
dropped dramatical-
ly, and society as a
whole descended to a
lower cultural plane.
So what caused the
decline if it was not the
Dorians? The whole eastern
Mediterranean area was in ferment

at this time. The Hittites disappeared
from Asia Minor while the Egyptians
were battling with the Sea Peoples. It
may be that these enemies of Egypt
swept through the Mycenaean palaces, or
there may have been civil war between
the Mycenaean kingdoms. There may
have been natural disasters, such as earth-
quakes,or the administrative and political
systems may simply have collapsed as a
result of famine or the cutting off of
trade routes. Whatever the reason, the
Mycenaean civilization disintegrated,
and the so-called Dark Age dawned 
in Greece.
Troy
While the Mycenaean culture was 
dominant on the mainland of Greece, a
city was flourishing in northwestern
Anatolia. This city was Troy,
the 
legendary adversary of Greece. As with
Mycenae, much of what is known about
Troy is the result of work carried out by
the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann.
The legendary city of Troy had fasci-
nated Schliemann since boyhood, when
his father had told him the stories of the
Iliad and the Odyssey (see box, page 38)
and Schliemann had come across an
illustration of how the ancient city might
have looked. The city was supposed to
have been encircled by a massive wall,
punctuated by towers, and to have been
the site of the Trojan War, the subject of
the Iliad.
Troy did in fact exist more than 5,000
years ago. Bronze Age Troy was situated
at the entrance to the Dardanelles, the
route for ships passing between the
Aegean Sea and the Black Sea.The city
also occupied a crucial position on the
land route between Europe and Asia. For
these reasons,Troy became a prosperous
mercantile city and a center of culture. In
the third and second millennia BCE,
it was the leading city of the region,
with a royal house ruling over the 
surrounding farming villages. Troy con-
tinued to prosper until the middle of the
11th century BCE.
Schliemann’s excavation
The true history of Troy was unknown
in the mid-19th century CE, but several
archaeologists, including Frank Calvert
(1828–1908), were interested in discov-
ering the site of ancient Troy (if it in fact
existed). Calvert was an English amateur
archaeologist working as a consular offi-
cial in the Dardanelles area. He had read
a book by Charles Maclaren (published
in 1822) that suggested that a hill called
Hissarlik on the Aegean coast of western
Turkey might be the site of the city.
Calvert’s brother Frederick, who was also
based in the area, bought a farm in 1847
that extended over 2,000 acres (8 km2)
and took in part of Mount Hissarlik.
Over the next few years, Frank made
some exploratory excavations on his
brother’s land.
Since his retirement from the world
of business around 1860, Heinrich
Schliemann had been busy. He had stud-
ied archaeology, written a book on Troy,
and traveled widely to visit sites of
archaeological interest. In 1868, he met
Frank Calvert in Turkey and learned of

37
the preliminary excavations at Hissarlik.
However, a full-scale excavation of the
site would require considerable financ-
ing, which Calvert could not provide.
Schliemann could, and he persuaded
Calvert to let him take over the excava-
tions on the Calvert half of the Hissarlik.
Schliemann also obtained permission
from the Turkish government to dig on
the other half of the mound, as long as
any discovered treasure was shared with
the government.
Schliemann hired 70 local
workmen and started digging in
1871. Very soon, he uncov-
ered an ancient wall, built
of immense boulders, just
15 feet (4.5 m) below
the surface.Encouraged
by this discovery, he
then sank shafts and
dug trenches into the
hillside. To his amaze-
ment, he discovered
the remains of not just
one city, but nine cities,
each built on the ruins of
the last.
The treasure of Priam
Schliemann had certainly discov-
ered an important archaeological site,
but was it Troy? Although he called him-
self an archaeologist, Schliemann was
primarily a treasure hunter. Later, at
Mycenae, he would hope to unearth
treasure belonging to Agamemnon. At
the supposed site of Troy, he longed to
find what he called “the treasure of
Priam.” Convinced that the Trojan War
was 
grounded 
in 
historical 
fact,
Schliemann felt sure that King Priam had
hidden his treasures to save them from
the Greeks.
Around noon on a day in June 1873,
Schliemann spotted the gleam of gold at
the base of a wall in the excavations.
Schliemann and his wife,
Sophia,
unearthed a cache of golden objects,
including bracelets, earrings, diadems,
and many gold rings. The Schliemanns
hid the treasure and smuggled it off the
site and, eventually, out of Turkey.When
news of the find leaked out, the Turkish
authorities were outraged at the decep-
tion. Schliemann had to pay a very heavy
fine before he was allowed to continue
excavating.
Although 
Schliemann
remained convinced he had discovered
the treasure of King Priam, later
research established that the 
golden horde dated from
more than a thousand years
before the time of the
Trojan War.
Believing that the
Troy 
of 
Homer 
would probably lie at
almost the lowest
level,
Schliemann
hired more men 
to dig down to that
level. Unfortunately,
since Schliemann un-
derstood nothing of
the scientific method of
archaeology, much valu-
able evidence was destroyed
during the dig. Later archaeolo-
gists established that Homer’s Troy
lay at a much higher level.
The nine cities
The nine levels of Troy start with the first
Troy, which was a small fortified citadel
dating from around 3000 BCE. This
citadel would have provided a safe 
shelter for the surrounding villagers
when danger threatened. The second
level was Troy II, dating from around
2600 BCE. The town was much larger
and became wealthy by trading with the
Mycenaeans of mainland Greece. The
evidence points to Troy II being
destroyed by fire, which was why

MYCENAE AND TROY

ANCIENT GREECE
T
he background to the story of the Iliad is the
siege of Troy by a coalition of Greeks, called
Achaeans in the poem.The reason for the war is
that Helen, the beautiful wife of Menelaus, king of
Sparta, has been abducted by Paris, a Trojan
prince.When Menelaus discovers that his wife is
gone, he and his brother Agamemnon, king of
Mycenae, call upon the princes of Achaea to assist
in punishing Troy and bringing Helen home.A fleet
is prepared, and the warriors sail for Troy, where
a drawn-out siege follows.
In the Greek camp outside Troy, a dispute arises
between the Greek prince Achilles and the supreme
commander,Agamemnon, who has abused his
authority by taking a beautiful slave away from
Achilles.Achilles, deeply insulted, refuses to con-
tinue fighting.Without Achilles, the Greeks prove
to be weaker than the Trojans, and disaster
threatens.Achilles finally agrees to allow his
friend, Patroclus, to take part in the conflict, and
Hector, the Trojan commander, kills Patroclus.The
grieving Achilles feels compelled to avenge the
death of his friend and in turn kills Hector, which
heralds the beginning of the end for the Trojans.
The Iliad ends with the burial of Patroclus and the
return of Hector’s body to his father, King Priam.
The Odyssey, a sequel to the Iliad, deals with the
difficult voyage home of one of the Greek
princes, Odysseus of Ithaca.The tale opens with
the stress that his prolonged absence has caused
his household. Since no word has been heard
from him for 10 years, Odysseus is assumed to be
dead. Greedy suitors are ruining his property as
they court his wife, Penelope.
Odysseus himself then relates his adventures to
the king and queen of Scheria.Among other
escapades, Odysseus tells them of his encounter
with the man-eating giant Polyphemus and the
temptations of the goddess Calypso, who offered
Odysseus immortality.
The Odyssey ends with the return of Odysseus 
to the island of Ithaca, where the hero discovers
what has been going on in his absence. He kills
the suitors who have been besieging his supposed
widow and is reunited with his wife, son, and aged
father.

MYCENAE AND TROY
Homer.The three succeeding Troys were
each larger than the one before.
Troy VI was heavily influenced by the
Mycenaeans and attracted many new set-
tlers. It was destroyed around 1300 BCE,
to be succeeded by what is called Troy
VIIa. Most archaeologists now believe
that this is the Homeric Troy. Fragments
of pottery found at this level indicate that
the city dates from the mid-13th centu-
ry BCE. Some human remains, one of
which is a human skeleton showing
injuries to the head and a broken jaw-
bone, have been found in the streets,
which suggests the city was destroyed by
war.There is also evidence that Troy VIIa
was put to the torch.The next city,Troy
VIIb, also seems to have been destroyed
by fire.Historians believe this destruction
happened around 1050 BCE.
The fall of Troy
After the destruction of Troy VIIb, the
city seems to have been abandoned for
several centuries, but at the start of the
seventh century BCE, the site was reoc-
cupied by Greeks and became known as
Ilium. Around 85 BCE, this city was
attacked and taken by the Romans, who
then built Troy IX, which became an
important trading city until it was
eclipsed by Constantinople in the fourth
century CE.Around 400 CE,the site was
finally abandoned and gradually disap-
peared under the mound of Hissarlik,
until the cities were finally rediscovered
by Schliemann.
Schliemann died in 1890, and the
work at Hissarlik was carried on by his
assistant, Wilhelm Dorpfeld, who made
further excavations in 1893 and 1894.
After that point, nothing more was done
until the 1930s, when the American
archaeologist Carl Blegen (1887–1971)
carried out careful excavations over a
seven-year period, from 1932 to 1938.
He took many photographs and was
instrumental in establishing much of the
chronology of the city. In particular, it
was Blegen who established that the Troy
of Homeric legend was almost certainly
Troy VIIa.

THE DARK AGE AND
GREEK EXPANSION
A
fter the fall of the Mycenaean civilization, Greece entered 
a period that is now known as the Dark Age. Gradually,
however, Greece emerged from this era, and exiles from the 
country founded colonies all around the Mediterranean region.
By the mid-13th century BCE, the cities
and palaces of mainland Greece were
feeling under threat. New construction
surrounded many of the cities with
strong fortified walls, and measures were
taken to protect underground water sup-
plies, suggesting that imminent invasion
was feared. This fear seems not to have
been misplaced. By the end of the centu-
ry, all the palaces had been burned, and
the once great Mycenaean civilization
was in terminal decline.
The cause of this collapse was a vast
influx of Dorian peoples from central
Asia. These aggressive tribesmen swept
down mainland Greece from the north,
traveling in ox-drawn covered wagons
and inspiring terror with their horned
helmets. By 1100 BCE, all the main
Mycenaean centers had fallen to these
invaders, and for the next few centuries,
Greece entered what is called the Dark
Age, about which very little is known.
An age of poverty
Archaeological excavations suggest that
Greece became impoverished and par-
tially depopulated in the turbulent peri-
od following the collapse of the
Mycenaean culture. The arrival of the
Dorians resulted in a change in the spo-
ken dialect and in iron being used in
preference to bronze, but the number
and size of both settlements and burial
grounds declined sharply, while the
primitive style of buildings and earthen-
ware show that the people lived in great
poverty. The complete disappearance of
the complex society once centered on
the palaces meant that writing skills were
also lost.The social organization seems to
have broken down into small communi-
ties, each led by a basileus. In the palace
hierarchy, this title had been used for a
subordinate figure, but in the Dark Age,
the title referred to a powerful chieftain
who held independent authority.
It seems that the population increased
again in the ninth century BCE, possibly
due to a reduction in mortality or an
increase in migration. What is certain is
that the Greeks began to migrate from
the mainland around this time, some to
Cyprus, Crete, and the Aegean islands,
others to Anatolia. Over the course of
the ninth century,representatives of three
main dialect groups (see box, page 44)
settled in much of the coastal region of
Anatolia and on the islands off this coast.
Those speaking the Aeolic dialect settled
on the island of Lesbos and in the region
from north of the Dardanelles on the
northwest coast of Anatolia down to

with the Greek world, these routes had
declined during the Dark Age but
had never been completely severed.
Toward the end of the ninth century
BCE, Greek seafarers could once again
be found in the harbors of northern
Syria and Phoenicia.
The Archaic period
The restoration of trade with the east
had momentous results for the Greeks.
The Greek world emerged from its tem-
porary isolation and began to experience
such great changes that a new era is
defined as beginning around 750 BCE.
The new world that was developing bore
little resemblance to the old Bronze Age
civilization. Historians call this new era
the Archaic period.
During the Archaic period, increased
contact with the east brought the Greeks
new ideas regarding pottery, sculpture,
architecture, mythology, religion, and the
use of iron and bronze. Most important
of all was the reintroduction of writing,
this time using an alphabet derived from
Phoenician examples (see box, page 46).
It is not clear exactly when the Greeks
started to adapt the Semitic alphabet to
their own needs, but the oldest inscrip-
tions using the new alphabet date from
the second half of the eighth century
BCE. After that, the use of the alphabet
spread rapidly, making it possible to
record the Iliad and the Odyssey; these

two epics were almost certainly first
composed in the oral tradition.
The beginning of the Archaic period
also saw the emergence of the polis (plu-
ral: poleis), which was an autonomous
political unit covering a small territory,
usually averaging between 50 and 100
square miles (260 km2), with a popula-
tion of between 2,500 and 4,500. Some
poleis were larger than this, particularly
those of Sparta, Argos, Corinth, Athens,
and Thebes. There were also some very
small units covering a territory of no
more than 15 square miles (39 km2) and
having a population of only around 250.
However large or small, each polis had at
least one settlement that was called a
city (also, confusingly, called a polis), no
matter how small or unlike a city it
actually was.
Each polis was completely independ-
ent. In theory, all the freemen who were
its citizens organized the political affairs of
the polis (from which the term politics is
derived) in community assemblies, but in
fact, much of the real power rested with
the aristocracy. The basileus, who in the
Dark Age had ruled as a king, was
replaced in most cases by magistrates who
were elected annually from the ranks of
the nobles. These aristocrats owed their
dominant position to a combination of

D
ialect was a significant factor in the Greek
migrations of the ninth century BCE because
people tended to settle into linguistic groups.
Doric was the dialect of northwest Greece. It
was also spoken along the west of Greece and on
the islands of Crete, Cos, and Rhodes as a result
of Dorian conquests between 1200 and 1000
BCE. Doric spread to Anatolia as Dorian speakers
settled there in the ninth century BCE.
The non-Doric dialects were Ionic,Aeolic, and
Arcado-Cyprian. Ionic was the language of Attica
and the island of Evvoia, while Aeolic was spoken
in the northeast and center of mainland Greece.
Arcado-Cyprian, the dialect spoken in Arcadia on
the Peloponnese and on Cyprus, is closely related
to Mycenaean Greek, in which the Linear B
inscriptions were written.This affinity to Linear
B may be due to the fact that there was little
migrant influence in the wild and rugged Arcadian
region and that Cyprus had served as a haven
for refugees from the mainland during the time
of the invasions.
The greatest differences were those between the
Dorians and the Ionians, two groups who spoke
different tongues, had different customs and
religious practices, and who each built up a
position of power.These differences led to the
Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE).

power and wealth, which, in the early
Archaic period,was often expressed in the
number of horses one owned. After 700
BCE, the possession of bronze armor was
another indicator of status.
Colonization
The emergence of the poleis took place
during a time of rapid population
growth.This rise in population led to the
conquest of sparsely populated regions
and to armed conflicts between neigh-
boring poleis in attempts to expand their
territories.The rise also encouraged fur-
ther emigration of Greeks from the
mainland. In the eighth century BCE,
Sparta subjected the region of Laconia
and began the conquest of neighboring
Messenia.Argos extended its power over
the Argolis region, while Athens united
the peninsula of Attica into one polis.
The emigration of many Greeks to set-
tlements on the Mediterranean and
Black Sea coasts led to what is called the
Archaic colonization.
Developments such as colonization
and the subsequent flourishing of trade,
the growing contact between the various
poleis, and the use of writing to record
the laws and decrees of a polis commu-
nity all had an influence on the relations
between the many small states of the
Greek world. Within the poleis, social
relations were changing as some citizens
became a great deal richer than others.
An elite of aristocrats and wealthy citi-
zens emerged as a result of trading with
the east. In several poleis, these small
groups of aristocrats managed to seize
control and end the community assem-
blies, thereby undermining the funda-
mental principle of the poleis. As the
majority of the citizens still had to work
to survive, they were often forced into a

T
he word alphabet comes from the first two
letters of the Greek alphabet—alpha and
beta—and denotes a writing system in which a
single character (grapheme) represents a single
sound (phoneme). Non-alphabetic systems of
writing use signs that represent whole words or
syllables.The Mesopotamian cuneiform system
used a combination of word and syllable signs,
while Egyptian hieroglyphs used signs that
represented words together with signs that
represented a group of consonants or a single
consonant.Around 1500 BCE, elements of the
Egyptian hieroglyphic script were adapted to
create a script in which each individual sound
of a language (apart from vowel sounds) was
represented by a single symbol—that is, an
alphabet.This adaptation took place somewhere 
in the Syro-Palestinian region, and the inventors 
of the new script spoke a Semitic language.
The new alphabetic script soon took on different
forms as its use spread among different peoples
over the course of the following centuries. One
script developed in the 14th and 13th centuries
BCE in the city of Ugarit on the coast of Syria
consisted of a cuneiform (wedge-shaped) alphabet
of 30 characters. One of the principal variants
was the Northwest Semitic alphabet, from which
nearly all alphabetic scripts in use today are
ultimately descended.A short version, using 22
letters, was being used to write the Phoenician
language from the 11th century BCE, and from
Phoenicia it spread to neighboring regions in
the Middle East.
The Greeks adopted this short Phoenician
alphabet in the eighth century BCE and modified
it by adding two or more consonant symbols.
They also began to use some of the symbols
to represent vowel sounds. For a time, they
experimented with writing from left to right and
from right to left, but by around 500 BCE, they
settled on left to right.As the Greek alphabet
spread, it was adopted and modified by various
Mediterranean peoples, including the Etruscans,
the Umbrians, the Oscans, and the Romans.The
last were to be the most influential, since the
Roman alphabet, used to write Latin, was
subsequently to be used by all the languages 
of western Europe.

dependent relationship with rich land-
holders. Many of the poorer citizens
were exploited, and if they got into debt,
they could be sold into slavery.
In Sparta, attempts were made to
resolve the internal tensions by making
all citizens equal, at the expense of an
underprivileged group that was excluded
from citizenship and left with no rights
at all. In Athens and Corinth, rivalry
between aristocrats led to internal polit-
ical conflict. In some cases, an aristocrat
would succeed in seizing absolute power
and set himself up as an all-powerful sov-
ereign—this was a new kind of monarch
that the Greeks called a tyrannis (tyrant).
After the horrors of the Dark Age,the
Archaic period saw the Greeks emerging
into an era of prosperity that in turn led
to a flowering of new ideas and artistic
achievement.The spread of writing had a
profound effect on law and government.
Because the results of law suits could
now be recorded, leading to the estab-
lishment of legal codes, any citizen could
appeal against an arbitrary ruling by a
corrupt magistrate and cite legal prece-
dent to uphold the appeal. This change
led to more rational government and the
rule of law.
Greek expansion
The period of Greek overseas settlement
that began in the middle of the eighth
century BCE lasted for more than 200
years. During that time, Greeks founded
dozens of settlements on the fringes of
the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black
seas.The impetus behind this colonizing
movement may have originally been
trade, but the settlements soon became
new, independent states. These colonies
(not a strictly accurate term for the
settlements) inherited various social and
political aspects—such as religious cults,
political organizations,
and spoken
dialect—from their metropolis (parent
city), but the colonies themselves were
completely independent entities.
An overseas polis often started as a
trading post (emporion), which then
developed into a settlement as colonists
followed. Trade was certainly the moti-
vating factor in some of the very early
Greek colonies, such as Al Mina in Syria
and Pithekoussai in Italy. Greek traders
were looking to buy iron ore, silver, and
slaves, while offering wine and olive oil
in return.A trading post that turned into
a colony was called an apoikia, meaning a
“settlement elsewhere.” Most apoikiai

started with no more than one or two
hundred people, to be joined by other
colonists at a later stage.The new colony
would always hold its parent metropolis
in esteem and would preserve the reli-
gious customs of the parent city despite
any political differences. The metropolis
and satellite polis would send official
envoys to each other’s religious festivals,
and the special relationship was some-
times demonstrated by the provision of
military aid by the parent to the colony.
For example, Corinth helped the city of
Syracuse to fight the Athenians during
the Peloponnesian War, because Syracuse
was Corinth’s colony.
The spread of settlements
Colonies fanned out in all directions
from the Greek mainland. Some of the
earliest settlements were on Sicily and in
southern Italy, where the colonists were
attracted by the good harbors and fertile
land to support farming.The Greek pres-
ence there became so dominant that the
area was called Magna Grecia (Great
Greece). In the fifth century BCE,
Syracuse on Sicily became the most
highly populated of all Greek cities.
Other new settlements were situated on
the Aegean islands along the northern
coast of the Aegean Sea; on the northern
coast of Anatolia along the Hellespont
and the Bosporus; around the Black Sea;
on the north African coast in Cyrenaica
(present-day Libya); and on the south
coast of France and the northeastern
coast of Spain.
The Greek colonists avoided areas
where other peoples had a significant
presence. These areas included the east-
ern coast of the Mediterranean, which
was already well occupied, and the
northeast African coast, which was large-
ly avoided because of the dominance of
Egypt in the area. The African coast to

the west of Cyrenaica was entirely in the
hands of the Phoenicians, as was the
western part of Sicily, the whole of
Sardinia, most of the smaller islands in
the western Mediterranean, and a large
part of the Spanish coast.
Adventurous colonists
Why the Greek colonists wanted to leave
the mother country is not completely
clear.The theory that they were escaping
overpopulation on the mainland has
been largely discredited, but they may
have been fleeing from an unsatisfactory
political situation at home, or seeking
land of their own,or simply searching for
adventure. When a group of emigrants
boarded a ship or—as some sources
imply—were taken aboard forcibly, the
people were already well prepared for
their enterprise. They knew where they
wanted to go and had consulted an ora-
cle before setting out to ensure a favor-
able outcome to the voyage. At least,
that is what they were supposed to do.
Colonies that did not possess the text of
an oracle, or that could not point out
the tomb of an original founder, often
produced forgeries in order to ensure
their standing.
When the immigrants disembarked at
their destination, the first thing they did
was to drive away the native population,
if there was one.It is not known whether
it was common practice to subdue the
original inhabitants and bind them in
servitude to the Greeks, but this
undoubtedly happened from time to
time. The second task was to find a site
where the new city could be built and
divide the surrounding land equally
among the colonists.This practice served

to create an aristocracy of the earliest set-
tlers, who had first choice of land and
became premier citizens. Immigrants
who arrived later would probably be
granted civil rights and a small piece of
land, but they would almost certainly be
accorded a subordinate position in the
new society. This practice explains the
existence of the extensive elite groups
that occupied the aristocratic councils in
many of the colonies. It is not clear
whether women accompanied the origi-
nal colonists. They may have been sent
for later,or they may have been sought—
or abducted—from neighboring regions.
When a trading post developed into a
more permanent community, it usually
took the form of an agricultural settle-
ment.
No matter how much trading
took place, arable land was of prime
importance, and most Greek colonies
were founded in regions with good agri-
cultural land. Some commentators have
deduced from this pattern that Archaic
colonization was motivated by a shortage
of land in the homeland.While many of
the colonists were probably driven to
emigrate for economic reasons, this
motivation would not have applied to
the aristocratic and wealthier colonists
who may have left a parent city for polit-
ical reasons.
Exporting a culture
The natural consequence of Greek colo-
nization was not only a migration of
people but a migration of their whole
culture, including their technological
skills, their customs, their religion, and
their concepts and attitudes.The Greeks
took with them everything, from specif-
ic agricultural methods and crops like the
olive and grape to architectural and
building skills and an entire hierarchy of
gods. This export of culture from the
Aegean region to, particularly, the Italian
region was to have a profound effect 
on European history. The colonies of
“Great Greece” were to form a bridge
between east and west, just as the
Mycenaeans and the Phoenicians had
done previously.
A good example of this influence can
be seen in the colony at Pithekoussai on
Ischia, an Italian island in the Bay of
Naples. Excavations carried out there
since the mid-20th century CE have
established that this settlement was
founded by colonists from the Aegean
island of Evvoia. Certainly not a typical
colony, Pithekoussai was a very early set-
tlement of the eighth century BCE and
was located right on the northern fron-
tier of what was later to become the
Greek world.The colony appears to have
started as an emporion and subsequently
developed into an apoikia. Greek settle-
ments functioned as a corridor through
which eastern influences reached the Iron
Age cultures of Italy and beyond, stimu-
lating major changes. In the seventh and
sixth centuries BCE, a Mediterranean
urban culture began to take root in the
Etruscan region of central Italy.

ANCIENT GREECE
One poet who seems to mark the transition between
the heroic epic poetry of Homer and the more
practical, personal work of writers such as Archilochus
is Hesiod, a farmer who lived in Boeotia around 700
BCE.Whereas the two epic poems of Homer, the Iliad
and the Odyssey, portrayed a legendary time of super-
heroes who fought with formidable foes and overcame
huge obstacles with the help of the gods, Hesiod’s
poetry dealt with his own world.Although his poetry
retained the traditional epic form, the content of it was
novel. Hesiod saw the world as a chaotic place where
the individual was on his own in trying to achieve good
relations with the gods and his fellow men. Hesiod
sometimes featured himself in his poems, and in his
“Contest between Homer and Hesiod,” he awards the
prize to himself, claiming that he stands for peace and
plowshares rather than swords and slaughter.
A POET FARMER

51
This bust depicts the
Greek poet Hesiod,
who lived in the
eighth century BCE.
In addition to generating changes in
the occupied regions, the Greek colonies
also stimulated developments in the
motherland.The existence of strong and
independent colonies overseas boosted
trade considerably. Grain from Sicily and
southern Russia was brought to main-
land Greece, while wine, bronze plate,
and high-quality pottery were the main
commodities sent from the motherland
to the colonies.The colonial Greeks then
often sold on these products to indige-
nous rulers in the hinterland.
Finds of pottery and other artifacts in
various locations have enabled archaeol-
ogists to trace trade movements and map
the contacts between Greeks and non-
Greeks. It has been discovered, for
instance, that Carthaginian and Greek
traders supplied bronze products, pottery,
wine, and other luxury articles via inter-
mediaries to chieftains who lived in
remote inland parts of western and cen-
tral Europe.These goods were exchanged
for silver, tin, or slaves.The Celtic chiefs
of Gaul were among those who pros-
pered from trade with the Greeks, as evi-
denced by the number of luxury Greek
items found in their burial chambers.
One particular example was a Greek
bronze krater (a vessel for mixing wine
with water) that was found in the tomb
of a ruler in Vix in the Seine valley.
Poetry of the colonies
Besides bringing Greek architecture,
sculpture, and art to the new settlements,
the colonists also imported Greek poet-
ry. One of these colonial poets was
Archilochus, who, in the seventh century
BCE, left his birthplace on the island of
Paros to go to Thasos (an island off the
Thracian coast), where the inhabitants of
Paros were founding a colony.
Archilochus was one of the first
Greek lyric poets. Unlike the epic poems
of Homer, Archilocus’s work describes
everyday life and the poet’s personal feel-
ings about the world around him. Often
sarcastic in tone, the poems convey
strong feelings about his new life abroad.
Joining an early emigrant voyage to
Thasos, Archilochus experienced first-
hand the rigors of life on the frontier at
that time.The settlement was under con-
stant threat from Thracian tribesmen, and
the settlers found life hard. Archilochus
himself lamented his stay in the “triply
dreadful city of Thasos,” where, as he 
put it, “the dregs of the entire Greek
nation” came together to fight “the
Thracian dogs.” Archilochus’s view of
Thasos gives a fascinating glimpse into
the mind of the Greek colonist, with 
his idealistic view of the paradise over 
the horizon.

THE DARK AGE AND GREEK EXPANSION

SPARTA AND 
ATHENS
T
he rivalry of the two city-states Sparta and Athens formed an
important part of the history of ancient Greece. Both cities
underwent changes in their political structure from the eighth
century BCE onward.
The eighth century BCE saw the emer-
gence in Greece of the polis (plural:
poleis), the city-state.Two city-states that
had very different histories and charac-
teristics were Sparta and Athens.
Sparta
The polis of Sparta had its origins in sev-
eral small settlements on the Eurotas
Plain in Laconia in the southern part of
the Peloponnese. In the 10th century
BCE, the Eurotas Plain was invaded by
warriors who spoke the Doric dialect.
Subduing the native population, the
invaders moved into several villages
grouped near the hills in the center of
the plain and formed the settlement that
was to become Sparta. Over the next
two centuries, the Spartans, as they came
to be called, developed a regime that dif-
fered considerably from that of other
Greek city-states.The highest level of the
social hierarchy of this new polis consist-
ed of the conquering warriors—the
Spartans—who were led by two kings.
The conquered people consisted of
helots, or serfs, and perioikoi, who were
neighboring freemen who recognized
the authority of the Spartan kings.
By the eighth century BCE, Sparta
had expanded to such an extent that
there was not sufficient land in Laconia
to provide a reasonable living for all the
warriors of the growing population. On
the other side of the Taygetus Mountains
lay the highly fertile region of Messenia.
After a lengthy war, the Spartans suc-
ceeded in conquering Messenia toward
the end of the eighth century. From that
time onward, the original settlement on
the Eurotas Plain remained the heart of
the state, while Messenia was regarded as
occupied territory.
The Messenians found the regime
under the Spartans so oppressive that
they revolted in the seventh century
BCE; the rising was only finally put
down after decades of strife. During this
period, the Spartan poet Tyrtaeus wrote
battle songs, and his verses constitute the
oldest written record of Sparta’s history.
In one song, Tyrtaeus describes the
rewards that the conquerors would enjoy
when all the Messenians were made into
helots:“Like heavily laden donkeys, they
will be forced by hard means to hand
over to their masters half of what they
harvest in their fields.”This prophecy was
soon to be fulfilled.
The helots
By the mid-seventh century BCE, Sparta
had finally subdued the Messenians and
was the largest of all the Greek city-
states. Sparta had an immense labor force
of helots to work its fertile lands, making
it also one of the most prosperous city-
states. The helots functioned as serfs,

carrying out all the agricultural work
while their Spartan masters concentrated
on military matters.In time of war,helots
were used to row the long galleys or as
low-ranking soldiers in the field. They
had no civil rights, but in contrast to
slaves, helots could not be owned by
individual Spartans.
Best described as “slaves of the state,”
the helots belonged to particular plots 
of land and could not be bought and 
sold individually. When land was 
allocated to a Spartan citizen, it came
complete with helots, and he was 
not allowed to sell or release them.The
state determined the percentage of 
the harvest that the helots had to hand
over to their masters. The helots were
allowed to keep the remainder of the
food for themselves.
There were a few legal ways for a
helot to secure freedom.A Spartan father
could adopt any children he had by a
helot mother, making the children
Spartan citizens. From the fifth century
BCE onward, helots could earn the sta-
tus of freeman by fighting with the
Spartans as full-fledged soldiers in
wartime. In neither case did the helot
acquire full Spartan civil rights.
Although they were essential for the
agricultural economy, helots were by no
means always well treated. Spartan citi-
zens were vastly outnumbered by helots
and lived in constant fear of an uprising.
Consequently, the Spartans attempted to
keep the helots firmly under control by
systematic humiliation and intimidation.
This treatment included the krypteia—a
kind of secret police in which young
Spartans were enrolled to hunt and kill
helots in the wilderness. This practice
seems to have been a sort of initiation
ritual that involved a period of isolation
followed by the killing of an “enemy.”
However, it is probable that only a few
helots were murdered in this way; a
large-scale culling of the workforce
would have had serious negative eco-
nomic implications.
Perioikoi
The other people who were not entitled
to Spartan civil rights were the
perioikoi—usually translated as neighbors
or out-dwellers. These people were

freemen descended from the pre-Dorian
inhabitants of the region and lived on the
outskirts of the polis. Most of the peri-
oikoi were farmers, and although they
had no political rights within the Spartan
state, their communities were internally
autonomous. In peacetime, Sparta had
little interest in the settlements, but in
times of war, the settlements were
expected to supply soldiers.
Spartan males were trained from 
a young age to become soldiers and 
were banned from engaging in trade or
crafts. For this reason, it was the perioikoi
who formed the class of traders and
craftsmen that exported iron ore, lime-
stone for building, bronze figurines, and
painted pottery.
Lycurgus and the constitution
After the final subjugation of the
Messenians, a number of changes took
place in Spartan society.While the basic
administrative and social structure that
had existed since the conquest of
Laconia continued, it was adapted and
systematized in the late seventh and early
sixth centuries BCE.These reforms have

traditionally been attributed to the great
lawgiver Lycurgus, although it is not
clear whether any such man ever existed.
It is more probable that the reformed
constitution was not the work of one
man, but rather the result of an evolu-
tionary process. However it was arrived
at, the constitution of the revised state is
generally referred to as the Lycurgan
Constitution, to distinguish it from the
earlier society.
Under the Lycurgan Constitution,
the joint rule of two kings continued.
However, apart from their joint com-
mand of the army, most of their func-
tions were purely honorary. The real
power lay not with the kings but with
three other institutions: the assembly, the
council of elders, and the magistrates.
The public assembly, called the apella,
was an assembly of adult warriors with
Spartan civil rights. This assembly had
the power to vote on motions presented
by the council of elders (the gerousia) but
could not propose its own motions. Nor
could the assembly make amendments to
motions laid before it.Voting took place
by means of booing or cheering,the out-
come being determined by the group
that made the most noise.
The most powerful of the governing
bodies was the gerousia, which consisted
of 28 men all aged 60 and above. Each
member was either related to one of the
kings or came from an aristocratic fami-
ly, and they were all elected for life.The
gerousia prepared motions to be debated
in the assembly and served as a Supreme
Court, with authority to try even the
kings if it seemed they had fallen short of
their duties.
When motions were voted on in the
assembly, the volume of noise was judged
by the five ephors (overseers), the highest
magistrates in the polis.These officials, in
whom ultimate authority lay, were elect-
ed annually by the assembly and consti-
tuted the actual government of Sparta,

supervising the entire range of state
affairs. The ephors held regular
meetings with the gerousia,influ-
encing the choice of items to
be debated at the assembly,
and had monthly meetings
with the two kings, at
which the kings pledged
themselves to observe
the laws.
In return,
the ephors promised to
support the kings, pro-
vided the kings did
indeed observe the laws.
If the kings and the ephors
had disagreements,
the
ephors, who had the last
word, could charge the kings
with misconduct, fine them,
dethrone them, and even send
them into exile.
Military training
In Lycurgan Sparta, the army was of
paramount importance, and all Spartan
boys had to undergo rigorous training
from a very early age for a military life.
At birth, infants were inspected by state
officials, and any infants deemed to be
defective were exposed on the moun-
tains and left to die.At the age of seven,
boys were taken from their homes and
brought up in “packs,” which were
supervised by older boys. When they
were twelve,the boys were placed in bar-
racks, where they lived on a basic diet of
porridge enriched with bits of pork.
Their education was primarily physical,
consisting mostly of athletics and combat
sports practiced naked in all weathers
outdoors.Throughout, the emphasis was
on learning to obey orders without hes-
itation and to endure hardships.
At age 20, the warrior graduated and
was allotted a plot of land that would
provide food to feed himself and his fam-
ily. He joined a sussitia (one of the mili-
tary messes) to which he would belong
for the rest of his life, and he became
eligible to vote in the assembly.
Spartan males were conditioned
to relate primarily to other
men. Indeed, part of their
youthful training involved
being paired with another
older boy in what was
almost certainly a sexual
relationship.
Even when a man and
a woman married, they
lived in separate male and
female quarters, although
they were allowed to share
a room at night. Marriage
was endorsed by the state,
since it was necessary to raise
another generation of warriors
and mothers of warriors. Since it
was deemed important that women
should be healthy to bear healthy chil-
dren, great attention was devoted to the
physical education of girls.The girls par-
ticipated—naked, to the amazement of
other Greeks—along with boys in the
athletics program until the age of 18.To
ensure that girls would not embark on
pregnancy too young, the marriageable
age for girls in Sparta was higher than
elsewhere in Greece.
An austere life
From the sixth century BCE, Spartan
society became increasingly austere and
rigid. Everything was focused on the
maintenance of a powerful army, and
Sparta became an introverted communi-
ty where change was seen as undesirable
and strangers were not welcome. The
Spartan ideology was rooted in the pri-
macy of the state over the needs of the
individual. Even today, the word Spartan
carries a connotation of strict austerity in
all aspects of lifestyle.
The settlement of Sparta itself was no
more than a collection of villages, not
worthy of being called a city. With the

exception of a few temples, there were
no stone buildings, only mud huts. The
art of poetry, which had flourished in the
seventh century, died away, and the once
famous bronze and pottery work of
Laconia also declined.
Music and dance remained important
in the religious life of Sparta, but here
too creativity was lacking. Only in 
the military field did Sparta play a
prominent role in Greece. During the
Persian Wars, Sparta assumed the mili-
tary leadership almost automatically, and
the heroic death of King Leonidas and
his followers in the pass of Thermopylae
in 480 BCE reinforced Sparta’s claim to
this leadership.
However, there were some in the
ancient world who admired Sparta not
only for its military strength, but also for
its fine example of virtue, honesty, aus-
terity, and fidelity.The philosopher Plato
declared that Sparta came closest to his
concept of the ideal state. Many histori-
ans, however, would argue that Sparta’s
rival,Athens, would have a greater claim
to the title.
Athens
The city-state of Athens consisted of the
city of Athens and the region surround-
ing it—the Attic Peninsula (generally
called Attica) on the east coast of main-
land Greece. Attica is largely mountain-
ous and dry, but it does have a number of
reasonably fertile plains. It is separated
from central Greece and the Corinthian
isthmus by virtually impassable moun-
tains, but it is enclosed by sea on two
sides and has good natural harbors.These
harbors allowed the people of Attica to
trade by sea and, when necessary, set out
by sea for distant lands.
Athens originated as a Mycenaean
settlement on and around the Acropolis,
a rocky outcrop that lies in the middle of
the largest plain of Attica. Legend has it
that during the Mycenaean period the
Athenian king Theseus united 12 Attican
villages into one polis, but whether this
has any basis in historical fact is not
known. It can, however, be established
that the Mycenaean fortress on the
Acropolis was never destroyed and that
Athens was continuously inhabited from

59
SPARTA AND ATHENS
F
rom around the eight century BCE onward,
the key component of the armies of ancient
Greece was the hoplite.The hoplite was a heavily
armed footsoldier who fought in close formation.
The hoplite took his name from the word hoplon,
meaning a piece of armor. His main weapon was 
a spear that was around 9 feet (2.7 m) long. He
would also carry a short sword for stabbing his
enemies at close quarters.
By the fifth century BCE, the hoplite’s armor
would consist of a large circular shield known as
an aspis, a breastplate, a pair of greaves (shin pro-
tectors), and a helmet.There were various styles
of helmet, but one of the most common was the
Corinthian, which protected both the bridge of
the nose and the cheeks. Early Corinthian hel-
mets also covered the ears, but this design made
hearing difficult. Because soldiers needed to hear
instructions in the heat of battle, later variations
had holes cut out for the ears. In illustrations on
Greek vases, helmets are usually topped by a
magnificent crest, but historians believe that many
helmets did without such decorations. In total,
the armor could weigh up to 60 pounds (27 kg),
so hoplites needed to be very strong.
In battle, the hoplites fought by marching forward
in a dense formation several rows deep.The left-
hand side of each soldier’s shield covered the
right-hand side of the soldier next to him.The
spears of the soldiers further back would go over
the shoulders of the troops in front of them, pre-
senting the enemy with a wall of spears. Once the
two sides engaged, the battle would often degen-
erate into a brutal pushing contest.As soon as
the formation of one side broke apart, the battle
was effectively over.
The hoplites were not professional soldiers, but
rather an army of citizens who took up arms
when the need arose. Because armor was fairly
expensive, the hoplites came from the wealthier
ranks of society. In the case of most cities, the
hoplites had jobs and farms to go back to, so
campaigning seasons were short.
The most fearsome hoplites were those from
Sparta.Although they were not professional sol-
diers, in the sense of being a paid, standing army,
the fact that all Spartan men trained in military
skills from birth meant that Spartan hoplites were
fitter, more organized, and more disciplined than
those from other cities.
This relief from the fifth century BCE depicts two
hoplites following a chariot and carrying the typical
round shield (aspis) and long spear.
THE HOPLITE 

the late Helladic period, through the
Dark Age, to the Archaic period. There 
is therefore a grain of truth in the 
claim by the Athenians that they were
the original indigenous Greeks whose
domain had never been conquered 
by invaders.
Social groups
As far as its social and political structure
was concerned,Athens followed the pat-
tern of many of the other Greek city-
states. There were three distinct social
groups. Dominating the others were the
hippei—horsemen or knights.These men
were the aristocrats who owned the most
land, which was usually worked by their
tenants. In the second rank were the
zeugitai, men who owned a zeugos or
yoke for a pair of oxen.These men were
farmers who owned enough land to be
economically independent. Below both
of these groups were the thetes,who were
small farmers and day laborers. In princi-
ple, all these groups, from the aristocrats
to the landless, were Athenian citizens.
This situation was fairly unusual, because
in many city-states, land ownership and
civil rights were linked.
From the seventh century BCE, or
perhaps earlier, Athens had a board 
of nine magistrates, called the archons,
who were elected annually.
These archons were always
drawn from the ranks of
the aristocracy. Ex-archons
became members of the
areopagus, a council named
after the place where it
convened, the Areos Pagos,
or hill of the god Ares.
Social tension
Athens experienced enor-
mous social tension in the
seventh century BCE. Poor
small farmers frequently
lost their land to richer
landholders and were sub-
sequently forced to rent
farmland at an exorbitant
rate—one sixth of the
yield, which was a high
price to pay in the relative-
ly dry and infertile Attica
region. Anyone who could
not pay the rent was de-
clared a debtor, and credi-
tors were merciless in
enforcing 
their 
claims
against debtors.
People
who could not pay were
often sold into slavery,
together with their wives

and children.This conflicted greatly with
the notion that all Athenians had equal
rights in the polis. Growing discontent
brought with it the danger of civil
unrest, and the constant competition
among the aristocrats led to the fear that
one of them might take advantage of the
situation and seize power for himself.
Solon
One way to deal with the social tension
was to reform the law. At the beginning
of the sixth century BCE, an aristocrat
named Solon, who had been a distin-
guished general, was appointed chief
archon with special powers to revise the
law and act as an arbitrator to avoid the
threat of civil war. Solon was to go down
in Greek history as an outstanding exam-
ple of a wise lawgiver, and many institu-
tions from a later period were also attrib-
uted to him.
One of Solon’s first decisions was to
invite a number of emigrants and exiles
to return to Athens. Some of these peo-
ple had been banished from the country
for political reasons, while others had
fled due to the huge burden of debt
incurred as tenant farmers. To enable
people in the latter group to return,
Solon negotiated the cancellation of all
their debts. He also abolished debt slav-
ery, making it impossible for someone to
guarantee a debt with his own person.All
the debt slaves who could be traced had
their freedoms purchased for them.
Besides being a economic reformer,
Solon was also a poet. He recorded his
reforms in the following verses: “I gave
Athens, divine city, back its sons; men
who were sold either lawfully or unlaw-
fully; men who were driven from their
native country by poverty; vagrants who
had almost forgotten how to speak their
own language.I did this by using the laws
and powers given to me.”
It is not clear whether anything was
done to prevent a new buildup of debts.
Poor Athenians probably had to work as
agricultural laborers from then on, while
some people may have found work in
the newly emerging industries.
Political changes
In addition to his efforts in the econom-
ic field, Solon was active in political
reform. He decreed that all free citizens
of Attica be allowed to vote in the pub-
lic assembly, the ecclesia. Other political
rights were linked to a division of the
citizens into classes. These classes were
defined by Solon according to a new cri-
terion based solely on property; previ-
ously, birth had been the most important
factor. The classification was based on
annual income expressed in terms of
quantities of grain, and there were four
groups. In addition to the thetes, zeugitai,
and hippeis, a new group was formed.

62
ANCIENT GREECE
U
nlike the women of Sparta, women in Athens
had a very low status.Although nominally
Athenian citizens, the women were not allowed
to vote or to attend the assembly, and their abili-
ty to inherit property was very limited.
Most Athenian women were virtually confined to
the home, where they spent their days in domes-
tic duties such as looking after the children, spin-
ning and weaving to make clothes for the family,
and cleaning. Upper-class women had slaves to
perform these duties and needed only to oversee
the work.A woman was always in the guardian-
ship of a man, either her husband, her father, or
her brother. Only lower-class women worked—
perhaps cleaning streets or participating in a
menial trade.
Even in the home, women were segregated from
the affairs of men and spent most of their time in
the women’s quarters, where men seldom went.
Athenian society was very much a man’s society,
and a woman’s main role was to give birth,
particularly to male infants. Fathers had the right
to reject an infant of the wrong sex, and it seems
that infanticide was a regular occurrence.
A girl was raised in the women’s quarters and
might see her father only rarely.When she was
seven, she might attend school to learn to read
and write, and by the time she was 12 or 14, she
was considered ready for marriage.
A woman’s life expectancy was 36 years, less 
than that of a man, which was probably because,
marrying young, women were worn out by child-
bearing. However, many women did survive their
husbands, who might have been considerably
older. If a widow remarried, her inheritance
became the property of her new husband.

Greek women drawing water from a well.Women in
ancient Athens would have spent most of their time
performing household tasks.
ATHENIAN WOMEN

63
SPARTA AND ATHENS
This new group, the pentakosiomedimnoi
(five hundred medimners), comprised
men with an annual income of more
than 500 medimnoi (roughly 1,500
cubic feet or 420 hectoliters) of grain, or
the equivalent. This new class was a
group of the superrich (distinct from the
broader group of hippeis) who were
granted the honor of performing duties
connected with the guardianship of the
temple of the goddess Athena, and only
they and the hippeis could be elected to
the position of archon.
All Athenians had the opportunity to
appeal against decisions made by the
archons. In order to facilitate this, Solon
turned the public assembly into the
highest court of justice.A separate “peo-
ple’s court” and a council of 400 mem-
bers drawn from the upper three classes
were also attributed to Solon, though
they may have originated at a later date.
Solon’s reforms did not please every-
body. The rich and privileged had to
make sacrifices, while the poorer people
were disappointed that Solon had not
redistributed enough land. However, his
reforms did achieve their goal,which was
to make social justice a cornerstone 
of the Athenian state. Solon described 
his reforms as follows: “I gave the 
people the necessary power,without giv-
ing them too much honor; and I took
away the excess power from the nobility,
without offending their noble feelings
unnecessarily. In this way the people 
follow their leaders without the 
leaders holding the reins too tightly or
too loosely.”
Solon’s measures temporarily endorsed
the dominance of the aristocracy while
allowing the lower classes to become
more involved in politics.The new prop-
erty criteria made social advancement
easier—an important social change that
meant it was no longer necessary to be
descended from the nobility to enjoy
upperclass privileges—high income was
sufficient. Some time after Solon, the
aristocratic structure was to be replaced
by a timocratic structure—one in which
political power was in proportion to
property ownership.

FROM TYRANNY TO
DEMOCRACY
I
n the seventh and sixth centuries BCE, Greece saw the rise of
tyranny as a system of government when politicians such as
Cypselus in Corinth and Peisistratus in Athens gained power. Later,
a new form of democracy arose in Athens.
During the Archaic period (c. 750–500
BCE), there was much social unrest in
the burgeoning city-states of Greece.
Some of this unrest was relieved by col-
onization, while attempts were made at
home to reduce the gap between rich
and poor. For example, in Athens in the
sixth century BCE, the lawgiver Solon
specifically addressed the rights of the
poor by abolishing debt slavery. Another
way of dealing with the internal social
problems in the Greek communities was
the institution of tyranny.
The word tyrannos was not originally
Greek; it was borrowed from the Lydian
language and was used to refer to an
absolute ruler who had taken power ille-
gally. Such a ruler was not necessarily a
“tyrant” in the modern sense of the
word, since an unlawful sovereign was
not necessarily a cruel or unjust one.
However, the fact that the Greeks adopt-
ed a foreign word for this new political
phenomenon indicated that they viewed
it as alien to the idea of a polis (city-state)
as a community of citizens.
The age of the tyrants
During the Archaic period, individual
aristocrats all over Greece took advan-
tage of infighting among the nobility to
seize power. In most cases, the details of
how they came to power are not known,
but what evidence there is suggests there
may have been military coups.The new
tyrants had clearly received support from
aristocratic friends and followers, and
sometimes from another state.They may
also have used mercenary troops, which
were a new phenomenon at the time.To
win the support of the populace, they
often promised various rewards, such as
grants of land, thereby turning social dis-
content to their own advantage.
One of the first tyrants was Cypselus.
Around 657 BCE, he drove out the rul-
ing aristocracy in Corinth. During the
next 150 years, tyranny became the most
common form of government in the
Greek world; of the more important
city-states only Sparta and Aegina appear
to have escaped it. Many of these tyrants
were quite popular, particularly among
the middle-class, mercantile populace
who had been denied any social privi-
leges by the previous aristocratic rule.
Some tyrants were also popular because
they stimulated local patriotism and
organized cults and festivals that celebrat-
ed the local gods.
The tyrannies followed a similar pat-
tern in each state. Eventually, popular
feeling would move against a dictator-
ship, as councils and tribal meetings were
excluded from power and the tyrant
placed himself above the law.
Most tyrants decreed their rule
hereditary, but the people tended to

unite against the second or third genera-
tion. As resistance against a tyrant
increased, he would typically take harsh
measures in an attempt to remain in
power. However, the will of the people
would eventually prevail, and he would
be ousted. One result of the phenome-
non of tyranny was that by undermining
the position of the aristocracy, it paved
the way for democracy.
The tyranny in Corinth
After around 750 BCE, Corinth became
the most important port and the most
prosperous city in Greece.Its situation on
the south of the isthmus joining central
Greece to the Peloponnese made
Corinth a crucial trading point. It had
harbors on both sides of the isthmus, and
to avoid the dangerous journey around
the Peloponnese, many traders arranged

for their goods to be transferred at
Corinth to wagons to be transported to
the other side, where they could be
shipped again. Trade with states on the
eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea
thrived, and after the Greek colonization
of southern Italy and Sicily, trade with
the west increased as well.
Corinth was also the center of a pros-
perous export industry in earthenware.
Corinthian pottery, painted in exquisite
detail, was shipped out to destinations in
every direction, outselling any other pot-
tery of the time. Most of this commercial
activity was dominated by the Bacchiad
family, an aristocratic clan that ruled 
over Corinth.
Around 657 BCE, the resentment of
the mercantile class against the Bacchiads
boiled over into revolution, and a new
leader called Cypselus was put in place as
a tyrant. Cypselus proved himself to be a
mild and popular dictator, who needed
no bodyguard. According to a popular
legend about his birth, Cypselus was a
hero favored by the gods. He belonged
to the same class as the aristocracy and
yet was an outsider.
The rule of Periander
Under Cypselus and, later, his son
Periander, the prosperity of Corinth
reached new highs. Colonies were
founded on the eastern coast of the
Adriatic Sea, to develop the trade route
to Italy. Periander built a slipway 5 miles
(8 km) long across the isthmus so ships
could be put on trolleys and dragged

FROM TYRANNY TO DEMOCRACY
One legend that became popular 
in Corinth after Cypselus came to
power tells the story of his birth.
Cypselus’s mother, Labda, was a
member of the Bacchiad clan but
had been rejected by her family
because of a handicap. She married 
a stranger named Eetion and bore
him a son. Oracles prophesied that
the child would grow up to destroy
the ruling dynasty.When members
of the Bacchiad clan heard of this,
they arrived at the child’s home
with the intention of killing him.
However, his mother hid the infant
in a wooden chest, called a kypsele
in Greek, and the child escaped.
Taking his name from the word
kypsele, Cypselus grew up in a village
outside Corinth.When he became
an adult, another oracle ordered
him to return to the city and seize
power from the ruling Bacchiads.
This legend is similar to many 
others in which an infant is hunted
but survives, later to become a
great ruler.The story of Moses in
the Bible is just one such tale.

from one side to the other. The tolls
from this facility greatly increased the
city’s wealth.
Periander ruled from 625 to 585
BCE and showed himself to be a wily
statesman. He extended the power of
Corinth both by the sword and by diplo-
macy. When Mytilene and Athens were
in dispute over the ownership of a
colony in 600 BCE, Periander was asked
to adjudicate between them. He came
down on the side of Athens, which made
the city a valuable ally.
During Periander’s reign, Corinth
also became a center of culture, where
poets and musicians congregated. He
inaugurated many public building works,
giving rise to the architectural style
known as the Doric order.
However, the rule of Periander had a
darker side. He was subject to violent
mood swings, and he was ruthless in exe-
cuting anyone he thought threatened his
power. His actions, as related by the 
fifth-century-BCE historian Herodotus,
caused his tyranny to deteriorate into a
reign of terror.
Periander died in 585 BCE and was
succeeded by his nephew Psammetichus,
who was deposed following a rebellion
in the third year of his reign. The gov-
ernment of Corinth was then taken over
by a group of aristocrats, who established
an oligarchy (rule by an elite).
The tyranny in Athens
Although the inspired lawgiver Solon
had produced a new code of law for
Athens in the early sixth century BCE, it
was still far from becoming a democracy.
Solon had granted civil rights to the
poorer Athenians and put an end to debt
slavery, but he had done little to secure
the economic future of the poor. Rivalry
between landed and landless people con-
tinued, as did rivalry within the aristoc-

This anecdote from the historian
Herodotus describes the downfall of
the tyranny in Corinth:
“Periander sent an envoy to the
tyrant Thrasybulus of Miletus to ask
him the best way to rule without
conflict.Thrasybulus took a walk
through a cornfield with the envoy,
while questioning him about the sit-
uation in Corinth. Now and then
the tyrant would stop and cut off
the largest ears of corn that rose
above the others. In this way he
destroyed the best of the corn, and
he later sent the envoy away with-
out having given him an answer.
“When the envoy returned to
Corinth, Periander asked him what
Thrasybulus had advised.The 
envoy replied that he had received
no answer, and he also expressed
surprise that Periander had sent 
him to a man who had nothing bet-
ter to do than destroy the best 
part of his crop. But Periander

racy. Against this unsettled background,
a politician called Peisistratus gained
the support of the common people
and managed to seize power in a coup
described by Herodotus:
“At that time [561 BCE] a civil war
was raging in Attica between the coastal
party and the plains party.Taking advan-
tage of their quarrel, Peisistratus devised
a plan to become tyrant of Athens by
forming a third party.This was the party
from over the hills.He mobilized a group
of followers and won victory by means
of a clever trick. One day he wounded
himself before coming to the market.
There, he said that he had miraculously
escaped from his enemies, who had tried
to kill him.To protect himself from fur-
ther attacks, he asked for an official
bodyguard.The Athenians gave him per-
mission to arm a group of 300 citizens
with clubs.With the aid of these people
Peisistratus rebelled and succeeded in
capturing first the Acropolis and subse-
quently the seat of government.”
The plains party referred to by
Herodotus consisted of old, aristocratic
families from the region surrounding the
city of Athens. The coastal party was
more democratic and consisted of sever-
al families, the most important of which
were the Alcmaeonidae. Their domain
lay along the coast to the south of
Athens. Peisistratus’s party “from over the
hills” was probably a splinter group from
the coastal party. The phrase “over the
hills” may refer to Peisistratus’s power
base on the east coast of Attica, on 
the other side (from Athens) of the
Hymettos Mountain ridge.
The return of Peisistratus
Soon after Peisistratus had established
himself as the tyrant of Athens, however,
he was driven out again by the two rival
groups of aristocrats. Five years later, he
returned from exile and to power with
the help of his former rival Megacles.
Herodotus described what happened 
as follows:
70
ANCIENT GREECE
The Acropolis in
Athens was a 
focal point of the
city during the 
reign of the 
tyrant Peisistratus.

71
FROM TYRANNY TO DEMOCRACY
“As soon as Peisistratus had left, the
two groups who had banished him began
to quarrel. Finally Megacles, the leader
of the coastal party, sent an envoy
to Peisistratus. Peisistratus would be
returned to power if he agreed to marry
the daughter of Megacles. Peisistratus
agreed to the proposal, and together they
designed a plan to accomplish the return
of the tyrant.”
This plan involved dressing up
a woman as the goddess Pallas
Athena, guardian of the city of
Athens, and arranging for her to
travel through the city, preceded
by heralds who announced that
the goddess was leading Peisis-
tratus back to his rightful place.
The plan appears to have worked.
For a while, Peisistratus resumed his role
as tyrant, but the alliance with the
coastal party and the marriage to
Megacles’s daughter soon broke down.
Once again, Peisistratus was forced to
flee Athens.
During the following decade,
Peisistratus first accumulated a great
deal of wealth, mainly from the gold
and silver mines in Thrace. He then
concentrated on building good relations
with states and individuals who might be
prepared to supply funds and mercenar-
ies to support his planned coup in
Athens. In 546 BCE, he landed with an
army at Marathon, on the east coast of
Attica. Marching towards Athens, he was
joined by other disaffected forces. The
Athenians sent out an army to meet him,
and at the Battle of Pallene, Peisistratus
was victorious. He entered Athens as its
tyrant and this time remained in power
for more than 19 years.
The rule of Peisistratus
Peisistratus was a benign tyrant. He took
no revenge against his opponents, and he
upheld the laws laid down by Solon. He
imposed very moderate taxation on the
populace, and, under his rule, trade and
industry flourished.In his efforts to make
Athens the political center of Attica,
Peisistratus organized great “national”
religious festivals, such as the Diony-
sian festivals at which tragedies were
performed.The Panathenaea—the cele-
bration of the city goddess Pallas
Athena—was also turned into a
great festival. The Iliad and
the Odyssey, the two great
epic poems of Homer,
were recited at this and
other events.
An important social
institution introduced by Peisi-
stratus was the one of traveling
judges, who visited the villages
of Attica, listened to cases, and
dispensed justice. Peisistratus also
initiated a great road-building pro-
gram, which made communicating
and traveling around Attica much
easier in general.
Many substantial construction
projects were also undertaken to
emphasize the great importance of
Athens and its ruling family. Poorer
Athenians seem to have benefited
under his rule from a redistribution
of land, as well as from the stimula-
tion of trade and industry.The pot-
tery industry in particular flour-
ished. During Peisistratus’s rule,
Athenian black-figure pottery came
to supersede all other pottery on
the Mediterranean markets.
Hippias
Peisistratus was succeeded in 527
BCE by his son Hippias (see
box, page 75), who continued his
father’s policy of making Athens a

cultural center. However, opposition to
his rule was growing.The powerful fam-
ily of the Alcmaeonidae had gathered
together a large group of exiles on the
Peloponnese.These disaffected Athenians
managed to gain the support of the
Spartans, who were trying to expand
their territory northward. A Spartan
army joined in an invasion of Attica in
510 BCE. Hippias and his supporters
were trapped on the Acropolis. Hippias
was deposed but allowed to go into exile.
He subsequently left for a colony in the
Dardanelles. His departure brought more
than 35 years of Athenian tyranny to an
end.
An agricultural economy
Trade and industry flourished in Greece
throughout the time of Cypselus and
Peisistratus. However, the main econom-
ic activity of most people was agricul-
ture. Some 90 percent of the population
were farmers, making a living growing
olives, figs, grapes, and fruit, as well as
cultivating crops such as grain, beans, and
green vegetables.
Farming methods were primitive.
Plowing was done by means of a wood-
en plow drawn by oxen, which, rather
than turning the earth, merely scratched
the surface. At first, farmers had to leave
a field fallow every year or so to allow it
to regain fertility, but by around 400
BCE, they had learned the art of crop
rotation. Most Greek farms were small,
although there was the occasional large
holding. The work was carried out by
individual farmer-landholders or by ten-
ant farmers or serfs.
Olive oil was a major agricultural
product. It was an important source of
export revenue, and, at home, it was used
universally in cooking and for lamp oil.
Olive oil also had a significant part to
play in religious ceremonies.
Craftsman had a low status in Archaic
Greece.Potters,smiths,tanners,and other
craftsmen generally worked in small
workshops, which were usually run as a
family business. Textile production was
a domestic industry carried out by
women. Only a small handful of people
in each polis could have survived by

FROM TYRANNY TO DEMOCRACY

doing non-agricultural work. The low
esteem in which craftsmen were held
is summed up by the fourth century-
BCE author Xenophon in the
following words:
“Craftsmanship has a bad
name and is quite rightly
greatly despised. . . . It makes
such demands on a man that
he can no longer devote him-
self to his friends or to the
polis. Such people must be
bad friends and bad defenders
of their nation. . . . The best
occupations are farming and
the waging of war.”
Working at a trade seems to
have been equated with a lack of
freedom. The work of the farmer
was rated more highly than that of the
“wage slave,” who was dependent on his
employer, or the work of the craftsman
or small trader, who was dependent on
his customers.
The link between war and the economy is 
illustrated by the fact that the world’s first coins
were probably produced to pay mercenaries.
These coins were minted at the end of the 
seventh century BCE by the kings of Lydia in
Anatolia.The coins were made from pieces of
electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver, and
were stamped on one side with a mark that
guaranteed their weight, and thus their value.
Around 600 BCE, Greek cities on the coast of
Anatolia, notably Ephesus and Miletus, began to
mint their own coins.These coins were made of
silver and were marked with the stamp of the
polis that issued them. Over the next century,
this practice of issuing coins was adopted by
Greek states in Europe. Under the Athenian
tyrants,Athenian coins were issued stamped
with the emblem of an owl, representing the
goddess Pallas Athena.
While the use of coinage remained limited in
Lydia during the sixth century BCE, it acquired
great importance in facilitating trade in Greece,
and small bronze coins appeared alongside the
silver ones. However, the introduction of
coinage did not create a full monetary economy.
Barter remained the staple form of exchange.
WAR AND COINAGE

Most trade in Greece at this time was
on a very small scale. Such trade as there
was was either carried on by farmers,
who brought their surplus product to the
market, or by craftsmen, who sold their
goods to customers in the workshops.
Professional traders—those who bought
the products of others in order to resell
them at a profit—were rare. Only rich
merchants engaged in this type of over-
seas trade, and they were wealthy enough
to build their own ships and employ
others to undertake the trading
voyages. Nevertheless, howev-
er small-scale or marginal it
was, trade in the Archaic
period still offered great
opportunities for per-
sonal enrichment.
War booty was
another important
source of income
in Archaic Greece.
The booty taken
on military enter-
prises provided a
major source of
wealth for aggressive
city-states. With wars
waged almost constantly
among the many Greek
states, booty was probably as
important a source of income as
agricultural production.
A return to democracy
After Hippias was deposed in 510 BCE,
the aristocrat Cleisthenes (570–508
BCE) seized the opportunity to establish
a new democracy based on the political
emancipation of the demos, or common
people. In the words of the fifth-century
BCE historian Herodotus: “Cleisthenes
made the demos his partners.”
Cleisthenes was a member of the
Alcmaeonid family, the clan that had
opposed the tyrant Peisistratus some 50
years earlier. Cleisthenes was the son of
Megacles, who had been both an ally 
and an enemy of the tyrant. The
Alcmaeonidae had been exiled several
times during the late sixth century BCE;
Cleisthenes himself was banished from
Athens for some 20 years.He returned to
take a prominent part in the overthrow
of Hippias.
Cleisthenes instigated a program of
political reforms between 510 and 507
BCE. His new constitution, under which
the political weight in Athens shifted
from the aristocrats to the demos, took
effect around 502 BCE. A crucial
part of his reforms was to
improve the civil rights of
both the thetes (the small
landless farmers and day
workers) and the zeugi-
tai (the economically
independent 
farm-
ers). Under Solon, the
zeugitai
had 
been
allowed political off-
ice, and during the
reign of tyranny, many
of them had become
prosperous enough to be
able to afford the full suit
of armor required to be a
hoplite. Their role as hoplites
had become increasingly signifi-
cant;
their importance to the
military security of the polis was 
almost certainly an influential factor in
Cleisthenes’s decision to enlist their
political support.
The Council of 500
The nucleus of Cleisthenes’s reforms was
the creation of a new institution, the
Council of 500, which may have been an
extension of an earlier council estab-
lished by Solon, but with wider powers.
The Council of 500 became the pivotal
point of political life in Athens, although
the ultimate power of decision making
lay with the ecclesia, or public assembly.

FROM TYRANNY TO DEMOCRACY
H
ippias, the son of Peisistratus, was 40 years
old when he succeeded his father in 527
BCE. He ruled with the help of his younger
brother, Hipparchus, who was instrumental in
bringing two distinguished poets—Anacreon and
Simonides—to Athens, strengthening its growing
reputation as the cultural center of Greece.
Around 514 BCE, a plot to assassinate both
Hippias and Hipparchus was hatched by
two young aristocrats, Harmodius and
Aristogeiton, who were lovers.The assassi-
nation was planned as an act of personal revenge.
Hipparchus had apparently made advances to
Harmodius but was rejected, spurring Hipparchus
to offer a public insult to Harmodius’s sister.The
assassination plot failed. Only Hipparchus was
killed, and in the botched attempt, Harmodius
was cut down by Hippias’s bodyguard.
Aristogeiton was later tortured to death.After
this attempt on his life, Hippias ruled with great
severity, which accelerated the end
of his tyranny.When Hippias was
finally deposed, Harmodius and
Aristogeiton were hailed as “tyrant
killers,” and their act was commemorated
in an annual religious festival.
After Hippias was forced into exile,
he eventually traveled to Persia and
obtained an appointment at the royal
court as an advisor to Darius I. In 490
BCE, Hippias, approaching 80, returned
with the Persian army to Marathon,
where he had landed more than
50 years earlier with his father,
Peisistratus, and an invading army.
The idea was that, after the
Persian victory, Hippias would be
reinstated as tyrant of Athens,
under Persian rule. However,
things did not go according to
plan—the Athenians defeated the
Persians, and Hippias had to flee,
along with the remains of the
Persian army. Disappointed
and disillusioned, the aged
tyrant died aboard ship on
the return voyage.
This sculpture depicts the “tyrant
killers” Harmodius and Aristogeiton. It
is a Roman copy of a statue originally
made by the Greek sculptor Kritios.
HIPPIAS,THE LAST ATHENIAN TYRANT

Farmers harvest

illustration from the
sixth century BCE.
The Council consisted of 10 groups,
each with 50 men, selected annually by a
complex system that ensured each of the
10 groups represented the total polis.The
same principle was applied to the hoplite
army, which was also split into 10 sub-
divisions. The intention behind this
system was to avoid a situation where all
the citizens living in a particular region
could join together to form a section of
the Council or a division of the army.A
scenario like that might have allowed the
most powerful aristocrats in a given
region to gain political or military con-
trol of Athens.
Under the new system, the entire
Athenian citizenry was split into 10 sec-
tions, called phylae, with each section
representing the polis in miniature. To
form the phylae,the local communities in
Attica were divided into 10 urban, 10
coastal, and 10 rural districts.Three dis-
tricts—one urban, one coastal, and one
rural—were then selected and combined
into one phyle.The resulting phyle was a
completely artificial unit; its urban,
coastal, and rural sections often did not
even adjoin. The purpose was to thor-
oughly mix the population of Attica in
order to prevent the rise of regional
power. The ten phylae
formed by
Cleisthenes were the basis of all the dem-
ocratic institutions in Athens.
Soon after Cleisthenes initiated his
political reforms, ostracism was intro-
duced. This practice was a means to
enable the citizens of Athens to banish
for 10 years anyone they deemed to be a
threat—for instance, anyone suspected of
planning to seize power. Every year, the
Athenian citizens voted in the public
assembly on whether they considered a
political banishment was necessary, and if
the answer was yes, a quorum of 6,000
citizens assembled at a later date. Each of
these citizens had to scratch the name of
the political leader he wanted banished
on a potsherd (a fragment of broken
pottery). Whoever received the most
votes had to leave the city for 10 years.
The potsherd on which a vote was
recorded was called an ostracon, hence
the term ostracism.
Democracy in practice
The system of government in Athens was
a direct democracy.The most important
element of government was the ecclesia,
which was a general assembly of all citi-
zens. Other administrative bodies were
composed of either the entire citizenry
or a number of representatives,who were
sometimes elected but were usually
appointed by lot.
Most of the important political deci-
sions were made by the ecclesia, which in
the fifth century BCE met around 10 or
11 times a year. Extra meetings could be
convened if exceptional circumstances
76
ANCIENT GREECE

77
FROM TYRANNY TO DEMOCRACY
made it necessary. However, the agenda
for meetings of the ecclesia was set by the
Council of 500, which therefore exerted
a great influence on the assembly. Apart
from subjects such as the grain supply,
military affairs, and the appointment of
magistrates—all of which had to be
addressed—the Council determined
what would be dealt with at each meet-
ing. The public assembly could accept
the Council’s agenda but could also add
alternative suggestions or new items for
discussion. Because the public assembly
had the last word,a powerful Council did
not necessarily pose a threat to the
Athenian democracy.
The preliminary work that was nec-
essary for the Council to draw up the
agenda took a great deal of time.
Discussions within the smaller body of
the Council were more efficient than
consulting with the several thousand
members of the public assembly. For this
reason, the assembly was prepared to
delegate less important matters and
emergency decisions to the Council.
Membership of the Council
Members of the Council were citizens
and 30 years of age or older. They held
the position for a period of one year and
never served more than twice in a life-
time.The Council members were drawn
from all over Attica—50 men from each
of the 10 phylae. Within each phyle,
Council members were chosen by lot
from a pool of candidates supplied by all
the villages and urban districts. In the
small communities, every adult male
probably had a chance to serve on the
Council at least once, which was less
likely in the larger communities.
The Council met frequently but was
not in permanent session.One of its tasks
was to carry out the decisions made by
the public assembly. Since this task
required an administration that was avail-
able all the time, the prytane system was
created. The prytane was a kind of per-
manent committee of Council members.
Each of the 50-man groups taken from
the 10 phylae served for one of the 10
months of the Athenian year.
This ancient Greek
relief depicts
athletes training.

The daily administration
was formed by the 50
men of the prytane. A
smaller group selected
from the 50 was ready
and available 24 hours
a day, living together
for this purpose in a
building on the agora,
the open space where
the public assembly was
sometimes held. The
prytanes
prepared,
convened, and re-
cessed meetings of
the Council and
the assembly and
received 
envoys,
messengers, com-
plaints, and a wide
range of requests.
Because the Greeks
liked to introduce a
competitive element in-
to everything they did,
the various prytanes com-
peted for the title of “best
prytane of the year.”
Every 24 hours, the prytane
had a different chairman, also
appointed by lot. A man could hold
this chairmanship only once in his
lifetime, but an ordinary man from
a small village in Attica had a good
chance of becoming chairman of
the daily administration, an indication
that direct democracy really worked.
Each village had to supply a number
of Council members each year, and
because the number of men who were
30 years of age and older was limited, it
was highly probable that every eligible
male would be selected at least once.
Once chosen, he would belong to the
prytane administration for a month, and
with 35 or 36 days in the Athenian
month, he would have a 70 percent
chance of being appointed chairman.
In the fifth century BCE,
the chairman of the prytane
also acted as chairman of
the Council and the
public assembly if those
bodies happened to
meet on that day. He
was also in charge of the
city seal and the keys to
the temples, which also
functioned as the city’s
treasury. These were
heavy responsibilities
for a farmer from a
small village.
Limitations
Athenian democracy
had several limita-
tions.
All citizens
were allowed to par-
ticipate in direct de-
mocracy, regardless of
their descent and the
amount of property they
owned, but not everyone
living in the polis was a
citizen. First of all, women
were excluded. This is not
surprising; women were excluded
from almost all public life in Greece.
Although nominally citizens (if born
to citizens), women were considered
apolitical beings and had virtually
no civil rights.
Other criteria for entitlement to cit-
izenship included being free (slaves had
no civil rights whatsoever), being of
Athenian descent (immigrants who set-
tled in Attica could not become citizens),
and being an adult. Relatively few men
were full Athenian citizens; democracy
was intended for a small minority of 
the population.
Also, even though there were tens of
thousands of citizens from all over Attica
who were eligible to attend the public
assembly, it seems unlikely that very

many did so.Although it was their right,
it was not their obligation. Many lived
too far away or were simply unable or
unwilling to miss a day’s work. Because
of these factors, it seems probable that
only a minority of the citizens actually
attended the assembly,even when impor-
tant issues were being discussed. Indeed,
there was only enough room for around
6,000 men on the Pnyx, the hill in
Athens where the assembly usually con-
vened after the end of the sixth century
BCE. Although 6,000 men represented
only a small proportion of those who
were eligible to vote, it was apparently
still considered enough to be termed the
“entire population of Athens.”
However, thanks to Cleisthenes’s
reforms, a participatory democracy—at
least in theory—had been created in
Athens by the end of the sixth century
BCE. Whether or not they did so, all
citizens had the right to participate col-
lectively in the government of the polis.
A threat from the east
As the sixth century BCE drew to a
close,a new danger threatened the young
Athenian democracy.The Persians in the
east were looking to Anatolia to expand
their immense empire. Under their king
Cambyses II, the Persians had already
annexed the Ionian cities on the
Anatolian west coast, thereby extending
Persian rule from the Indus River right
to the Aegean Sea. It was looking
increasingly likely that the Persians
would try to subdue the small city-states
of mainland Greece, which was now on
the frontier of the Persian Empire.

GREEK
RELIGION
T
he ancient Greeks worshipped a wide array of gods, many of
whom were believed to dwell on Mount Olympus.Worship
was usually carried out openly, although more secretive mystery
cults were also popular.
Greek religion was polytheistic in nature,
meaning that it involved the worship of
many gods. The Greeks believed that
these deities had a profound influence on
life on earth. Most of the gods were
believed to have human form and,
although they were immortal, they had
many mortal defects, being prey to lust,
jealousy, anger, and other human failings.
In order to propitiate a god, the Greeks
offered prayers, sacrifices, and public fes-
tivals to win divine approval and help in
their human endeavors.
The first Greek gods
The origins of the Greeks’ religion lie far
back in antiquity. When the first Indo-
European tribes reached mainland
Greece around 2000 BCE, they brought
with them a warlike religion presided
over by a patriarchal god.This deity was a
universal divine father figure worshipped
by Indo-European peoples from India to
western Europe. The Greeks knew him 
as Zeus, the king of the gods who lived
on Mount Olympus (see box, page 84).
Other deities of Indo-European heritage
were Helios,the sun god,and Eos Aurora,
the goddess of dawn.
In Minoan Crete,many female deities
were worshipped, and they may have
been adapted later by the mainland
Greeks. The Linear B tablets from the
Mycenaean era (c. 1600–1250 BCE)
mention several gods who are later found
in the Greek pantheon, such as Zeus,
Hera, Dionysus, and Hermes. It is certain
that by the time of Archaic Greece (c.
750–500 BCE) multiple influences had
contributed to the family of Greek gods;
often, they would become merged with
similar deities from neighboring regions,
a process known as syncretism.
One Greek god whose characteristics
were derived from a variety of sources
was Apollo. He was the main god of the
Dorian people, who invaded mainland
Greece around 1250 BCE after the col-
lapse of the Mycenaean civilization. As
well as being a sun deity,Apollo was also
the god of music and dance. In this
aspect of his personality, he may have had
Minoan antecedents. Apollo the archer,
the god who brought disease with his
arrows, may have had Semitic or Hittite
connections. In some cases, the influ-
ences from the east were very strong.The
Greek goddess of love,Aphrodite, shared
many similarities with the Phoenician
deity Astarte, who in turn was closely
related to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar.
In addition to the chief gods and
goddesses, the Greeks recognized the
existence of heroes (including demigods,
or deified mortals) and spirits of various
kinds, both good and evil. Greek myths
also featured a number of odd creatures
that combined the characteristics of

different animals. Many were associated
with Dionysus, the popular god of wine
and pleasure. These creatures included
satyrs, which had the legs of a goat or
horse and the upper body of a man, and
centaurs, which had the head and torso
of a man and the body of a horse.There
were also various types of nymphs,which
were beautiful female spirits associated
with natural features such as trees, rivers,
and springs.
The temples
Each god had his or her own temple, and
one god might have many temples spread
throughout Greece.An image of the god
was kept in the temple, which at first was
a simple wooden construction but was
later made of stone.These stone temples
were larger than the earlier ones and
were surrounded by a colonnade. In the
center was a small chamber in which the
idol of the god was housed.The temple

also had an altar, which was usually 
situated outside at the front.The altar was
used for sacrifices.
Greek religious life featured a num-
ber of rituals and celebrations, which
were carried out throughout the year
and were often shared by the entire com-
munity. Each city had its own patron god
or goddess—Athena was the goddess of
Athens, for example—with temples ded-
icated to him or her. The patron was
honored with prayers, sacrifices, proces-
sions, and festivals of song, dance, poetry,
drama, and athletics.
Sacrifices
The Greeks believed that the gods repre-
sented vast forces of nature before which
humans were helpless and insignificant.
However, people could try to influence
the actions of the gods through prayer
and sacrificial offerings.
Sacrifices were considered the most
important element of worship. They
were performed before battles, after
planting crops, or before any
risky enterprise.The object was
to placate a god and enlist
help. The most usual sacri-
fice was that of an animal,
generally a sheep or goat,
which was ritually killed
to make an offering of
blood to the god. After
the animal was sacri-
ficed, it was sometimes
totally cremated. How-
ever, a god was more
often considered to be sat-
isfied with just the aroma of
the cremated shanks, and the
other meat was eaten during the
feast that followed the offering.
Non-blood offerings included the
placing or burning of food on the altar,
libations (pourings) of wine, milk, olive
oil, or aromatics, and the burning of
incense. People made these sacrifices in
order to express gratitude or to honor a
god, or because they sought something
from a deity in return.Worshippers often
asked a god to give them something first,
vowing to bring an offering if the god
complied with the request. Offerings
made in fulfilment of such a vow includ-
ed land, slaves, cattle, money, and valu-
ables such as weapons, textiles, jewelry, or
objects of art.
Priesthood
Most temples had their own priests or
priestesses, but it was not necessary for a
member of the priesthood to attend a
sacrifice. Priests had no special status, and
priests and priestesses were often chosen
or drawn by lot to serve for a set period
of time.The gods were worshipped at
home as well as in public. Every home
had altars to the various household gods,
such as Hestia, the goddess of the hearth.

GREEK RELIGION

Two Greek writers in particular
provide insights into Greek religion.
One of these is Homer, who lived in
the ninth or eighth century BCE. In
his great poems the Iliad and the
Odyssey, Homer gives a vivid picture
of a Greek society in which the
gods play a vital part. He is also
credited with the authorship of the
Homeric Hymns, poetic celebrations
of the many Greek gods.
Another important writer is the
poet Hesiod, who lived around 700
BCE. In his Theogony, or Birth of the
Gods, Hesiod compiled a vast collec-
tion of Greek myths and described
deities that were not mentioned by
Homer. Hesiod also described the
creation of the world, the origins
of the gods, and related many
anecdotes about the gods.
RELIGION IN 
LITERATURE
Oracles
In order to gain answers to specific ques-
tions, the Greeks consulted oracles. An
oracle was a medium who could make a
response on behalf of a god. From the
eighth century BCE onward, certain
sanctuaries associated with oracles
became widely honored. Priests, who
were sometimes local officials, were pres-
ent at each of these sites to offer an inter-
pretation of the oracle or prophecy.
However, the priests did not have any
particular training and were not consid-
ered to have any unusual powers. One
of the earliest oracles, mentioned in
Homer’s Iliad, was that of Zeus in
Dodona, in northern Greece.
The most famous oracle of the
ancient Greek world was the one at
Delphi, on the top of Mount Parnassus.
Supplicants flocked there to put ques-
tions to Apollo through the medium of
his special priestess,the Pythia.Questions
could involve anything from trivial per-
sonal matters to important affairs of state.
The Pythia fell into a trance in order
to give Apollo’s answers, which were
famous for their vague and confusing

ANCIENT GREECE
T
he highest mountain in mainland Greece,
Mount Olympus, was thought to be the 
home of the 12 most important gods, who
all belonged to the same family.These
gods were presided over by Zeus.The
others in the Olympian family were Hera,
Poseidon,Athena,Apollo,Artemis,
Aphrodite, Hermes, Demeter, Dionysus,
Hephaestus, and Ares.
As king of the gods, Zeus 
ruled the skies. He was also 
a lord of justice and a 
peacemaker. He had two
brothers. One of them,
Poseidon, was lord of the
waters, while the other
brother, Hades, was lord of
the underworld and did not
belong on Olympus. Hera,
both the sister and wife of
Zeus, was the goddess of
women and marriage. She and
Zeus were the parents of Ares
and Hephaestus.
Athena was the daughter of Zeus
alone—she was born, fully grown,
out of his head.Athena was an
important goddess, the patron
goddess of the city of Athens. She
was a virgin and a goddess of
war. She was also the protector
of women’s handicrafts.Apollo
and Artemis were the twin 
children of Zeus by the
demigoddess Leto.Apollo,
usually depicted as a handsome
young man carrying a lyre, was
the god of music and poetry
and was the leader of the
nine Muses. He was also
the god of medicine and of oracles.Artemis,
another virgin goddess, ruled over hunting, the
wilderness, and wild animals.
Aphrodite, the goddess of love and 
sexuality, was born from the sea.
Hermes, the son of Zeus and the
demigoddess Maia, was the messenger
of the gods and the protector of 
shepherds, travelers, and heralds. He 
also guided the souls of the dead to the 
underworld.The mysterious Demeter, the
sister of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, was
the goddess of agriculture and fertility.
She was the mother of Persephone,
who was carried away by
Hades to the underworld.
Another very important god,
Dionysus, was the son of
Zeus and the Theban princess
Semele. He was the god of wine and
ecstasy, and his festivals were very 
popular with the common people of
Greece. Dionysus was, however, also
the god of madness and death.
Hephaestus, a son of Zeus and Hera,
was the smith-god, the patron of all
craftsmen. Married to Aphrodite,
Hephaestus was considered the outsider
of the Olympian family and was always
depicted as a cripple.
Ares, also a son of Zeus and Hera, was the
god of war and was often Athena’s adversary.
In myth,Ares was Aphrodite’s lover, and one
story relates how he killed another of her
lovers,Adonis, in a fit of jealousy.
The Ares Borghese, made around the second
century CE, is one of the most famous depictions
of the Greek war god.

nature.Priests were on hand to transcribe
the oracle’s pronouncements. In fact, one
of the first uses of writing in Greece was
to record oracular utterances. Many of
the sayings of the oracles, at Delphi and
elsewhere, were written down to support
certain policies.
Divination was another way of find-
ing answers to questions. Seers were
practiced in the interpretation of dreams,
of the flights of birds, of the spirals of
smoke rising from an altar, and of the
arrangement of the entrails of a newly
sacrificed animal.
The mysteries
Between the seventh and sixth centuries
BCE, mystery religions began to flourish.
While the usual religious observances of
the polis community were very public,
the mysteries consisted of closely guard-
ed rituals that were only open to wor-
shippers who had been inducted into a
secret cult.The purpose of the mysteries
was to liberate the initiates from their
earthly bonds and to show them the way
to a happy life in another world after
death. The secrets of the rituals were so
closely guarded that there is no way to
know what took place in them.
The most famous Greek mysteries
were those held in the town of Eleusis,
northwest of Athens.For a thousand years,
between around 600 BCE and 400 CE,
people gathered there to become initiates.
The subject of the Eleusian mysteries was
the legend of the goddess Persephone,
who was abducted by her uncle, Hades,
and taken to the underworld. Her disap-
pearance so traumatized her mother, the

agriculture goddess Demeter, that the
crops ceased to grow. Eventually, an
agreement was made that allowed
Persephone to spend part of the year
with her mother and part in the under-
world. The legend was used to explain
the seasons.
The initiation ceremonies took place
every year on the same date during the
autumn. The main public event was a
procession from Athens to Eleusis cover-
ing some 25 miles (40 km) over the
“Holy Road.”Then, in a secret ceremo-
ny held in Demeter’s temple, the initiates
underwent the secret rites that admitted
them to the mysteries. Those who
attended this ceremony had to swear an
oath of secrecy, and they left the temple
with the expectation of a better life in
the hereafter.
The first atheists
Most Greeks took part in community
rituals, believed in the supernatural pow-
ers of the gods, consulted an oracle occa-
sionally, and possibly were initiated into a
mystery cult. However, not everyone
could accept all the ideas that were
inherent in Greek religion. In particular,
the notion that the gods could assume
many forms troubled some people. The
image of Aphrodite, for example, took

different forms in different city-states. In
addition, the fact that good was not
always rewarded and that evil was not
always punished was an important stum-
bling block for others.
Greek thinkers came up with various
theories to address these concerns. One
theory was atheism—the idea that there
is no god at all. One of the first known
atheists was the philosopher Diagoras of
Melos, who lived in the fifth century
BCE. Diagoras, a stoic and a student of
the philosopher Democritus, apparently
came up with his theory out of anger at
the fact that the gods did not punish
wrongdoing—possibly because they did
not act against the Athenians, who had
slaughtered the citizens of his native city.
Diagoras is said to have ridiculed the
gods on a number of occasions, most
notably when he cut up a statue of the
demigod Heracles to provide enough
firewood to cook turnips.

THE BIRTH OF 
DRAMA
O
ne of the most important cultural developments to occur in
Greece in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE was the growth
of drama. Originally part of religious festivals, plays gradually
became art forms in their own right.
The drama, and ultimately the theater,
grew out of annual festivals held in
honor of the god Dionysus, who was the
god of wine, intoxication, and ecstasy, a
word that implied a way of losing your-
self in an alcohol-induced frenzy and
becoming one with the god. Dionysus
was also regarded as the god of repro-
duction and of the life force of all living
beings. However, because ecstasy also
implied a loss of self-control leading to
insanity, another view of Dionysus was
that he was the god of confusion,
destruction,and death.For this reason,he
was considered to be the god of the
whole of life in all its aspects.
Festivals
Festivals held in honor of Dionysus
involved processions of devotees wearing
masks and dancing and singing.This type
of procession of ordinary citizens was
called a comos and was usually quite
riotous.The words sung by the comos rev-
elers were generally satirical and proba-
bly involved repartee with onlookers.
Comedy seems to have developed from
this exchange of backchat.
Tragedy had a different origin. At
more solemn festivals for Dionysus a
chorus would chant or sing a narrative
poem called a dithyramb, which told the
story of a Greek myth.In time,the leader
of the chorus began to step out from the
chorus and assume the role of a charac-
ter in the myth. The person generally
credited with this innovation was the
chorus master and poet Thespis, who is
thought in the sixth century BCE to
have introduced an actor wearing a mask
to speak lines in between chanting from
the chorus.The poet-dramatist Aeschylus
(525–456 BCE) later introduced a sec-
ond actor, which laid the foundation for
the development of “drama.”
Thespis was a writer, composer, cho-
reographer, director, and actor all in one.
Such a person was known as a tragoidos
(goat bard), probably because the tragoidoi
took part in a competition that awarded
a goat as the prize. The word tragedy is
supposedly derived from tragoidos.
In the middle of the sixth century
BCE, performances of tragedy and com-
petitions among poets were the heart of
the newly established great Dionysian
festival, held every spring in Athens. Each
year, a wooden stage and wooden stands
for spectators were set up in the agora
(the public square where the assembly
was held), but one year in the fifth cen-
tury BCE, the stands collapsed.The acci-
dent resulted in the building of a new
theater on the south slope of the

Acropolis, close to an exist-
ing shrine to Dionysus.
This theater consisted of 
a natural auditorium
formed by the curve
of the hillside and
overlooking a cir-
cular orchestra at
the base of the
hill.The orches-
tra was where
the chorus and
the actors per-
formed.
This
plan 
was 
fol-
lowed by all later
Greek theaters.
The festival lasted
for five days and five
nights. On the first day,
there was a great proces-
sion, and offerings were
brought to Dionysus. This
was followed by a dithyramb
competition, an impressive specta-
cle with 10 boys’ choruses and 10 men’s
choruses of 50 singers each. The day
closed with a comos procession, usually
involving a masquerade and plenty of
rough merrymaking.
On the second day, the dramas began,
and five comedies by five different
authors were performed. Each of the
following three days then featured a
tetralogy—three tragedies and a satyr
play—by a single author. The satyr play
featured a chorus of clownish satyrs
(creatures that were half goat and half
man) and was intended to provide comic
relief after a long day of tragedy.
The eight authors chosen to chal-
lenge each other for the best comedy
and tetralogy at the festival were selected
by the archons (magistrates). The archons
then looked for choregi (literally “chorus
leaders”) to act as producers.These chore-
gi were wealthy people who were
obliged to pay most of the costs of the
event from their own pockets, with the
rest being paid for by the state.
After a lengthy pre-festival
period of rehearsals, the festival
performances were all given.
The jury that decided the
winners was a committee
of 10 people chosen 
by lot. One dithyramb
chorus, one comedy,
and one tetralogy were
selected as the win-
ning pieces, and the
choregi of the winners
shared the honors.
The chorus
Greek theater in the fifth
century BCE was dominated
by the chorus. Comedies had
a chorus of 24, tragedies 12 or
15. The chorus recited or sang
the text in unison, emphasizing the
words with gestures or dance steps.
Dance was an integral part of the drama,
and the colorful costumes and masks
worn by the actors greatly added to the
effect of the plays.
To begin with, both the chorus and
the actors were located on the orchestra.
As it became obvious that a place was
needed for the two,and later three,actors
to change their costumes, a hut called a
skene was erected at the back of the
orchestra. It was quickly realized that the
skene could be used as a background to
the dramatic action, so the drama might
be seen to take place in front of a build-
ing, such as a temple or palace, rather
than in the open countryside as had been
the case previously. Later still, a low plat-
form was built at the rear of the orches-
tra and in front of the skene. Under this
new arrangement, the chorus members
were located on the orchestra, while the
actors were located on the raised plat-
form to declaim and sing the most
important parts of the tragedy.

THE BIRTH OF DRAMA
The Theater of
Dionysus was the
largest theater in
Athens. Plays by all
the great Athenian
writers were
performed there.
Unlike the members of the chorus,
the actors were professionals. Because no
more than three actors were allowed on
stage in the tragedies, the actors often
had double roles. Women were not
allowed to act—although they could be
members of the chorus—so female roles
were played by men, which was made
possible by the use of masks.The actors
also changed the timbre of their voices
when playing women.
In the fifth century BCE, no pieces
were performed twice in Athens, which
meant that 17 premieres were enacted
every year. Only a very few of these plays
have survived in their complete state—
just 44 pieces out of the thousand or
more that must have been performed.
The tragic poets
The oldest dramatist-poet known by
name is Thespis, but none of his work
survives. A little more is known about
Choerilus, whose career began at the
same time as that of Thespis in the sixth
century BCE. His surviving work
includes a couple of small fragments and
one title, Alope, which may have been a
satyr play. Another successful dramatist
from this time was Phrynichus (c.
540–475 BCE). He was a winner in the
poetic competitions held during the last

decade of the sixth century BCE.
Perhaps his most interesting work is The
Capture of Miletus. This tragedy is based
on a piece of contemporary history—the
story of the siege of the Ionian city of
Miletus by the Persians in 494 BCE.
Aeschylus
The heyday of Greek tragedy began with
Aeschylus, who was born in 525 BCE in
Eleusis, northwest of Athens. He wrote
around 90 plays, all of them destined to
be performed at the annual Dionysian
festival. Only seven of them have sur-
vived, however. One of his main contri-
butions to Greek drama was to write a
part for a second actor, which greatly
increased the possibility for dramatic
confrontations. Most of the plots for his
plays were taken from Greek myths and
show how the actions of men on earth
bring retribution from the gods.
Aeschylus first took part in the com-
petition of the tragedians in the Dionysia
of 499 BCE, but he did not win until
484 BCE. Of his seven surviving
tragedies, three formed the trilogy with
which he won the Dionysian competi-
tion in 458 BCE.The Oresteia trilogy was
probably his last work and is an out-
standing example of Aeschylus’s poetic
style and mastery of suspense.
The Oresteia concerns the fate of
the royal family of the Atreides. The
action of the first play, Agamemnon, takes
place in the palace of Mycenae, where
Clytemnestra awaits the return after
many years of her husband Agamemnon,
the leader of the Greeks in the Trojan
War. Clytemnestra hates her husband,
who sacrificed their daughter Iphigenia
to appease the gods. During his absence,
Clytemnestra has had an affair with
Aegisthus and now, when Agamemnon
returns, they plot to kill him. In spite 
of being warned of his danger by 
Cassandra, the Trojan princess whom
Agamemnon has brought with him from
Troy as a slave,Agamemnon is murdered
by the lovers soon after his arrival.

Agamemnon is avenged by his son
Orestes, who kills his own mother and
her lover. In the third part, Eumenides,
Orestes, pursued by the furies (the god-
desses of vengeance), finds no peace until
a special court in Athens acquits him of
the charge of matricide.
Of the four other remaining works of
Aeschylus, Persians is based on the story
of the Greek victory over the Persians at
Salamis, told from the Persian point of
view. Suppliants tells the story of the
Danaides, the 50 daughters of Danaus
(the king of Libya), who were promised
in marriage to the 50 sons of his brother
Aegyptus. Seven Against Thebes is about
the struggle between the brothers
Eteocles and Polyneices for possession of
the throne of Thebes, and the battle of
the Seven Heroes for possession of the
city. Prometheus Bound portrays the story
of the demigod Prometheus, who gave
fire to mankind in defiance of Zeus.Zeus
punished him by chaining him to a rock,
where an eagle tore out his liver every
day. In most of Aeschylus’s dramas, the
main theme is that man must yield to the
jealous power of the gods.
Sophocles
Aeschylus’s successor, and for a time his
competitor, was Sophocles (c. 496–406
BCE), who was almost 30 years younger
than Aeschylus and came from an old,
aristocratic Athenian family. As well as
being a poet-dramatist, Sophocles served
as one of the Athenian strategoi (generals)
for the year 440 BCE.
Sophocles’ literary career began in
468 BCE, when he took part in the
Dionysian competition for the first time
and defeated Aeschylus. Sophocles won
the competition another 18 times.
Although Sophocles was the most popu-
lar tragedian of Athens, only seven of his
estimated 123 tragedies have survived.
Sophocles was an innovator. He was
the dramatist who first introduced a third
actor on the stage, a convention later
taken over by Aeschylus. Sophocles also
broke with the tradition that the tragedi-
an must act in his own plays, as Aeschylus
still did.
Sophocles was less convinced of the
implacability of fate than Aeschylus was
and laid greater emphasis on individual
human will. However, the consequences
of trying to alter one’s fate could be trag-
ic. In the plays, this possibility leads to
heightened dramatic tension.
None of Sophocles’ trilogies remain.
The seven surviving tragedies are all
independent works in their own right—
Ajax, Antigone, Electra, Oedipus Rex,
Trachiniai, Philoctetes, and Oedipus at

Colonus. Of all the extant Greek
tragedies, Oedipus Rex is probably the
best known.The play shows a great man
brought low through ignorance of his
origins. Because he has been raised not
knowing who his parents are, Oedipus,
the king of Thebes, discovers that he has
unknowingly killed his father, Laius, and
married his mother, Jocasta. When he
realizes that he has committed patricide
and incest, Oedipus puts out his own
eyes in horror and then goes into exile,
where he dies.
In Antigone, Sophocles examines the
conflict between human laws and divine
laws. Antigone is the daughter of
Oedipus and goes with him into exile.
Her brothers Eteocles and Polyneices
fight for the vacant throne of Thebes,and
both die in battle before the gates of the
city.The throne now falls to their uncle,
Creon, and he strictly forbids Antigone
to bury the body of her brother
Polyneices, whom he regards as a traitor
to his country. Creon decrees that the
body must lie dishonored on the battle-
field, a prey to dogs and vultures.
Antigone, however, knows that she
has a moral obligation to give her broth-
er a fitting burial, so his spirit will have
rest. By disobeying her uncle, Antigone
sets in motion a tragic chain of events
that leads not only to her own death but
also to that of her lover Haemon.
In this play, Sophocles directs all his
attention to the conflict within the
human soul. Antigone, Haemon, and
even Creon are torn between human
and divine laws. Because of this emphasis
on human psychological dilemmas,
Antigone is regarded as one of the great-
est of all tragedies.
Euripides
Euripides (c. 485–406 BCE) was the
youngest of the three great tragedians.
He wrote around 92 plays, of which 18
tragedies and 1 satyr play remain.

THE BIRTH OF DRAMA
This bust depicts 
the playwright
Euripides. Euripides
is seen as one of the
three great Athenian
tragedians, the other
two being Sophocles
and Aeschylus.
Because his characters seem more human
and realistic than those of his predeces-
sors,he is seen as the most modern of the
Greek tragedians. His play Medea, rec-
ognized as one of the greatest of the
Greek tragedies, tells the story of the
enchantress Medea, who helped Jason
gain the golden fleece. After the couple
settle in Corinth,they have two children,
but Jason is unfaithful and threatens to
leave Medea. Driven by pathological
jealousy, Medea murders her own chil-
dren as revenge on her husband.
In Hippolytus, Euripides paints a sym-
pathetic portrait of a woman in the grip
of an obsessive love.To punish the youth
Hippolytus, who has angered her, the
goddess Aphrodite makes his step-
mother Phaedra fall in love with
him. When Phaedra declares
her love, the chaste youth is
horrified.Phaedra commits sui-
cide but leaves a note accusing
Hippolytus of lusting after her.
When 
Hippolytus’s 
father,
Theseus, hears of this, he ban-
ishes his son, at the same time
laying a curse on him that
swiftly results in his death.
The comic dramatists
Another group of Greek dramatists
wrote comedies, which generally made
fun of current politicians and events.
The greatest of these dramatists was
Aristophanes (c. 450–388 BCE). He was
the leading exponent of what is now
called Greek “Old Comedy.” His first
work, entitled Revellers, was produced in
427 BCE. That play no longer survives,
but of the 30 or so plays he wrote, 11 still
do exist.
An enormously popular dramatist in
his time,Aristophanes did not hesitate to
lampoon leading politicians of the day.
His play Knights, first performed around
424 BCE, contains a satirical portrait of
the ambitious politician Cleon, mocking
his attempts to be elected as a strategos.
In Frogs, meanwhile, Aristophanes ridi-
cules his fellow playwrights Euripides
and Aeschylus.
In the late fourth century BCE,
“New Comedy” emerged. The leading
exponent of this style was Menander 
(c. 341–291 BCE). In this kind of com-
edy, there was virtually no satire. The
plays dealt with social comedy, showing
family situations and highlighting indi-
vidual characters with their various
foibles.This form of drama was to have a
great influence on the development of
comedy in the Roman era.

THE PERSIAN
WARS
I
n the fifth century BCE, the two greatest powers of the
Mediterranean world—Greece and Persia—were involved in a
titanic military struggle.The great battles of the Persian Wars—
Thermopylae, Marathon, and Salamis—are famous to this day.
By the end of the sixth century BCE,the
Persian Empire was the greatest the
world had ever known. Its rise to power
came with stunning rapidity. Only 50
years earlier, the Persians had been just
one of several small peoples inhabiting
the Iranian plain in the Middle East.
They were also subjects of the Medes. In
549 BCE, the Persians’ ambitious king
Cyrus the Great (ruled 559–529 BCE)
led a revolt against the Medes and defeat-
ed them. By this victory he became lord
of one of western Asia’s great kingdoms.
He then embarked on a campaign of for-
eign conquests. First in his sights was
Lydia in Anatolia, another great power.
He marched into Lydia in 546 BCE and
took its capital, Sardis. He then annexed
the Greek cities in the western part of
Anatolia, which was known as Ionia.
Cyrus seized Babylon in 539 BCE,
making him lord of the mighty
Babylonian Empire. By the end of the
century, the Persian dominions stretched
from the Aegean Sea in the west to the
Indus Valley in the east and from the
Danube River in the north to the Red
Sea and Persian Gulf in the south.
After the death of Cyrus, his son,
Cambyses II (ruled 529–522 BCE), suc-
ceeded in adding Egypt to the Persian
Empire. Darius I (ruled 521–486 BCE)
was anxious to extend his boundaries to
the northwest. By 512 BCE, he had
crossed the Bosporus and was actively
seeking conquests on the west side of the
Black Sea all the way to the mouth of the
Danube, but with little success. However,
Darius did succeed in conquering Thrace
and Macedon, which meant that his
empire then bordered the northwest
extremity of mainland Greece.
Between the eighth and sixth cen-
turies BCE, Sparta and Athens had
become the predominant city-states of
Greece. With all of mainland Greece
feeling threatened by the presence of the
mighty Persian Empire on the border, it
seemed that maintaining the balance of
power between Persia and Greece would
depend on the lead of these two cities.
The Ionian Rebellion
In 499 BCE, a massive rebellion against
Persian dominance in Anatolia broke out
in the Ionian coastal cities and the neigh-
boring islands.The reasons for the revolt
are not clear, but it may be that the
Greeks resented the necessity of doing
military service in the Persian army
(which applied to everyone, of whatever
rank), and there was also resentment
against the Greek tyrants who served as
puppet overlords for the Persians. The
rebellion began on Ionian ships that had
been engaged in naval operations on
behalf of the Persians. Returning home,
the seamen and officers mutinied and

arrested the ships’ commanders. The
leader of this uprising was Aristogoras of
Miletus,who went on to mastermind the
whole rebellion.
The Ionian cities rose up and
deposed their puppet tyrants, replacing
them with democracies. The rebels
turned to the city-states of mainland
Greece for support. Only Athens and
Eritria 
responded,
both 
sending
squadrons of warships. With the help
of Athenian and Eritrean land forces,
the rebels marched on Sardis, where
Artaphernes, the brother of Darius I,
ruled as a satrap (provincial governor).
The Greeks succeeded in occupying the
lower town but could not take the
citadel. Lacking clear leadership, the
Greeks retreated, and the retreat deterio-
rated into chaos. Artaphernes managed
to catch up with the Greeks before they
could reach the cost and inflicted a heavy
defeat on them near Ephesus.
Despite its failure, the rebellion had
inspired other Greek cities—in Cyprus,
the Dardanelles, and Byzantium—to rise
against their Persian oppressors. The
Persians gathered a large navy and army
and campaigned throughout the region
to bring the Greeks to heel. In 494 BCE,
Greeks and Persians met at sea, off
Samos, to fight a naval battle, but most of
the Greek ships fled, perhaps encouraged
to do so by Persian promises of lenient
treatment for those who did not fight.
The remaining ships were routed. Darius
exacted a terrible vengeance on Miletus,
the center of the Greek rebellion. The
city was sacked, and its inhabitants were
either deported to Persia or sold into
slavery. Other cities were punished
according to their part in the rebellion.
However, the episode set the scene for
the First Persian War.

of the 192 Greeks who died at the Battle 
of Marathon.

ANCIENT GREECE
C
roesus, king of Lydia (ruled 560–546 BCE),
reigned over an immensely rich and powerful
kingdom in Anatolia.The Greek cities of Ionia
were conquered by the Lydians in the mid-sixth
century BCE, greatly adding to the Lydians’ 
prosperity, but the real basis of Lydian wealth lay
in their thriving trade and industries and in the
gold and silver mined in their lands.
The first modern coins, minted by the Lydians
around 600 BCE, were fat disks stamped with
pictures and their specified worth. Up to this
time, most trade had been carried on by way of
barter—the direct exchange of merchandise—
though in some areas, grains of gold and silver,
or bars of gold, silver, or bronze, were used to
represent the value of goods.
Under Croesus, Lydia achieved the peak of its
wealth.As he expanded his empire, he got richer
on the booty he took; the expression “as rich as
Croesus” dates from this time.There is a story
that when the great Athenian legal reformer and
philosopher Solon visited him, Croesus claimed 
to be the happiest man on earth because of his
wealth. Solon reputedly replied (prophetically as it
turned out),“Call no man happy before his
death.” Croesus was captured by Cyrus of 
Persia in 546 BCE and, according to the Greek
historian Herodotus, was burned to death on a
funeral pyre.
This 17th-century-CE painting depicts King Croesus of
Lydia displaying his great wealth to the Athenian
statesman Solon.

THE PERSIAN WARS
The First Persian War
The Ionian rebellion led Darius to make
some concessions to the Greeks of
Anatolia He relaxed his regime slightly
and did not require the cities to take
their old tyrants back. However, he was
determined to subdue mainland Greece.
In 491 BCE, he sent messengers to all
the Greek city-states, requiring them to
send “earth and water” to him as a sign
of submission. All the communities on
the mainland and islands complied with
this request—except for Sparta and
Athens. As a sign of their contempt, the
Athenians threw the Persian messengers
into the pit for condemned criminals. In
Sparta, the messengers were thrown into
a well where, they were told, there was
water and earth in abundance.
Outraged by the death of his messen-
gers, Darius was ready to listen to two
Greek exiles in his court who convinced
him that they had a number of sympa-
thizers in Greece.These two exiles were
Hippias, the ex-tyrant of Athens, and
Demaratus, an ex-king of Sparta. Darius
formed a plan to take Athens and put
Hippias back in power there, under
Persian rule.
In 490 BCE, Darius sent an expedi-
tion, directed explicitly against Athens, to
Greece. On board the Persian fleet was
the aged Hippias, convinced that he
could regain his position of power. The
fleet set sail from the island of Samos,
crossed the Aegean Sea, and landed at
Eritria, where the Persian forces sacked
the city and deported its citizens.
The Battle of Marathon
The Persian army, some 20,000 to
25,000 strong, disembarked at the Bay of
Marathon, around 25 miles (40 km) east
of Athens.The Persians wanted to make
contact with the sympathizers of
Hippias, who had his home base on that
side of Attica. The Athenians sent to
Sparta for assistance, but their request
came during a religious festival that the
Spartans would not leave.As soon as the
Athenians learned of the landing at
Marathon, however, they sent a force of
10,000 hoplites, who were joined by
1,000 Plataean soldiers.

KEY

The two armies drew up in battle
formation on the plain of Marathon.The
Persian forces consisted of archers, spear-
men, and cavalry, while the Greeks had
only foot soldiers. However, the Greeks’
armor was heavier and provided
more protection than that of
the Persians, and the Greek
hoplites were a formidable
fighting force. There was a
standoff for several days,
with the two armies
backing off to sleep in
camp at night. Eventually,
the Persians decided to
sail around to the other
side of Attica and launch
an attack from there.
Once the Persian cavalry
was embarked, one of the
Greek generals, Miltiades, con-
vinced the overall commander of the
troops, Callimachus, to launch an attack.
The Greek hoplites advanced at a run,
engaging the Persian infantry with dev-
astating results. After the two Persian
wings were crushed, the Greeks and
Plataeans wheeled in from the sides to
decimate the center. The Persians fled,
and many of them were cut down before
they could reach the ships.The Persians
left 6,400 soldiers dead on the field,
while the Greeks lost only 192 men. It
was a resounding victory for the Greeks.
After the unexpected defeat at
Marathon, the Persian fleet sailed around
Cape Sounion to make a second landing.
The Persians planned to march on
Athens, which they believed was unpro-
tected. However, the Athenian army
quickly returned to the city in a forced
march, reaching it within only seven
hours. To make matters worse for the
Persians, the Spartan army was rapidly
approaching Athens. Discouraged, the
Persian fleet retreated.
The Second Persian War
The next Persian attack did not come
until 10 years later.The delay was caused
by Darius’s death in 486 BCE.The sub-
sequent domestic disturbances forced his
son Xerxes I (ruled 486–465 BCE) to
100
ANCIENT GREECE
After the Athenian victory over the Persians at the
Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE, a Greek runner was 
dispatched to run the 25 miles (40 km) to Athens to
bring the good news. Upon arrival, he collapsed from
exhaustion and died.
Centuries later, this feat inspired the marathon race.
When the Olympic Games were revived in Athens in
1896 CE, they included a long-distance foot race of
around that distance. It was called the marathon in
honor of the unknown runner.The marathon distance
was later standardized at 26 miles, 385 yards (42.2 km).
The story of the athlete who ran from Marathon to
Athens has often been intertwined with a separate
story, told by Herodotus, of another runner, named
Pheidippides, who ran from Athens to Sparta on the eve
of the war to ask the Spartans for help. Pheidippides
would have run 150 miles (241 km) in two days.

wait until 481 BCE. According to
Herodotus, Xerxes was warned by his
advisers against the consequences of a
new campaign, but the king continued
his preparations for what would become
the largest military undertaking in histo-
ry to that date.
Athens had made good use of the 10-
year calm. During that time, the city had
transformed itself into a naval power.The
events of the Ionian rebellion had
demonstrated the importance of having
a strong fleet. This change of view
was largely due to the foresighted states-
man Themistocles, who convinced the
Athenian assembly to spend the major
part of the profits gained from the newly
opened silver mines of Laurium on ship-
building. The number of Athenian
triremes (warships; see box, page 109)
rose from 70 to 200.
In 481 BCE, when the Persian prepa-
rations for war were already under way,
a conference of Greek states met 
in Corinth, probably at Themistocles’
instigation, to decide on the tactics to be
followed. It was decided to proclaim an
overall peace to end ongoing internal
conflicts. All states would enter into an
alliance against Persia, and none was to
consider making a separate peace. The
property of traitors would be confiscated
and given to the sanctuary in Delphi.
Wooden walls
Despite this friendly gesture, the prophe-
cies of the Delphi oracle were consis-
tently unfavorable.The people of Delphi
were so well informed of the formidable
Persian war preparations that they dared
recommend nothing less than uncondi-
tional surrender.The advice of the oracle
“to flee to the ends of the earth” was not
appreciated by the Athenians.They asked
the oracle for less defeatist counsel, and it
replied that only “wooden walls” could
protect Athens. Themistocles declared
that this meant ships; because the ships
had already been built, the Athenians
were satisfied.
Athens was joined by
30 other Greek states.
They decided to meet the
Persian attack head on,
with Sparta in charge of
the entire military opera-
tion. The Greek strategy
was essentially to avoid
battles on the plains,
where the Persian superi-
ority in numbers, and in
particular their cavalry,
would almost certainly
overcome smaller Greek
forces. Instead, the Greeks
planned to try to engage
the Persians either in
mountain passes or at sea
in narrow channels.
On the Persian side,
Xerxes was personally in
charge of the new expe-
dition. The winter of
The waters off the
Greek island of
Samos, shown here,
were the site of a
naval battle
between the Greeks
and the Persians 
in 494 BCE.

481–480 BCE was devoted to prepara-
tions in Sardis. The Persian army, the
largest that had ever been assembled, was
too large to be transported by sea.
Equally, the army was too large to live off
the land it had to march through, so
arrangements had to be made to supply
the army with food by sea.
Into Greece
In the spring of 480 BCE, Xerxes led his
army north and crossed the Dardanelles
by means of a bridge constructed of
boats built by his engineers. He then
trekked into Europe, following the coast.
A large fleet of warships and freight ves-
sels accompanied the army. They were
ordered not to lose sight of each other,
since the land army could not function
without the fleet.
From Thessaly to central Greece,
the main road ran through the pass of
Thermopylae, between the sea and the
mountains.There the Greeks waited for
the Persians, and a historic three-day
battle was fought, which the Greeks
eventually lost.
At the same time that the Battle of
Thermopylae was happening on land,
the Greeks engaged with the Persians in
a naval battle at Artemisium, in a sea
channel only 6 miles (9.7 km) wide.
Although the Persian fleet had originally
numbered around 600 ships, it had lost a
number of them in recent storms, so it
did not greatly outnumber the 370
triremes of the Greeks.The Persians had
the advantage that many of their ships
were in fact Phoenician, sailed by
Phoenician crews, who were generally
acknowledged at that time to be the best
sailors in the world. However, in the
confined waters at Artemisium, superior

sailing tactics did not count for much.
The Persians’ technique was to bring
their ships alongside the Greek ships, so
that infantrymen could board the enemy
ships.The Greeks had their own soldiers
aboard their vessels and fought back vig-
orously.The two fleets inflicted substan-
tial damage on each other, and although
the battle was nominally a victory for the
Persians,the fact that they had performed
so well was a great morale booster for the
Greeks. On receiving the news of the
defeat at Thermopylae, the Greek ships
sailed south.
Campaign in Attica
Following the battles at Marathon and
Artemisium, central Greece and Attica
lay open to the advancing enemy. On
The pass at Thermopylae was an obvious place for the
Greeks to intercept the Persians. It was hemmed in on
one side by tall cliffs and on the other by the sea.A
Greek force of 9,000 hoplites, under the command of
the Spartan king Leonidas, made camp in the pass to
await the Persians.
The 200,000 strong Persian army poured into the pass,
but because it was so narrow, only a few could engage
with the Greeks at a time.The superior equipment of
the Greek hoplites gave them a crucial advantage and
they were able to hold the pass for two days. On the
third day, a local Greek guide treacherously showed the
Persians a mountain path that enabled them to come
down behind the Greek lines. Realizing that he was out-
flanked, Leonidas ordered most of his army to retreat
south, and with 300 Spartans and around 1,000 other
troops, he made a heroic last stand.The Persians
attacked, and the Spartans were all killed.
THE BATTLE OF THERMOPYLAE

Themistocles’ advice, the population of
Athens was evacuated to Salamis, an
island in the Gulf of Aegina, and the
Peloponnese. This proved to be a wise
decision, because Xerxes entered Athens
and sacked it.From Salamis,Themistocles
was forced to watch the clouds of smoke
billowing up from the burning temples
on the Acropolis.
The Battle of Salamis
Meanwhile, the Persian fleet had sailed
south to Salamis, where the Greek fleet
was waiting. According to the poet
Aeschylus, who took part in the ensuing
battle, the Persian fleet made such an
impression that the Spartan leaders were
all for retreating from the bay, assembling
all land and naval forces by the isthmus of
Corinth, and building a wall to block the
Persians.Themistocles pointed out that a
wall would be useless if the Persian fleet
could sail past it. Only “wooden walls”
could help.
Before the battle began,Themistocles
sent a messenger to Xerxes with false

information, claiming that there was dis-
sension among the Greeks, that the
Athenians wanted to defect to the
enemy, and that the Persians should
attack right away if they wanted to take
advantage of the situation.The Persians
were so confident of victory that Xerxes
had a golden throne built on a hill over-
looking the harbor of Salamis so he
could witness the destruction of the
Greek fleet in comfort.
The ruse worked.The Persians, con-
fident that victory would be theirs, sailed
into the Salamis narrows by night with
the intention of launching an attack at
dawn, but first light brought an unwel-
come sight. The Greek fleet was drawn
up in a semicircular formation, spanning
the width of the channel and forming a
trap in which the Persian ships were
caught. In the ensuing battle, the Greek
ships rammed their Persian counterparts,
which could not maneuver in the tight
situation and, because they were lighter
than the Greek triremes,were susceptible
to this form of attack.The Persian ships

THE PERSIAN WARS
T
he most important source for the history of
the Persian Wars is the historian Herodotus,
who was born some time around 480 BCE in the
Greek city of Halicarnassus in Anatolia. His date
of death is also unknown but probably
lies sometime between 430 and
420 BCE. Cicero, the Roman
statesman and philosopher
(106–46 BCE), called
Herodotus the father of
historiography, that is, the
writing of history based
on a critical examination
of sources. Herodotus
attempted to interpret
the past, putting a human
face on it and infusing 
it with a moral 
understanding.
According to Herodotus, his
work was the fruit of
research and
inquiry. He
opened his
History, his
account of the
Persian Wars,
with the following
words:“Here fol-
lows an explana-
tion of the study
that Herodotus of
Halicarnassus initi-
ated with the
intention that the
deeds of the people
not be forgotten in
time and that the
important and 
amazing feats of the
Greeks and non-
Greeks be given their due glory, and also to shed
light on the reason why they entered into conflict
with one another.” 
Herodotus’s History is now divided into
nine separate books. It does not
just tell the story of the Persian
Wars themselves; it also
attempts to place them into
context by giving a history
of the Persian Empire.
Herodotus’s work was
based largely on 
information gathered on
his travels throughout
Anatolia, Egypt, Palestine,
Phoenicia, Mesopotamia,
and the Black Sea region.
His goal was to collect
information, separating
what he had seen and
heard from other 
observations. Nevertheless,
his work is far from being
a dry, historical account.
He wrote in an easy-
going, engaging style
and mixed his
accounts of the
wars with gossip,
descriptions of
the personalities
involved, and
stories of 
the gods.

capsized, littering the sea with wrecks
and corpses. By evening, Xerxes could
see that his fleet was crushed.
Xerxes returns to Asia
Alarmed by the destruction of his fleet,
Xerxes began the long march back
to Asia with the bulk of his land forces.
However, he left a formidable force
of around 60,000 men behind under
the command of his brother-in-law
Mardonius with instructions to continue
the planned subjugation of Greece.
Mardonius spent the winter in
Thessaly. In the spring, he sent a delega-
tion to Athens offering to repair all the
damage and help in reconstructing the
city. He hoped by this means to negoti-
ate a settlement with the Athenians
excluding Sparta. All he asked in
exchange was that Athens should recog-
nize the sovereignty of the Persian king.
The Athenians rejected Mardonius’s
proposals and hastened to reassure the
concerned Spartans that they would
stand firm for “the Greek brotherhood,
the collective ancestry and language, the
altars and the sacrifices in which all
Greeks share,” as Herodotus put it.
Mardonius responded by ravaging
Attica and capturing Athens, but he
pulled back his troops when the Spartan
main force advanced northward. The
Greek forces assembled en masse on the
plain of Plataea (a few miles south of
Thebes) where the Persian army awaited
them. The Battle of Plataea ended in a
comprehensive victory for the Greek
forces and the death of Mardonius. The
Persian hopes of conquering Greece
were finally at an end.
Meanwhile, reputedly on the same
day that the Battle of Plataea was being
fought, another encounter took place
that completed the Persians’ humiliation
at the hands of the Greeks. This battle
took place at Cape Mycale in Ionia.

107
THE PERSIAN WARS
O
n the plain of Plataea in the summer of 479
BCE, a Greek army under the command of
Pausanius, the Spartan regent, faced a Persian
force under Mardonius. Pausanius had 38,000
heavily armed hoplites from Sparta,Athens, and
Corinth, with perhaps an equal number of lightly
armed soldiers, but he had no mounted troops.
The Persians had the advantage of their 
formidable cavalry, whose technique against
infantry was to charge them, release a hail of
javelins and arrows, and then wheel away.
The two armies faced each other across the
Asopus River for almost two weeks, with a little
daily skirmishing. Each general was reluctant to
initiate an attack. Finally, with no access to fresh
water, Pausanius decided to withdraw to Plataea.
When he saw the Greeks on the move,
Mardonius ordered his troops forward to attack.
In the retreat, the Greeks had become separated
into several units. One of these units consisted of
around 12,000 Spartan hoplites, while another
was made up of 8,000 Athenians.At the time of
the Persian attack, these units were separated by
around 1 mile (1.6 km), so the ensuing battle
really took place on two separate fronts.The
Spartans turned and formed up in battle order
to face the onslaught of the Persian infantry, who
were equipped with bows and arrows. Many of
the Spartans fell under the rain of arrows, but
when the command came to charge, the hoplites
proved their superior fighting prowess. In the
ensuing chaos, Mardonius was killed, and once
their general was dead, the Persians fled. On
the other side of the field, the Athenians were
engaged with other Persian forces, but once
the Persians saw their comrades fleeing, they
also ran away.The battle was a resounding
victory for the Greeks.

and Persian troops fighting at the Battle of Plataea

changed sides. Leotychides managed to
inflict a decisive defeat on the Persian
land forces and captured the Persian
fleet, which was moored nearby.
The end of the war
Even though the battles of Plataea and
Cape Mycale effectively ended the dan-
ger that the Persians posed to the Greek
mainland, sporadic fighting continued
for another 30 years. From this time on,
it was the Greeks who were on the
offensive. The Athenians attempted to
secure a complete dominance of eastern
Mediterranean trade by systematically
driving the Persians out of Ionia and
Cyprus. Eventually, in 449 BCE, a peace
treaty was negotiated between Persia
and Athens, and the Persian Wars were
finally at an end.
109
THE PERSIAN WARS
This seal depicts the type of Greek warship
that would have been used at Salamis.
The main type of warship used by the Greeks
during the Persian Wars was the trireme
(known to the Greeks as a trieres).The triremes
derived their name from the fact that they were
powered by oarsmen arranged in three separate
banks, one above the other.This arrangement
came about as the solution to the problem of
how to fit as many rowers into a ship as 
possible.The triple-deck system meant that
around 170 oarsmen could be fitted into a ship
(as well as a number of foot soldiers).Although
triremes also used sails, they were lowered
before the ships went into battle; the use of
oars gave the ships greater maneuverability.
During a naval engagement, a commander could
adopt two different tactics.The ship could try to
pull up alongside the adversaries, enabling Greek
troops to board the enemy vessel and capture
it.Alternatively, a ship could simply try to ram
the enemy with the prow, which was specially
designed for that purpose. In order to execute
this maneuver, one fleet had to outflank the
other so the prows of at least some of the ships
faced the sides of the enemy vessels.This tech-
nique was known as the periplus.Various defen-
sive formations could be adopted to offer pro-
tection. One was the kyklos, which was a simple
defensive circle where all of the ships had their
prows facing outward.
Greek triremes used ramming tactics to win
victory in arguably the most famous naval battle
of ancient times—Salamis.The Greek fleet was
heavily outnumbered, but the quicker and more
maneuverable Greek triremes managed to inflict
huge damage in the narrow channel where the
battle was fought.

THE AGE 
OF PERICLES
D
uring the fifth century BCE, the city of Athens was involved
in wars against two major adversaries—Persia and the fellow
Greek city of Sparta. However, the period was also a time when
democracy and culture flourished.
The Athenian statesman Pericles, who
lived from around 495 to 429 BCE, was
so important to the development of
Athens that historians call the time he
was in power the Age of Pericles. Under
his guidance,
Athens reached the
pinnacle of its influence. The city also
became an unparalleled center of culture
and learning, a process that culminated
in the construction of the Parthenon on
the Acropolis.
The Athenians enjoyed a good life
under Pericles, as he himself described
it in a speech:“We have feasts and cere-
monies throughout the year.Life is pleas-
ant in our homes, and with our noble
behavior, we provide ourselves with
pleasures that hinder sadness.The fame of
our city brings us fruits from the entire
Earth, so we can enjoy foreign and exot-
ic products… We are admirers of beauty,
but we remain simple.”
The upbringing of Pericles
Pericles was the son of Xanthippus, a
general who led the Athenian contingent
that contributed to the defeat of the
Persians at Cape Mycale in 479 BCE.
Although he came from an aristocratic
family, Pericles made his name in politics
as a reformer with left-wing leanings.
With the support of the common peo-
ple, he became leader of the popular
party. He was a persuasive orator, and
when he spoke in the assembly, he could
generally convince his listeners of the
merit of his proposals. By 460 BCE, he
had virtually become head of state.
The Battle of Salamis, where the
Greeks routed the Persians in a sea battle
in 480 BCE, marked the beginning of
the rise of Athenian sea power.After the
final defeat of the Persians at Plataea the
following year, Athens emerged as the
predominant city-state in Greece.
Up until this time, Sparta had been
the greatest military power in Greece.At
the end of the wars with Persia, howev-
er, the Spartans opted for isolation.They
returned to their austere lifestyle on the
Peloponnese peninsula, where their lands
had remained untouched by the Persian
Wars. Although they had ample ability
and resources to establish military sover-
eignty throughout Greece,they preferred
to concentrate on domestic affairs.
Athens suffered heavily in the wars
with Persia, and it remained fearful of a
new invasion. To reduce this threat, the
Athenians pursued a policy of offensive,
expansionist action. After the battles of
Salamis and Cape Mycale, the Athenians
had undisputed sea supremacy in the
eastern Mediterranean region. However,
maintaining a large fleet put a severe
strain on the funds of Attica, so Athens
needed to form alliances to continue
military offensives against Persia.

THE AGE OF PERICLES
This bust, created in the second century BCE, is believed to depict
the Athenian statesman Pericles, who dominated the politics of
Athens for more than 30 years.
The Delian League
In 477 BCE, Athens and most of the
Aegean city-states formed an alliance
against Persia called the Delian League. It
was named for the island of Delos, where
the meetings of the league were to be
held and the funds of the alliance were to
be kept.Athens headed the league, but all
the members had an equal vote, in prin-
ciple at least. As the leading member of
the league,Athens commanded a fleet of
200 ships, and every ally was required to
pay an annual fee to help maintain the
fleet.This fee could consist of ships, men,
equipment, or silver talents, all assessed
according to the resources of the mem-
ber state.
Between 476 and 466 BCE, a Greek
force, under the joint command of gen-
erals Cimon and Aristides, succeeded in
liberating the coasts of the Aegean from
Persian control. One notable success
came in 466 when a force led by Cimon
destroyed both the Persian fleet and the
Persian army near the mouth of the
Eurymedon River in Anatolia.
An Athenian empire
By 466 BCE,most of the members of the
league were paying their contributions in
silver talents rather than men or goods.
This was tantamount to paying tribute.
When some of the states started to
object, Athens responded ruthlessly. For
example, when Naxos objected to paying
the tribute and attempted to withdraw
from the league, Athens destroyed its
forts. Athens then annexed the lands of
other recalcitrant allies, distributing the
land to its own citizens.The league that
had started as a defensive alliance against
Persia had become a naval empire run by
Athens. It encompassed most of the large
islands of the Aegean Sea and many cities
to the north, either as equals or as sub-
jected former allies.
Following his famous success at the
Eurymedon River, Cimon had become a

leading politician. However, his reputa-
tion was severely damaged when he took
an Athenian contingent to assist Sparta in
quelling a slave rebellion. The Athenian
expedition ended badly when the
Spartans rejected the offer of help.
Cimon was ostracized and banished from
Athens in 461 BCE. His exit left the
stage clear for Pericles to become the
city’s leading statesman.
In 449 BCE, an Athenian diplomat
named Callias succeeded in negotiating a
treaty with the Persians, which put an
end to the Persian Wars.To celebrate the
end of hostilities, Pericles embarked on
an ambitious building program that
resulted in the construction of the group
of buildings that are still seen on the
Acropolis today. With the Persian threat
gone, and Athens obviously in the ascen-
dancy, other city-states on the Greek
mainland lined up to join the league. In
the long run, however, the result
was that the members of the
Delian League simply became
the vassals of Athens.
The Peloponnesian War
The Peloponnesian War that was to
devastate Greece between the years
431 and 404 BCE was sparked off by
growing tension between Athens and
the cities of Corinth and Sparta.
Corinth had developed from an ancient
settlement near the isthmus of Corinth
to become a thriving trading city by
1000 BCE. Benefiting from two harbors,
one on the Corinthian Gulf and one on
the Saronic Gulf, Corinth became the
major center of commerce in Greece by
650 BCE. As Athens increased both its
naval and commercial activity under
Pericles, the older city felt threatened.
The years leading up to 431 BCE also
saw relations between Athens and Sparta
deteriorate; Sparta saw the growing
Delian League as a threat to the stability
of the Greek mainland. In 431 BCE,
Corinth joined with Sparta in forming
the Spartan Confederacy to counteract
the rising power of the Delian League.
Other members of the confederacy were
Thebes, Macedon, and Ambracia on the
Ionian coast.These allies faced the might

of Athens,which was concentrated along
the northern and eastern coasts of the
Aegean Sea, on most of the large
Aegean islands, and in Byzantium.
Before long, the rivalry between Sparta
and Athens finally erupted into the
Peloponnesian War.
In 431 BCE, the Spartans
launched the first of a number
of raids against the country-
side surrounding Athens. As
the army of the Spartan
Confederacy pillaged unim-
peded through the rural
regions of Attica, Pericles gath-
ered the residents of Attica inside
the city walls of Athens for safe-
ty. In the following year, 430
BCE, plague decimated the
overcrowded city. The angry
and dying Athenians removed
Pericles from office, and he was
tried and fined for misuse
of public funds. After a brief
reinstatement, he died in 429
BCE.The Age of Pericles was at
an end.
Golden age of Athens
During the time of Athenian
ascendancy under Pericles, the
government of Athens and its
culture can both be said to have
enjoyed a golden age. In partic-
ular, the constitution was mod-
ified to extend the principles of
democracy, further weakening
the power of the aristocracy.
The main body of the
Athenian political system was
the public assembly (the eccle-
sia). In theory, all Athenians
could attend the assembly, but in prac-
tice, although there were something like
30,000 to 40,000 citizens, only around
6,000 actually attended meetings. The
meetings were held around once a
month in a natural amphitheater on a
hillside, where the citizens would debate
and vote on motions prepared by the
Council in advance. The Council con-
sisted of 500 members who were elected
each year, usually from families of the
middle and upper classes.
In earlier centuries, one of the most
important political offices was that of
archon, or magistrate. In 487 BCE, a
change had been made in the way the
archons were selected. From that point
onward, the archons were appointed
by lot, rather than elected. The
change meant that the magistracy
lost much of its importance, as did
the Areopagus, the old council of
the nobility to which ex-archons
belonged. In 462 BCE, the judicial
function of the Areopagus was large-
ly taken over by jury tribunals, and its
supervision of polis administrators was
relegated to the Council of 500.
Farmers and politicians
Around the middle of the fifth century
BCE, it became possible for archons to
be drawn from the zeugitai (farmers who
owned land). A system of attendance
fees, payable to magistrates and council
and jury members so they did not lose
financially because of their services,
was introduced. At the beginning
of the fourth century BCE, the
payment was extended to cover
attendance at the public assembly,
which meant that all citizens
could exercise their political
rights without the worry of
financial loss. The change was
of particular benefit to the
thetes (small landless farmers and
day laborers).
The selection of magistrates by lot
carried risks, because some aspects of the
role required a degree of specialized
knowledge not available to the ordinary
man. In an effort to deal with this prob-
lem, the Athenians created 10 elected

strategoi (commanders-in-chief), who
were appointed for one-year terms.They
could be reelected but were subject to
monitoring by their fellow strategoi. If
necessary, they could be removed from
office by popular vote in the assembly,
which meant there was little chance of a
strategos becoming a tyrant. Pericles
served as a strategos continuously from
443 to 430 BCE.
The assembly
Given the size of the assembly, there was
only time for a few of those present to
speak. Because the issues discussed were
often complicated, not everyone could
be expected to speak with equal author-
ity. To address several thousand people
and convince them to vote the way the
speaker wanted demanded special skills
in public speaking. In response to these
demands, a new class of orator-politi-
cians, called rhetors, developed. These
rhetors were generally wealthy people,
and they played an essential role in
political decision making. Pericles was
the most famous of the rhetors, and the
most important.
Rhetors spoke either on their own
behalf or on behalf of special interest
groups.They were not politicians repre-
senting specific political parties; political
parties did not exist in the modern sense.
Athenian democracy allowed everyone,
from all classes and walks of life, to
participate in political life, but it was
not until the second half of the fifth
century BCE that nonaristocrats were
called on as designated speakers in the
public assembly.

Pericles on democracy
A speech attributed to Pericles and
believed to have been given around 431
BCE encapsulates his beliefs on the ben-
efits of democracy. The speech praises
Athens for its power, strength, prosperity,
openness, and freedom, as well as the
equality of its citizens. He says: “Our
government is no imitation of our
neighbors’. On the contrary, we serve
as an example for them.We are a demo-
cracy,
because the government is 
in the hands of the people and not in the
hands of a small group. Our law states
that every citizen has equal rights. We
Athenians recognize the supremacy of
intelligence, and when a fellow citizen
distinguishes himself from the others, the
people appoint him to the highest posi-
tions. This is not the right of a gifted
man, but the reward for his great merits.
Lack of money is no obstacle to fulfilling
high office: any citizen can serve the
state.There are no privileges in our polit-
ical life, nor in our personal relationships;
we trust one another.”
He goes on to say: “Although there
are few among us who are extraordinary
enough to formulate proposals, we are all
good enough to make decisions. It is our
conviction that danger does not lie in
discussion, but in ignorance.We have the
special characteristic that we can think
before we act, even in the middle of
action. Others, however, are brave in
ignorance, yet hesitate as soon as they
begin to think!”
In other parts of the speech, Pericles
talks about the glorious history of
Athens, the great Athenian Empire, and
the courage of Athenian soldiers. He

paints an ideal picture of Athenian
democracy.There is no mention of slav-
ery. Slaves were an accepted fact of life in
the Athenian state. Their lack of rights
was an issue ignored by all Greeks,
including Pericles.
The perils of democracy
Not everyone was in favor of the idea of
democracy. An anonymous political
pamphlet from the Age of Pericles sum-
marizes a number of arguments against
democracy that were widespread in
Athens at the time. Although the pam-
phleteer argues against these opinions, he
nevertheless offers a good impression of
the anti-democratic viewpoint.
Against equal participation in gov-
ernment for all citizens, he writes:“One
can argue that not everyone should be
allowed to speak and sit on the council,
but only the best and most intelligent
citizens … how can such a low person
decide what is good for himself or for
the entire populace?” The main objec-
tion of the critics of democracy was that
effective government was impossible
when left to the less educated members
of society.
This was certainly the view of the
Athenian philosopher Plato (c. 428–348
BCE). In his dialogue The Republic, he
called democracy anarchy. He wrote:
“Whenever a meeting must be held con-
cerning matters of state, the one to stand
up and offer advice can be a carpenter,
a smith, a shoemaker, a merchant, a
shipowner, a rich man, a poor man, of
good family, or of no family at all, and no
one thinks of telling him that his 

meddling is not justified by any knowl-
edge of matters, nor by the instruction of
a teacher.”
There were certainly other citizens in
democratic Athens who held such opin-
ions, and who favored an oligarchy (gov-
ernment by the few), even if they played
no significant political role. They were
admirers of Sparta, a state where, it was
said, everyone knew his place. Only in
the last quarter of the fifth century BCE,
when Athens was at war with Sparta,
did the supporters of oligarchy have
the opportunity to attempt to change
Athenian democracy. Their efforts came
to nothing, however.
The culture of the golden age
During its golden age, Athens was both
powerful and prosperous. The city’s
wealth came from the silver mines of
Attica and the harbor dues of Piraeus,
which was now the most important port
in the eastern Mediterranean region.
The Athenian golden age saw an
explosion of creativity in philosophy, art,
architecture, and science. For the first
time,Athens became an important center
for philosophy and science. Philosophers
gathered there from all corners of the
world, finding a warm welcome among
the richer citizens. Among the leading
figures who congregated in Athens were
Anaxagoras, Socrates, and Plato.
Athens was also visited by sophists—
traveling teachers who specialized in
teaching intellectual skills, particularly
rhetoric and disputation. One of these
sophists was Damon, who was also a
master of music. He had a special influ-
ence on Pericles, as did the Ionian
philosopher Anaxagoras.Throughout his
life, Pericles was noted for his eloquence,
wisdom, and patriotism, which won him
recognition from the majority of the cit-
izens of Athens. Although he remained
aloof from most Athenians, he had a
number of distinguished friends, includ-

ing the playwright Sophocles, the histo-
rian Herodotus, the sculptor Phidias, and
the sophist Protagoras. Pericles never
married, but he had a mistress, Aspasia.
She was a hetaira, a sophisticated, highly
educated type of prostitute.
One project that had personal inter-
est for Pericles was the development of
the colony of Thurii on the Gulf of
Tarentum in southern Italy. Thurii was
intended to be a model colony, taking in
emigrants from all over Greece, the
Aegean islands, and Ionia and molding
them into an ideal community. Many
famous figures became involved. The
philosopher Protagoras of Abdera is said
to have written its laws, while the 
famous architect and urban designer
Hippodamus of Miletus drew up city
plans for the colony. Hippodamus had
designed Piraeus, which featured a street
plan of straight streets crossing each other
to flank rectangular blocks of buildings.
Because of this connection, some histo-
rians believe that Thurii may have had a
similar plan, but this has not yet been
confirmed by archaeological excavation.
The literary arts flourished in Athens
under Pericles. In the theater, Greek
tragedy reached its peak, with the plays
of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides
being performed. The great comedy
writer Aristophanes was also working at
this time.
Architecture
After the destruction of the Acropolis by
the Persians in 480 BCE, the Athenians
had vowed never to build there again.As
they regained confidence and power
during the fifth century BCE, this view-
point gradually changed. To mark the
peace with Persia of 449 BCE, Pericles
initiated a great building program on the
Acropolis, both to restore the temples
destroyed by the Persians and to con-
struct new buildings.
The years between 447 and 406 BCE
saw the completion of some of the most
outstanding examples of Greek architec-
ture. Among the buildings constructed
during that period were the Propylaea,
the Erechtheum, and the Temple of
Athena Nike.The most famous product
of this construction program, however,
was the Parthenon.

120
ANCIENT GREECE
I
n ancient Athens, marriage was seen as a
practical rather than a romantic arrangement;
citizens were expected to marry and to
procreate. Usually, the fathers of the bride
and groom made a contractual agreement
for a dowry to be paid by the bride’s family
to the groom, although the agreement could
occasionally be between the groom himself
and the bride’s father.
The main purpose of a marriage was to
produce legitimate children, who would be
citizens of Athens. So, an Athenian citizen had
to marry another Athenian citizen; otherwise,
the children of the marriage would not be
deemed citizens.The wedding was celebrated
by a wedding feast, held in the house of the
bride’s family.After the feast, the bridegroom
led his veiled wife to his own house, followed
by well-wishers who usually sang outside the
bridal chamber.
The bride was generally much younger than
her bridegroom. In classical Athens, she
would typically be around 14, and he might
be in his late twenties. Greek society was
strictly patriarchal, and the young wife had a 
subordinate position. Her place was in the
home, and in theory, she would leave it only
rarely to attend funerals and religious 
celebrations. In practice, however, there were
many religious events in which women played
an important role.
In Greek society, women were generally
thought to be inferior beings. Men viewed
women largely in terms of their bodies—
they were categorized into four groups by their
ability to bear children.These groups were the
young, sexually immature girl; the marriageable
virgin; the sexually active, fertile wife and mother;
and the elderly, infertile woman. Outside of this
classification, and essentially outside of society, fell
unmarried women who had lost their virginity,
infertile women, and prostitutes.
A marriage could be ended by divorce. For the
husband, this was a simple matter of just
banishing his wife from the house.The wife could
also leave, but she would probably be unable to
obtain the return of her dowry. For this, she
would have to go to the courts, which, like so
many other things in Greece, were dominated by
men and would be unlikely to find in her favor.
A man is shown leading his bride in this
illustration of a wedding scene on a Greek
pyxis (jewelry box). In ancient Athens, women
married when they were very young.
MARRIAGE IN ANCIENT ATHENS

The Parthenon is
the most famous 
of all the temples
built during the Age
of Pericles.
121
THE AGE OF PERICLES
A marble temple dedicated to
Athena, the Parthenon took its name
from one of the goddess’s titles, Athena
Parthenos, meaning Athena the Virgin.
Work began on the building in 447
BCE, yet it was not completed until 438
BCE. The building works were carried
out under the direction of the sculptor
Phidias. He was also responsible for one
of the most imposing features of the
temple, a statue of the goddess that stood
40 feet (12 m) high. Made of gold and
ivory, it was one of the most admired
pieces of art of the ancient world. It is
believed to have been destroyed by fire.
The Athenian building program pro-
vided employment for many of the
city’s poorer citizens, while making
Athens the most magnificent city of 
the ancient world. This blossoming 
of culture, art, and architecture in the
fifth century BCE is evidence of the
preeminent position Athens held in
Greece at that time.

THE GREAT 
PHILOSOPHERS
F
rom the sixth century BCE, Greece was home to a number of
famous philosophers. Men such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,
Pythagoras, and Diogenes came up with ideas that were to shape
the history of Western thought.
Like most ancient peoples, the Greeks
worshipped a variety of gods, who they
believed could influence human affairs.
However, from the sixth century BCE
onward, there was also a general growth
of secular thinking. The fifth-century-
BCE physician Hippocrates searched 
for a natural, rather than a supernatural,
explanation for disease, while the histori-
an Thucydides made no allowance for
the actions of the gods in his account of
events of the past. The philosopher
Protagoras,also of the fifth century BCE,
claimed that there was no absolute
“right” and “wrong”—only what human
opinion determined was so.This idea was
expressed in his famous saying “Man is
the measure of all things.”
Some thinkers, such as Diagoras of
Melos (c. fifth century BCE), went so far
as to doubt the existence of the gods.
However, even for people who did not
possess such extreme views, the relation-
ship between the gods, fate, and man’s
own responsibility became increasingly a
matter for debate in the fifth and fourth
centuries BCE, which contributed to the
growth of Greek philosophy.
Ionian philosophy
Greek philosophy had its origins in the
sixth century BCE in Ionia. Ionia was a
region in western Anatolia that had been
occupied by Greeks since around 1000
BCE. People who lived there were more
open to influences from other lands and
cultures than the citizens of the city-
states of mainland Greece. They would
have been aware of intellectual accom-
plishments such as the discoveries of the
Babylonian astronomers.These new ideas
opened the way for discussions about
natural phenomena and gave rise to the
birth of philosophy and science.
These new “natural philosophers”
tried to describe and explain the origin
and existence of heaven and earth in a
rational manner, rather than through
myths involving the various gods. The
philosophers were searching for basic
rational principles that could explain the
entire universe.
The School of Miletus
The center of the explosion of new ideas
was Miletus, a city on the southwest
coast of Ionia.The first of these thinkers
(now considered to be the founder 
of Greek philosophy) was Thales of
Miletus, who lived from around 610 to
540 BCE. In the first half of the sixth
century BCE, Thales rejected a mytho-

logical explanation of the universe and
attempted to explain it in rational terms.
Thales left no writings of his own, but
his beliefs are discussed in Aristotle’s
Metaphysics, a work written in the fourth
century BCE. Thales was noted for his
knowledge of astronomy. He is reputed
to have predicted the solar eclipse of May
28, 585 BCE. To make this calculation,
Thales would have used mathematical
techniques borrowed from Babylon in
the east and possibly also from Egypt in
the south. Thales is said to have visited
Egypt, where he calculated the height of
a pyramid. He subsequently introduced
geometry to the Greek world, using
Egyptian examples and applications.
Because of his practice of making careful
observations in order to draw conclu-
sions about the physical nature of the
world,Thales has sometimes been called
the first scientist. He formulated a theo-
ry that the original principle matter of
the cosmos was water,from which every-
thing proceeds and into which every-
thing is eventually resolved.
Anaximander
Anaximander of Miletus (c. 611–546
BCE) was, if anything, even more bril-
liant than Thales, his teacher, was.
Anaximander recorded his theories
about the nature of the cosmos in a trea-
tise called About Nature. Much of this
work is now lost, although the substance
of it is referred to by later writers.
According to Anaximander,the entire
cosmos was created and derived from
something that he called the apeiron,
which can be translated as “the indeter-
minate” or “the unlimited.” Everything
originated from the apeiron, which he
defined as the first element, and every-
thing would return to it.Anaximander is
credited with having produced a sundial
and the first Greek map of the world. He
is also believed to have introduced a
number of hypotheses about astronomy.
According to Roman writers of the third
century CE, Anaximander also came up
with a remarkable theory about the
development of life on earth. He
believed that humans developed from
embryos that were once found inside of
fish, a theory that predated the evolu-
tionary theories of Charles Darwin by
more than 2,300 years.
Anaximenes of Miletus, a student of
Anaximander, was active in the second

half of the sixth century BCE.The last of
the three great scholars of the School of
Miletus, Anaximenes proposed a system
of philosophy based on the idea that a
primary element was the origin of all
things and beings, including the gods.
This primary element was air. Air, he
argued, could be transformed into water,
earth, and fire.This theory explained the
origins of the four elements that were
seen as being basic to nature—earth,
water, air, and fire. A saying of his sums
up his concept: “As the soul, which is
breath, holds us together, so does air hold
the whole world together.”
Xenophanes
Two other main thinkers who con-
tributed to Ionian natural philosophy
were Xenophanes and Heraclitus.
Xenophanes was a poet-philosopher
who lived from around 580 to 480 BCE.
He was born in Colophon, not far from
Miletus, but left his place of birth when
it came under Persian rule. He settled in
the Greek city of Elea in southern Italy,
where he is believed to have founded the
school of philosophy that was later made
famous by Parmenides.
Xenophanes roamed through south-
ern Italy, Sicily, and probably the Greek
mainland until old age, reciting his poet-
ry, through which he criticized the opin-
ions of his contemporaries. He was par-
ticularly scathing about the accepted
mythical explanations of the world and
the fact that people believed the gods
resembled humans. In attacking how
human beings worshipped gods that
looked like themselves, he suggested that
if cows or horses could draw, they would
portray their gods as cows or horses. He
also spoke out against wealth, soothsay-
ing, the drinking parties of the nobility,
and the idolization of the winners of the
Olympic Games. In the last case, he
emphasized that it was better to honor a
scholar than an athlete because, he said, a
learned man could be of benefit in the
managing of the polis, and wise counsel
could even bring money. Xenophanes’
criticisms were based on his conviction
that sensory perceptions were always
deceptive and, consequently, could not
lead to sure knowledge. Sure knowledge
could only reside in the divine—an
invisible and omnipresent god.
Heraclitus
Heraclitus of Ephesus, who probably
lived from around 560 to 480 BCE,
expressed his ideas in a series of proverbs.
His main theory was that the entire cos-
mos is organized and directed by a single
principle, called the Logos in Greek.The
material embodiment of this Logos was
fire, which Heraclitus considered to be
the essential form of matter.The logos is
the directing force that ensures equilibri-
um in the world by balancing change in
one area with an equivalent and opposite
change elsewhere. One of Heraclitus’s
best-known sayings, attributed to him by
the later philosopher Plato (c. 428–348
BCE), was that “all things are in flux.”

Anaxagoras
One result of the Persian drive into
Anatolia in the fifth century BCE was
the emigration of Ionian scholars to the
Greek mainland and its colonies.
Anaxagoras (c. 500–428 BCE), who was
born in Clazomenae in Ionia, moved to
Athens around 480 BCE. In contrast to
earlier thinkers who looked to earth, air,
fire, and water for the origin of ultimate
reality, Anaxagoras formulated the doc-
trine of nous (meaning eternal intelli-
gence, from the Greek for “mind” or
“reason”). In a work entitled On Nature,
only portions of which survive, he sug-
gested that all matter existed in a state of
chaos as infinitely numerous and small
particles called “seeds.”These seeds were
brought into order by the animating
force of nous.
Anaxagoras taught in Athens for 30
years, during which time his students
included the dramatist Euripides and
possibly also the philosopher Socrates
(469–399 BCE). He was also friends
with Pericles, but the Athenian statesman
was unable to help Anaxagoras when he
was charged with impiety for insisting
that the stars, including the sun, were
glowing masses of red hot stone and that
the moon received its light from the sun.
For these ideas—far ahead of their
time—Anaxagoras was sentenced to
death, but he managed to escape to
Lampsacus in Anatolia.
Pythagoras
Thinkers leaving Ionia set up schools of
philosophy in southern Italy and Sicily as
well as in Athens. One of these thinkers
was Pythagoras (c. 580–500 BCE), who
was born on the island of Samos off the
coast of Anatolia. In his late twenties,
apparently unhappy with the policies of
the Samian tyrant Polycrates, Pythagoras
left Samos for Croton, a Greek colony in
southern Italy, where he settled around
530 BCE.
In Croton, Pythagoras established a
philosophical sect that had two main

teachings. One idea was that the study of
mathematics and numbers could reveal
the hidden order of the universe. The
other idea was the doctrine of metempsy-
chosis, which stated that at death the soul
passes into another body, either that of a
human or that of an animal.
The fact that the Pythagorean move-
ment was a sect was important. It was the
first time in the history of Greek religion
that a group had distinguished itself in
this way. At first, the Pythagoreans had
great influence in Croton, but the resi-
dents of the city came to distrust the sect
so much that around 500 BCE they set
fire to the Pythagorean building. The
embittered Pythagoras left the city for
another Greek colony close by called
Metapontion, where he died within a
short time.
An important part of Pythagoras’s
teaching was the concept of purity and
ascesis (training or exercise). He asserted
that anyone who does not succeed in
keeping his body pure by following the
rules of life also contaminates his soul.
Unjust behavior also pollutes the soul,
which is then not capable of achieving
sophia (wisdom or insight).
According to Pythagoras’s followers,
someone’s conduct in life could affect his
or her eternal fate.An immoral life could
lead to reincarnation as an animal.
Pythagoreans believed that the main goal
in life is to attain as much sophia as pos-
sible, so the soul rises toward a better
body in the next life.
Music and mathematics
After Pythagoras’s death, his disciples 
continued to develop his ideas. In math-
ematics, they searched for patterns,
believing that the essence of all things lay
in numbers and that all relationships
could be expressed numerically. Music,
in particular, could be explained by
mathematical formulas. Pythagoras’s fol-
lowers discovered that if a string of a
stringed instrument is stopped halfway
along its length, it will produce a note
one octave higher than the note of the
whole string.

Pythagoras, shown in this 17th-century-CE
illustration, is identified with the theorem
about the lengths of the sides of a right-
angled triangle.
In geometry, the Pythagoreans estab-
lished the famous theorem that the
square of the hypotenuse (the longest
side) of a right-angled triangle is equal to
the sum of the squares of the other two
sides. This theorem is still taught in
schools today.
The Pythagoreans were among the
first to teach that the Earth is a spherical
planet that revolves around a fixed point.
They also saw a numerical scheme
behind the arrangement of the heavenly
bodies. Pythagoras’s followers believed
that these bodies were separated from
each other by intervals corresponding to
the harmonic length of strings.The very
movement of the heavenly bodies, they
contended, produced music—the “har-
mony of the spheres.”
The teachings of Pythagoras had a
considerable influence on many Greek
thinkers of the fifth century BCE, one of
whom was Parmenides of Elea. Elea was
a small Greek colony on the southwest
coast of Italy, and it was there that
Parmenides was born in 515 BCE.
Growing up in a wealthy and pow-
erful family, he became a politi-
cian before founding a school of
philosophy in his home town.
An ideal world
The heart of the philosophy
of Parmenides was that the
material world is unreal; reality
only subsists in a timeless
“ideal world,” an idea that
may have owed something to
the Pythagoreans. Parmenides
expressed his ideas in a poem,
large parts of which have
survived. He believed that all
movement is nothing other
than outward appearance.
Only “being” exists; there 
is no “not being.” The
“being” is like a sphere—perfect
and indivisible.
The radical nature of Parmenides’
philosophy is evident when compared to
that of the great Ionian philosophers of
the seventh and sixth centuries BCE.
They supposed that all things were
derived from a basic element—whether
water, fire, air, or earth—and assumed
that the contraction of that element
brought about changes in nature. When
an element assumes a material form,
however, it must necessarily occupy a
place that was originally empty—a vacu-
um. This vacuum is what Parmenides
called “not being.” Because he believed
that such a vacuum could not exist, he
considered the entire philosophy of the
Ionian school invalid.
128
ANCIENT GREECE
Anaxagoras, shown
in this 15th-century-
CE illustration, was 
one of the first
astronomers to
believe that the
moon received its
light from the sun.


Parmenides also believed it was
impossible to explain motion in a philo-
sophical manner.When an object moves
from one place to another, he believed,
something must be moved that was there
before, or the object has to move to a
place where there was nothing. Even
when the object is initially moved to a
place where it replaces another object,
there must come a time when the moved
object comes to a stop on a place where
there was nothing—a vacuum.A vacuum
(a “not being”) cannot exist, so conse-
quently, neither can motion, from
Parmenides’ viewpoint.
Zeno (c. 495–430 BCE), a student of
Parmenides, tried to prove his teacher’s
theory of the “indivisibility of being” by
means of a number of paradoxes, the
most famous of which is that of Achilles
and the turtle. In spite of all their logic,
these stories led their readers to conclu-
sions that seemed totally absurd. For
this reason, the stories exercised the
minds of Greek thinkers for lengthy
periods of time.
130
ANCIENT GREECE
In this 15th-century-CE woodcut, Pythagoras
demonstrates the relationship between music
and mathematics.
One of Zeno’s famous paradoxes is the story of Achilles
and the turtle.Achilles, the fastest runner among the
Greeks, challenges a turtle, the slowest of animals, to a
race.Achilles gives the turtle a head start of a certain
distance, and then they start to run at the same time.
When Achilles comes to the place where the turtle
started, the turtle has run a certain distance and is
ahead of Achilles.Achilles keeps running, but every time
he arrives at the place where the turtle was, the turtle
has also run a certain distance farther.As fast as Achilles
runs, and as slow as the turtle crawls, there will always
be a distance for Achilles yet to cover. In other words,
Achilles can never catch up with the turtle.This paradox
rests on the assumption of infinite divisibility. On the
basis of such clever absurdities, which appealed enor-
mously to the Greeks, Zeno attempted to demonstrate
the truth of the “indivisibility of being”—and thus that
Parmenides was right.

THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS
Atomic theory
Another of Parmenides’ students was
Leucippus (c. fifth century BCE), the
founder of the theory of atoms. In
Greek, the word atomos means “some-
thing that is not divisible.” Leucippus
argued that all matter consists of count-
less tiny particles, or atoms, and that the
diversity of matter depends on the way in
which these atoms are combined. The
point over which Leucippus stumbled
was that he had to allow for empty
space, or a vacuum, between the
atoms, which brought him
into conflict with the ideas
of his master.
The 
work 
com-
menced by Leucippus
was continued by his
student Democritus
of Abdera, who per-
fected the theory of
atoms.
Democritus
maintained that visi-
ble reality is made up
of atoms, which are in
eternal motion in end-
less space. Atoms are
unchangeable but infinitely
varied, and by joining togeth-
er, they form all living and non-
living matter.
Greek thinkers of the sixth and fifth
centuries BCE were obsessed with ques-
tions that were actually unsolvable by
philosophers. However, while seeking
answers to these questions, some of the
philosophers discovered mathematical
and scientific truths that were way ahead
of their time.
The sophists
In spite of their importance in the devel-
opment of Western thought, the early
philosophers did not have the same social
influence as the fifth-century sophists.
The sophists were teachers who traveled
from city to city, offering to tutor young
men in intellectual skills such as public
speaking. The Greek word sophistes
originally meant “expert” or “man of
wisdom,” but it gradually acquired a
different connotation.
The negative image of the sophists
arose because they excelled at rhetoric
and taught would-be public speakers how
to look at a question from both sides and
defend both viewpoints. Consequently, a
sophist came to be regarded as someone
who was very clever with words and
could convince an unsuspecting
listener of just about anything.
Good or bad, the sophist
could make a good argu-
ment for it.
Initially, the sophists
were quite popular in
Athens,but they even-
tually drew fire from
Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle, as well as
the state itself, for
their indifference to
morality.
Plato 
and
Aristotle also criticized
the sophists for taking
money,even though,as itin-
erant educators, that was how
they earned their living.
The term sophist came to acquire
a derogatory meaning, and the word
sophistry was defined as “deceptive or
false reasoning.” On one occasion,
Socrates compared the sophist to a fish-
erman:Both try to fish—one to catch his
meal, the other to catch people to cheat
them out of their money in exchange for
false teachings.
Socrates
The philosopher Socrates was of seminal
importance to the development of
Western thought. Unlike most Greek
philosophers, he came from humble ori-
gins, being the son of Sophroniscus, a
sculptor, and Phaenarete, a midwife. It is

not known who his teachers were,but he
seems to have been acquainted with the
doctrines of Parmenides, Heraclitus, and
Anaxagoras. However, far from pursuing
their ideas, he was more interested in
ethical matters, such as how a man
should conduct himself in life.
There is no clear indication as to how
Socrates supported himself.He apparent-
ly worked as a sculptor for a while; his
statue of the Three Graces stood near the
entrance to the Acropolis until the sec-
ond century CE. It is also known that he
fought as a hoplite for Athens in the
Peloponnesian War, serving with distinc-
tion in the campaign of Potidaea in
432–430 BCE.
From a relatively early age, Socrates
wanted to be a philosopher and to guide
the moral and intellectual improvement
of Athens.In order to do so,he turned an
otherwise normal life into one of public
dialogue in the marketplaces and squares
of Athens. However, Socrates wrote no
books and established no formal school
of philosophy.What is known about him
and his thinking comes primarily from
the works of his student Plato and, to
a lesser extent, from the historian
Xenophon. It is through the writings of
these two men that Socrates has been
able to exert his profound influence on
all later Western thinking.
A matter of ethics 
Socrates rejected the conflicting ideas of
the “one,”the “indivisible,”and the “eter-
nally changeable.” He also refused to
become involved in the search for the
“core of things” or “basic matter.” His
interest was in ethics and in the objective
definition of love, justice, and virtue,
achieved through rational argument. He
argued that all vice is the result of igno-
rance and that no one is intentionally
wicked. Because those who know what
is right will act rightly, virtue is the result
of knowledge.
Sophocles despised rhetoric and long-
winded 
arguments 
about 
nothing.
Consequently, he ridiculed the sophists
and rhetoricians. He was relentless in
employing logic as a weapon in his philo-
sophical duels. In these “battles,” clarity
and simplicity had the highest priority,
and in his arguments, he used expressions
and terms derived from daily life. Plato
recorded how Socrates managed to
embarrass Gorgias, one of the most
famous sophists of Athens, simply by ply-
ing him with question after question.
Plato also recorded an encounter
between Socrates and the two great
philosophers of Elea, Parmenides and
Zeno. The two Elean philosophers had
132

The Death of

CE. Socrates was

traveled to Athens to attend the
Panathenaea and were staying at the
home of Plato’s stepbrother. One morn-
ing, Socrates visited the famous guests
and subjected them to his relentless
questioning. Parmenides kindly attempt-
ed to answer Socrates’ questions, while
Zeno did his best to get the troublesome
visitor out of the door.
Socrates then summed up his impres-
sions of the two philosophers:“I under-
stand that Zeno is actually a second
Parmenides, even though he says things
in a totally different manner. You,
Parmenides, want to convince us that
everything is one, and Zeno says, on the
other hand,that diversity cannot exist.So
you argue in two different manners to
express the same truth: one of you claims
something, and the other repudiates the
opposite. Something like this demands a
mental effort that far exceeds my moder-
ate abilities.”
Socrates’ attitude toward the two
philosophers from Elea illustrates his
manner of disputation. He typically pre-
sented himself as someone who needed
things explained to him.This profession
of ignorance, given his brilliance and
extraordinary sharpness of mind, is called
Socratic irony. By constantly questioning
his interlocutor and forcing him to
define his terms, Socrates’ aim was to
encourage people to think for themselves
and seek eternal truths.
The pursuit of knowledge
Socrates started from the basic principle
that only the good can guide the behav-
ior of man, and man must strive toward
knowing that good. When man has
found that out, he will pursue it—no
one will ever go deliberately against the
good. Socrates’ philosophical enquiries
took the form of a conversation or dia-
logue—starting from the specific, he

sought general truths through an endless
game of question and answer. Even
though his method was based on logic
and rationality, Socrates also accepted
that there was something like “the
voice of one’s own conscience”—an
instinctive,nonrational sense of high-
er values that could keep a man from
committing wrongful actions.
Unlike the sophists, Socrates
refused to gather paying students
around him. Instead, he would present
questions to anyone who talked to him
at any time. He elicited answers that,
after subjecting them to acute analysis
mixed with mild derision, he rejected as
inadequate or incorrect.
He then
attempted to reach a logical and correct
conclusion, encouraging his “victim”
to formulate clear-cut defini-
tions. This goal was hardly
ever achieved, but the value
of the discussion lay in the
enlightenment of both
people involved.
By the end of the
fifth 
century 
BCE,
Socrates had made a lot
of enemies in Athens.
His criticism of the
sophists and of the
institution of democ-
racy did not endear
him to the general public.
In the drama The Clouds, Aristophanes
made fun of him as the director of a
“thinking shop.” Eventually, Socrates’
enemies managed to get their revenge. In
399 BCE, he was charged with religious
heresies and corrupting the morals of
Athenian youths.
The trial of Socrates
In accordance with Athenian law, the
accused had to defend himself by means
of a public speech. Plato’s Apology gives
an account of Socrates’ defending argu-
ments, which exhibited both his ironic
style and his simple dialectic. Socrates
disputed the Athenian judges’ authority
to sentence him to death, as his accusers
wished, and pointed out great gaps in the
official accusation. However, he had
clearly determined that if the jury took
offense at his life and work, then they
had to condemn him.He refused to deny
what he had asserted for so many years.
It is possible that Socrates could have
avoided his heavy sentence by using a
different defense, based less deeply on
principle. Had he done so, he might have
got off with a fine; there were plenty of

his students who would have been happy
to pay it for him. Instead, he was sen-
tenced to death, although at first only by
a small majority.As allowed by Athenian
law, Socrates replied to the sentence—
with an ironic proposition that it should
be changed to a small fine because his
importance to the state was also small.
Enraged by his stance, the jury voted
again.The result was an increased major-
ity for the death penalty.
Socrates could easily have fled the
city; his friends even planned his escape.
However, he preferred to comply with
the verdict. Plato’s Phaedo describes the
final day of Socrates’ life. In the evening,
in accordance with the usual method of
execution, he drank a fatal cup of the
poisonous herb hemlock.
Plato’s Academy
Socrates’ student Plato (c. 428–348 BCE)
went on to become a distinguished
philosopher in his own right. He came
from a noble, wealthy family and grew
up during the time of the Peloponnesian
War. Plato contemplated a political
career when he was young, but he
became disillusioned with politics, and it
was then that he became a follower of
Socrates. Plato was greatly influenced by
Socrates’ method of question and answer
in the pursuit of truth.
In 387 BCE, Plato founded his
Academy, a school devoted to the pursuit
of philosophical knowledge, and it was
there that he refined his own philosoph-
ical ideas. He considered that only “the
idea” was real and rejected the view that

136
ANCIENT GREECE
S
ome students of Socrates attempted to carry
on the work of their master, in particular 
by practicing asceticism (giving up material 
pleasures). One of those students was
Antisthenes, who founded the movement that
was later known as the Cynics.Antisthenes had
been a sophist until he came under the influence
of Socrates, after which he started to protest
against the material interests of established socie-
ty. He contended that any form of luxury or
pleasure made people slaves, and therefore
unhappy. Instead, people should free themselves
from all needs and strive toward the good; only
that approach could offer a happy life.
These ideas were carried to the extreme by
Diogenes (c. 400–325 BCE), who was born in
Sinope on the coast of the Black Sea. In middle
age, he went to Athens, where he became a stu-
dent of Antisthenes. Diogenes rejected all social
conventions and completely embraced poverty
and austerity. Homeless and sleeping outdoors, he
traveled from city to city expounding his belief in
the simple life to all who would listen. His brutish
lifestyle earned him the abusive name of kuon
(“dog”), and from this, his followers came to be
called kunikoi, or Cynics. Diogenes welcomed the
nickname, arguing that if humans lived like dogs,
they would be far happier.
Diogenes was famous for
his austere lifestyle. He
believed that human
society was hypocritical
and that it was better to
live like a dog with no
material possessions.This

knowledge was based on sensory experi-
ence.The object of knowledge (the idea)
had to be something fixed, permanent,
and unchangeable—it was based on
reason, not sensory perception. This
approach countered the ideas of most
previous philosophers, who had sought
to explain reality in terms of the materi-
al world.Plato maintained that reality did
not reside in the material world but in
another world of eternal phenomena
that he called Forms. All objects in the
material world are merely representa-
tions of the eternal Forms.
Applying his theory of knowl-
edge to social philosophy, Plato
wrote the Republic and the Laws.
These described an ideal city-
state, which could serve as a blue-
print for a state on earth. In this
state,
the 
philosopher-rulers
would exercise control over the
two lower classes—peasant-arti-
sans and soldiers. Because the leaders
would have true knowledge, there
would be no room for dissent. In 367
BCE, Plato tried to persuade the tyrant
Dionysius II of Syracuse to put his ideas
into practice but did not succeed.
Aristotle
Aristotle (384–322 BCE) was Plato’s
most important student. He spent 20
years at Plato’s Academy, but while he
was strongly influenced by Plato’s ideas,
his own philosophy developed in a dif-
ferent direction. Aristotle preferred an
experimental and deductive approach
based on the reasoning of the mind,
insisting that the observation of visible
reality was of prime importance. His
major contribution to philosophy was to
establish a system of logic that was to
influence philosophical reasoning for
more than two thousand years.
In 335 BCE, Aristotle established his
own school in Athens, called the
Lyceum, where scientific subjects such as
biology and physics were studied in 
addition to philosophy and logic.
Aristotle taught at the school but also
had time to pursue his own research. He
wrote major works on zoology, geogra-
phy, history, mathematics, and astronomy,
which were to be highly influential in
medieval times. He also drew up an
inventory of all political systems of the
time and described an ideal polis that
would combine the best elements of
existing systems.

THE PELOPONNESIAN
WAR
T
he Peloponnesian War was a mammoth struggle between
Sparta and Athens that took place toward the end of the fifth
century BCE.The war lasted for 27 years, from 431 to 404 BCE,
and tore the Greek world apart.
The roots of the conflict between Athens
and Sparta lay in their cultural differ-
ences. By the middle of the fifth century
BCE, Athens had become the undisput-
ed artistic and intellectual center of
Greece. It was an “open” society, engag-
ing in many commercial transactions
with the outside world and depending
on large-scale imports of food to feed its
population.Athens was a progressive and
democratic state, and an expansive naval
power. Sparta, on the other hand, was an
isolated, agrarian, and largely self-suffi-
cient closed society with an oligarchic
government (one dominated by a small
elite).While the militaristic Sparta expe-
rienced only stagnation, Athens became
increasingly self-confident and more
aggressive in its foreign affairs.
Alliances
Both Athens and Sparta had many allies.
Athens was backed by the member states
of the Delian League, an alliance that had
been set up in 477 BCE to protect the
Greek cities of Ionia (an area of south-
western Anatolia) and the nearby islands
against possible Persian attack. As the
Greeks defeated the Persians in succes-
sive battles, Athens, with its powerful
navy, gradually came to dominate the
league, which soon became more of an
Athenian empire than a voluntary con-
federation of independent city-states. On
Sparta’s side was the Peloponnesian
League, a group of city-states located in
the Peloponnese (the southern part of
mainland Greece).
In the middle of the fifth century
BCE, there were occasional skirmishes
between Athens and Sparta. The skir-
mishes ended in 446 BCE,when the two
parties signed a peace agreement. The
pact was supposed to hold for three
decades. In fact, the Thirty Years’ Peace
lasted only until 431 BCE, when full-
scale war broke out.
The origins of the war
The immediate cause of the war was the
fact that Athens assisted the island of
Corcyra (present-day Corfu) in its con-
flict with Corinth, an ally of Sparta.
Corcyra had long been a colony of
Corinth and, in turn, had founded its
own colony, called Epidamnus, on the
Adriatic coast of what is now Albania.
When a dispute erupted between
Epidamnus and Corcyra, Epidamnus
called on Corinth for help. Corcyra, feel-
ing threatened by Corinth, decided to
join the powerful Delian League. Athens
was happy to welcome the island into the
coalition, particularly because the addi-

campaign would not be short of finance,
while the Long Walls gave the Athenians
a secure route to the vital port of Piraeus,
where there lay a fleet of 200 warships.
Pericles made the decision not to
defend Attica on land; his plan was to
defeat Sparta at sea. In 431 BCE, the
Spartans invaded unopposed, destroying
the harvest, cutting down olive trees and
grapevines, and demolishing buildings.
The raid lasted perhaps a month—his-
torically campaigning seasons were short
because soldiers had to return home to
tend to their farms. However, the raids
became an annual occurrence over the
following five years. Pericles retaliated
with attacks on Megara and Epidaurus.
Plague
In 430 BCE, a deadly epidemic broke
out in Athens, which was overcrowded
with refugees from Attica.The historian
tion of Corcyra’s fleet of 120 war vessels
to its own fleet would greatly strengthen
the naval power of Athens. A joint force
of Athenian and Corcyrean ships clashed
with the Corinthian fleet in 433 BCE.
The following year, Athens laid siege to
Potidaea, a Corinthian colony. Incensed,
the Corinthians demanded that Sparta
should declare war on Athens.
Archidamus II, king of Sparta, made a
final attempt to avoid a confrontation
with Athens. As commander-in-chief of
the Peloponnesian League, he urged its
members to review the situation before
acting precipitously. His urging was in
vain, however. In 432 BCE, the League
voted for war.The following year,Athens
in turn declared war on Sparta.
The leading Athenian statesman,
Pericles, was confident that Athens was
the stronger power. Money collected
from the Delian League meant that any

Thucydides provided a very graphic
account of the illness (see box,page 142),
which killed around 50,000 people.The
psychological effects of this sudden mass
death were as serious as the physical con-
sequences of the epidemic. Believing
they might be struck down and die with-
in days, people began to live for the
moment, squandering their wealth and
committing many acts without regard for
the law. According to Thucydides, “they
did not believe they would live long
enough to be prosecuted and punished
by the judiciary.”
A change of leadership
When Pericles fell victim to the epidem-
ic in 429 BCE, the leadership of Athens
fell to Cleon, the major representative of
the pro-war party. Together with the
general Demosthenes, Cleon spearhead-

of Spartan forces at the Battle of Pylos in
425 BCE. However, in 422 BCE, Cleon’s
luck changed abruptly. In a battle to
recapture the Athenian colony of
Amphipolis, which had fallen to the
Some 30 years before the outbreak
of the Peloponnesian War, the
Athenian statesman Pericles 
initiated the building of two walls to
safeguard the route between Athens
and its port Piraeus. Between 461
and 456 BCE, two great walls were
constructed, enclosing a roadway
around 600 feet (183 m) wide.The
Long Walls turned the whole
Athens-Piraeus complex into a sin-
gle fortress, ensuring that Athens
had unrestricted access to the fleet
at Piraeus.When Attica was invaded
by the Spartans during the
Peloponnesian War, its citizens took
refuge in Athens, and many were
crammed between the Long Walls.
The difficult and unsanitary
conditions greatly contributed
to the catastrophic outbreak of
the plague in 430 BCE.
THE LONG WALLS

142
When the plague broke out in Athens in 430
BCE, the historian Thucydides was living in the
city. He wrote extensively about the plague,
noting that it claimed more victims than all of
Sparta’s campaigns combined. He went on:“I
want to discuss this illness so that able physicians
may determine whence this evil came and which
causes may have produced such a calamity. If this
illness returns, everyone shall be warned and take
measures. I speak of this epidemic as someone
who knows it intimately, for I too was affected
and I saw many fall ill and die.
“That year had been extraordinarily healthy and
free of all other disease. But if someone sus-
tained a wound or became ill, it immediately
turned into this pestilence.The healthy were
suddenly afflicted, without there being any 
evident reason for their illness. First they felt a
severe headache; their eyes turned red, their
throat became inflamed and their breathing
became labored. Hoarseness, pain in the chest,
and a mucous cough were followed by painful
contractions and convulsions, which lasted
longer with some than with others.The skin
swelled up and turned red and became covered
with small blisters of pus. Some died after seven
or nine days as a result of a burning pain in
their intestines.Those still living after this time
were struck with stomach pains.After severe
diarrhea and cramps, most succumbed from
total exhaustion.
“Generally, the contagion appeared first on the
head and subsequently spread over the entire
body. Some were blinded or paralyzed; others
went mad and did not recognize friends or rela-
tives.Although there were many unburied
corpses lying out in the open, the vultures and
other scavengers did not come near them, and
when they did eat the diseased human flesh,
they also died.”
THUCYDIDES’ ACCOUNT OF THE PLAGUE

143
THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR
Spartan general Brasidas, Cleon was
killed. Brasidas also died.
With the leading proponent for war
on either side dead, the stage was clear
for peace negotiations. On Cleon’s
death, the Athenian general Nicias
became the leading Athenian politician,
and he negotiated a peace agreement
with Sparta and the Peloponnesian
League. The Peace of Nicias was
intended to last for 50 years. In fact, it
broke down in less than three.
Alcibiades
Alcibiades (c. 450–404 BCE) was 
a young, ambitious nobleman
who, having lost his father at an
early age,had been reared by his
uncle, Pericles. Spoiled but
handsome, Alcibiades used his
charm to secure great person-
al popularity. Contemporary
sources describe his great
appetite for power as well
as his sexual and other
excesses.
In 420 BCE, when he
was around 30 years old,
Alcibiades was called on
by the Athenian people to
act as one of the ten strat-
egoi (chief military com-
manders). It was not a
good decision. Alcibiades
was keen to win honors
on the battlefield, even
though the Peace of
Nicias had only just
been negotiated.
Alcibiades was a
staunch political
opponent of the
treaty, and he sought to stir up some
trouble for Sparta by playing on the
dissatisfaction that some members of the
Peloponnesian League felt with the con-
ditions set forth in the recent peace
agreement. He persuaded Athens to join
with the disaffected cities of Argos,
Mantinea, and Elis in confronting Sparta
at the Battle of Mantinea in 418 BCE.
The result was a resounding victory for
the Spartans.
Undaunted by this setback,Alcibiades
sought to revive the policies of Pericles,
who had aspired to found an empire
in the west with Thurii, in southern
Italy, as its center. The Athenian fleet
already controlled the Aegean Sea,
the Dardanelles, and the Bosporus, so
Alcibiades argued that if Athens could
extend its dominion to the western
basin of the Mediterranean, Sparta
would be completely isolated on
the Peloponnese.
Sicilian campaign
The primary objective of
Alcibiades’ plan was to gain
control of Sicily, which he con-
sidered a bridgehead to both
southern Italy and Africa. A
large number of Athenians
enthusiastically supported
this scheme, but several
cautious men, including
Nicias and Socrates, opposed
the enterprise. A decision in favor of
war was made after a delegation from
Sicily visited Athens. The party
consisted of representatives of sev-
eral Sicilian cities, who claimed
that they felt threatened by the
powerful Dorian city of Syracuse,
an ally of Sparta, that dominated
Still a bustling commercial center today,
Piraeus has been the port of Athens since
ancient times. During the Peloponnesian
War,Athens and the port were connected by
fortified walls.

the island. Alcibiades’ plan encountered
little further resistance from the Athe-
nian assembly. Nicias, Lamachus, and
Alcibiades were appointed leaders of a
military expedition to Sicily to capture
Syracuse.A fleet of around 260 ships was
fitted out. On board were more than
5,000 heavily armed hoplites, in addition
to thousands of support troops.
Disaster in Sicily
From the moment the fleet reached
Sicily in 415 BCE, everything went
wrong.The island’s Greek colonies were
not willing to participate in the cam-
paign against Syracuse. Nor did they
want to bear the heavy cost of provision-
ing the Athenian troops, which forced
the expedition’s leaders to look outside
the city walls, where makeshift markets
sold supplies at monstrously inflated
prices.The cities of Tarentum and Locris
even refused to supply fresh water.
In spite of such setbacks, the Athe-
nians succeeded in taking the city of
Catana, which was strategically impor-
tant because it lay between Syracuse and
Messina and could be used to command
the strait between Sicily and southern
Italy.The aim was to isolate Syracuse and
enable the Athenians to find allies among
the discontented cities on the other side
of the strait.
By this point, Alcibiades was no
longer involved in the campaign, how-
ever, because he had been recalled to

Athens on a charge of sacrilege. The
accusation was that he had “mocked the
goddesses of Eleusis and ridiculed their
mysteries.” On the return voyage to
Athens, he escaped his captors and
fled to Sparta, where he became
a counselor to the enemies
of his native city.
Syracuse
In the spring of 
414 BCE, the aging
Nicias took com-
mand of the Athenian
troops on Sicily and
started a siege of Syracuse.The Athenians
attempted to isolate the city by building
a siege wall on land while their fleet kept
the Syracuse warships confined to the
harbor. However, the arrival of a
Spartan general,
Gylippus,
with a
Peloponnesian force put an end to
Athenian hopes of a swift victory.
Suddenly, the Athenians were on the
defensive. Nicias was forced to send a
desperate message to Athens for more
troops. Athens responded with a second
army and support fleet, but neither was
able to salvage the expedition.
When, in September of 413 BCE,
Nicias finally decided to abandon the
siege of Syracuse, the retreat degenerated
into a debacle.The Athenian troops were
surrounded and either massacred or
taken prisoner.The commanders, includ-
ing Nicias, were summarily executed.
The other prisoners either became
forced laborers in the mines of Syracuse,
where they died slow deaths, or were
sold into slavery.
The Sicilian campaign was a dis-
aster for Athens.The campaign had
been immensely expensive, and the
whole expeditionary force of both
men and warships was wiped out.The
Athenian spirit was undaunted,
however. The war on the Greek
mainland, in the Aegean, and in
Ionia was to continue for another
nine years.
The end of Alcibiades
Alcibiades established a niche for
himself in Sparta as a strategic
advisor on the Syracuse
campaign. However, his
position there became
much less secure once
the Athenian expe-
ditionary force was
destroyed. He fled to
Anatolia and settled in the
court of the Persian governor,
where he tried to persuade the
Persians to conclude an alliance
with Athens against Sparta. This
plan failed, driving the distrustful
Persians into the arms of Sparta
instead. In 411 BCE, following
some political unrest in Athens,
Alcibiades was reinstated as an
Athenian army commander and
won some victories for Athens in
the Aegean.Toward the end of the
war, however, he lost the trust of
the Athenian people for a second
time. He once again fled to the
Persians, who killed him.
The defeat of Athens
After the disastrous Sicilian cam-
paign, the war continued,
being mainly fought in the
Aegean and Ionia. Because
so many Athenian ships
had been destroyed at
Syracuse, Sparta’s sea power
now more than equaled that
of Athens. To make matters
worse for Athens, Persia lent financial
support to Sparta and helped it to build
a new fleet. In 404 BCE, the beleaguered

THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR
M
uch of what is known about the
Peloponnesian War is derived from the
work of the historian Thucydides (c. 460–400
BCE). Born into a wealthy Athenian family,
Thucydides lived through the war, and from
its beginning, he set out to document it as
objectively as possible. Unlike his predecessor
Herodotus,Thucydides recorded events in
chronological order without reference to the
work of fate or the meddling of the gods.
Thucydides took the view that events were the
result of both the circumstances of the time and
the characters of the leading personalities
involved. He had the advantage of firsthand
knowledge of many of the events, and indeed
took part in the war himself at one point. In
424 BCE, he was elected as a strategos, given the
command of the Athenian fleet, and ordered to
go to the assistance of Amphipolis, which was
under siege by the Spartans. However, he arrived
too late to save the city from being taken, and for
this blunder, he was banished from Athens. He
spent the next 20 years in exile, but he used the
time to travel extensively around the Greek
region, gathering material for his great History of
the Peloponnesian War.
Thucydides visited Sparta, which he compared
unfavorably with Athens in the following words:“If
the city of Sparta were to be depopulated so that
only the temples and public buildings remained,
then I believe that in due course someone visiting
the city would not be able to believe that Sparta
had been as powerful a state as it currently is. But
if the city of Athens were to have the same fate, a
person visiting it later would think that it had
been even greater and more powerful than it
actually is today—just from seeing the ruins and
the enormous space they occupy.”
Thucydides’ comparison was prophetic.Anyone
traveling to Sparta today will find an insignificant
rural town without many monuments.Athens,
on the other hand, still boasts numerous ruins
of temples, theaters, marketplaces, and other
great monuments, despite its eventful and
sometimes violent history.
This bust depicts the Greek historian
Thucydides. His History of the
Peloponnesian War is the main source of
knowledge about the military struggles
between Athens and Sparta in the fifth
century BCE.
THUCYDIDES

148
ANCIENT GREECE
The atmosphere of war appears to have no
detrimental effect on the art of theater in
Athens.With the city under siege,Attica in
flames, and the Athenian fleet threatened with
destruction, dramatists such as Euripides and
Aristophanes (c. 450–388 BCE) continued to
produce tragedies and comedies.
Aristophanes’ plays enjoyed great popularity.
They were biting satirical comedies in which he
mocked both politicians and society.As a 
comedy writer, his goals were to entertain his
audience and to win the annual prize at the
festival of Dionysus. His plays about the war
describe the atmosphere of the time—firewood
is scarce and olive oil expensive, while traitors,
defectors, defeatists, and war profiteers abound.
In Acharnians (425 BCE),Aristophanes mocks
the war and makes a plea for peace, portraying
a peasant concluding his own peace with the
Spartans. In Knights (424 BCE), he attacks Cleon,
the radical democrat, who is portrayed as a
scheming slave outwitted by a sausage seller.The
warlike Cleon was a frequent target of ridicule
in Aristophanes’ plays. Clouds (423 BCE) is an
attack on the sophists and Socrates, while
Wasps (422 BCE) satirizes the Athenian love of
litigation. Peace (produced shortly before the
Peace of Nicias was signed in 421 BCE) sees a
farmer flying to heaven to find the goddess of
the title, while the farcical Lysistrata (413 BCE)
depicts the women of Athens going on sex
strike, declaring they will withhold their favors
from their husbands until the men end the war
and make peace.
In all, 11 of Aristophanes’ plays have survived.
It is clear from their content that he enjoyed
great freedom of speech to mock whatever
he disliked in Athenian society and politics,
even in a time of war.
ARISTOPHANES AND THE WAR
and isolated Athens was forced to surren-
der.The Delian League was dissolved,the

The aftermath of the war
At the end of the war,Athens was occu-
pied by the Spartan general Lysander,
who proposed that in place of the former
democracy, the city should be ruled by
an oligarchy. Thirty Athenians were
appointed to govern the city. With
Lysander’s approval, they proceeded to
seize absolute power. Backed by Spartan
troops,the Thirty Tyrants immediately set
about settling accounts with their 
former political opponents. All demo-
cratic institutions were abolished, and
with the help of their own police force,
the tyrants confiscated property, arrested

citizens on flimsy charges, and carried
out summary executions.
The rule of the Thirty Tyrants was so
unbearable that, after only one year, the
Athenians rebelled. Opponents of the
regime who had fled the city gathered
under the exiled Athenian soldier
Thrasybulus, and this makeshift army
met the forces of the Tyrants and defeat-
ed them.The triumphant Athenians then
entered the city and executed most of
the remaining Thirty, after which,
democracy was restored. Surprisingly,
Sparta did nothing to stop this turn of
events. It seems that the Spartan king,
Pausanias, disagreed with Lysander’s
ruthless treatment of the Athenians and,
rather than send out an army to reverse

the situation, preferred to recognize the
new government.
The orators
After democracy was restored in Athens
in 403 BCE, the city saw a period in
which great orators became highly influ-
ential in meetings of the public assembly.
These orators were for the most part
legal experts who were accustomed to
arguing a case in the law courts. Because,
in theory, anyone accused of a crime in
Athens had to argue his own defense,
many orators made money by writing
speeches for their clients to read in court.
Orators who wrote speeches for
other public speakers were known as
logographers or storywriters. Several
logographers are counted among Attica’s
best-known orators, even though they
never spoke during Athenian legal ses-
sions; not being citizens of Athens, they
were not allowed to do so. One of the
most famous litigators of the late fifth
century BCE was Lysias (c. 459–380
BCE), who was a metic, or foreigner
residing in Athens.
Lysias was a native of Syracuse. His
father acquired such fame as a manufac-
turer of armor and shields that Pericles
invited him to settle in Athens. After
their father’s death, Lysias and his elder
brother moved to Thurii, the Athenian
colony in southern Italy, where Lysias
learned the art of rhetoric and eloquence
from a distinguished orator. After the
failure of the Athenian campaign in
Sicily, the brothers returned to Athens,
where they earned a fortune from the
sale of weapons before the end of the
Peloponnesian War.
Following the defeat of Athens and
the installation of the Thirty Tyrants, the
new government instituted a ruthless
purge of anyone suspected of democrat-
ic sympathies. Scores of people were sent
into exile or condemned to death.
Lysias’s brother was executed, but Lysias
himself managed to escape from the city
and join the conspirators who were plan-
ning to restore democracy. After the
Thirty Tyrants were defeated, Lysias
returned to Athens. In a major trial, he
prosecuted Eratosthenes, one of the
Thirty who had survived, for the murder
of his brother. Due to the trial’s political
background, it attracted a large audience.
In his speech, Lysias outlined the
crimes that Eratosthenes had committed,
together with his role in the Thirty
Tyrants’ reign of terror. Lysias’s words
touched on matters that were fresh in the
memory of everyone. His indictment of
the oligarchs’ crimes aided the recovery
process that saw democracy reestablish
itself in Athens.

THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR
Agesilaus II, shown
on the right in this
18th-century-CE
illustration, was king
of Sparta in the
fourth century BCE.
He conducted
several successful
campaigns against
the Persians.
Spartan imperialism
Although Athens had won back its free-
dom, Sparta remained the overlord of all
Greece, which had some catastrophic
consequences. Sparta’s victory in the
Peloponnesian War had been achieved
with the help of Persian financial aid, and
in return, the Ionian Greek cities in
Anatolia had to cede their autonomy to
Persia once more. Sparta made other
cities protectorates and forced them to
pay large sums of money in tribute. In
effect, this meant that Athenian imperial-
ism, as manifested in its domination of
the Delian League and its demands for
annual tribute, had simply been replaced
by Spartan imperialism.
In 399 BCE, a new king was chosen
in Sparta. Agesilaus II (c. 444–360 BCE)
distinguished himself by his forthright-
ness and piety and proved to be a major
statesman and general. One of his first
projects after becoming king was to go
to the aid of the pro-Sparta Greek cities

in Anatolia.They were being harassed by
Persian forces, so in 396 BCE, he took a
large force to the coast of Anatolia to halt
Persian raids. He campaigned around the
Bosporus and the Meander River for the
following two years. His success on the
battlefield was an indication of the
decline of the Persian Empire.
The Corinthian War
On the mainland,a new threat to Sparta’s
dominance was looming. In 395 BCE,
the cities of Athens, Argos, Corinth, and
Thebes formed, with Persian support, an
alliance against Sparta. Several battles
were fought between Sparta and the
coalition before Agesilaus was recalled
from Anatolia to help deal with the situ-
ation.The conflict, called the Corinthian
War, lasted eight years.
In 387 BCE, Persia switched sides
and signed its own peace treaty with
Sparta. Under the terms of this settle-
ment, which was called the Peace of
Antalcidas (or the King’s Peace), all the
Greek cities in Anatolia were ceded to
Persia, while the city-states of mainland
Greece and the Aegean islands became
autonomous. This treaty put an end to
Spartan imperialist ambitions and left
Athens free to develop its position as a
commercial and cultural center.
The rise of Thebes
The early fourth century BCE
saw a new power arise.
Thebes, a large city on the
plain of Boeotia in central
Greece, was known for the
excellence of its army.
Under the strong leadership
of the charismatic and ambi-
tious Epaminondas (c. 410–362
BCE),Thebes was to achieve pre-
eminence in Greece for at least a
short time.
In 382 BCE, despite the terms of the
King’s Peace, Sparta attacked and occu-
pied Thebes.Thebes sought and received
the support of Athens, and in 379 BCE,
the Spartans were driven out. However, a
full-scale war had started. Epaminondas
was appointed army commander in 371
BCE. He introduced new infantry tactics
that brought spectacular results at the
Battle of Leuctra, fought the same year. It
was traditional for hoplite commanders
to put their strongest and most experi-
enced soldiers on the right of their for-
mations (to stop phalanxes from drifting
to the right as soldiers sought protection
behind their comrades’ shields). At
Leuctra, Epaminondas attacked in mass
on the left. This surprise move allowed
him to overwhelm the opposition.
After annihilating the Spartans at
Leuctra,
Epaminondas invaded the
Peloponnese and annexed the regions of

Arcadia and Messenia, freeing them from
the yoke of Sparta. At a stroke, Thebes
ended Sparta’s dominance in Greece and
took first place among the Greek city-
states. However, the time of triumph for
Thebes was short-lived. Alarmed by the
emergence of this new rival, Sparta and
Athens joined forces against the com-
mon enemy in 369 BCE. The new
alliance engaged with the Theban army
at the Battle of Mantinea in 362 BCE.
Although the battle was indecisive,
Epaminondas was killed, which put
an end to the decade of glory
enjoyed by Thebes.
Macedonia
During the decade of
Theban 
dominance
(371–362 BCE), two
Macedonian princes
had been held as
hostages in Thebes.
In 359 BCE, one of
these princes became
Philip II,
king of
Macedon.
Macedon
lay just to the north of
Thessaly,
and during
Philip’s reign, it became a
powerful state. The great
Athenian orator Demosthenes
understood that there was great
danger lurking in the kingdom of
Macedon and the wild surrounding
region, and he incessantly warned the
Athenian people of the threat of Philip.
According to Demosthenes, Philip “was
willing to sacrifice everything to gain
fame and glory.”
In his now famous oratories against
Philip of Macedon (called the Philippics),
Demosthenes spoke out with increasing
vehemence against the danger posed by
this military usurper from the north.
When a rumor spread in Athens that
Philip was seriously ill, Demosthenes
railed at his fellow citizens: “Did Philip
die? No, he is merely ill.And his illness is
of no account, because even if Philip
should die, your sluggishness would
cause another Philip to rise up.” In
spite of the fact that the advancing
Macedonian armies were uncomfortably
close to the borders of Attica, the Greek
city-states did not react.
Demosthenes’ opponent was the ora-
tor Aeschines, who was acting as the
spokesman for the pro-Macedonian
party in the assembly. This party was
in favor of a negotiated settlement
with Philip. However, although
Aeschines twice visited the
Macedonian court, he had
no success. In the end,
Demosthenes succeed-
ed in marginalizing
the pro-Macedonian
movement and then
pushed for an alliance
with Thebes. How-
ever,
the 
alliance
came too late, and
it was not strong
enough to stop Philip
and the Macedonian
army.
Chaeronea
On August 7, 338 BCE, Philip
of Macedon, with an army of
30,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 cavalry,
defeated the smaller army of the Greek
allies near Chaeronea on the plain of
Boeotia. This battle gave Macedonia
complete hegemony in Greece. Philip’s
young son Alexander played a key role in
the Macedonians’ victory. As Alexander
the Great, he would later change the
Greek world beyond all recognition.

MACEDON AND
ALEXANDER THE GREAT
A
lexander the Great was one of the greatest military leaders
that the world has ever known. Building on the great military
successes of his father, Philip II, Alexander created an empire that
covered the entire eastern Mediterranean world.
The young Macedonian king Alexander
crossed the Dardanelles in 334 BCE. He
was scarcely 22 years old, and his aim was
to conquer Persia and the whole of Asia.
By the time he succumbed to fever at age
33, he had succeeded in moving the
frontier of his empire 3,000 miles (4,800
km) east to the borders of India, subdu-
ing tens of millions of people along the
way. However, his empire was to be
short-lived—within a few years of his
death, his generals had divided the vast
territory among themselves.
Early life
Alexander was born in 356 BCE in Pella,
the capital of Macedonia. He was the son
of Macedonia’s king Philip II (ruled
359–336 BCE) and Olympias, a princess
of Epirus,whom Philip had met when he
was being initiated into the local religious
mysteries of the island of Samothrace.
When Alexander reached his teens,Philip
sent for the Athenian philosopher
Aristotle to teach his son rhetoric, philos-
ophy, literature, and science. Alexander
seems to have been an attentive student,
and he remained in touch with Aristotle
for the rest of his life.
According to the Greek biographer
Plutarch, Alexander inherited a love of
medicine from his tutor.The king would
prescribe treatment and medication to
his friends when they were ill. Plutarch
goes on to describe how Alexander was
an avid reader and would go to bed with
a copy of the Iliad, which he would place
next to his dagger under his headrest. On
his Asian campaign, he ordered his treas-
urer Harpalus to send him books.Among
the works that he received were
Philistus’s history of Sicily and the plays
of Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus.
Alexander was only 14 years old
when he got his first taste of power and
command. When his father went away
on campaign and left him in charge of
Macedon, Alexander successfully fought
off an attack by a tribe of Thracians.Two
years later, at the age of 16, he was given
a command at the Battle of Chaeronea,
where the Macedonians defeated the
Greek forces.
Ascent to the throne
Philip II was assassinated in the summer
of 336 BCE.The reason has never been
clearly established.The Persians may have
been behind it, or even Alexander him-
self, who was not on the best of terms
with his father.Whatever the truth of the
matter, Alexander ascended the throne
and had the alleged conspirators sum-
marily executed.
Before his assassination, Philip had
been preparing to invade Anatolia (pres-
ent-day Turkey) via the Dardanelles.
Alexander was anxious to continue this

cities, but before he could embark on the
campaign, he had to deal with troubles

only a week to subdue yet another rebel-
lion, this time by the Illyrians.

ANCIENT GREECE
Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, was
born around 382 BCE, the third son of King
Amyntas of Macedonia.When his brother
Perdiccas was killed in a battle against the
Illyrians in 359 BCE, Philip became king at
around the age of 23. Philip was a shrewd
diplomat and an inspired military commander
who was to transform his hitherto insignificant
kingdom into the most powerful Greek state.
At that time, Macedon was beset by enemies,
and one of Philip’s priorities on acceding to the
throne was to reorganize his army into a more
efficient fighting force. He introduced rigorous
new training and refined the phalanx formation.
Under Philip, the soldiers that made up the
phalanx were armed with metal-tipped pikes
around 16 feet (4.9 m) long. He also
incorporated equipment for siege warfare, such
as catapults and siege towers.
With his revitalized army, Philip embarked on a
20-year campaign of warfare and diplomacy that
was to make him master of the Greek world. In
357 BCE, he married Olympias, a princess of
Epirus, and a year later, she bore him a son
whom they named Alexander. In 338 BCE, having
subjugated all his non-Greek neighbors, Philip
invaded mainland Greece and defeated the
combined forces of Athens and Thebes at the
Battle of Chaeronea. Once Greece was his,
Philip planned to invade Anatolia and conquer
the Persian-held cities. However, before his
preparations were much advanced, Philip was
assassinated, leaving the throne of Macedon and
the conquest of Persia to his son,Alexander.
PHILIP OF MACEDON
This medallion bears a depiction of Philip II
of Macedonia, the father of Alexander the
Great. Philip greatly enlarged his kingdom
through a series of military campaigns in the
early years of his reign.
After he put down the Illyrian rebel-
lion, Alexander was forced to confront
yet another insurrection, one by the city
of Thebes, located on the plain of
Boeotia.The revolt, supported by a num-
ber of other Greek cities, was incited by
the orator Demosthenes and funded by
Persian gold.The rebels spread the rumor
that Alexander was dead and then
attacked the Macedonian garrison occu-
pying the citadel. Hearing this news,
Alexander moved his army rapidly
southward in forced marches. One
morning, the Thebans were alarmed to
see that the king they had presumed dead
was outside their walls.The Macedonians
took the city by storm,razing it and spar-

MACEDON AND ALEXANDER THE GREAT
M
uch of the deadly efficiency of Alexander’s
army depended on the phalanx, which had
been restyled by his father, Philip II of Macedon.
The phalanx was made up of around 9,000
infantrymen, often drawn up in 256-man squares,
16 men wide and 16 men deep.The weapon of
the phalanx was the sarissa, a long, heavy pike that
measured around 16 feet (4.9 m).These weapons
were held horizontally by the first few rows,
making a wall of sharp points that stretched 10
feet (3 m) or more ahead of the advancing
phalanx. Because the infantry of opposing armies
tended to be armed with spears no more than
8 feet (2.4 m) long, the Macedonian phalanx had
an immediate advantage.
An advancing phalanx presented a deadly wall of
metal spikes and was a formidable fighting force.
While the sarissas of the leading rows were
inflicting damage on their opponents, casualties
within the phalanx were immediately replaced by
men from the rear. However, a moving phalanx
was effective only on level ground and was
vulnerable on its flanks, which had to be protect-
ed by cavalry or light infantry such as slingers. For
this reason, the usual function of the phalanx was
defensive—while it stood its ground as the enemy
attacked, the cavalry could harass their adver-
saries on the flanks.
The phalanx was a flexible unit that could, if
necessary, assume different shapes—such as a
square, a rectangle, or even a wedge or arrow-
head shape. Because the sarissa required both
hands to hold it, each soldier wore his circular
shield on a neckstrap.When in battle, the shield
was brought around to the front of the body.
Each soldier also wore a helmet and greaves.
This artist’s illustration depicts a Macedonian
phalanx about to engage with the enemy.The front

ing only the temples and the house of
the famous Greek poet Pindar. Of the
surviving inhabitants, some 8,000 were
sold into slavery.The speed and severity
of this retaliation left such an impression
on the other rebellious Greek cities that
they surrendered almost immediately
and were treated with comparative
leniency by Alexander.
Into Asia
Leaving his general Antipater as regent of
Macedonia and Greece, Alexander was
free to embark on the long-delayed Asian
campaign. He set out with a formidable
army that comprised 30,000 foot soldiers
and some 5,000 horsemen.These cavalry
units were the core units of the force and
were composed mainly of Macedonians
and Thessalians. There were also many
Macedonians among the infantry, but at
least half of the footsoldiers were merce-
naries drawn from the rest of the Greek
world, from Thrace, and from regions
farther north.
Alexander was also surrounded by his
personal retinue, called the hetairoi, or
Companions. This hetairoi squadron of
1,500 men was mainly drawn from the
Macedonian aristocracy. They answered
directly to Alexander and, wherever he
was and whatever he did,his hetairoi were
always near.The king regarded the mem-
bers as his friends and allowed them lib-
erties not granted to others.
Alexander did not have much diffi-
culty in assembling his army. Since the
peace forged by him and his father in
Greece, there had been a much reduced
demand for mercenaries. Serving as a

mercenary was a popular occupation.
Although the soldier had to provide his
own equipment, military service provid-
ed pay and a share of any booty won.
Mercenaries were accustomed to serving
on the side that offered the greatest
reward. Many Greek soldiers had already
crossed the Aegean Sea to join Persian
troop contingents. In every one of his
battles against the Persians, Alexander
faced opposing Greek mercenaries.
Many of them defected to his army—not
through patriotism, but because they
expected higher earnings.
Alexander’s Companions, the army’s
elite horsemen, were highly skilled riders
and were armed with lances and short
swords.They trained intensively so their
horses would be manageable in battle.
Alexander almost invariably led the
charge of his Companion cavalry him-
self, and these attacks generally inflicted
great damage on the enemy.
The main foot soldiers were used in a
phalanx (see box, page 157), a formation
that had been in use long before the time
of Philip and Alexander. However, the
Macedonians adapted it by using far
longer spears than their predecessors. If
the formation became confused, all was
lost; it was impossible to restore the orig-
inal order in the heat of battle. Generally,
the phalanx was able to resist a frontal
attack by cavalry but not one from the
side. For this reason, the phalanx was
always placed at the center of the battle
formation, with the cavalry and more
mobile infantry at its flanks. Alexander
exploited the flexibility of this army to
great advantage, and it brought him vic-
tory after victory.
The Battle of Granicus River
In the spring of 334 BCE,Alexander led
his army of 35,000 Macedonians and
Greeks across the Dardanelles and into
Anatolia. At the Granicus River in
northwestern Anatolia, he attacked an
army of 40,000 Persians and Greeks.
Alexander won the battle and reputedly
lost only 110 soldiers of his own. The
road to Anatolia lay open.
The victory at Granicus River had a
serious effect on Persian morale. When

Alexander’s army approached the Persian
government center of Sardis, which had
long been able to withstand attack, the
governor walked out through the gate to
surrender. One by one, the Greek
colonies of Ionia fell to Macedonian
hands, and it took Alexander barely a
year to subdue the whole of Anatolia.
After the Persian king Xerxes died in
424 BCE, the kingdom of Persia had
gone into decline. Under a succession of
ineffective kings, the provincial gover-
nors had divided Persia into a large num-
ber of semi-independent principalities.
Artaxerxes, king of Persia from 358 to
338 BCE, had restored his authority in
the cities of Susa and Persepolis with
brutal force, so it is possible that many
Persians regarded Alexander’s arrival as 
a liberation.
The Gordian knot
On his route of conquest, Alexander
passed through Gordium (the capital of
Phrygia), which was home to an ancient
legend. According to Greek mythology,
Gordius, a Phrygian peasant, had been
made king because he fulfilled a prophe-
cy that said that the first person to enter
the town driving a wagon must be made
ruler. The grateful king dedicated his
wagon to Zeus, tying it with a complex
knot in a grove in the god’s temple.The
knot was so difficult that no one could
undo it—it was said that anyone who
could untie it would rule all of Asia.
When he was told this story, Alexander
unsheathed his sword and simply sliced
through the knot. This act gave rise to
the expression “cutting the Gordian
knot,” meaning to find a swift and imag-
inative solution to a difficult problem.
For this act, Alexander was rewarded
with enough booty to cover his cam-
paign expenses.
Carrying on south to Syria, the
Macedonians encountered a large
Persian army, commanded by King
Darius III himself. At the ensuing Battle
of Issus, the Persians outnumbered the

Macedonians by almost two to one, yet
the result was a catastrophic defeat for
the Persians. When Alexander and his
cavalry penetrated the Persian infantry,
Darius turned and fled, with much of his
army following. Alexander captured
Darius’s wife, mother, and children, who
had been left behind in the Persian
army’s camp.
However,
Alexander
ordered that they be treated with the
respect normally accorded to royalty. He
was already beginning to make efforts
to placate conquered peoples in
order to build a socially inte-
grated empire.
Phoenicia
After the Battle of
Issus, Alexander car-
ried on down the
coast of Syria and
Phoenicia. His object
was to capture all
of the ports of the
eastern 
Mediterra-
nean, thereby cutting
the Persians off from
their naval bases. Alex-
ander encountered little
resistance; only the well-
fortified Phoenician seaport of
Tyre put up a fight. Although its
rulers were willing to acknowledge
Alexander as king, they were not pre-
pared to let him and his army enter the
island on which the city lay.A prolonged
siege of seven months followed,but final-
ly, in 332 BCE,Alexander seized the city
and razed it in a bloodbath. Any surviv-
ing citizens, including all the women and
children, were sold into slavery.
After the fall of Tyre, Darius offered
all his lands up to the Euphrates River,
his daughter in marriage, and a large
dowry in exchange for peace with
Alexander. As a guarantee of his good
intentions, Darius offered to send his son
as a hostage. However,Alexander replied
that he already had whatever Darius
could offer and that he would marry his
daughter regardless of her father’s per-
mission. Alexander also said that he
would come to take what he considered
his, but not immediately.
Alexander continued down the
Mediterranean coast to the fortress at
Gaza,which also offered resistance.It took
a long siege before the city was taken, and
because Alexander was injured in the
course of the siege, he exacted a terrible
revenge. Jerusalem, however, surren-
dered without a single blow
being exchanged—the high
priest came out in full
regalia to welcome the
conqueror and his army.
Egypt
Later that same year,
332 BCE, Alexander
led his army across the
Sinai Peninsula and
into Egypt, where the
Persian governor sur-
rendered without a fight.
Alexander was welcomed
everywhere as a liberator,
and he was installed as the new
pharaoh.Alexander founded a new
city on the coast next to the mouth of
the Nile River. Named Alexandria, the
city was destined to become the commer-
cial and cultural center of the Greek world
(see box, page 162).
During the summer of 331 BCE,
Alexander made a pilgrimage to the ora-
cle of Amon-Re,the Egyptian god of the
sun, at the Siwa Oasis in the Libyan
desert. Around this time, Alexander had
begun to entertain the notion that he
was descended from the gods, and the
Egyptians, who had made him their
pharaoh, did not attempt to dissuade him
from the idea;all Egyptian pharaohs were
considered to be the sons of Amon-Re.
The oracle apparently confirmed his

162
ANCIENT GREECE
F
ounded by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE,
Alexandria was designed to be a model city
that would reflect the splendor of its founder. It
was probably originally conceived as a military
stronghold and naval base, but it rapidly became
the trading and administrative center of Egypt
under the Greeks. Situated on the Mediterranean
coast just west of the Nile Delta, it extended for
around 4 miles (6.5 km) along the coast and
around 1 to 2 miles (2–3 km) inland. Its streets
were laid out in a grid pattern, with two wide
main avenues where many of the most important
commercial and cultural buildings were found.At
its southern end, an isthmus projected into the
Mediterranean Sea and separated two great har-
bors. In 280 BCE, a lighthouse around 460 feet
(140 m) high was built at the mouth of one of the
harbors. It has since disappeared, but in its time,
the lighthouse was counted as one of the seven
wonders of the world.
After Alexander’s death in 323 BCE, the city came
under the control of the Egyptian Ptolemaic
dynasty and continued to flourish. Its two big
harbors made it an important center for
Mediterranean trade.Alexandria exported various
products manufactured by Alexandrian craftspeo-
ple, including linen, papyrus, and precious metal-
work. It was also an important transit port for
Egyptian grain and wares from India,Arabia, and
even more distant countries.These wares arrived
by way of the Red Sea and the caravan routes.
Within 100 years of its founding,Alexandria had
become the leading city of the world and the
center of Greek cultural life. Its great library
housed hundreds of thousands of books and
attracted many scholars and poets, including
Theocritus,Apollonius, and Callimachus.Another
great center of learning and research was the
Museum, next to the royal palace of the
Ptolemies.The Museum was both a temple of the
Muses and a research institute where scholars
and artists could devote themselves to learning at
the ruler’s expense.
Alexandria, shown in this undated modern illustration,
was perfectly situated for trade.

lineage,
and
because the Greeks iden-
tified Amon-Re with
Zeus, Alexander pro-
claimed himself to be a
son of Zeus.The Greeks
had no difficulty with
this concept, involving as
it did a young king with
military achievements so
remarkable as to appear
superhuman. Divine or
not, Alexander was a
great man, and most
Greeks and Egyptians
were happy to treat him
as a god.
The Battle of Gaugamela
Once he had secured the Mediterranean
coast (he had also captured Cyrene,
capital of the kingdom of Cyrenaica
on the north African coast), Alexander
turned his attention north and east.
In the late summer of 331 BCE, he
retraced his steps across the Sinai
Peninsula and then proceeded up
through Palestine to Babylon. He had
with him an army of 40,000 infantry and
7,000 cavalry, and after crossing the
Euphrates and Tigris rivers, Alexander
found Darius waiting for him with a far
larger army.
The two forces engaged near the
town of Gaugamela in northern
Mesopotamia on October 1, 331 BCE.
In spite of the disparity in numbers, and
the fact that the Persian army included
an Indian contingent with elephants, the
Macedonians were again victorious,
although they suffered heavy losses.
Once again, Darius fled from the battle-
field, taking refuge in the mountains to
the northeast.
Alexander turned south and entered
Babylon, which surrendered without a
fight. From there, he continued eastward
into Persia, conquering the royal city of
Susa (which held the treasury of the
Persian Empire), the capital Persepolis,
and Pasagardae. The splendid palace at
Persepolis, built by Darius I as a symbol
of the might and wealth of the Persian
Empire, was looted by the army and set
on fire by Alexander, possibly in a fit of
drunkenness. It burned to the ground.
Alexander was lord of all Persia—
Darius had essentially forfeited the
Alexander was of medium height, with fair hair and a
pale complexion. He grew up believing he would achieve
greatness (his mother encouraged him to believe he was
not actually Philip’s son but a son of the god Zeus), and
from an early age, he yearned to explore the world. He
excelled at all martial skills but was not keen on any
other sports apart from hunting. He became a heavy
drinker and was capable of ungovernable rages and
great cruelty. He had a lifelong passionate relationship
with Hephaestion, a young Macedonian aristocrat, and
when Hephaestion died of a fever in 324 BCE,
Alexander was prostrated with grief. He organized a
stunningly expensive royal funeral in Babylon for his
friend and built an extravagant monument to him.

throne. In the summer of 330 BCE,
Darius was murdered at the instigation of
a group of satraps (local governors). One
of them—Bessus—then proclaimed
himself king. Alexander branded the
satraps as regicides and usurpers, but
Bessus unleashed a popular war, forcing
the Macedonians and the Persians into
yet another conflict.Bessus was eventual-
ly betrayed, taken by Alexander, and exe-
cuted as a traitor.
Central Asia and India
In 329 BCE,Alexander set out on a new
campaign to complete his conquest of
the eastern Persian Empire, including the
provinces of western India. Over the fol-
lowing two years, he broke the last traces
of resistance in central Asia,extending his
realm to encompass Media and Parthia
(present-day Iran, Afghanistan,
and
Baluchistan) and Bactria and Sogdiana
(present-day Turkmenistan).
In 327 BCE, Alexander led his army
over the dangerous pass through the
Hindu Kush mountains to reach the
Indus Valley. There, in 326 BCE, he
encountered the Indian king Porus,
whose considerable army contained a
mighty contingent of elephants. The
Battle of Hydaspes was fought in torren-
tial monsoon rains, and Alexander was
once again victorious.He captured Porus
and made him the local governor under
Macedonian rule.
Despite their successes, Alexander’s
troops had begun to grow unhappy with
their lot. It was rumored that they still
had far to go, even that Alexander’s aim
was to conquer the whole world. In the
fall of 326 BCE, the troops mutinied and
refused to proceed any further.They had
been on campaign for eight years and
wanted to go home. Alexander was
forced to compromise;he could not con-
tinue without an army. He abandoned
the idea of conquering the rest of India.
Instead, he had a fleet built and sailed
down the Indus River
Alexander reached the mouth of the
river in 325 BCE. From there, the fleet
continued by sea to the Persian Gulf,
while Alexander and the army marched
west by land along the arid coastline.The
fleet was supposed to sail parallel to the
army’s line of travel, to keep it supplied
with food and water, but because the
ships were unable to sail close to land
against the prevailing winds, the army
was forced to forage for supplies.Because

the army needed a daily supply of
190,000 gallons (720,000 l) of water 
and 250 tons (225 tonnes)
of cereals to survive,
many troops perished.
Alexander lost more
men on this march than
in he did in all his battles
combined.
Uniting the empire
In 324 BCE, Alexander re-
turned to Susa to attend to
affairs of state. In an effort to
reconcile the conquered and the
conquerors, he organized a funeral
for Darius (the last of the
Achaemenids) so that he was
buried with his forefathers with
due ceremony. Alexander adopted
Persian customs, wearing the vest-
ments and insignia of the “king of
kings” on all ceremonial occasions.
He arranged a mass marriage
ceremony of Macedonian men
with Persian wives, at which
he himself married Barsine,
the daughter of Darius.
He also appointed Persians
to important offices and
drafted thousands of young
Persians into his army.
These actions showed that Alexander
intended to create a mixed Macedonian-
Persian elite that would hold his empire
together, but they resulted in consider-
able tension between Alexander and his
Macedonian entourage, particularly his
hetairoi. When the new Persian troops
were called up at the same time that
Macedonian veterans were dismissed, the
veterans mutinied. However, Alexander
still had enough influence to effect a
reconciliation with the rebels. At a cele-
bratory banquet for the entire army,
he openly prayed to the gods for “unity
and equally shared rule”
between
Macedonians and Persians.
Final days
In the spring of 323 BCE, Alexander
transferred to Babylon, where he took
up his quarters in the palace of
Nebuchadnezzar. Soon after his arrival,
Alexander came down with a fever, an
illness that was probably aggravated by
heavy drinking. He died ten days later,
on June 10. He was 33 years old.
Alexander bequeathed his empire “to the
strongest,” thereby setting off a power
struggle that was to last for 50 years.

AFTER 
ALEXANDER
A
fter the death of Alexander in 323 BCE, several empires rose
to prominence.The Ptolemaic dynasty took control of Egypt,
the Antigonids rose to power in Macedonia, and the Seleucids took
over the area that had formerly belonged to the Persians.
When Alexander the Great died at age
33 in 323 BCE, he left behind a power
vacuum.The ensuing struggle among his
generals was to result in the eventual
breakup of his mighty empire into three
main kingdoms.
The age of the diadochs
Alexander’s first wife, Roxana, did not
give birth to their son, also called
Alexander, until four weeks after the
king’s death.The only other person with
any claim to the throne was the 35-year-
old Aridaeus,an illegitimate son of Philip
II, who was rumored to suffer from both
physical and mental illness. Nevertheless,
both the newborn Alexander and his
uncle Aridaeus were immediately invest-
ed with imperial titles—Alexander IV
and Philip III. Since neither of them was
in a position to exercise power,it fell into
the hands of the imperial regent,
Perdiccas, who divided the empire
among the commanders of Alexander’s
army. These commanders are known as
the diadochoi (successors), or diadochs.
For a time, while each diadoch
attempted to secure for himself as much
land and wealth as possible, a precarious
unity was preserved in the empire, but
the diadochs soon fell into open conflict.
Years of war ensued, many of them
marked by the formation of fresh coali-
tions. In 317 BCE, Aridaeus was mur-
dered. After the 13-year-old Alexander
met a similar fate in 310 BCE, there was
no longer any lawful successor to stand
in the way of the diadochs’ ambitions.
Ptolemy and Egypt
One of the kingdoms that was to emerge
from the breakup of Alexander’s empire
was a new, Greek-influenced Egypt,
ruled by the diadoch Ptolemy (c.
367–283 BCE). Ptolemy came from an
aristocratic Macedonian family and had
grown up in the court of Philip II,
becoming a friend of the king’s young
son,
Alexander.
When 
Alexander
embarked on his Asian campaign,
Ptolemy accompanied him as a general
in his army. Ptolemy was later appointed
satrap (governor) of Egypt.
After Alexander’s death, Ptolemy was
confirmed as diadoch in charge of Egypt
and Libya, and he used the position as a
power base. For almost 20 years, he bat-
tled the other diadochs, consolidating
and expanding his realm. He successfully
fended off invasions of Egypt and the
island of Rhodes and annexed Cyprus,
Palestine, and Cyrenaica. In 305 BCE, he
proclaimed himself king of Egypt, taking
the title Ptolemy I.

Taking up residence in his capital city,
Alexandria, Ptolemy set about expanding
the might and wealth of his kingdom.He
improved the administrative system and
established a system of land registration
to simplify the collection of taxes. He
also expanded Alexandria itself, making
it the largest Greek settlement in the
known world.
Ptolemy succeeded in having his
friend Alexander’s body brought to
Egypt. Although it was known that
Alexander would have preferred the
Siwa Oasis as his final resting place, the
funeral took place in Alexandria. The
body was placed in a golden coffin and
given divine honors.
In 285 BCE, Ptolemy abdicated in
favor of his son, Ptolemy II. It was
Ptolemy II who was to make Alexandria
an unparalleled center of learning and
culture. The new king built a famous
library and museum that attracted and
supported Greek scholars and artists from
all over the Greek world.
Ptolemy I died around 283 BCE,
having established a dynasty that was to
rule Egypt until the arrival of the
Romans in 32 BCE.
Antigonus and son
Antigonus was another important
general in Alexander’s army. He
was nicknamed Monophthalmos
(One-Eye), the result of his hav-
ing lost an eye in battle.Antigonus
was already an old man—almost 
60 years old—at the time of
Alexander’s death. For the previous
10 years, he had been governor of the
recently conquered Phrygia, ruling the
territory while the king went on to
other conquests.
In 321 BCE, having been made
commander in chief in Asia, Antigonus
joined forces with his son Demetrius
Poliorcetes (Taker of Cities),so-called for
his skill in laying sieges. Together they
hoped to preserve the unity of the
empire, but they almost immediately
found themselves in conflict with the
other diadochs. Initially, they were very
successful in battle, and in 306 BCE, they
proclaimed themselves joint kings as
Alexander’s successors, ruling a huge
region centered around western Asia
Five years later,
in 301 BCE,
Antigonus and Demetrius were forced to
defend their territory against a coalition
of the other diadochs (now also calling
themselves kings) at the Battle of Ipsus.
Antigonus, now 80, was killed, but
Demetrius escaped to Greece.There, he
succeeded in conquering Macedonia and
much of mainland Greece, but in 286
BCE, while on a campaign in Anatolia,
he was captured and imprisoned by the

AFTER ALEXANDER
Demetrius’s son, Antigonus Gonatas,
regained possession of the Macedonian
throne around 272 BCE, and his descen-
dants—the Antigonids—remained in
power until the Romans put an end to
their dynasty.
The Seleucids
The Seleucid Empire was the largest of
the kingdoms that resulted from the divi-
sion of Alexander’s domains. It was
founded by Seleucus, one of the
diadochs who rose to power after
Alexander’s death. Born around 358
BCE, Seleucus was, like Ptolemy, the son
of a Macedonian aristocrat. He was
roughly the same age as Alexander and
probably his friend. He accompanied the
young king on his Persian campaign and,
after Alexander’s death, was appointed
governor of Babylon.
Having secured Babylon and the
regions farther east, Seleucus gradually
expanded his influence to the west. In
Syria, he built himself a new capital city,
Antioch, which was to become the most
important metropolis in Asia. In 281
BCE,
Seleucus met the diadoch
Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium
near Sardis and defeated him, thereby
securing Anatolia for himself. Because
Lysimachus (who was killed in the fight-
ing) had been the king of Macedonia,
Seleucus tried to secure that territory.
However, before he could achieve this
aim, he was assassinated.

ANCIENT GREECE
Pompey’s Pillar, built
in the third century
CE, is one of the
most famous
monuments in
Alexandria.
Alexandria was 
the capital of 
Egypt during the
Ptolemaic period.
The most famous opponent of the
Seleucids is probably the Jewish
guerrilla fighter Judas Maccabaeus.
Palestine was seized from the
Ptolemies by the Seleucid king
Antiochus III in 198 BCE. In 168
BCE,Antiochus IV outlawed Judaism,
ordering the worship of Greek gods
and persecuting anyone who
remained true to the Jewish religion
and culture.
Mattathias, patriarch of the priestly
Hasmonaean family, objected to this
edict and killed both a government
official and a Jew who had complied
with the order. In 167 BCE,
Mattathias fled to the mountains
with a loyal band of Jews, initiating a
lengthy revolt against the Seleucids.
After he died, his son Judas
Maccabaeus (The Hammer) took
command of the rebellion, defeating
much larger Syrian armies in 166
and 165 BCE and capturing
Jerusalem. He restored Jewish rites
to the temple in Jerusalem in
December 165 BCE, an event that
is commemorated by the Jewish
festival of Hanukkah. For the next
80 years, the Jews in Syria were
virtually an independent nation.

In the decades
following Alexander
the Great’s death,
Seleucus gained
control of much of
the eastern part of
Alexander’s empire.
171
AFTER ALEXANDER
Seleucus had carved out an enor-
mous empire, one that almost rivaled
Alexander’s in size. He was succeeded by
his son, Antiochus I. The Seleucid
dynasty was to survive for more than two
hundred years.
The people who lived within the
boundaries of the Seleucid Empire spoke
many languages and adhered to many
different ways of life. The empire never
became truly integrated, and under
Seleucus’s successors, it gradually crum-
bled away. In central Asia, Bactria made
itself virtually independent, while in
northern Persia, the warlike Parthians
roamed at will, ultimately conquering
many of the eastern provinces. Other
usurpers set up their own kingdoms in
imperial territory. One such state was
Pergamum, on the Aegean coast, which
rebelled against Seleucid rule to become
the leading city of Anatolia and an
important hub of Greek culture.
Antipater and the Lamian War
Antipater (c. 397–319 BCE) was a trust-
ed friend of Philip II and Alexander the
Great.When Alexander embarked on his
Persian campaign, Antipater was left
behind to act as his regent in Macedonia
and Greece. As soon as news of
Alexander’s death reached Greece in 323
BCE, Athens and several other states
rebelled.The insurrection was spurred on
by the oratory of Demosthenes, who had
long led Athenian opposition to
Macedonia. Antipater acted promptly to
put down the revolt.
The conflict between Antipater and
the Greek states was called the Lamian
War.The Athenians were backed by the
Aetolian League, an alliance based in the
mountainous region of Aetolia. At first,
the rebels were successful, but Antipater
eventually crushed them at the Battle of
Crannon in 322 BCE.
Antipater demanded that the Athenians
hand over the rebel leaders, including
Demosthenes, and the Athenian assem-
bly condemned the rebels to death.
Demosthenes managed to escape to the
island of Calauria, where he took poison
rather than surrender.
Antipater’s next battle was with his
own countryman, the Macedonian gen-
eral Partakes, who challenged his author-
ity. Antipater won this struggle easily—
Partakes was killed in 321 BCE.Antipater
was then confirmed as supreme regent of
Macedonia and charged with the care of
Alexander’s children. On Antipater’s
death in 319 BCE, the regency passed to
Polypechon, but he was swiftly replaced
by Antipater’s son Cassander, who seized
control. Continued infighting between
the diadochs led eventually to Antigonus

Gonatas becoming the king of
Macedon in 272 BCE. He
established a dynasty that
was to last for more than a
hundred years.
By the early third
century BCE, there-
fore, Alexander’s en-
tire empire had been
broadly divided into
three much smaller
empires. Macedonia
was ruled by the
Antigonid dynasty,
solidly established in
their homeland. Outside
Macedonia, their position
was less strong, but their
sphere of influence extended
from present-day Bulgaria to the
Peloponnese. Egypt was ruled by the
Ptolemies, who gradually relinquished
their possessions beyond its borders.The
Seleucid dynasty held the region that had
originally stretched from the Aegean Sea
in the west to the Indus River in the east.
However, over the years, the eastern
boundary was gradually eroded and
receded westward.Although the diadoch
dynasties lived in continual conflict,
no one empire was able to achieve
dominance. The division of power
remained unsettled until the advent of
the Rome Empire.
Hellenism
The campaigns of Alexander the Great
had far-reaching consequences that were
not only political but also social and cul-
tural. In his epic progress of conquest
across Asia, he had established many new
cities and populated them with Greek
veterans from his army. Those cities
became oases of Greek language and cul-
ture in the middle of an Oriental culture,
which gave rise to the concept of
Hellenism, a term used to describe the
unprecedented spread of Greek culture
in the east in the period
between the death of
Alexander and the
beginning of the
Christian era.
Alexander 
had
founded cities as far
away as Uzbekistan
and Kashmir, leaving
the new cities as
small, isolated islands
of Greek civilization in
an enormous sea of local
culture. However, the new
Greek cities were not modeled
on the old idea of a city-state ruled by
its citizens.That concept had no place in
Alexander’s empire; these cities were
ruled by a distant king. Greek was gener-
ally used as the common language in
large parts of the Hellenistic empires,
without wholly replacing Aramaic,
which had played a similar role in the
Persian Empire. In spite of this unity of
language, Greek culture had little effect
on the indigenous population. In most
cases, the Greeks and the native inhabi-
tants existed side by side,with little inter-
action between them.
Although the old Greek gods were
worshipped in the new Greek cities, they
faced fierce competition from the non-
Greek gods that surrounded them. Many
of these other gods were messianic (sav-
iors or deliverers) with cults of an ecstat-
ic nature. Similar Greek cults, especially
Dionysiac cults, also flourished at this
time. The cult of the ruler derived
strength from the popularity of the mes-
sianic gods: often, he too was regarded as
a savior or messiah.
The Greeks did not automatically
adopt foreign gods—the gods first had to
be adapted to Greek tastes, which was

zenship rights, and most of them were
living below subsistence level. All the
wealth was in the hands of a select few.
In the last half of the third century
BCE, when the situation was ripe for
revolution, a reforming leader emerged:
Cleomenes.
Cleomenes III became one of the
two kings of Sparta in 235 BCE. He was
determined to introduce new policies to
redress the inequalities in Spartan socie-
ty. After ridding himself of his political
enemies, he took the radical course of
canceling all debts and dividing the land
into equal parcels, which he distributed
among the citizens.At the same time, he
granted full citizenship to several thou-
sand of the perioikoi (original inhabi-
tants). The revolutionary ideas of
Cleomenes spread, and in many Greek
states, a cry arose for debts to be canceled
and land to be redistributed.
Cleomenes also attempted to restore
Sparta’s military prestige by going to war
with the Achaean League, an alliance of
city-states under the leadership of Aratus
of Sicyon. Aratus was deeply opposed to
the revolutionary ideas fanned by
Cleomenes, and in order to ensure his
success in battle against the Spartans, he
called on the help of Macedon.
Cleomenes was defeated, and his reforms
were dismantled. The king fled to
Alexandria, where he died in 219 BCE.
Roughly 20 years later, the radical
ideas of Cleomenes resurfaced during
the brutal reign of the Spartan tyrant
Nabis (ruled 207-192 BCE). Nabis rein-
troduced Cleomenes’ system, even going
so far as to free the slaves, but his rule
came to an end when he was betrayed by
his allies during a war against Rome. His
death marked the end of Sparta’s days as
a major power.

THE GREEK 
LEGACY
T
he ancient Greeks made profound and far-reaching
contributions to the worlds of literature, science, and
philosophy.Their discoveries and achievements became the
building blocks for generations of later scholars and artists.
Many of the cultural achievements asso-
ciated with ancient Greece took place
not in Greece itself but in the Greek out-
post of Alexandria in Egypt.The city was
founded by Alexander the Great in 332
BCE. When he left Egypt to go on a
campaign,Alexander left one of his gen-
erals, Ptolemy, in charge of the province.
On Alexander’s death in 323 BCE,
Ptolemy effectively became the ruler of
Egypt. He crowned himself king of the
country in 305 BCE.
From the very beginning of his reign,
Ptolemy encouraged Greek scholars and
philosophers to congregate at his court
in Alexandria. When Demetrius of
Phaleron was banished from Athens, he
took refuge in Alexandria and suggested
that Ptolemy should establish a center of
study dedicated to the Muses (see box,
page 182).The center would allow schol-
ars to pursue their studies in all the arts
and sciences. Ptolemy happily agreed to
the idea.
The first museum
The Temple of the Muses was expanded
to make it a true academy of literature
and the sciences. The Greeks knew the
temple as the Mouseion, although it is
now known as the Museum—the origin
of the word used today.Those who were
appointed to work there became well-
paid servants of the state and lived in the
building. They were overseen by the
director and chief priest.
Under Ptolemy’s son, Ptolemy II
(ruled 285–246 BCE), Alexandria be-
came renowned as a center of arts and a
magnet for scholars and poets, whom
Ptolemy welcomed to his court. He
increased his financial support for the
Museum, which became a research cen-
ter for the natural sciences and mathe-
matics as well as an academy for more lit-
erary pursuits.
Most of the writers working at the
Museum did not produce original work.
Instead, they focused on collecting and
preserving the literary works of the past.
The versions of Homer’s epic poems the
Iliad and the Odyssey that exist today
are essentially the work of Alexandrian
scholars. The Museum’s archivists col-
lected manuscripts of literary texts attrib-
uted to Homer and then compiled them
to produce new editions. Copies of these
texts were widely sold and greatly prized
for their authenticity.
The scholars also did invaluable work
in the area of textual criticism, a
discipline that had its beginnings in
Alexandria.After scrutinizing all available
manuscripts of a text, the scholars would

publish their own version of an ancient
work, together with annotation. Crucial
to this process of textual criticism were
the resources provided by the great
Library of Alexandria, which contained
many thousands of handwritten scrolls—
a unique collection during that period
of history.
Theocritus
The Museum also supported original
writers producing new works. One of
these poets was the Greek Theocritus
(born c. 300 BCE), who became famous
in the third century BCE for his sophis-
ticated verses that extolled the pleasures
of an idealized pastoral life.The Arcadian
landscape depicted by Theocritus was
filled with amorous shepherds and shep-
herdesses who frolicked to the sound of
melodious music.This view of the coun-
tryside was in complete contrast to the
archaic tradition of Arcadia, in which the
countryside was rugged and inhabited by
fearsome mythological beasts. This new
view of Arcadia found favor with the
citizens of Alexandria who, oppressed by
the stench, noise, and crowds of city life,
began to idealize life in the countryside.
It is a view of Arcadia that was to be
handed down from Theocritus to the
Roman poet Virgil, and from him to the

poets of the Renaissance period, includ-
ing William Shakespeare.
Theocritus also wrote comedies, one
of the very few genres in which the
Hellenistic writers were noted for their
originality.The ancient comedy of Attica
had been a kind of satirical revue, often
politically based, and covered contempo-
rary issues. The comedies of the
Alexandrian poets, on the other hand,
had tightly structured plots that owed
nothing to the current political scene.
Instead, they told stories of real life, albeit
with highly stereotypical characters.
One famous contemporary of these
Alexandrian comic writers was the play-
wright Menander (c. 341–291 BCE). He
was very popular in Egypt, and several of
his plays have been discovered there on
papyrus scrolls. Many attempts were
made to persuade him to join the
Museum in Alexandria, but Menander
preferred to stay in his native Athens.
The pure sciences
Study of the sciences also came into their
own at Ptolemy’s academy. The Library
of Alexandria was filled with the output
of the Museum’s scientists as well as its
writers. One of the foremost mathemati-
cians in Alexandria around 300 BCE was
Euclid, who produced a major work—
the Elements, which was a compilation of
all mathematical knowledge that existed
at the time.The work was assembled in
13 books and had a particular emphasis
on geometry.This synthesis of everything
that had gone before was a typical prod-
uct of Hellenistic science. Euclid’s book
was an essential basis for all later mathe-
matical studies. The sections on plane
geometry were turned into a school
textbook that was used as late as the end
of the 19th century CE.
The discoveries of the Greek mathe-
maticians were not always original—
many had already been made by the
Egyptians or Babylonians. What the
Greeks did realize,however,was that the-
orems could be linked, and that geome-
try was an integrated system that could
be studied through the use of logic.
Mathematics was put to little practi-
cal use. Only those with something to
construct, such as temple architects,
knew how to use mathematics to help
them in their work. One reason that
applied mathematics was ignored was
that technology was still in its infancy,
and there was little incentive to develop
it. Since the sheer brute strength of ani-
mals and slaves was enough to construct
buildings and turn mill wheels, society

could keep going without it. Another
factor that worked against the develop-
ment of technology was the dismissive
attitude usually displayed by the Greek
elite toward practical matters. It was felt
that anything to do with manual
labor—and that included tech-
nology—was not worthy of
the attention of the learned.
One invention in par-
ticular could have had a
huge effect on the course of
history if its implications
had been recognized. The
scientist Hero of Alexandria
discovered the principle of
the steam turbine in the
first century CE and used it
to construct an amusing 
little steam toy to entertain
his friends. The principle
was never put to further
use, however.
Archimedes
One ancient Greek citizen who
did not ignore the opportunities
offered by putting the sciences to practi-
cal use was the mathematician and
inventor Archimedes (c. 287–212 BCE).
Archimedes studied at the Museum in
Alexandria before returning to his native
Syracuse. He made a particular study of
the characteristics of force. It was already
known that heavy loads were easier to lift
with the help of pulleys and levers, but
Archimedes discovered that even the
heaviest weight could be lifted easily by
using a long lever that moved around a
fixed point, or fulcrum.
Archimedes applied this knowledge
to many applications, including military
catapults. He is also said to have single-
handedly launched a massive ship with
the help of levers and pulleys. Legend has
it that he once boasted:“Give me a solid
place to stand in space, and I will move
the Earth.”
Eureka!
Another famous
myth tells the story of
one of Archimedes’ most
famous discoveries, that of specif-
ic gravity.The king of Syracuse had asked
him to find out whether a supposedly
golden crown was in fact pure gold. As
water slopped out of the overfull bath
when Archimedes got in, it came to him
that the amount of water displaced by
objects of different volumes would also
be different. For this reason, the amount
of water displaced by the crown (if it was
adulterated) would be different from the
amount of water displaced by a lump of
pure gold that weighed the same as the
crown. Archimedes is reputed to have
jumped out of the bath and run down
the street naked crying “Eureka!” (“I
have found it!”).

in the first century

practical steam
engine was not
invented until 1,600
years later.
Astronomy
Rather than thinking that the stars were
controlled by the gods, as earlier civiliza-
tions had believed, the Greeks adopted a
scientific approach to astronomical study.
They employed mathematics, particular-
ly geometry, to help explain the move-
ments of the heavenly bodies. The
Greeks were pioneers in making careful
observations of the heavens, and they
noted that the stars remained in approx-
imately the same place in relation to each
other throughout the year, while the
moon and five other bodies (Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) seemed
to move around the sky. The Greeks
called these heavenly bodies planates,after
the Greek word meaning “wanderer.”
In order to explain the movement of
the planets, Greek astronomers put for-
ward the theory that the cosmos was
divided into concentric spheres, each
one the path of a planet. They usually
assumed Earth to be at the center of
these spheres (a geocentric view of the
universe), which was an error that made
the calculations very complicated. One
astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos (flour-
ished c. 275 BCE), suggested that every-
thing would be easier to explain if it was
assumed that the sun was the central
point of the universe, but his ideas were
too revolutionary for their time; they
were dismissed in favor of the more pop-
ular geocentric model.
The geocentric view of the universe
was refined in the second century CE by
Claudius Ptolemaeus (also known as
Ptolemy of Alexandria), who lived from
90 to 168 CE. He used geometric calcu-
lations to show that the sun, the moon,
and the planets moved in small circular
orbits (which he called epicycles) around
larger circles, like rings strung on a
bracelet. To support his contention that
Earth was at the center of these circles,
he provided mathematical calculations
that were accepted by other astronomers
up to the 16th century CE.The calcula-
tions were then rejected by Polish

astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who
postulated a heliocentric (sun-centered)
view of the cosmos that retained
Ptolemy’s system of epicycles.
Ptolemy also contributed to several
other fields of knowledge. He added to
the understanding of trigonometry, using
this knowledge to make astrolabes
(instruments used for measuring the alti-
tude of the stars) and sundials. In his
great work Geography, he drew maps of
the known world that incorporated lines
of latitude and longitude. In spite of
being based on incomplete data, these
maps were used for centuries. He built a
device to study light and presented a
mathematical theory of its properties in
his treatise Optics. In Harmonica, he
offered an outline of music theory, while
in Tetrabiblos, he used his knowledge of
astronomy and astrology to make predic-
tions about the future.
Another Greek mathematician who
contributed a great deal to the knowl-
edge of astronomy was Eratosthenes of
Cyrene, who was director of the Library
of Alexandria from around 240 to 196
BCE. After distinguishing himself by
cataloging 675 stars, Eratosthenes set
about trying to calculate the circumfer-
ence of Earth. He discovered that at the
summer solstice a stick placed vertically
in the ground in Syene (now Aswan) in
Egypt would cast no shadow at noon,
while a similar stick in Alexandria would
cast a shadow one-fifth of its length.
Using this data, Eratosthenes calculated
the Earth’s circumference, with only 3.5
percent error.
Medical science
Great advances were made in medical
science in Alexandria in the fourth cen-
tury BCE. They were based on the
rational approach to medicine pioneered
by Hippocrates of Kos (c. 460–377
BCE), who is called the father of medi-
cine. Previously, the practice of medicine
had been bound up with religion and
magic. However, Hippocrates believed
that disease had natural causes. He con-
sidered medicine to be an art that people
could learn, diagnosing disease through
an examination of the patient.
Hippocrates was born on the Greek
island of Kos, where he eventually estab-
lished a school of medicine. His method
of clinical observation was to influence

all succeeding generations of doctors,
while his Regimen in Acute Diseases intro-
duced the concept of preventive medi-
cine through healthy diet and lifestyle.
Hippocrates also suggested that the
weather and drinking water can have an
effect on public health.
The 70 works generally known as the
Hippocratic Collection may not have
been written by Hippocrates himself, but
they originated from his school of med-
icine. Similarly, he probably was not the
author of the Hippocratic Oath—the
oath to act ethically that is taken by all
doctors today on graduation.
Herophilus, the personal physician to
Ptolemy I in the fourth century BCE, is
considered the father of the study of
human anatomy. Born in Chalcedon in
Anatolia around 335 BCE, he spent most
of his life in Alexandria. By dissecting
dead bodies, he discovered that the brain
is the center of the nervous system. He
also identified the separate functions of
the motor and sensory nerves. He stud-
ied the liver, genitalia, eyes, pancreas, and
salivary glands and pioneered research
on the blood vessels, learning that they
carried blood and not air, as even
Hippocrates had believed. Erasistratus
(born c. 275 BCE) also carried out many
dissections at his school of anatomy in
Alexandria and identified the pumping
function of the heart,even though he did
not understand the concept of the circu-
lation of the blood.
Philosophy
In addition to advances in literature, the
sciences, and medicine, the fourth and
third centuries BCE saw the develop-
ment of several new philosophical move-
ments, including Skepticism, Stoicism,
and Epicureanism.
By the fourth century BCE, a num-
ber of Greek philosophical schools of
thought had been established, including
that of Sophism. Traveling teachers of
philosophy, politics, and rhetoric, the
Sophists thought it was more important
to be able to argue on either side of a
question than to be morally right.

Plato (428–348 BCE) and his student
Aristotle (384–322 BCE) objected to the
Sophists’ view that truth and morality
were matters of opinion and countered
that view with the concept of idealism.
Plato maintained that the object of
knowledge (the “idea”) was fixed, per-
manent, and unchangeable. He consid-
ered that only this “idea” was real and
rejected the view that knowledge was
based on the experience of the senses.
The Skeptics countered by saying
that all knowledge is questionable and
that inquiry itself is a process of doubt-
ing. A philosophical school based on
these ideas was founded by Pyrrhon of
Elis (c.363– 272 BCE).The essence of its
philosophy was the impossibility of
obtaining certain knowledge. Pyrrhon
assumed that mankind primarily strives
for happiness, and this is the sole reason
for the practice of philosophy. He said
that no human could ever know the real
nature of things; therefore, the wise per-
son would suspend judgment. Pyrrhon
never took sides, believing solely in the
value of observation—skepsis in Greek.
His followers were called Skeptics, and
their questioning of everything, based on
the example of the questions and answers
of Socrates, gave rise to the modern con-
notation of the word skeptic.
Epicureanism
Epicureanism was founded by the Greek
philosopher Epicurus (341–270 BCE),
who was born on the island of Samos.
When he was 18, he had to go to Athens
to do his military service.When his serv-
ice was completed, he traveled for 10
years, studying and developing his own
philosophical ideas.Around 311 BCE, he
established a school of philosophy at
Mytilene on the island of Lesbos. Later,
in 306 BCE, he settled in Athens, where
he bought a house with a garden. He set
up a school in the garden, and many of
his followers from his travels in Anatolia
flocked there.
Epicurus’s philosophy was based on a
system of ethics and the belief that good
and evil were to be perceived through
the senses. To achieve a happy life, one
should seek pleasure and avoid pain.
However, he also taught that a simple life
was best, because any attempt to satisfy
all desires would itself bring pain. So,
although the goal of life was pleasure
(and intellectual pleasure was to be pre-
ferred to sensual pleasure), moderation
was the path to true happiness. He
described justice, honesty, and friendship
as virtues, while politics was to be avoid-
ed because it produced only misery.
Epicurus subscribed to the atomic
theory refined by Democritus in the fifth
century BCE. According to this theory,
everything 
is 
composed 
of 
tiny
unchangeable atoms, which join togeth-
er to form material objects. Epicurus
maintained that the soul and the body

ANCIENT GREECE
In Greek mythology, the Muses were nine goddesses
thought to inspire artists of all kinds, including 
philosophers, poets, and musicians.The Muses were all
born of a union between Zeus, king of the gods, and
Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory. Each Muse
presided over a different art or science. Poetry was so
important that it had four separate Muses: Polyhymnia
for sacred poetry, Calliope for epic poetry, Erato for
love poetry, and Euterpe for lyric poetry.Terpsichore
was the Muse in charge of choral singing and dance,
while Thalia was the Muse for comedy, and Melpomene
was the Muse of tragedy. Clio presided over history, and
Urania presided over astronomy.
The companions to the Muses were Apollo, the god of
music, and the Graces, who were the three goddesses
of beauty, joy, and charm.The Graces were also 
daughters of Zeus, but by the nymph Eurynome.Thalia
was associated with good cheer,Aglaia with splendor,
and Euphrosyne with mirth.

are composed of material atoms, and
when the body dies, the soul is also
dissipated and no longer exists.
Consequently, there can be no
afterlife, and there is nothing to
fear from death.
Epicurus did not deny the
existence of the gods, but he
considered them irrelevant to
human affairs. He viewed them as
existing in empty space outside the
cosmos and believed that they were
too caught up in their own affairs to
be interested in the material world
of mortals. To fear or venerate
them was as pointless as
fearing life after death.
Followers of Epicurus
lived a comparatively aus-
tere life in his school.
They consumed little
other than bread and
water and enjoyed few
pleasures beyond those of
friendship and intellec-
tual pursuits. This mod-
est lifestyle, withdrawn
from the world, is in
direct contrast to the
modern understanding of the word
epicurean, which has come to mean the
pursuit of pleasure; an epicure is some-
one who indulges freely in the pleasures
of food and wine.
Stoicism
Around 308 BCE, the philosopher Zeno
of Cyprus began giving public lectures in
Athens under the painted colonnade
next to the agora. The colonnade was
known as the Stoa Poikile in Greek,
which gave the name Stoicism to his
teachings. Zeno had studied with the
Cynics, at Plato’s Academy, and at
Aristotle’s Lyceum, but he developed his
own view of life and the universe.
The Stoics believed that everything
in the universe, including mankind, was
linked by a divine force (Logos), which
they also called reason. Zeno consid-
ered that by living in conformity
with nature, mankind would live
in conformity with the Logos,and
this was the only way to attain
happiness. By calmly accepting
everything that life deals out,
mankind can be freed from pas-
sion, grief, and joy.
Zeno believed that information
received through the senses is based
on correct perceptions. If mistakes
are made,they are due to inaccurate
observation or faulty processing
of the information. The
person who uses his reason
to digest information will
come to a correct con-
ception of things. Once 
one has a correct con-
ception of virtue, one
can then gain virtue.
Equality for all
The Stoics believed that
because all mankind is
animated by the Logos,
all men and women, rich
or poor, free or slave, should be treated as
equals. This was a revolutionary idea in
the third century BCE.
The Stoics considered possessions
and wealth unimportant in human rela-
tionships and believed that people had a
responsibility to help one another. For
this reason, they encouraged people to
enter public life because it allowed them
to improve the lot of their fellow citi-
zens. Stoicism, as first taught by Zeno
and later refined by his follower
Cleanthes and his successor Chrysippus,
was destined to become a major influ-
ence in the Roman world.
