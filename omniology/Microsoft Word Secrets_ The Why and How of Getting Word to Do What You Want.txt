Introduction
As soon as I published my first Apress book, Programming Excel with VBA, my very 
talented editor, Gwenan Spearing, asked me “What’s next?” I then proposed writing a 
book about Microsoft Word because in my opinion it is probably the most used software 
in the world, while it is also probably the least understood. She promptly asked me 
to prepare a Table of Contents about how the book would approach the topic with a 
different concept than that used in other books on the market.
My first approach was to write a small, concise book, of 200 pages at most, to teach 
Microsoft Word basics, using a very fast and direct approach. As you can see, I failed at 
that. The book became bigger than expectations. But I think it is much better also. Some 
issues deserved more attention and some options needed to be clarified while others 
needed a step-by-step approach.
Since Microsoft Word is indeed an advanced typographic tool, I made the decision to 
teach it by covering the typography component. And I added chapter exercises.
It was a pleasure to produce this book for you, reader. So here is the result, and I truly 
hope that you like it—or even better, that you learn from it.
Although it offers extreme simplicity in its usage, Word also has deep typographical 
knowledge and rules, so anyone can play Gutenberg in their own way. While Word is 
easy to use, it is often misunderstood because it is so rich in typographic tools.
And it is due to being so ambitious in its intentions—to be a typographic tool as easy 
to use as it is powerful in its effects—Word sometimes becomes misunderstood. Who 
never gets mad about a Word document that
•	
Refuses to obey the formatting options that need to be applied?
•	
Seems not able to format text into a table?
•	
Cannot hold the position of title headers and other items (such as 
figures) as the document is edited?
•	
Or so many other “simple” things we want to do but have difficulty 
executing?

xxii
What’s in the Book
This book was written to try to make sense of Microsoft Word as a typographic tool, and 
as such, it breaks the knowledge behind well-formatted and printed documents into 12 
successive chapters that will solidly build your knowledge on the very simple typographic 
principles behind Microsoft Word interface, spread through its powerful Ribbon tabs or 
its many (and sometimes very hidden) dialog boxes, options, and features.
The chapters present a succession of knowledge that requires you to read them linearly, 
from the first to the last, and then go back at random whenever necessary, with each 
chapter having one or more exercises so you can practice the knowledge gained so far.
And by the end, I surely expect that you will suddenly have that strong feeling of final 
mastery.
Screenshots are from Windows 7 and Word 2016 versions. You may see small 
differences from the ones you see on your computer. Much of this book can be used with 
earlier versions of Word.
So what is in the book?
•	
Chapter 1, Brief Introduction to Word and File Extensions is a 
very small chapter that makes a simple Microsoft Word presentation: 
how its interface is organized, the names the book uses to refer to 
some specific interface components, and a brief introduction to file 
extensions.
•	
Chapter 2, Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph 
Formatting talks about hidden characters and how Microsoft Word 
uses them to set simple typographic concepts, like paragraphs, line 
breaks, and tabulation characters. You will be also introduced to the 
controls found in the Home tab of the Ribbon and the Paragraph 
dialog box (alignment, indentation, spacing, and text flow controls).
•	
Chapter 3, Character Attributes discusses another basic issue 
regarding text formatting—the font and characters you choose to 
present your documents. You will learn about the different font 
types, how to install and use them, And how to take advantage of the 
controls found in the Home tab of the Ribbon and the Font dialog 
box to produce text documents that may rival the ones formatted by 
professional typographers.
Introduction

•	
Chapter 4, Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters gives you 
a solid introduction to a feature already touched on in previous 
chapters: Find and Replace text in a document. By using the tools 
offered by Microsoft Word, you will wake up your abilities to quickly 
format any kind of document, by finding the desired text and 
applying the desired formatting options.
•	
Chapter 5, Quick Document Formatting with Styles explains what a 
style is and how you can use it to quickly apply standardized formats 
to the text. You will be introduced to the Styles Gallery and the 
different interfaces to manage styles. It also talks about the Normal 
style, its strong inheritance behavior, and how you can create and 
manage the styles available in a document.
•	
Chapter 6, Using Recommended Styles talks about the philosophy 
behind the usage of a determined set of styles treated by Microsoft 
Word as Recommended, and how you can take advantage of using 
them, along with the Design tab and the Styles Set gallery to quickly 
apply or change the appearance of a text document.
•	
Chapter 7, Using Heading Styles introduces you to the all-important 
Heading1 to Heading9 styles that you can use to hierarchically format 
the headings (title and subtitles) of your document. It shows how 
to take advantage of the Paragraph > Outline level property, how 
to collapse and expand the document text, how to quickly navigate 
inside the text using the Navigation Pane, and how to automatically 
create the document’s Table of Contents. You will also have a brief 
introduction to Microsoft Word Outline view and how use it to 
quickly change the position of large text blocks inside the document.
•	
Chapter 8, Page Formatting discusses page formatting, which is the 
essence of any document’s final appearance. You will learn how to 
select page sizes and margins and how to use the Header and Footer 
areas to propagate information on the document. You will learn 
how to number pages and use different Header/Footer options for 
the First, Even and Odd pages, producing different types of popular 
documents (like e-books, PDF files, and books printed on both sides 
of the paper).
Introduction

xxiv
•	
Chapter 9, Section Breaks approaches how Microsoft Word allows 
changing the page formatting options inside a document using 
Section Breaks, which is a special hidden character. You will learn 
how to change page size orientation and vertical alignment for 
just one page, how section inheritance propagates through the 
document, and how to set or break links between sections. You will 
also be introduced to formatting text into columns and controlling 
the page number shown on different document pages.
•	
Chapter 10, Formatting Tables uses all the knowledge gathered so 
far to show that each table cell can be considered as an independent 
document which is affected by the Normal style and all available 
formatting options. This chapter teaches how you can create and 
format tables that will surely obey your document formatting, and 
also approaches how you can use formulas to calculate table values.
•	
Chapter 11, Creating and Using Templates discusses how you can 
use the typographic knowledge revealed in previous chapters to 
create a Microsoft Word Template that can be reused to reproduce 
the same document appearance in different files. You will learn how 
to use ready-made templates, the importance of the Normal.dotm 
template, and where templates are stored on your hard drive. You will 
also learn how to can create, use, and associate or insert an existing 
document to a template so you can take advantage of its style sets 
and all of its formatting options (including page formatting).
•	
Chapter 12, Master and Subdocuments explores how Microsoft 
Word allows managing different documents as a single entity using 
the Outline view and the Master/Subdocument approaches. You 
will also be introduced to how you can create an Index (glossary) at 
the end of the document, and how you can take advantage of all the 
knowledge discussed on this book (formatting, hidden character, 
styles, section breaks, templates…) to produce a consistent format 
in long documents of any size, produced by one person or many 
different people.

This Book’s Special Features
This book has two main special features: the Attention box and the Exercises it proposes 
to explore the issues approached in each chapter and its sections.
Attention  This box will call your attention to important information regarding 
the issue being discussed, and sometimes will even explain some unexpected 
Microsoft Word behavior. Use as a tip to enhance the knowledge under discussion.
Exercises: These were produced with the intention to make you practice the 
concepts approached in previous sections, the current chapter, or previous chapters. 
They become increasingly difficult from Chapter 2 to Chapter 12, and will give you 
the opportunity to test how a Microsoft Word document reacts or can be changed by 
following its steps.
They use fragments or the entire texts of classic and famous books, all of them 
considered as public domain.
Website Extras
Each chapter points to the Internet (https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets) 
and file you must download to have access to the documents proposed in the chapter 
exercises.
Each chapter has its own compressed .ZIP file whose content you can extract using 
Windows Explorer or a number of freeware software packages (iZarc, WinZip, WinRAR, 
and even Internet Explorer) to a desired folder (I am supposing that you will create a 
book folder in your \Documents folder, and recommend that you use a different folder 
for each chapter file.)

CHAPTER 1
Brief Introduction to Word 
and File Extensions
This book does not intend to teach you how to use Microsoft Word. It supposes that you 
already have some knowledge about it: how to open, change, and save documents, and 
how you can format text.
This very brief chapter is just a primer about Microsoft Word interface, so you can 
easily associate some terms cited throughout these book chapters.
Figure 1-1 details some items of the Microsoft Word interface and how they are cited 
in the chapters.
Figure 1-1.  The Microsoft Word 2016 interface and the names of its main items,  
as cited in this book

Microsoft Word commands are mainly found in the Ribbon tabs and the many dialog 
boxes derived from its commands.
But some can also be executed from different parts of it Interface, like
•	
Title bar: shows the name of the current document and has the 
Quick Access tool bar for common file operations.
•	
Ribbon: the tabbed control that allows access to Microsoft Word 
commands.
•	
Ruler: shows page dimensions using the desired units and gives 
access to the Page Setup and Tab dialog boxes.
•	
Document area: shows the current selected document page  
(or document content, according to the View mode selected).
•	
Status bar: where each item can give access to different dialog boxes 
by clicking the text it shows, such as the following (Figure 1-2):
•	
Navigation Pane, Word count, Idiom, or Zoom dialog boxes.
•	
Change Microsoft Word view mode (to Page Layout, Reading 
mode, or Web mode).
•	
Change the document zoom factor (dragging the zoom slider) or 
show the Zoom dialog box (by clicking the percent zoom factor 
indicator).
Figure 1-2.  Use the Status Bar to read document information (page number, word 
count, etc.), to quickly access specific dialog boxes, and to change the View mode or 
zoom factor applied to the document window
The book text will always cite how you can easily access a specific dialog box 
whenever important to make you more productive in using Microsoft Word interface.

A Note About Word File Extensions
For those of you that still do not understand what a file extension is, here comes a  
good explanation about how to see or hide them, and why I talk so much about them in 
the book.
For your information, every file you create using a computer has two parts in its 
name: the name itself and a file identification code that uses three or more characters 
and is appended to the name by the program that creates it. To separate the name from 
its file extension, Windows (and most operational systems) uses a dot, like this:
filename.ext
Where
•	
filename: Is the name you give to the file, which can be up to  
255 characters;
•	
ext: The file extension that the program appends to the  
file—generally a three-letter combination that is associated with  
the program name (but can have more than three characters).
Microsoft Word, for example, traditionally used the file extension .DOC up to 
Word 2003 version, but by the time that Microsoft moved in the direction of Office 
2007, the world had changed: there were many pressures on Microsoft to force it adopt 
an open file structure standard to save its Office files using what is called an “XML 
schema,” so any programmer could easily open its files.
So all Office 2007 suite programs standardize their file structure to XML (eXtended 
Markup Language) adding an extra “X” character to each program file extension: the 
standard Microsoft Word .DOC file extension (and file format) changed to .DOCX  
(did you guess that the last X comes from XML?).
That’s why throughout this book I always refer to Microsoft Word files using their 
four-letter file extension (like the new standard .DOCX Word file, .DOCM for an macro 
enabled document, or .DOTX and DOTM for a template or macro enabled template).
Attention  Although .DOTM files are cited in the text, Macro codes are not 
approached in this book.
Chapter 1  Brief Introduction to Word and File Extensions

Do Not Change a File Extension
That’s it: the file extension identifies the file type.
And somewhere inside Windows there is a file extension table that associates every 
file extension to an executable program. This way, Windows can also associate the file 
with a special icon, and whenever you double-click the file, Windows looks in extension 
inside the file extension table for the appropriate program to open it, and if it finds a 
match, opens the program with the desired file.
Attention  Many people naively believe that changing one file extension to 
another also changes the file type. This is not true and always leads to disasters. 
For example, Adobe Reader uses the now very popular .PDF extension. If you 
change any Microsoft Word file extension from .DOCX to .PDF, Windows will quickly 
change its icon from a Word document file to a PDF file, but you will not change the 
expected file structure. The Adobe Reader program (the one normally associated 
to a .PDF file extension) will not be able to open the file—and even if it does, it is 
more than probable that you will just see garbage instead!
Showing File Extensions
You normally can’t see the file extensions using Microsoft Word Open or Save as dialog 
box, or in any Windows Explorer window, because Microsoft Windows hides them to 
protect the file extensions from being inadvertently changed by the users, so the correct 
program can always open the file whenever the user double-clicks it!
But this is just an option in Windows interface, and as such, it can be turned on and 
off. To turn on file extensions exhibition in your Windows 7, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open the Control Panel from the Start menu and double-click 
Folder Options to open the Folder Options dialog box.
	 2.	 In the Folder Options dialog box, select the View tab and uncheck 
Hide extensions for known file types.
	 3.	 Click OK to close the Folder Options dialog box.
Chapter 1  Brief Introduction to Word and File Extensions

5
Attention  In Windows 10, open File Explorer and use the View Tab Options 
command to show the Folder Options dialog box.
From now on, all file extensions will appear in all folders!
Attention  Be careful not to delete the file extension, if exhibited, whenever you 
rename a file using Windows Explorer.
About This Book’s Figures
All figures used in this book come from Microsoft Word 2016 version and Microsoft 
Windows 7 system environment. Small differences perceived on your computer may be 
due to a different Windows or Word version.
Anyway, most of the dialog boxes pictured in this book have had the same 
appearance and formatting since Microsoft Word 2000.

CHAPTER 2
Hidden Characters, 
Inheritance, and  
Paragraph Formatting
Every word processor—Microsoft Word included—bases its inner workings on hidden 
characters and the basic principle of inheritance to copy the format applied to whatever 
is under the cursor to what comes next. To format its text paragraphs, Microsoft Word 
uses three main hidden characters:
¶    indicates an Enter key pressed in the document, used to 
represent the end of a text paragraph.
→    indicates a Tab key pressed in the document, used to displace 
the text to the next tabulation mark.
↲    indicates a Shift+Enter key combination pressed in the 
document, used to manually break a text line.
In this chapter, you will see how these hidden characters and formatting inheritance 
impact Microsoft Word text, why it is so important to control the text flow, and how to 
take advantage of knowing that they were inserted in the text to gain precise control over 
any .DOC or .DOCX text document. The document sited on the Exercise section can be 
found by downloading the Chapter02.zip file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets

Hidden Characters and Inheritance
Whenever you open Microsoft Word 2016 it presents you the “New Template” screen 
from where most people select the first, default Blank document template (earlier 
versions of Word just show the blank document template, Figure 2-1).
Figure 2-1.  Microsoft Word New Template selection screen
Attention  You can make Microsoft Word 2016 go straight to a blank page 
without showing its New Template screen by unchecking the “Show the Start 
Screen when this application starts” option, found in File ➤ Options ➤ General ➤ 
Startup Options area.
After selecting the first Blank document template, Microsoft Word will offer you 
the new, white page of an apparently blank document, into which no text has yet been 
inserted (Figure 2-2).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

9
The page seems to be clean, but it isn’t, and you can confirm this by clicking the 
Show/Hide button of the Paragraph area of Microsoft Word Ribbon (the one that has the 
“¶” character paragraph mark, also known as pilcrow). This command will make Word 
show all possible hidden characters and breaks inserted in the document. Since the 
document is still empty you will see just one ¶ character, which indicates a single, blank 
paragraph inserted in the text (Figure 2-3).
Figure 2-2.  This is the Microsoft Word blank page obtained whenever you select 
the Blank document template
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

10
Attention  From now on, I will refer to the Microsoft Word Ribbon just as “Ribbon.”
Each of these three hidden characters has an importance inside any Microsoft 
Word document and will be discussed in the next sections of this chapter. But to really 
understand why they are important we first need to learn about another serious issue: 
paragraph formatting inheritance.
Paragraph Formatting Inheritance
For the sake of the next explanations, I will leave the Show/Hide button selected in next 
figures. Supposing that you are on the blank page of a new document, if you begin to 
type anything, the typed text will appear using the default Calibri, 11 pt, regular font. 
If you select the Bold formatting button in the Font area of the Ribbon and continue 
typing, everything after that will be bold formatted. Keeping the Bold option pressed and 
selecting the Italic formatting button, now everything will be bold and italic, until you 
deselect these attributes before typing anything again (Figure 2-4).
Figure 2-3.  This figure shows the ¶ (pilcrow) hidden paragraph character that 
exists in every Word blank document, as an indication that it has at least one 
single text paragraph. To show/hide such characters, click the Show/Hide button 
on the Paragraph area of the Ribbon again.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

11
This is the first word processor inheritance level: font properties. Whenever you 
apply a font property to the text, everything you type will continue to be formatted using 
such properties, until another set of properties is selected. Note in Figure 2-4 that when 
the Show/Hide option is selected, Microsoft Word also shows a second hidden character: 
the dot character “·”, in the middle of the text line, for each space you typed with your 
keyboard space bar (I put a sequence of three space characters at the end of the text so 
you can see them).
When you press the Enter key and continue to type, you will realize that a new ¶ 
paragraph character will appear in the text, and that all precedent formatting attributes 
will be copied from the previous paragraph to this new one. This is the second level of 
inheritance: each paragraph receives the same formatting options of its predecessor.
Press the Enter key repeatedly to insert as many lines of text as you want, and note 
that Microsoft Word will add a new ¶ paragraph mark for each Enter key you press, each 
one inheriting the same formatting options of its predecessor (Figure 2-5).
Figure 2-4.  Whenever you change any font properties, these properties will remain 
active for whatever you type, constituting the first inheritance level of any word 
processor
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

12
And if you now uncheck the Show/Hide option of the Paragraph area of the Ribbon, 
you will see that all hidden characters (the ¶ paragraph marks and “·” characters for each 
space typed) disappear from the text view. They are all still there, but now you can’t see 
them anymore (Figure 2-6).
Figure 2-5.  Whenever you type the Enter key, a new hidden ¶ paragraph mark is 
inserted into the document, each one receiving by inheritance the same formatting 
options of its predecessor!
Figure 2-6.  After unchecking the Show/Hide button of Microsoft Word Paragraph 
area on the Ribbon, all hidden characters disappear from the user view! They are 
still there, but now are invisible!
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

13
This very simple operation has a deep impact on Microsoft Word document 
behavior, because most people do not understand this inheritance in paragraph 
formatting or realize that each space character and Enter key continues to exist in the 
document, allowing some unexpected behaviors, since the current paragraph formatting 
is always copied to the next when an Enter key is pressed. Through the next sections, 
this book will explore this concept whenever possible, trying to explain why the user of 
Microsoft Word thinks that it works poorly when it doesn’t.
Paragraph Formatting
Text paragraphs are the main component of any document, and Microsoft Word offers 
in the Font and Paragraph areas of the Home tab of the Ribbon many important controls 
as shortcuts to both the Font and Paragraph dialog box options. Among other things, 
you can control the font properties, alignment, line spacing, space before and after, and 
text flow. Figure 2-7 shows the main Paragraph controls that will be detailed in the next 
sections (Font controls will be analyzed in Chapter 3).
Figure 2-7.  The Paragraph area of the Home tab with its many paragraph 
controls
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

14
Text Alignment
Alignment controls how each text paragraph aligns to the page margin, and just as any 
other text processor, Microsoft Word allows a choice between Left, Center, Right, and 
Justify alignments. The correct use of text alignment is a matter more of taste than of 
science, but it’s necessary to follow some simple rules if you want your documents to 
look better and to be as legible as possible.
Although there is no scientific research to sustain this argument, most typographers 
believe that reading is improved when the correct alignment is used, so follow these 
simple principles:
•	
A “ragged” edge happens at the right of a Left alignment, at left of 
a Right alignment, and at left and right of a Center alignment. It is 
referring to the undulating shapes created by the white space along 
the opposite side of text alignment.
•	
Center alignment has double ragged edges (at left and right) that 
impede reading speed and comprehension.
•	
Use Center alignment just for chapter titles that begin on a new 
document page, or to present the author name that may appear right 
before or after the document title.
•	
Don’t use Center alignment on document section titles, because the 
reader may lose them when reading. Section titles must be always 
Left aligned.
•	
The straight (or “hard”) left edge and ragged right edge combination 
of standard Left alignment tends to performs best for readers because 
it helps the eye find the start of the next line when it leaves the end of 
the last one.
•	
Use Right alignment just on special paragraphs (like signatures or 
citation credits).
•	
The effect of full-justified text—which produces straight left and right 
edges of a text block—results in uneven space between words, which 
may be harder to read: the uniform shape of the justified paragraph 
block makes it easier for the eye to get lost when returning from the 
end of one line to the start of another.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

15
•	
Justify alignment works best on multicolumn layouts, because  
small-­width columns don’t make the reader lose the position of the 
next line.
•	
Long documents with Justify alignment (like books) may feel boring 
and tiring to read, and that is why some desktop publishers choose 
Left alignment in textbooks to improve text readability.
•	
Justify alignment may be used when the audience is mainly 
composed of people that are acquainted with it, like lawyers, 
teachers, and so on.
Attention  I will issue my opinion here. I personally dislike Justify alignment, and 
unless it is mandatory, I do not use it in anything I produce. As I said before, it is a 
matter of taste.
Now that you have some clues about how to use text alignment, let’s give more 
attention to Justify alignment because sometimes it may be a source of unexpected 
Microsoft Word behavior.
Justify Alignment
Although it is not recommended in long text documents, Justify alignment is the most 
frequently desired paragraph attributes, where all paragraph text lines but the last are 
perfectly aligned to the left and right page margins. When you ask Microsoft Word to 
Justify any text paragraph, its inner algorithm does something like this:
	 1.	 Count the number of words found in each line of text.
	 2.	 Count the number of character spaces need to stretch the line to 
the right text margin.
	 3.	 Divide the number of character spaces by the number of words 
minus 1, to know how many spaces must be inserted between 
each word.
	 4.	 Insert extra spaces between each word but the last, making the 
text left and right aligned, or in a word, justified!
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

16
Figure 2-8 shows the first paragraph of James Fenimore Cooper’s The Last of the 
Mohicans using two different alignments: Left and Justify. It uses a Microsoft Word 
document page with the Show/Hide button checked, with the text formatted using 
the default Calibri 11 pt font, and 160% zoom so you can best understand what 
happened to the text. The “·” characters you see between the words are the spaces 
typed to separate them.
Figure 2-8.  Two versions of the same paragraph: the first is left aligned, the second 
justified. The Microsoft Word Show/Hide option is checked and the zoom is 160%.
Look at the second Justify alignment paragraph of Figure 2-8 and note that its 
second and third lines received extra spaces between its words to guarantee that they 
were equally separated, so the first and last word of each line are perfectly left and right 
aligned to the page margins.
Also note that Microsoft Word did not insert any hidden characters to Justify the 
text: justification was made by using a kind of “empty space” between the words, so they 
become harmonically separated in each line of text (Figure 2-9 gives a bigger zoom to 
the justified paragraph so you can better appreciate the justifying effect).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

17
If the justified paragraph has many words, the effect may be quite good. But if it 
hasn’t, which happens in special cases—like in text using column layout with narrow 
columns, or when there are other special hidden characters inserted in the text—the 
effect may be very surprising. This is especially true when the text has Manual line break 
characters.
Manual Line Break
Besides the fact that you can press the Enter key to insert a new document paragraph, 
or in typographic words “insert a paragraph break,” sometimes you may want to (or 
inadvertently) break a line inside a paragraph without inserting a new ¶ pilcrow hidden 
paragraph mark in the text. This kind of operation is typographically called a “Manual 
Line Break,” and Microsoft Word does this by inserting the hidden Manual line break 
character ↲ whenever you press Shift+Enter.
Attention  From now on, every time you see the “+” character concatenating two 
or more keys to be pressed, it means that you should keep pressing the first one(s) 
and then press the next. In this case, press and hold Shift and then press Enter once.
We can insert a line break in the middle of the second line of the same justified  
paragraph used in the last example by simply pressing Shift+Enter after the word 
“obvious.” Figure 2-10 shows what happens to the justified text after the insertion of 
such Manual line break character.
Figure 2-9.  Microsoft Word inserts empty spaces (not hidden characters) to 
further separate the words of each text line, so it can Justify any text paragraph!
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

18
Did you notice how spaced words become in the second text line after the insertion 
of the ↲ Manual break line? Using the rule stated in the last section, Microsoft Word 
counted the words, counted the number of space characters needed to get to the right 
margin, and put these equal blank space characters between each word, so the first 
and last word of the second line become perfectly spaced—or in typographic jargon, 
justified.
This is very relevant, because if you have a single ↲ Manual line break character 
inserted in a single justified paragraph and begin to type anything in this paragraph 
without being aware of this situation, Microsoft Word may present you with very odd 
behavior.
Figure 2-11 shows what happens in such cases (note that hidden characters are 
shown). When the two words “Demystifying Word” are typed in the first line of the 
justified paragraph that has a Manual line break, Microsoft Word tries to equally space 
the two words, make them bounce around on the screen, putting the first left aligned 
and the second (and last) word, right aligned!
Figure 2-10.  Justified paragraph after the insertion of a Manual line break 
character (↲) in the middle of its second text line (after the word “obvious”)
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

19
Do you get it? Now, imagine the very moments when this happens without any 
knowledge about these possibilities and being unaware of such hidden characters.
Attention  In my experience, orienting university students to produce technical 
articles, it is quite common to see sequential Manual line break characters 
separating each text line inside a paragraph as a proof that the text was copied 
from Internet web sites or Adobe Acrobat PDF files. So, that is the truth: whenever 
you click Show/Hide command to show hidden characters and find Manual 
line breaks separating text lines, it came from the Internet or another source of 
electronic information. 
Too easy to find cheating!
Microsoft Word offers the “File ➤ Options ➤ Advanced ➤ Layout options for 
<document name>, Don’t expand character spaces on a line that ends with 
Shift+Enter” option to avoid expanding a justified paragraph that has a Manual 
line break character created by pressing Shift+Enter (Figure 2-12).
Figure 2-11.  Whenever an empty justified paragraph has a Manual line break as 
its first character, Microsoft Word will try to Justify each typed word, making them 
bounce around the screen as you type them!

Other Paragraph Attributes
Besides alignment, every paragraph has many different attributes related to a 
typographic issue. To fully understand them, it is needed to understand some basic 
typography concepts.
Baseline, Descender and Ascender Lines
Every Font obeys typography rules when it draws its letters, and Microsoft Word 
uses such rules to implement control over characters and paragraphs you type in the 
document.
Figure 2-13 shows how the characters are built inside a Font based on five imaginary 
straight lines.
Figure 2-12.  Check the File ➤ Options ➤ Advanced ➤ Layout options for 
<document name>. Don’t expand character spaces on a line that ends with 
Shift+Return option, to avoid justifying a line that has a Manual line break 
created with Shift+Enter in a justified paragraph.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

21
•	
Baseline: the lines where all characters lie down.
•	
X-height: right above the baseline, defines the size of the lowercase 
letters by the size of the “x” letter.
•	
Capital line: above the x-height line; defines the size of uppercase 
letters (which is not always the same height as the ascender).
•	
Ascender line: next above the Capital line; defines the size of 
ascenders, a vertical stroke that extends above the x-height line for 
some lowercase letters, like b, f, h, and t.
•	
Descender line: defines the size of descenders, which are vertical 
strokes or tails that hang below the baseline for some lowercase 
letters, like g, j, p, and q.
Keeping in mind that such font attributes are fixed to each font (like Calibri, Times 
New Roman, or Arial), let us examine how they affect the way Microsoft Word works by 
exploring some paragraph attributes.
Line Spacing
Line spacing, typographically called leading, is the space that Microsoft Word uses 
to separate the current line of text from the previous inside the same or different 
paragraphs. Line spacing = 1 is typographically defined as 120% the size of the greatest 
font used in a single line. Or more specifically, it calculates 20% of the height between the 
Ascender and Descender lines for current text line and uses this space to separate it from 
the previous text line of text.
Figure 2-13.  The anatomy of all characters in a Font obeys some typographical 
principles that determine the size of its lowercase and uppercase letters, and 
the appearance of some special letters that have ascenders (like f, h, k, and t) or 
descenders (like g, j, p, and q).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

22
Note that I italicized the words “120% the size of the greatest font used in a single line”!
This means that when you use Line Spacing = 1.5, Word adds 50% more space, or 
half a line height to separate two consecutive lines. When Line Spacing = 2, Words adds a 
blank line between every two consecutive lines inside the paragraph. Figure 2-14 shows 
the same justified text paragraph, using Line Spacing = 1, 1.5, and 2.
Since I told you that the Line spacing control is granted regarding 120% of the 
greatest font size used in a single line, Figure 2-15 shows what happens to a text 
paragraph using Line spacing = 1 and that has just one of its characters with a greater 
size! Just the selected “t” letter has font Calibri, 24, while all other characters of the entire 
paragraph has font Calibri, 11.
Figure 2-14.  Line spacing 1, 1.5, and 2 applied to the same paragraph to insert 
space between paragraph text lines
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

23
Attention  Regarding Line spacing, the opposite is also true: if all characters of 
an entire line of text have a font size smaller than the paragraph font size, this line 
spacing will be smaller than the others.
This odd behavior always happens when you insert some small image as a character 
inside any text line, or use a different font type to define the appearance of a single 
character. In case that you are wondering if different fonts of the same size occupy the 
same vertical space: the answer is yes, they do. Calibri 12 seems to be greater than Times 
New Roman 12 because its X-height line is at an upper position, but they have the same 
height distance between their Ascender and Descender lines for a 12 pt size.
Microsoft Word allows precise control over the Line spacing applied to each 
paragraph using the Paragraph dialog box, which can be selected in three ways:
	 1.	 Click the Line and Paragraph Spacing control in the Paragraph 
area of the Home tab and select the Line Spacing Options…; or
	 2.	 Click the very small square at the bottom right of the Paragraph 
area of the Home tab of Word Ribbon (see Figure 2-15); or
	 3.	 Right-click the desired paragraph and select Paragraph… in the 
context menu.
You will receive the traditional Microsoft Word Paragraph dialog box, which is quite 
the same since Word 2000 or even older versions (Figure 2-16).
Figure 2-15.  This figure shows that Microsoft Word uses the 120% rule based on 
the largest font size found in any single character (the selected “t,” formatted with a 
24 pt size), to define what is considered as Line spacing = 1, to separate the second 
line of text from the first
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

24
In the General area at the top of the Paragraph box you find the Alignment control (to 
allow selecting the left, center, right, or Justify alignments), and the Outline level (which 
will be explained in the “Outline Level” section of Chapter 7). In the Spacing area, you 
will find the Line spacing control, which offers these options:
•	
Single, 1.5 lines, and Double: Applies Line spaces 1, 1.5, and 2, 
respectively.
•	
At least: Does not allow that line spacing to go below the specified 
level, even when font size is smaller.
Figure 2-16.  Microsoft Word Paragraph dialog box
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

25
•	
Exactly: Keeps line spacing at an exact size, not increasing it 
whenever one or more characters inserted in the text receive a bigger 
font size than that specified for the entire paragraph. When selecting 
this option, the upper part of such bigger characters may be missing 
in the line they reside.
•	
Multiple: Allows selecting any line space you want (besides 1, 1.5, or 2), 
using real values with one-decimal precision (like Line spacing = 3 or 1.7).
If we apply Line spacing = Exactly = 11 pt to the paragraph shown in Figure 2-15, with 
the big 24 pt “t” inside a paragraph formatted with Calibri 11 pt size, this big letter will 
lose its vertical stroke, while all paragraph lines will receive Line spacing = 1 (Figure 2-­17).
Figure 2-17.  Microsoft Word allows you to apply a permanent line spacing 
using the Exactly option, which will define a precise amount of line spacing, 
independently of the characters size found in each text line. In such cases, the 
bigger characters may lose their vertical strokes.
Attention  As you may note in the last example, Line space = 1 is equal to Line 
Space = Exactly = 11 pt for a paragraph formatted with 11 pt size. In other words:
Line spacing = Line spacing Exactly in pt ÷ Font size in pt.
By applying a Line Spacing = Exactly = 18 pt for a 12 pt font paragraph, you will 
apply Line spacing = 18 ÷ 12 = 1.5.
As you might be wondering, current line spacing is also inherited by the next 
paragraph when you press Enter.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

26
Space Before and After Paragraphs
Many people have the (strange) habit of pressing Enter twice at the end of each 
paragraph to insert an empty row of the same line spacing between two consecutive 
paragraphs, as a visual clue to show where one paragraph ends and the other begins.
When they do this they also insert a pair of hidden paragraph characters preventing 
Microsoft Word from precisely controlling the text flow between document pages, 
because this extra empty paragraph may become the first paragraph of the next page 
displacing the text from the top margin (Figure 2-18).
Figure 2-18.  By using two consecutive Enter keys to insert a white space between 
two consecutive paragraphs, the document may get pages where the first 
paragraph is an empty text row, displacing the text from the top margin by the 
current line spacing.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

27
As a rule of thumb, never type two Enters to separate text paragraphs. Instead, use 
the Before and After options of the Paragraph dialog box shown in Figure 2-16, or the 
Before and After options of the Spacing area of the Layout tab on the Ribbon, shown in 
Figure 2-19.
•	
Use the Space Before to separate the current paragraph from the 
previous. It is most used to displace special paragraphs like section, 
figure, or table titles from the previous paragraph in the document 
text (also called body text).
•	
Use the Space After to separate the current paragraph from the next. 
It is most used to displace the document text paragraphs (body text) 
whenever the text doesn’t use indentation in its first row.
You can define the After and/or Before spacing options using different measuring 
units by specifying the desired suffix:
•	
By using single real numbers without a unit suffix the Before and 
After options are specified in points.
•	
Use 1 in to define it in inches;
•	
Use 1 cm to define it in centimeters (1 inch equals 2.54 cm).
•	
Use 12 pt to define it in typographic Point units.
Figure 2-19.  Use the Spacing ➤ Before and After options of the Layout tab to 
displace characters by specific values, instead of pressing Enter key two or more 
times to create such white space
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

28
Attention  A point is defined as 1/72 of an inch (about 0.353 mm), or 1/12 of a 
pica (another common typographic measure).
Whichever the unit you use, Microsoft Word will always convert Spacing Before 
and After values to typographic points units and show it accordingly, and since spacing 
Before and After are paragraph properties, they will be inherited by the next paragraph 
whenever you press Enter.
To guarantee that the Before and After spacing options are proportional to the Line 
spacing used by the paragraph, set them with the same paragraph point size multiplied 
by the Line spacing used on it.
Let me explain better: 
•	
If the paragraph font size is 8 pt and its Line spacing = 1, to insert 
a blank line of 1-line spacing of 8 pt before or after the paragraph, 
define Before or After = 8 × 1 = 8 pt.
•	
If the paragraph font size is 10 pt and its Line spacing = 1.5, to insert 
a blank line of 1.5-line spacing of 10 pt before or after the paragraph, 
define Before or After = 10 pt × 1.5 = 15 pt.
•	
If the paragraph font size is 12 pt and its Line spacing = 2, to insert 
a blank line of 2-line spacing of 12 pt before or after the paragraph, 
define Before or After = 12 pt × 2 = 24 pt.
Do you get it?
Attention  The rule of thumb is as follows: To insert an empty line before or after 
the current paragraph, the Spacing Before or After options must be proportional:
Paragraph font size × Line spacing
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

29
Figure 2-20 shows how any Microsoft Word document uses the Before and After 
Space options to displace text paragraphs from its neighbors.
How Microsoft Word Implements Paragraph Spacing
Giving closer attention to Figure 2-20, you will realize that Microsoft Word doesn’t use 
both the Space After and Before options to displace two consecutive paragraphs.
The third paragraph of this figure (the “New Section Title (16 pt, Line spacing = 1, 
Before = After = 16pt)” paragraph that uses bold characters) is displaced by just 16 pt 
from the previous paragraph (the “New paragraph (inherited from previous)” which has 
the Space After = 12 pt option).
By the typographic rule of paragraph spacing we expect that it will be spaced by 28 pt 
from its predecessor: 12 pt from the Space After option of the precedent paragraph plus 
16 pt from the Space Before of this paragraph.
But it isn’t.
Since Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Word has begun to philosophically implement 
the Space paragraph options to displace the current paragraph from its neighbors. I think 
they had a great discussion to take this decision, which seems to work this way:
Figure 2-20.  Use the Before and After Spacing options to define an extra space 
that must exist before or after any text paragraph, so it can be visually separated 
from the previous or next paragraph without pressing the Enter key extra times
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

30
To displace two successive paragraphs where one employs the Space After option 
and the other employs the Space Before option (vice versa), use the greatest values of 
both options.
Using this thought, Microsoft Word acts philosophically correct, since it uses the 
greatest defined space (after or before) to space two successive paragraphs, to guarantee 
that the greatest space is always used.
But from the objective point of view, Microsoft Word fails to be precise: instead of 
using the options defined by the user, it “thinks” which is the best and then applies it.
Attention  I researched this with other popular word processors. Corel 
WordPerfect does not have options to define Space Before and After paragraphs. 
The word processors of the free software LibreOffice and OpenOffice, like the 
­professional desktop publishing software QuarkXPress and PageMaker, are very 
objective: they sum the Space After and Before options to displace two consecutive 
paragraphs.
From my programmer point of view (I am again issuing an opinion here) Microsoft 
Word is wrong: it should apply the options typed without “thinking” which is the 
best, or have a clear option to not add space before and/or after for two successive 
paragraphs when their values are equal . But since this is a Microsoft Word book, 
we must just understand how the software works, use its rules, and follow with 
them, without considering if they are right or wrong. Right?
So, follow this rule when applying paragraph spacing in any Microsoft Word 
document: Microsoft Word will always discard the smallest value when comparing 
the Space After and Space Before of two successive paragraph. If both options are 
equal, it will not sum them.
Let’s be practical: to guarantee that the third paragraph of Figure 2-20 is 28 points 
spaced from the previous one, define Space Before = 28 pt (Microsoft Word will 
discard the Space After=12 pt implemented in the previous paragraph).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

31
To avoid that the first paragraph spacing problem shown in Figure 2-17 happens 
when the text flows between two successive pages, Microsoft Word offers in the “File ➤ 
Options ➤ Advanced ➤ Layout options for <document name>” options, the “Suppress 
extra line spacing at bottom of Page” and “Suppress extra line spacing at top of page” 
options. Check both to guarantee a perfect text flow for body text paragraphs that 
implement the Space Before and After options (Figure 2-21).
Figure 2-21.  Use Microsoft Word File ➤ Options ➤ Advanced ➤ Layout options 
for <document name> > Suppress extra line spacing at bottom of page and/or 
Supress extra line spacing at top of page options to guarantee a perfect text flow 
between document pages whose body text implements the Space Before and After 
options
Attention  Although Microsoft Word offers these two options for suppressing 
extra line spacing at the bottom or top of a page, it seems to me that it really does 
not implement such space when the page breaks, so both options seem to be 
unnecessary.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

32
Paragraph Indentation 
Every printed page has a predefined margin that defines where the text of the document 
will appear on the page, but on a full text page we may eventually need to indicate where 
each paragraph begins by adding an extra space in it first line, creating what is called a 
First line indent. Other times we must give an emphasis to some special text paragraphs 
from the body text by detaching then from the page left and/or right margins.
Microsoft Word allows you to do this in the Indentation area of the Paragraph dialog 
box shown in Figure 2-16, where you can set individual paragraphs’ Left and Right 
margins, and you can also control the first line paragraph using the Special control and 
its associated By option. Using such options one can create these types of indentations:
•	
First line indent, which is used to indicate that a new paragraph 
begins by adding a defined amount of space to the left of the first 
character of it first line. It is optionally used in the first paragraph of 
any section since it doesn’t need to be detached from the previous.
•	
Left indent, which displaces the entire left paragraph margin from the 
page left margin—even though it received a First line indent.
•	
Hanging indent, which is a negative first line indent, when all but the 
first paragraph lines are indented. It is the default formatting style 
used by the Bullets and Numbering controls found in Paragraph area 
of the Home tab of the Ribbon.
•	
Right margin indent, which displaces the entire paragraph right 
margin from the page right margin.
Attention  As a good formatting practice, choose just one effect to signal the 
beginning of a new paragraph: Paragraph spacing or First line indent. Don’t use both!
The English version of Microsoft Word uses inches to define the Indentation options 
found in the Paragraph dialog box (Figure 2-16) and in the Layout tab of the Ribbon 
(Figure 2-19), but you can change this default measurement unit to centimeters, 
millimeters, points, or picas using the Show measurement option, found in the Display 
area of the Advanced dialog box, which you can show using the File ➤ Options ➤ 
Advanced command (Figure 2-22).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

33
Showing and Using the Ruler
Since it may be difficult for most of us to think in terms of inch values to define the 
desired paragraph indentation, Microsoft Word offers a horizontal ruler that is hidden by 
default in its interface and can be set to visible by checking the Ruler option in the Show 
area of the View tab of the Ribbon (Figure 2-23).
Figure 2-22.  Microsoft Word allows defining the desired unit to be used in its ruler 
and the many Paragraph dialog box options using the option File ➤ Options ➤ 
Advanced ➤ Display ➤ Show measurement units.
Figure 2-23.  Check the Ruler option in the Show area of the View tab to make 
Microsoft Word display a horizontal ruler with a scale that uses the application 
default unit measure.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

34
Microsoft Word ruler shows a scale that uses the default Microsoft Word 
measurement unit (inches) and specific areas to show the page margins (dark gray 
background) and the text margin (white background). It also offers specific controls to 
define the First line, Hanging indent, and Left and Right paragraph indent (Figure 2-24).
Figure 2-24.  Microsoft Word rule controls allow you to define the indentation of 
the first line, all but first line, and left and right margin
Apply Paragraph Indentation
Most people employ one of these two bad habits to indent the first paragraph line to 
signal that a new paragraph begins:
	 1.	 Type a defined number of spaces (4 to 6 spaces); or
	 2.	 Type a Tab character.
Never do that. To apply a First line indent to any text paragraph you can
•	
use one of the default five options exposed in the Paragraph area of 
the Home tab.
•	
use the Indentation area of the Paragraph dialog box shown in 
Figure 2-16 to set the Special option to First line and the By option to 
desired horizontal displacement in inches.
•	
drag the First line ruler control to the desired horizontal position.
In both cases, whenever the paragraph has the appropriate indentation, you may 
leave inheritance to take care of copying its format to the next paragraph whenever you 
type Enter to create a new paragraph with the same indentation.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

35
Default Indentation Options
Microsoft Word has five default options in the Paragraph option of the Home tab of the 
Ribbon to allow insert an indent in any paragraph: Bullets, Numbering, Multilevel List, 
Decrease indent, and Increase indent (Figures 2-7 and 2-25).
Figure 2-25.  Microsoft Word offers the Bullets, Numbering, Multilevel List, 
Decrease indent, and Increase indent controls in the Paragraph area of the 
Home tab. They may change the Left, Right, Special, and By options found in 
the Indentation area of the Paragraph dialog box reflecting on the position of 
associated ruler controls.
Each one may change the Left, Right, Special, and By options of the Indentation area 
of the Paragraph dialog box shown in Figure 2-16 (or the Indent Left and Right options of 
the Paragraph area of the Layout tab of the Ribbon, shown in Figure 2-19). The Bullets, 
Numbering, and Multilevel list controls automatically create a hanging indent in the 
paragraph, while the Decrease and Increase indent changes the Left Indentation option 
of the paragraph (for further tips about this issue, see section “Bullets and Numbering” 
later on in this chapter).
Figure 2-26 shows many different paragraph indentations produced by dragging 
Microsoft Word ruler controls to specific positions (as you drag any of the ruler controls, 
Word will show a vertical dashed line to allow precise text alignments), or by using the 
Numbering tool.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

36
Figure 2-26.  Drag Microsoft Word ruler controls to achieve different types of text 
formation. You can left indent just the first line, all lines but the first, or all left or 
right lines. When you press Enter, the next paragraph will inherit all these format 
options!
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

37
Attention  After each paragraph had been indented, an Enter key was pressed 
to create a new, identically formatted paragraph, so you can better appreciate 
inheritance in action. The pilcrow ¶ character that represents the inherited 
paragraph is always right under the ruler First line indent control for the paragraph 
that precedes it.
Although is quite easy to drag the ruler controls to achieve a desired effect, it may 
be difficult to use Microsoft Word default inches unit to make the same adjustments 
in the Paragraph dialog box controls (or in the associated controls of the Paragraph, 
Indentation options of the Layout tab).
For example, the last numbered text paragraph of Figure 2-26 (the one with a 
hanging indent produced by Microsoft Word Numbering control) received the values 
shown in Figure 2-27. Quite complex to consider such numbers without any typographic 
knowledge, isn’t it?
Figure 2-27.  You can easily implement the Autonumber feature by a click of a 
mouse; define these values in Microsoft Word Paragraph dialog box: Special = 
Hanging, By = 0.25.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

38
Paragraph Tabulation
Most of you that are reading me now may never have used a typewriter machine to 
produce a page of text. This old technology has a special way to easily allow the creation 
of tables on a printed page using three special keys:
•	
an “Add tabulation” key that allowed to define specific horizontal 
page positions on the paper;
•	
a “Tabulator” key that makes the typewriter carriage to fast jump to 
the next tabulated position;
•	
a “Clean up tabulations” key to redefine the tabulation positions.
It is interesting that although many people used the typewriter, most of them were 
unaware how to use these three keys to produce tables. That is why the first computers 
produced received a Tab (Tabulator) key right above the All Caps key: it was to mimic the 
old typewriter keyboard, and smooth the transition from one technology to another.
Most interesting is the fact that today almost nobody knows the usefulness of the Tab 
key. They just know that when you press Tab at the beginning of a new paragraph, a fixed 
amount of space will be inserted in the text, which may vary depending on the horizontal 
position where it is inserted.
Every time you press the Tab key, Microsoft Word inserts a hidden → (Tab character): 
the right arrow that you see in text whenever you check the Show/Hide option of the 
Paragraph area in the Home tab of the Ribbon. Figure 2-28 shows the insertion of five tab 
characters and numbers 1 to 5 after each tab.
Figure 2-28.  Every time you press the Tab key, Microsoft Word inserts a hidden  
“→” tab character in the text and aligns the next character at each 0.5-inch 
position on the ruler.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

39
Attention  If Word doesn’t insert a Tab key at the beginning of any  
paragraph—displacing its First line indent control instead—press Ctrl+Tab to do it!
Note how the → Tab characters force these numbers to be perfectly left align below 
the respective 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 inch positions of the ruler. This behavior is 
because Microsoft Word is factory defined to space each Tab stop by 0.5 inches in the 
horizontal position.
You can check or change the default tab position by clicking the Tabs button located 
at the bottom right of the Paragraph dialog and inspecting the Default tabs option 
(Figure 2-29).
Figure 2-29.  This is the Tabs dialog box, where the Default Tab stop option is 
factory set to 0.5 inches
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

40
Besides the default Tab stops, you can set the horizontal rule position (and type) of 
each Tab stop to wherever you want just by clicking the white area of the ruler. When 
you click, Microsoft Word will insert a Tab stop character of the tab type selected at the 
right of the ruler, and will horizontally displace all the remaining text in the same row. 
Figure 2-30 shows what happened to the numbers’ positions in the text when a left 
default Tab stop was inserted in the ruler at about 0.75 inches.
Note that number 1, which was left aligned by the insertion of a Left tab stop at 0.5 
inch position, is now left aligned at 0.75 inches, exactly below where the left Tab stop was 
inserted in the ruler. Also note that every other default Tab stop didn’t change its default 
position, being exactly below each 0.5 inch increment as defined by the Default Tab 
stops value (at 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 inches).
If the first Left Tab stop now positioned at 0.75 inches is dragged to the left or 
right, the number character that is at the left of this Tab stop (the number 1) may be 
repositioned on the screen, eventually displacing all the remaining text of this row. 
Figure 2-31 shows what happens when the 0.75 inch Left Tab stop shown in Figure 2-30 
was moved to 1.5 inches: all other tab aligned numbers were also right displaced to the 
next default Tab stop position on the ruler (at 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 inches).
Figure 2-30.  Click the white area of the ruler to insert a default left Tab stop. Note 
how the text is horizontally repositioned to obey the Tab stop position and tab 
character order.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

41
Attention  You can also insert Tab stops at a specific horizontal position of the 
page by double-clicking anywhere on the page’s white space. The selected type of 
Tab stop will be inserted in the ruler. Press Esc or Ctrl+Z to undo such operation.
Types of Tab Stops
Microsoft Word has seven types of Tab stops, according to what is selected in the Tab 
stop selector located at the left of the ruler, out of the page borders (see Figure 2-32). 
Every time you click this tab selector it changes its icon, cyclically returning to the default 
Left Tab stop. You can select the types of Tab stops shown in Figure 2-32.
Figure 2-31.  When you drag any Tab stop along the ruler, all printed characters to 
its left thatare preceded by hidden tab characters have their position affected. This 
figure shows the effect of dragging the left Tab stop to the 1.5-inch position.
Figure 2-32.  Microsoft Word Tab stop types defined when you click the Tab stop 
selector at the right of the ruler
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

42
The first three types of Tab stops align the tabulated text to the left, center, and right 
of the tabulation mark, respectively. The decimal Tab stop is used to right align numbers 
using the position of the decimal separator character (usually “ . ” in the United States 
and other English speaking countries). The vertical line Tab stop adds a vertical line 
at the point it is defined, and the First line and All but first line indentation are used to 
click the ruler to reposition the associated ruler controls (they have the same effect of 
dragging the First line or All but first line rule controls on the rule). Figure 2-33 shows 
how these different Tab stops impact on the tabulated.
Figure 2-33.  Different text alignments made with Tab stops. Note how text can be 
aligned to the left, center, or right of a Tab stop, and how numbers can be perfectly 
aligned to its decimal character separator.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

43
All those Tab stops were created to allow the design of precise tables, which was fully 
surpassed by Microsoft Word Tables capability (see next section). And now that you have 
some basic understanding about how Tab stops work, just follow this very simple rule:
NEVER type two successive tab characters. One is always enough since you set a Tab 
stop at the appro priate position on the ruler.
Attention  Note that when you add a Center aligned Tab stop, type a Tab 
character to put the cursor down the Tab stop and type anything; the text will 
be center distributed as you type. Conversely, when you add a Right aligned Tab 
stop and type some text, the text will grow to the left and keep aligning its last 
character to the right Tab stop position.
Precise Text Alignment with Tab Stops
Have you ever tried to align different text columns on the screen using spaces to perfectly 
separate them, only to note that they later became totally misaligned when printed?
This happens due to the different horizontal spaces used by different characters 
implemented by the Microsoft Windows installed fonts (we will see more about Fonts in 
Chapter 3).
Most modern computer fonts are “proportionally spaced,” which means that each 
character occupies just the space it needs, while the typewriter font (and some special 
Windows fonts) are “mono spaced”: each character occupies the same horizontal space.
On proportionally spaced fonts, the “l” (L lowercase) and “i” characters are the 
narrowest ones, and the “M” (uppercase) is the largest; the space character occupies its 
own horizontal space. Since different rows has different letters and space characters, you 
can’t separate words using a defined amount of space characters and expect that they 
will be correctly aligned when printed!
This is the best utility for Tab stops: to perfectly align text columns in different 
paragraphs. Note that thanks to inheritance, you can put many different Tab stops at 
specific positions and produce new, identical paragraphs with the same Tab stops just by 
pressing the Enter key.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

44
Let’s suppose you want to create a three-column text to produce a basic table to 
correctly align text and numbers. The first column begins at the left paragraph margin 
and does not need a Tab stop (is Left aligned by default). The second column begins 
at 2 inches and is also Left aligned. The third column begins at 4 inches and is where 
numbers of different magnitudes are to be typed, perfectly aligned to their decimal 
points. Figure 2-34 shows how this basic paragraph alignment can be defined in 
Microsoft Word ruler using Tab stops.
Follow these instructions as a simple exercise:
	 1.	 Type any word at the beginning of the paragraph.
	 2.	 Press tab to jump to 2 inches (first Tab stop) and type another word.
	 3.	 Press tab again (second Tab stop) and type a number.
	 4.	 Press Enter and repeat steps 1 to 3 to insert two other perfectly 
aligned text rows.
Figure 2-35 shows how this simple exercise must appear in my Microsoft Word 
interface. Note that all three rows of text were perfectly aligned at left margin, at 2 inches 
and 4 inches on the ruler and will surely print as you see them on the screen!
Figure 2-34.  A simple paragraph with two Tab stops: a left Tab stop at 2 in and a 
decimal Tab stop at 4 in
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

45
Also note that there is just one Tab key pressed between each text column, and 
that the text precisely aligns with the next Tab stop position. And you want to change 
the position of a Tab stop of many paragraphs at once, you must first select them and 
then drag the desired Tab stop to a new position on the ruler. The text of all selected 
paragraphs will immediately be repositioned on the screen (Figure 2-36).
Figure 2-35.  Text aligned by different tab stops attributed to the first paragraph 
and copied to the next by inheritance when Enter is pressed
Figure 2-36.  Select all paragraphs with the same Tab stops and drag a Tab stop to

Attention  If the selected paragraphs have one or more Tab stops with a fade 
color on the ruler, it means that one or more of the selected paragraphs miss this 
Tab stop.
You can set the same Tab stops to any number of paragraphs by first selecting them 
before clicking the ruler to define each Tab stop horizontal position type.
Filling Tab Stop Spaces
Chances are that you may need to insert trailer characters (like dots or underscores) as 
visual clues to associate text with numbers in the same text row, to create the common 
text formatting we see in some accounting tables or in any book’s analytical index.
If you ever did it, you probably noticed that although the page numbers seem to be 
perfectly aligned on the screen they don’t aligned well on the printed page.
You should NEVER try to type leading or trailing dots to fill a text gap in an attempt to 
try to align them. Instead you must place a tab character at the appropriate ruler position 
and indicate for Microsoft Word to precede it by the appropriate filling characters 
(a space character is the default Tab character filling type, but you can also use dots, 
dashes, or underscores).
To fill a tabulation gap with a different character type, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Use the mouse to define the desired Tab stop on the ruler.
	 2.	 Double-click the Tab stop character on the ruler to show the Tabs 
dialog box.
	 3.	 Select the desired Tab stop in the Tab stop position list (identify it 
by its position in inches).
	 4.	 Eventually change its alignment type in the Alignment area 
(see Figure 2-29 for alignment types).
	 5.	 Change its leader character by selecting one of the possible four 
options in the Leader area.
	 6.	 VERY IMPORTANT: click Set to redefine the Tab stop before 
closing the Tabs dialog box.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

47
Repeat steps 3 to 5 for every other Tab stop you want to change and then close the 
Tabs dialog box to apply the desired format to the selected paragraphs.
Attention  You can easily show the Tabs dialog box by double-clicking any 
tabulation mark on the ruler.
To remove a Tab stop from the selected paragraphs, click the desired Tab stop and 
drag it out from the ruler to the document area, or double-click it to show the Tabs 
dialog, select it from the list and click Clear to remove it.
Figure 2-37 shows what happened after these operations had been applied to the 
decimal Tab stop defined at 4 inches in Figures 1.29 and 1.30. Note that now leading dots 
fill the space created by the decimal Tab stop automatically created by the Tab stop. And 
if you drag the Tab stop with leading dots to the right, all selected paragraphs that have it 
will be affected, adding or removing leading dots to the new specified position.
Figure 2-37.  Double-click any Tab stop to invoke the Tabs dialog box, where 
you can select any of the Tab stops on the list and change its alignment or leader 
character. Don’t forget to press the Set button to define each Tab stop property 
before closing the Tabs dialog box.

Text Flow
Programmers call text “a string” because its successive character sequence resembles a 
long string of letters. With this thought in mind, it is quite obvious that whenever more 
text is inserted or deleted at any text position of a Microsoft Word document, this text 
string will grow or shrink. Text inserted or deleted at the beginning or at the middle of 
the document’s text string will displace the remaining text toward the string end.
For example, how many times have you caught yourself typing many Enter keys at 
the end of a page just to reach the beginning of the next page?
As you may be wondering now, this kind of action inserts many hidden ¶ characters 
into the text, leading to an undesirable consequence on the document: the remaining 
text will reflow down under, eventually sending these sequences of empty paragraphs to 
the beginning of another page. Figure 2-38 shows a diagram of what happens to the text 
in such occasions.
Figure 2-38.  Typical text flow produced by many Enter keys pressed to get a new 
page. Note that when a new paragraph was added to the first page, the Enter 
keys were displaced to the second page, inserting three empty lines of text at the 
beginning of the next page.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

49
Page Breaks
From now on, every time you want to reach a new page in any document, insert a Page 
break by pressing Ctrl+Enter. Microsoft Word will insert a hidden Page Break character 
that can be seen by checking the Show/Hide option of the Home tab of the Ribbon. It 
will be represented as a dashed line where you can read “Page break” to indicate each 
Ctrl+Enter typed.
If you type some text before the page break character, the remaining text will reflow 
until the page break pass to the other page (Figure 2-39).
Watch the Status Bar
Many people may inadvertently insert one or more Ctrl+Enter characters in the text, 
inserting many white space pages that seems coming from nowhere…
Keep an eye on Word Status bar to see how many pages the document already has. 
Figure 2-40 shows a three-page document with the Show/Hide option checked, allowing 
you to see two page breaks that generate a three-page document. Word status bar shows 
Page 3 of 3 because the text insertion cursor is at page 3.
Figure 2-39.  Press Ctrl+Enter to insert a page break, forcing Microsoft Word to create 
another page in the document. All remaining text will reflow to the new page(s). 
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

50
Controlling the Text Flow with Paragraph Attributes
Besides control-specific attributes that impact each paragraph appearance, Microsoft 
Word and most text processors also offer different options to define another very 
important task: controlling the way text flows along the document pages.
Typographically speaking, it is considered a typographical error whenever text flows 
through two consecutive pages and
	 1.	 only the first line of the last page’s paragraph appears at the 
bottom of the page, continuing printing at the top of the next page: 
this lone row at the end of a page is called an orphan row; or
	 2.	 only the last line of the last page’s paragraph appears at the top of 
the next page: this lone row at the beginning of the page is called a 
widow row); or
	 3.	 any title section paragraph prints alone at the bottom of the page, 
while the first section paragraph prints alone at the top of the next 
page; or
	 4.	 a chapter title paragraph does not begin on a new page. It is misplaced 
printed in the middle of the last precedent chapter page.
Figure 2-41 visually explains when these typographic errors may happen whenever the 
text flows through the document pages. Microsoft Word controls how text flows between 
Figure 2-40.  Microsoft Word showing a three-page document as indicated by 
the status bar (cursor at page 3). Note that it has two Page Break characters 
(Control+Enter) inserted at text beginning, which creates two empty pages.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

51
document pages to avoid such errors using the Lines and Page Breaks tab of the Paragraph 
dialog box (Figure 2-42), which offers these text flow controls. They are as follows:
•	
Widow/Orphan control: to avoid the occurrence of the first two 
situations pictured in Figure 2-40.
•	
Keep with next: to avoid the occurrence of the third situation 
pictured in Figure 2-40 (section title not printed on the same page of 
its first paragraph).
•	
Keep lines together: to avoid that any paragraph suffers a break in 
the lines between page breaks (normally used in special situations 
like contract clauses, bibliographic references, etc., when the 
paragraph text must be printed on the same page).
•	
Page break before: to avoid the occurrence of the fourth situation 
pictured in Figure 2-40 (chapter title not printed on a new page).
Figure 2-41.  Common typographic text flow errors that may arise in incorrectly 
formatted text documents, when the text flows between two consecutive pages 
(note the page numbers).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

52
Figure 2-42.  The Line and Page Breaks tab of the Paragraph dialog box offers 
text flow controls to avoid the appearance of widow and orphan rows, and to 
guarantee that certain paragraphs will begin on a new printed page
Attention  There is some disagreement about the definitions of widow and 
orphan: what one source calls a widow another calls an orphan. The explanation 
given so far is the most prevalent on the Internet and I will follow it. Since 
Microsoft Word has a single command to control both Widow and Orphan rows at 
once, for the sake of this book this discussion doesn’t really matter!
If you understood how these options work, you may now perfectly understand why 
it is so important to avoid pressing two or more successive Enter keys to separate two 
consecutive text paragraphs. By using just one Enter you can surely trust that Microsoft 
Word will perfectly control the text flow of the entire document whenever you insert 
more text in any part of it. Otherwise, it will try to control empty text paragraphs inserted 
by many consecutive hidden ¶ characters, and the text flow will always be a mess…
Attention  You will see how to implement this text flow rules in Chapter 4.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

53
Line Numbers and Hyphenation
Line numbers are mostly used in contracts, script, code documentation, and some 
English tests to allow precise references to specific lines of text (text boxes, figures, and 
tables are counted as a single line).
Hyphenation is a Microsoft Word resource that can automatically hyphenate words 
when they fall in the hyphenation zone (the right page or column margin). It is typically 
used in Justify aligned text or columnated text to avoid the extra spaces inserted by 
justification.
Both Line Numbers and Hyphenation commands can be found in the Page Setup 
area of the Layout tab of the Ribbon and are very easy to implement.
The Suppress line numbers and Don’t hyphenate options found in the Formatting 
exceptions area of the Line and Page Breaks tab of the Paragraph dialog box can be 
checked to avoid that such formation is applied to the selected paragraphs.
Borders and Shading
Typographers refer to lines that separate paragraphs as rules, and borders all around 
them as boxes. Microsoft Word calls them borders. Such formatting resources can be 
associated to a background color to detach the entire paragraph, to call the reader’s 
attention to important things in the text (like the Attention notes you see everywhere in 
this book). They can be applied to pages, paragraphs, and tables.
Before applying a border to a paragraph, verify if there is a need to use it in this 
specific paragraph: don’t forget that you can use paragraph spacing and indentation to 
do the job.
Microsoft Word allows you to add borders to the selected paragraph(s) using the 
Shading and Border controls found in the Paragraph area of the Home tab of the Ribbon 
or using the Page Border command found in the Page Background area in the Design 
tab of the Ribbon. Both commands may display the traditional Borders and Shading 
dialog box, which allow adding borders and shading to the entire page (using the default 
selected Page Border tab) or to just the selected paragraphs (using the Borders tab, 
Figure 2-43).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

54
Figure 2-43.  Use the Page Borders command found in the Design tab to show the 
Borders and Shading dialog box, from where you can add different borders and 
shading to text paragraphs.
Attention  The Borders and Shading dialog box opens with the Page Border tab 
selected by default, which is quite similar to the Borders tab. If you do not select 
the Border tab, the borders will be added to the page, instead of the paragraph.
To add a paragraph border, you must first select the Borders tab and then use one of 
these two methods:
•	
Use the Setting area at left of the Borders tab to define which type 
of border must be added to the selected text paragraphs. You can 
remove all borders (by selecting None) or add a simple box (all four 
borders are identical), a shadow, or a 3D border.
•	
Select the style, color, and width combo box to define the desired 
border appearance.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

55
Figure 2-44.  Use the Borders tab to define the border style, color, and width, and 
click the Style area to which border will receive it. Use the Shading tab to define the 
Fill color used in the paragraph background.
Using the Shading tab, select a Fill color to be used as the paragraph background 
color (or define a pattern).
To add borders and shading to any paragraph, follow these instructions:
	 1.	 Click the desired paragraph (or select them), show the Borders 
and Shading dialog box, and click Borders tab.
	 2.	 Define the border style, color, and width and click the Preview 
area at the top and bottom borders (or its associated buttons at the 
left of the paragraph preview).
	 3.	 Click the Shading tab and select the desired Fill color (I selected 
“White, Background 1, Darker 15%”).
	 4.	 Press OK to close the dialog box and apply the desired border 
(Figure 2-44).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

56
Figure 2-45 shows a simple text paragraph that received the borders and shading 
defined by Figure 2-44, and that can be also set or confirmed using the Border and 
Shading controls of the Home tab of the Ribbon: black straight lines of 1/2 pt width in the 
top and bottom borders, with a White, Background 1, Darker 15% fill.
Figure 2-45.  Borders (top and bottom) and shading Gray 15%) applied to a single 
paragraph using the Border and Shading tools of the Paragraph area of the Home 
tab on the Ribbon (or with the Page Border command found in the Design tab of 
the Ribbon)
Figure 2-46 shows what happens when two Enter keys were pressed: inheritance 
copied all paragraph formatting to the new ones, but now the top and bottom borders 
were added to just the first and last paragraphs in the sequence, respectively.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

57
Figure 2-47 shows what happens when the intermediate paragraph of Figure 2-46 
has its Left indent control of the ruler dragged to 0.5 inches: now that each paragraph has 
a different layout, Microsoft Word applies top and bottom borders to each one, although 
they all share the same background color.
Figure 2-46.  Borders and shading inheritance keep the top and bottom borders 
just on the first and last paragraphs of the sequence, respectively
Figure 2-47.  If any paragraph inside a sequence of borders and shading 
formatting changes its left or right indentation margins, it breaks the inheritance 
and all different paragraphs receive their own borders.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

58
You must never make rules and borders using old typewriter habits that employ 
repeated typographic characters, like punctuation, hyphens, dashes, or math symbols: 
instead use Border and Shading dialog box or the Shading and Border controls of the 
Home tab of the Ribbon, being aware of the following:
•	
these paragraphs really need this typographic resource (try 
paragraph spacing and/or indentation first).
•	
use thin borders between half a point and one point size. Take into 
account that thinner borders may be too fine to reproduce well in an 
office printer or computer screen.
•	
avoid using thicker borders because they are counterproductive, 
creating noise that may diminish the attention to the information 
inside. Think that your reader needs to see the data, not the lines 
around it.
•	
solid borders work best; dots, dashes, or double lines are 
unnecessarily complicated.
Figure 2-48 shows the same data formatted using different amounts of borders: they 
share the same tabulation marks to align the text (but the first table also uses Vertical 
tabulation marks to draw its vertical lines). Their data are presented side-by-side with 
and without it hidden characters so you can appreciate how the Tab character can be 
efficiently used.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

59
Look at the ruler and note that the first table, created using tab characters, has also 
Vertical tabulation marks to generate its vertical lines. The second table doesn’t have 
the top and bottom borders or the vertical lines; the last table has just a bottom border 
behind its first row and top border above its last row (the total row).
Which one seems best formatted to you? I think that you might now understand that 
sometimes less formatting may give a better finish!
Attention  These tabulated data can also be easily produced using Microsoft 
Word Tables, which will be discussed in Chapter 5.
Figure 2-48.  The same data formatted with the aid of Tabulation marks and Tab 
characters using different amounts of borders. The left version shows the hidden 
characters; the right version hides them. All but the first table share the same 
Tabulation characters (the first table also has Vertical tabulation to generate its 
vertical lines). Which is the best?
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

60
Bullets and Numbering
The Bullets and Numbering tools you find in the Paragraph area of the Home tab of the 
Ribbon (see Figure 2-7) deserve an independent section because they tend to work as 
Microsoft Word thinks is right. They must be used to draw the reader’s eye to important 
information the text must convey, making it easier to find and read.
Whenever you have a list of issues that demand special attention, grant it using a 
bulleted or numbered list:
•	
Use a bulleted list in less formal writing, where the items’ order 
doesn’t matter.
•	
Use a numbered list when the sequence of reading is important, such 
as describing steps, instructions, or event rules to be followed.
•	
Try to make bullet and numbered list paragraphs as small as possible. 
Three lines is a reasonable max length.
•	
Be consistent in the way you use them throughout your document: 
use just one type of bullet or number format for the numbered lists in 
your document.
•	
When applying Bullets or Numbering tool to a set of paragraphs, try 
to use only up to the third level of numbering: more levels can add 
confusion for the reader.
Both the Bullets and Numbering tools creates hanging indents in the paragraphs 
where they are applied and require that you type at least one character so its format can 
be used and copied to the next paragraph by inheritance, whenever you press Enter. 
Otherwise, an empty standard paragraph will be created.
Changing Bullets and Numbering Levels
Bullets and Numberings can have different levels, which can be created by pressing the 
Tab key at the beginning of a level do demote it, or Shift+Tab on any sublevel bullet to 
promote it.
Figure 2-49 shows a simple paragraph created using the Bullets tool, which received 
the first bullet level. After the Enter key is pressed, inheritance takes care to create 
another bulleted paragraph of the same level. When the Tab key is pressed at the 
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

61
beginning of this new paragraph, the new paragraph is demoted to the second bullet 
level, which is also inherited by the next paragraph when Enter is pressed. Keep pressing 
Enter and Tab to see different bullet levels appear in your document, each one indented 
to the level immediately above it (press Shift+Tab at the beginning of any sublevel 
bulleted paragraph to promote it to the level immediately above it).
Figure 2-49.  Create different bullet levels by pressing Tab (to demote) and 
Shift+Tab (to promote) at left of the first bullet paragraph character, or use  
the Decrease indent or Increase indent controls.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

62
Attention  Instead of pressing Tab or Shift+Tab at the first character of a bulleted 
paragraph, you can also use the Decrease indent or Increase indent controls of the 
Paragraph area of the Home tab of the Ribbon to demote and promote the bullet 
level (these controls don’t require that you put the cursor at the first character 
paragraph: just click it anyway and use them to produce the desired result).
Microsoft PowerPoint bullet lists work the same way.
You may note in Figure 2-49 that the second- and third-level bullets use about a  
0.25 units indentation from its predecessor level’s first character. If you want to make 
them perfectly aligned to the first letter of the precedent level, drag its Left indent control 
in the ruler (the small square below the ruler scale) to the left until the desired position is 
achieved (or remove 0.25 units from the Left Indent control of the Layout tab of the ruler, 
Figure 2-50).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

63
The same is true when you use the Numbering tool to create a numbered list: 
after you type anything in the first numbered paragraph and press Enter, its format is 
copied to the next paragraph by inheritance, and whenever you press the Tab key at 
the beginning of a numbered text paragraph, it changes its level and numbering system 
(Figure 2-51).
Figure 2-50.  Drag the Left indent of any second- or third-level bullet paragraph 
until it stays perfectly aligned to the first letter of the precedent level
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

64
Attention  The same rules used to demote and promote Bullet levels apply to 
numbered paragraphs.
Note however that the Multilevel list tool does a different indentation than the 
Numbering tool. The Numbering tool adds deep indentation for all its sublevels, while 
the Multilevel list doesn’t: it numbers the text paragraphs creating a perfect indent in 
its sublevels, where the number of the next level is perfectly positioned to the hanging 
indent alignment of the level that precedes it (Figure 2-52).
Figure 2-51.  The Numbering tool also allowscreation of a multilevel numbering 
system by pressing Tab to demote the paragraph number (or Shift+Tab to promote 
it). Each numbered paragraph has a deep indentation relative to its precedent 
level, using a hanging indent format.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

65
Attention  Although we can select the Multilevel list tool to apply a different type 
of paragraph numbering, it does not remain selected in the paragraphs that has 
received its formatting options: Microsoft Word keeps showing the Numbering tool 
selected instead.
The Multilevel list tool also offers different types of numbering system that can be 
selected by clicking its small arrow. To change any paragraphs already numbered by 
a different numbering system, just select the desired paragraphs and apply a different 
numeration to them (Figure 2-53).
Figure 2-52.  The Multilevel list tool creates a perfect indentation between different 
levels of numbering (also achieved by pressing Tab at the beginning of a numbered 
paragraph). It does not add a Left indentation to the first-level paragraph (it is 
perfectly aligned to the page margin).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

66
Changing Paragraph Numbers
In my practice of producing long text documents using Microsoft Word (like this book 
you are reading), both the Numbering and Multilevel list tools may inadvertently 
change the first number of some spaced numbered paragraphs in the document: an 
automatically numbered paragraph that must begin on 1 subtly follows the next number 
of the last numbered paragraph, well above it in the text, even though it has many other 
text paragraphs in between them.
Other times the number system restarts when it shouldn’t: I just need that it 
continues to numerate from the last numbered paragraph (which is especially true in 
some “follow the next instructions” lists).
To force Microsoft Word to restart to numbering the paragraphs the way you want:
•	
Click the Numbering tool and select Set Numbering value… 
command; or
•	
Right-click the first numbered paragraph and the context menu that 
appears select Set Numbering value… command
Figure 2-53.  Use the Multilevel list tool to choose another numbering system to 
any number of selected paragraphs, according to the indentation paragraph levels.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

67
Both options will bring the Set Numbering Value dialog box (Figure 2-54), which will 
allow to select one of the following.
•	
Start a new list: which will restart paragraph numbering from 1;
•	
Continue from previous list: which will give to the selected 
paragraph the next number used in the last numbered paragraph 
above (at any point of the document);
•	
Set value to: which allows you to indicate which number must be 
used to number the selected paragraph.
Figure 2-54.  Right-click any autonumbered paragraph and choose Set Numbering 
value to restart its numeration from any value. All paragraphs that follow will be 
renumbered until Word’s find another restarting point.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

68
Attention  Whenever you change the autonumber applied to a paragraph in a 
Microsoft Word document, each paragraph that follows it will automatically change 
its number to the next used in the sequence, until it finds a paragraph which is set 
to restart numbering from 1.
Although the Numbering tool and Multilevel list tools seem the same, they aren’t: 
Microsoft Word will continue from previous list from the last numbered item 
applied to the Numbering or Multilevel list tool (each tool holds its own number 
system sequence).
There may be such moments that you don’t want to let Microsoft Word take care 
of the numbering system applied to the paragraphs you type. Figure 2-55 shows that 
if you want to type “A)” to start a new paragraph, whenever you type a space character 
before the parenthesis Microsoft Word will automatically change it to an autonumbered 
paragraph that begins with an indented A) that you cannot edit anymore. By pressing 
Enter, the next paragraph will be B).
Figure 2-55.  To undo any Microsoft Word Autocorrect action (like change any 
paragraph number system to an autonumbered paragraph), press Ctrl+Z, or click 
the Autocorrect icon and disable this feature
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

69
If you want to disable such behavior you can do one of the following:
•	
press Ctrl+Z to undo the last Autocorrect operation (by pressing 
Enter, the next paragraph will be a blank one).
•	
uncheck the Automatic numbered lists option found in the 
AutoFormat As You Type tab of the Autocorrect dialog box (found by 
clicking the “File ➤ Options ➤ Proofing ➤ Autocorrect options…” 
button of the Word Options dialog box, Figure 2-56).
Figure 2-56.  Use the Automatic bulleted lists and Automatic numbered list of 
the AutoCorrect dialog box to control whether Microsoft Word will automatically 
create bullets and numberings as you type some special characters at the beginning 
of a new paragraph
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

70
•	
click the Autocorrect icon that appears at the left of the paragraph 
and choose one of the following options:
•	
Undo Automatic Numbering: disable the last autonumbering 
applied (same as pressing Ctrl+Z).
•	
Stop Automatically Creating Numbered Lists: uncheck the 
Automatic numbered lists option in the Autocorrect dialog box.
•	
Control AutoFormat Options: show the AutoCorrect dialog box.
Choosing Which Hidden Characters to Show
This chapter (including most of its figures) indicates that it may be important to show 
Microsoft Word’s hidden characters in the text so you can control whether to use them or 
not as you type or edit text, by checking the Show/Hide control of the Paragraph section 
of the Home tab of the Ribbon.
Instead of showing each possible hidden character (like the space bar “·” characters 
that pollute how your document text is viewed in Microsoft Word interface), you may 
choose what hidden characters must be permanently shown in your Microsoft Word copy:
	 1.	 click File ➤ Options ➤ Display
	 2.	 Use the Always show these formatting marks on the screen area 
to check which hidden characters you want to be permanently 
visible.
In my Microsoft Word copy I always check the Tab characters and Paragraph marks 
(the Object anchors option is checked by default), so I can always view where a Tab →, 
an Enter ¶, or a Shift+Enter ↲ were pressed in the text and fix it as necessary (Figure 2-­57), 
whether or not I selected the Show/Hide control of the Paragraph section of the Home 
tab of the Ribbon.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

71
The options that your Word copy must always show is now a matter of taste.
Attention  Throughout these many years I have helped many different people 
(friends, teachers, students, writers…) to fix their Microsoft Word documents. 
Everyone that I helped, when viewing the document in my Microsoft Word 
interface, become frightened by the appearance of the pilcrow ¶ character after 
each Enter they pressed in the document. They immediately said: “What are those 
symbols in my document?”
You may feel strange at the beginning when they are always turned on, but in 
the long run, they may become absolutely necessary to take control of any Word 
document.
If you disable the Automatic numbered lists option, Microsoft Word will permanently 
stop using it in all other documents until the option is checked again.
Figure 2-57.  The Microsoft Word Options dialog box offers for its Display settings 
the possibility of choosing which hidden characters may be permanently shown in 
your documents. I suggest checking Tab characters and Paragraph marks.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

72
Copying Paragraph Formatting Attributes
Now that you know that each paragraph may have many different formatting options 
(alignment, line spacing, spacing, and indentation, to mention just a few…), it is 
interesting that you can copy the paragraph formatting options you want and paste them 
into other paragraphs by using two different methods:
•	
Use the ¶ character to copy just paragraph formatting (no Font 
properties are copied).
•	
use the Format Painter tool to copy and paste all paragraph 
formatting (including all its Font properties).
Copying Just Paragraph Formatting (No Font Properties)
If you want to copy just Paragraph dialog box options (plus Borders and Shading, Bullets 
and Numbering), use the ¶ character to convey this formatting information by following 
these steps:
	 1.	 Check the Show/Hide control in the Paragraph area of the Home 
tab of the Ribbon.
	 2.	 Select just the ¶ character from the paragraph that has the 
information you want to copy and press Ctrl+C to copy it to 
Clipboard (optionally, you can right-click and choose Copy, or 
click the Copy control in the Clipboard area of the Home tab).
	 3.	 Select just the ¶ character in the destination paragraph (the one  
to be formatted) and press Ctrl+V to paste (optionally, you can 
right-click and choose Paste, or click the Paste control in the 
Clipboard area of the Home tab).
Figure 2-58 show these operations in action, to copy just the Paragraph formatting 
(Alignment, Line spacing, Spaces, Indentation, Borders and Shading) from a source to 
a destination paragraph. Note that the paragraph destination does not change its Font 
properties.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

73
Figure 2-58.  Use Clipboard to copy all paragraph formatting options between 
two paragraphs: select the pilcrow character of the source paragraph and press 
Ctrl+C to copy it; select the pilcrow character of the destination paragraph and 
press Ctrl+V to paste. No Font properties are copied using this method.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

74
Copying All Paragraph Formatting (Including Font 
Properties)
To copy all paragraph formatting, including Font properties, use the Format Painter tool 
you find in the Clipboard area in the Home tab of the Ribbon:
	 1.	 Drag the mouse to select the entire paragraph text, including its ¶ 
hidden character.
	 2.	 Click the Format Painter tool to copy.
	 3.	 Drag the mouse over the text you want to format (Figure 2-59).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

75
Figure 2-59.  Use the Format Painter tool to copy and paste all paragraph 
formatting: select the entire text of the the source paragraph (triple-click it, or drag 
the mouse to include its ¶ hidden character), click the Format Painter tool to copy, 
and drag the mouse over the destination paragraphs to paste.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

76
Attention  Triple-click any paragraph to easily select it (including its hidden ¶ 
character, even if it is not visible). Then, press Ctrl+Shift+C to copy all its formatting 
options, select the destination paragraphs, and press Ctrl+Shift+V to paste it.
If you do not select the ¶ hidden character, you will copy just Font formatting: no 
paragraph formatting will be copied.
Double-click the Format Painter tool to lock it and paste the paragraph format to 
noncontiguous paragraphs. Press Esc or click it again to unlock it.
Note in Figure 2-59 that if the Font formatting options of the first character 
selected will be used by the Format Painter tool to format the destination 
paragraphs (just the first “This” word in the source paragraph used bold, while all 
the text of destination paragraphs were formatted in bold).
Searching and Replacing Hidden Characters
Since many people use the Enter and Tab keys incorrectly, and since some text copied from 
web sites can show many Shift+Enter keys (Manual line breaks) to break paragraph lines 
when pasted in Microsoft Word documents, it is good to know that you can use Microsoft 
Word Search and Replace commands to search for these characters in a document and 
sometimes take action, like changing some of them to more appropriate ones.
This kind of search can be made by selecting the Find ➤ Advanced Find… command 
in the Editing area at the right of the Home tab of the Ribbon, which shows Word’s Find 
and Replace dialog box with its Find tab selected by default.
Attention  The Find and Replace dialog box has three tabs: Find, Replace, and 
Go To. You can also show it using a single click by selecting the Replace command 
that is also found in the Editing area of the Home tab of the Ribbon.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

77
Click the More>> button of Find and Replace dialog box to expand it, check that the 
cursor is inside the Find what text box, and then click the Special button at its bottom to 
show the special Find what options it offers for searching (Figure 2-60).
Figure 2-60.  This is the expanded view of Word’s Find and Replace dialog box, 
from where you can select some special characters to search inside any document
Attention  The Special Find and Replace list options also change for both the Find 
what and Replace with check boxes when the Use wildcards option is checked 
(Figure 2-61). Its uses will be seen in the “Making Wildcard Searches” section of 
Chapter 4).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

78
To make a conventional Find operation for hidden characters, the Special options 
that we are interested so far are as follows:
•	
Paragraph Mark: the hidden ¶ character that is inserted when an 
Enter key is pressed.
•	
Tab Character: the → hidden character (right arrow) that is inserted 
when a Tab key is pressed.
•	
Manual Line Break: the ↲ hidden character that is inserted when 
Shift+Enter keys are pressed.
•	
Manual Page Break: the hidden dashed line with “Page Break” in the 
middle that is inserted when Ctrl+Enter keys are pressed.
•	
White Space: the vertical center aligned dot “·” hidden character, 
which represents an empty space that is inserted when the Space key 
is pressed.
Figure 2-61.  The Replace with Special list of options is different from the Find 
what list
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

79
Attention  Do not confuse the Paragraph Mark and ¶ Paragraph Character 
options: the first means the hidden character inserted by Microsoft Word to indicate 
that an Enter key was pressed; the second is the real pilcrow ¶ character inserted 
by the user in some legal documents by using Microsoft Word Symbol command 
(which is commented on in Chapter 3).
These Special search options are translated into a sequence of two characters 
(character case counts) where the first is always a caret ^. Table 2-1 shows all of them.

Let us see how can we take advantage of using such hidden characters in a search 
and replace operation to fix a messy text document produced with Microsoft Word.
Exercise
Extract “The Last of the Mohicans, Introduction and Chapter1.docx” file from Chapter02.
zip and open it in your Microsoft Word copy. This is a small, eight-page document that 
has just the Introduction and Chapter 1 of the famous book The Last of the Mohicans by 
James Fenimore Cooper published in 1840.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

80
Attention  This document was prepared by me to resemble some Microsoft Word 
documents which I had already received and that bring confusion to anyone who 
tries to fix them without a deep understanding of what is really going on inside the 
text. I did not really find it as it is presented: it was purposely produced to be used 
as a didactic example.
When you open it for the first time in a typical Microsoft Word environment, it must 
seem quite well formatted, as shown in Figure 2-62, which shows its title, author credit, 
Introduction section title, and three of its first text paragraphs.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

81
Figure 2-62.  This is the appearance of “The Last of the Mohicans, Introduction 
and Chapter1.docx” file, which can be extracted from Chapter02.zip, when opened 
in a regular Microsoft Word interface. It seem to be a nice text document, but it 
isn’t…
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

82
But when you click the Show/Hide control of the Paragraph area in the Home tab of 
the Ribbon, you will notice that it has a lot of trash inside it (Figure 2-63), including the 
following:
•	
useless sequences of spaces in many paragraphs at the first and last 
document page;
•	
useless sequences of Tab characters and spaces to displace the 
book title and author name in two different text lines to give then an 
apparently Center alignment;
•	
the “Introduction” (at page 1) and “Chapter 1” (at page 4) section 
titles also use sequences of spaces and Tab characters to give them an 
apparently Center alignment;
•	
each paragraph begins with a six-space sequence to create a First line 
indentation;
•	
an empty paragraph is inserted between two text paragraphs to 
create empty space between then;
•	
each paragraph line ends with a Manual Line Break character, which 
will prevent the text from correctly flowing if the page size is changed;
•	
each phrase inside a paragraph begins with three space characters to 
detach it from the precedent phrase;
•	
scroll the text to page 3 and note that there is an enormous sequence 
of Enter keys pressed in the last Introduction paragraph to reach 
the next page where Chapter 1 begins, and that it also makes use 
of spaces and Tab characters to give it an appearance of Center 
alignment.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

83
Figure 2-63.  This is the appearance of “The Last of the Mohicans, Introduction 
and Chapter1.docx” file when the Show/Hide tool is checked, revealing the 
trash inadvertently inserted into the text: sequences of spaces and Tab charaters, 
text lines ending with Manual Line Breaks, two Enter characters to separate 
paragraphs, and many other additions…
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

84
If we consider that the entire book could be formatted this way, one can imagine the 
work that must be made to fix such a mess by hand, one-by-one…
Fortunately, we can easily fix the document by using a simple five-step search and 
replace operation with the aid of the Search and Replace dialog box and its Special 
button. We will need to
	 1.	 Change any Tab character to a space;
	 2.	 Change any Manual Line Break to a space character;
	 3.	 Change any two-space sequence to just one space character;
	 4.	 Remove the remaining spaces that may still exist as the first 
character at the beginning of any paragraph.
	 5.	 Change any two Enter characters to one;
Let us do them all (follow the exercise on your computer so you can appreciate  
the result)!
Attention  This kind of task must have a specific order to be accomplished faster. 
Although you can make it in any other, you may need to repeat some tasks to get 
the same final result.
Removing Tab Characters
Unless the document has some tables or another use for Tab characters, it is safe to 
remove all of them, which is the case of the example. Each Tab character must be 
changed to a space or nothing (absence of character). To remove them all by changing 
them to nothing, do a Replace command with the following steps:
	 1.	 select the Find what option and type a ^t (or select the Special ➤ 
Tab Character option);
	 2.	 leave the Replace with option empty;
	 3.	 click the Replace all button and watch Microsoft Word replace 37 
occurrences of Tab characters with nothing, effectively removing 
them from the text (Figure 2-64).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

85
Removing Manual Line Break Characters
All manual line break characters must be changed by a Space character, or the last word 
at the end of a line will glue to the first word of the next line. To change them all, do 
another Replace command with the following steps:
	 1.	 select and clean the Find what option, then type a ^l (or select 
Special ➤ Manual Line Break option).
	 2.	 in the Replace with option, type a Space character (optionally, 
type ^w or select the Special ➤ White space option).
	 3.	 click the Replace all button; Microsoft Word must replace 306 
occurrences of Manual Line Break characters with a Space 
character, effectively fixing the text flow whenever the page size or 
its margins are changed (Figure 2-65).
Figure 2-64.  This figure shows how to use the Search and Replace dialog box 
remove any Tab character (represented by the ^t sequence in the Find What text 
box) from the text (represented by the empty Replace with option).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

86
Changing Two Successive Space Characters to Just One
Now is time to search for any two successive space characters and change them to just 
one. Since there is a lot of successive space characters, this operation must be repeated 
until no two space characters are found:
	 1.	 Select and clean the Find what option and type two successive 
space characters (optionally, you can type ^w^w or select the 
Special ➤ White space option twice).
	 2.	 Select and clean the Replace with option and type a single space 
character (optionally, type ^w or select the Special ➤ White space 
option).
	 3.	 Click the Replace all button and watch Microsoft Word make 
699 replacements in its first pass through the text to change two 
successive spaces to just one space character (Figure 2-66).
Figure 2-65.  This figure shows how to use the Search and Replace dialog box to 
replace any Manual Line Break character (represented by the ^l sequence in the 
Find What text box) with an empty space (represented by a space at the left of the 
cursor inside the Replace with option - we could also use ^w to represent the space 
character).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

87
	 4.	 Close the first warning message of 699 replacements and click the 
Replace all button again. This second Replace all operation will 
make 183 replacements.
	 5.	 Repeat step 4 successively, while Microsoft Word makes 105, 34, 
17, 8, 2, and at last 0 replacements, as an indication that there are 
no more occurrences of two successive space characters in the 
document (Figure 2-67).
Figure 2-66.  This figure shows how to use the Search and Replace dialog box to 
replace two successive space characters with just one (you may use Find What 
=^w^w and Replace =^w instead). The Replace All operation must be successively 
repeated until it returns “All done. We made 0 replacements.”
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

88
Remove the Space Character That Begins Any Paragraph
After changing two successive spaces by only one space, any paragraph that used a space 
character sequence to create the First Line indent effect will hold a single space at its 
beginning (and many may also have it at its end). So it is time to remove these lonely 
beginning spaces by searching for a paragraph character followed by a space character 
(`p ) and then replacing with just a paragraph character:
	 1.	 select and clean the Find what option, then type a “^p ” (without the 
quotes), or optionally type ^p^w, or successively select Special ➤ 
Paragraph Mark and Special ➤ White space options).
	 2.	 in the Replace with option and type ^p (or select the Special ➤ 
Paragraph Mark option).
Figure 2-67.  Press Replace all sucessively to make all replacement operations 
needed to replace each two sucessive space characters with just one, until there 
are no more to replace.
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

89
	 3.	 click the Replace all button; Microsoft Word must replace 67 
occurrences of a Paragraph character followed by a space with just 
a Paragraph character in its first pass through the text.
	 4.	 Repeat step 1 until there are no more occurrences of a Paragraph 
character followed by Space character (Figure 2-68).
Figure 2-68.  This figure shows how to use the Search and Replace dialog box 
replace a Paragraph Mark character followed by a space characer (^p ) with a 
single Paragraph Mark character (^p). You may also use ^p^w in the Find what 
option. The Replace All operation should be repeated until no Paragraph Mark 
character followed by a space characer be found in the document.
When this operation ends, the text must be now very clear from strange typing 
habits—just the first document paragraph will remain with a space character.
Changing Two Successive Enter Characters to Just One
The last operation is to replace two successive paragraph characters (^p^p) with just one 
paragraph character (^p) following these last instructions:
	 1.	 Select and clean the Find what option, then type a ^p^p (or select 
Special ➤ Paragraph Mark option twice).
	 2.	 Confirm that the Replace with has just a ^p (a single Special ➤ 
Paragraph Mark option).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

90
	 3.	 Click the Replace all button; Microsoft Word must replace 81 
occurrences of a Paragraph character followed by a space with just 
a Paragraph character in its first pass through the text (Figure 2-69).
Figure 2-69.  This last operation replaces two successive Paragraph Mark 
characters (represented by ^p^p) with a single Paragraph Mark in the text. The 
Replace all operation must be repeated until there are no two successive Paragraph 
Mark characters in the document.
	 4.	 Repeat step 3 until there are no more occurrences of a Paragraph 
character followed by Space character.
As you click Replace all, Microsoft Word will replace 23, 13, 7, 5, 4, and 3; my 
Microsoft Word copy keeps returning 3 occurrences forever, without any explanation 
(Figure 2-69).
When you finish these operations, the text will be quite clean, just needing to be 
better formatted by applying some of the paragraph attributes cited in this chapter 
(Figure 2-70).
Chapter 2  Hidden Characters, Inheritance, and Paragraph Formatting 

91
Figure 2-71 shows the first paragraphs of “The Last of the Mohicans, Introduction 
and Chapter1 Formatted.docx” file, which can be extracted from Chapter02.zip file. 
Titles were centralized and received Spacing Before and After = 50 pt. Body text received 
a First line indentation = 0.25. All paragraphs received Line spacing = 1. The document 
page was changed from Legal (8.5x14) to A4 (8.27x11.69). And it keeps flowing very well 
through the document pages.

Compare Figures 2-71, 2-70, and 2-63 and take your own conclusions. Quite cool, 
isn’t it?
Figure 2-71.  This is “The Last of the Mohicans, Introduction and Chapter1

title and author name received different font sizes, all title paragraphs received 
Space Before and After = 50, and all Body text received a First line indentation 
=0.25. Page size was changed to A4 so you can appreciate how the document text 
flows perfectly when is well formatted.

Summary
Microsoft Word uses four special hidden characters to control the paragraph formatting 
of documents when you press the Enter key to create a Paragraph Break, the Shift+Enter 
keys to create a Manual Line Break, the Tab key to insert a Tabulation Character, and the 
Ctrl+Enter keys to insert a Page Break. All of these hidden characters—and many other 
types of code inserted in the document—can be seen by checking the Show/Hide control 
found at the top right corner of the Paragraph area of the Home tab of the Ribbon.
Using paragraph attributes, you can set to each paragraph the text alignment, line 
spacing, spacing before and after, indentations, and special options to control the text 
flow between document pages.
All of these formatting options are automatically copied to the next paragraph 
when you press the Enter key using inheritance: the next always inherits the previous 
attributes.
Once you know about these hidden characters and how they impact text flow, you 
can use Microsoft Word Search and Replace Special features to find and change them to 
more appropriate characters, allowing the text processor to perfectly control how the text 
flows between document pages.
In this chapter, you learned the following:
•	
How Microsoft Word, like any other text processor, uses inheritance 
to transfer one paragraph formatting option to the next when you 
press the Enter key.
•	
How hidden characters are used to signal special text breaks, such as 
paragraph breaks, manual line breaks, and page breaks.
•	
How to control many different paragraph attributes using the 
Microsoft Word Paragraph dialog box.
•	
How to effectively use the Tab key associated with Microsoft Word 
ruler tabulation marks to perfectly align text in different paragraphs.
•	
How the tabulation marks of one paragraph are always inherited by 
the next when an Enter key is pressed.
•	
How to create perfectly formatted tables using the Tab key and 
tabulation marks.

CHAPTER 3
Character Attributes
Character attributes relate to precise typographic control of text formatting of the letters and 
words, and consequently to the whole appearance of the text paragraphs of your document.
It includes everything that may affect the appearance of the characters on the page, 
including the characters itself, the font selection and its attributes (like point size, bold, 
italic, underline, caps size, etc.), letter spacing and vertical displacement, kerning, and 
some other subtleties that may be seen in certain types of documents.
To really make the best use of Microsoft Word to format your documents by 
manipulating character attributes, it is necessary to understand some basic typographic 
knowledge and how Microsoft Windows allows them to be implemented using Fonts.
The documents used to generate some book figures and the ones sited on the Exercise 
section can be found by downloading Chapter03.zip file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
Typeface and Font Classification
Typographers historically refer to a Typeface as an entire family of fonts (like Arial) 
reserving the word Font to refer to a specific font type, size, and weight (like Arial, 12 pt, 
Bold): this distinction made sense in the letter­press age, when each font was physically 
associated with a drawer of metal type. Not any more: nowadays in the Computer Age, 
the word Font often means a whole family of styles of any size. So, whenever somebody 
talks about the Calibri font, he or she is talking about all the different styles in which it 
can be presented in a document.
There are many different font types and ways to categorize them. They can be 
associated with four main groups according to their appearance: serif, sans serif, script, 
and decorative.
Let us explore how these different font classifications can impact the appearance of 
your document.

96
Serif and Sans Serif Fonts
For those of you that have never heard about “serifs,” they are the tiny tails on the main 
strokes of the letters which are supposed to help to lead the eyes from left to right. 
Figure 3-1 shows two graphic representations of letter “A”: with serifs (using the Times 
New Roman font) and without serifs (using the Calibri font).
Attention  Many sans serif fonts are named receiving the “Sans” suffix, like 
“Comic Sans,” “Gil Sans,” “Lucida Sans,” and so on.
One of the secrets of creating good document appeal is to combine sans serif and 
serif fonts in a single document: one for the section titles and another for the body 
text. This strategy will be explored in the section “Combining Fonts” later in this 
chapter.
Script and Decorative Fonts
Script (or calligraphy) fonts tend to mimic some beautiful handwritten styles, commonly 
seen on marriage invites and certificates, while decorative fonts can have many different 
types and are used in advertising or to add a special feeling to some types of documents. 
Figure 3-2 shows two other graphic representations of the letter “A” using a script font 
(Kunstler Script) and a decorative font (Algerian).
Figure 3-1.  Representations of letter “A” using a font with serifs (Times New 
Roman) and without serifs (sans serif) (Calibri)
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

97
Symbol Fonts
Inside the decorative group, we may find Symbol fonts that offer symbols instead 
of letters, like Webdings, Wingdings, and so on. Figure 3-3  shows the graphic 
representation of letter “A” when using these three symbol fonts.
Attention  Use Microsoft Windows Character Map applet (found at Start button 
➤ All apps ➤ Windows Accessories ➤ Character Map) to select and copy to 
clipboard any character associated to a symbol font, like Wingdings.
Monospaced and Proportionally Spaced Fonts
Different letters need different amounts of horizontal space on a printed page. Take for 
example the Occidental alphabet letter “M” (the widest alphabet letter) and compare 
it to the Occidental alphabet letter “I” (the thinnest): they need different amounts of 
horizontal space on a printed page.
Figure 3-2.  Representations of letter “A” using an script font (Kunstler Script) and 
a decorative font (Algerian): both with serif!
Figure 3-3.  Representations of letter “A” using three symbol fonts: Webdings, 
Wingdings, and Wingdings2
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

98
Typographers refer to all fonts where each character occupies just the space it needs 
(with great difference between lowercase and uppercase letters) as proportionally 
spaced, while fonts in which each character occupies the same horizontal space  
(for both its uppercase or lowercase letters) are referred to as monospaced.
Most Microsoft Windows fonts are proportionally spaced (each letter occupies just 
the space it needs), but you will also find installed by default a serif monospaced font 
called Courier New.
Monospaced fonts are used only when there is a need to correctly position different 
rows of text in the same text column (like programming language editors do, or 
programming books use to print code that the reader must follow) or when you have a 
need to create an antique, typewriter-produced feeling for your text.
Take for example this paragraph. It was typed using the serif, monospaced 
Courier New font, and you can surely replace it with many other monospaced 
fonts available on the Internet, like American Typewriter, Consola, Love 
Letter Typewriter, Monaco, and so on. Note, however, that whenever a 
monospaced font is used, it may need many more printed pages than what is 
needed to print the same text using a proportional font.
Figure 3-4 shows the alphabet using three popular proportional fonts (the serif Times 
New Roman, and the sans serif Arial and Calibri) and one monospaced font (the serif 
Courier New), all set to a 14 pt size. Note that all four paragraphs have a Tab character 
after the Font name and a left tabulation mark at 1.75 inches on the ruler to guarantee 
that each alphabet begins exactly at the same horizontal page position. Also note that 
the monospaced font Courier New needs many more horizontal spaces to represent the 
same alphabet letters!
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

99
Font Technologies
There are three main font technologies, which emerged at three different moments in 
time. You may find all of them to download as font files:
•	
Adobe PostScript Type 1
•	
TrueType
•	
OpenType
The Adobe Postscript Type 1 font was the first digital font, developed in the early 1980s. 
It is based on Adobe’s PostScript printing technology, which is a programming language 
developed for high-resolution output, and has long been viewed as a reliable choice by 
professional designers, publishers, and printer manufacturers. Each postscript font consists 
of two different files: one to be seen on the screen and another to be sent to the printer 
(postscript printers expect to receive the postscript font instructions before printing).
The TrueType format was jointly developed by Apple and Microsoft about six years 
before the appearance of Adobe PostScript because both manufacturers early perceived 
that they needed to have its own font technology to not be controlled by an outside 
company (like Adobe), since it’s such a key issue. They contain both the screen and 
printer font data in a single file, which makes them easier to install, and they can be used 
on both PC and Macintosh computers.
Figure 3-4.  Different alphabets typed with two sans serif (Arial and Calibri) and 
one serif (Times New Roman) proportionally spaced fonts, compared to one serif 
monospaced font (Courier New). Note how the monospaced font on the last text 
row needs much more horizontal space to represent the entire alphabet.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

100
The OpenType format is the latest font technology to be introduced. It is a joint effort 
of Adobe and Microsoft, and like TrueType, contains both the screen and printer font 
data in a single file to make its installation easier. Besides being multiplatform (can be 
used on Apple, PC, and Linux), it has several exclusive capabilities, like storage of up to 
65,000 UNICODE characters, which provides the freedom to include special features 
such as small caps, old-style figures (figures is the typographic name for numerals), 
alternate characters, different alphabet types (like Chinese, Arabic, etc.), and other extras 
that previously needed to be distributed as separate fonts and special characters that can 
be explored by Microsoft Word 2016.
Knowing Which Font Types You Have Installed
It may be interesting to know which font types you have installed on your Windows 
system so you can eventually select them to take advantage of all formatting available 
in Microsoft Word 2016 (as you will see in the section “Using Character Attributes” later 
in this chapter). To install a new font on your system, you must show the Windows Font 
folder (Figure 3-5), using one of these two methods:
	 1.	 Click Start ➤ Control Panel ➤ Appearance and Personalization 
➤ Fonts, or
	 2.	 Open the Windows Explorer (click its icon on Windows taskbar or 
press Windows key+E), expand Computer ➤ Local disk (C:) ➤ 
Windows, and click the Font folder.
Attention  The Windows key is the one between the left Ctrl and Alt keys with the 
Microsoft symbol on it.

Figure 3-5 shows the default view for the Microsoft Windows Font folder.
In the Windows Font folder, you can list fonts installed by type following these 
instructions:
	 1.	 Click the View icon over the top right side of the Windows Font 
window and select the Details view.
	 2.	 Right-click the header column to show other column options and 
select Font Type in the context menu (Figure 3-6).

	 3.	 The Font Type column will be added as the last column header. 
You may eventually click the Font type header column and drag it 
to the left of the font name to be easier accessed.
	 4.	 Click Font Type header to classify fonts by type, or click the Font 
Type arrow and check the font type that must be shown by the 
Windows Font window (Figure 3-7).

System Fonts
System Fonts are the ones that everybody has installed by a default installation of 
Microsoft Windows and/or Microsoft Office suite. They are considered by typographers 
and professional designers as despicable, mainly because they are
	 1.	 optimized for screen readability and not for print.
	 2.	 overexposed in the sense that they are used all time in almost 
every Word document;
	 3.	 not very well made, lacking finishing details.
Yes, I am talking about Times New Roman and Arial, the most used fonts in  
the world.

Chapter 3  Character Attributes

104
I personally don’t dislike the combination or usage of Times New Roman/Arial fonts, 
but whenever you have the opportunity to get some professionally formatted text that 
feels like it has something like an undistinguished beauty, it is because it does not make 
use of system fonts: instead, it probably uses a professional set of serif/sans serif fonts.
So, if you want your documents to have a different feeling when others read them, 
you must rely on different serif and sans serif fonts, and the Internet is full of possibilities 
(see section the “How to Install Fonts” later in this chapter).
Attention  There are many fonts with very interesting path histories, like Times New 
Roman and Arial, which was the reasons for their selection as default system fonts for 
Microsoft Windows. Google it to find more information about this interesting issue.
Combining Fonts
To give a good impression, you must combine serif and sans serif fonts in the text, which 
is more a matter of taste than a science: something like combining colors, tie and shirt, 
purse and shoes… Anyway, there is an agreement that the use of a san serif font for 
chapter and section titles and a serif font for body text works better, mainly because it is 
supposed that the serifs helps the eye to follow the text.
As far as I know, all Microsoft Office documents that I have read used Arial in their 
chapter and title sections and Times New Roman in the body text. The idea is to create 
contrast to perfectly define when the paragraph is a title and when it is normal text  
(or body text).
Do some homework and try to find new fonts that may cause your documents to 
stand out from the crowd. Since there are a lot of different fonts to try, you must use 
simple rules to not overuse them in your document:
	 1.	 If possible, try to avoid the default Arial/Times New Roman 
combination: choose another pair of sans serif/serif fonts 
searching the Internet, and eventually buy some.
	 2.	 In text documents, try to use no more than three different fonts 
(one for chapter titles, one for section titles, and one for body text).
	 3.	 Never use script, fancy, or decorative fonts in your text 
documents: keep the simple serif/sans serif classical combination 
because… it is enough.

105
How to Install Fonts
There are thousands of Internet sites that offer free fonts for your usage. Note however 
that to have the best results you may need to buy some professional fonts. And once you 
have downloaded the desired font, you may receive an entire typeface font family (like 
the bold, italic, underline, and narrow variants) on a single zip file.
To install such fonts in Microsoft Windows, you must
	 1.	 Download the font (you may receive a compressed file that needs 
to be expanded to free the font files).
	 2.	 Select all downloaded font files and copy them to Clipboard (press 
Ctrl+C).
	 3.	 Navigate to the C:\Windows\Fonts folder. Microsoft Windows will 
change the folder appearance.
	 4.	 Right-click inside the C:\Windows\Fonts folder and select Paste to 
install the font.
Attention  You may need to close and open Microsoft Word so the installed fonts 
appear in the font list.
Using Special Characters
Special characters are those special symbols that don’t exist on your keyboard,  
like the © (copyright) and ™ (trademark) symbols, currency symbols (¢, £, ¥), 
typographic symbols (§, ¶, etc.) and many others that you may regularly use in text.
Special Text Characters
Microsoft Word allows the use of some special characters as you type your text. Table 3-1 
lists some of them.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

106
Attention  The Num - expression used in Table 3-1 means the “-” character 
found on the numeric keypad found at the right of any PC keyboard, not the hyphen 
found near the Backspace key.
A nonbreaking space (Ctrl+Shift+Space) has the same width of the space character 
typed with the spacebar, but it prevents the text from flowing to a new line or page.  
A nonbreaking hyphen is the same: it has the same width of a regular hyphen but doesn’t 
let the text flow from its position on one line to the next.
Use the nonbreaking space or the nonbreaking hyphen whenever two words (spaced 
or hyphenated like United States or Coca-Cola) or two successive punctuation characters 
(like the open and closing parenthesis after an Excel function name, like Sum()),, must 
not be broken at the end of a line: the entire expression must be always printed together 
on the same line.
About the size difference between the hyphen, en-dash, and em-dash, the hyphen is 
the shortest of them, and must be used to concatenate a compound word that represents 
two intimately related things, like fractions or ordinal numbers (three-quarters), to 
set words prefixed by ex-, self-, cross-, or all- (like ex-wife), and in numerous other 
situations.
Table 3-1.  Special Characters That You Can Type Inside a Microsoft Word 
Document
Character name
Shortcut
Usage
Nonbreaking space
Ctrl + Shift + Space
Avoid separation of two words by a line break
Nonbreaking hyphen
Ctrl + Shift + _
Avoid separation of two hyphenated words  
by a line break
En-dash –
Ctrl + Num -
Used to separate text instead of the default hyphen
Em-dash —
Ctrl + Alt + Num -
Used in a special way to indicate dialog
Optional hyphen
Ctrl + -
The hidden character that may break a word at the 
end of a line
Ellipsis …
Ctrl + Alt + .
The … ellipsis character must be used instead of 
three dots …
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

107
The em-dash normally has the width of capital letter H, approaching the size of three 
successive hyphens ---, while the en-dash is half of its size (approaching the size of two 
successive hyphens --).
Use the en-dash to connect two things that are related by a range in substitution of 
the typical from…to… construction, like page numbers (pages 97–123), a span between 
two years, months, or days (207-2017, January–June, 23-31), etc.
Use the em-dash whenever you want to insert a break between parts of a sentence, 
to signal a personal speech in romances, to indicate duplicate citations on the same 
paragraph, or to put a nice pause in text to simulate a natural conversation between 
people. It is normally used at the beginning or in the middle of dialogs, like the next text 
(it has been italicized to call it to your attention):
— As I was saying, bla, bla, bla.... and he continued talking endlessly until 
Sara stood up and went to her room: — What is wrong, Sara? You don't like 
my stories? …
Attention  Some people believe that the origin of the em-dash and en-dash lies 
within the typographic widths of capital letters M and N, respectively. But this isn’t 
so: the em-dash comes from the measure of the height of a piece of type used by 
a traditional metal font, while the en-dash always had half of its size. They were 
bigger in the past and in the Computer Age they became narrower.
Microsoft Word always changes single hyphens typed in the middle of a phrase to 
an en-dash character. In case it fails (and it sometimes does), type the Ctrl+Num - 
character.
The ellipsis is a single character that should be used in professionally formatted text 
instead of typing three successive dots. Since most of us have a strong addiction to typing 
three dots, use Microsoft Word Replace command to change three successive dots with 
the Ctrl+Alt+. character.
Symbols Command
Microsoft Word offers the Symbols dialog box (found in the Symbols area at the right 
border of the Insert tab of the Ribbon) to help you search and select the appropriate 
symbol you want to use in your document (Figure 3-8).
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

108
It is quite simple to use the Symbol dialog box:
•	
Select the desired font;
•	
In case it is an OpenType font, the Subset combo box appears to 
help you select specific subsets of characters inside the font (the list 
options may vary according to the font selected);
•	
Click the desired character and choose Insert (or press its associated 
shortcut key that appears at the bottom of the dialog box).
Attention  Use the Symbol dialog box to explore symbol fonts like Webdings, 
Wingdings, and so on.
The Symbol dialog box also offers the Special Character tab, from where you can 
select popular special characters and quickly insert them into your document – like the 
ones mentioned in Table 3-1 and shown in Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-8.  Use the Symbol dialog box to select any symbol that may exist in any 
font and insert it into your document
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

109
Optionally, you can also
•	
use AutoCorrect to associate a short name or nickname to the 
character so whenever you type it and press the space bar, Microsoft 
Word automatically changes it to the associated character  
(or character sequence). 
•	
associate a Shortcut key to a special character (shortcut keys must be 
prefixed by Ctrl, Shift, Alt, or any combination of these keys).
Using Character Attributes
Microsoft Word uses the Font area of the Home tab of the Ribbon to allow control 
character attributes for any amount of text (Figure 3-10). You can select the font type, 
size, and most attributes by a single click of the mouse on the appropriate control, or by 
calling the Font dialog box (Figure 3-11), which offers traditional controls to these and 
other character attributes.
Figure 3-9.  The Special Character tab of the Symbol dialog box offers shortcuts to 
popular special characters you may need to insert into the document

111
Attention  Click the Set as Default button of the Font dialog box to change the 
default font properties used by Microsoft Word to this and other new documents.
We will now explore each Font dialog control so you can make better use of them.
Font and Font Size
Now that you have a basic understanding about the different font types available in your 
Windows system, select the text first and use the Font combo box in the Font area of 
the Home tab of the Ribbon (Figure 3-10), or use the Font list box of the Font dialog box 
(Figure 3-11) to apply it to the selected font. Keep the text selected and use the Font size 
combo box to select the size.
Since Microsoft Word versions 2010, up to 2016, the default font selected is Calibri 
11 pt, a sans serif font that appeared as an alternative to Arial (which is still present as a 
system Font). And by your knowledge gathered so far about inheritance, you may already 
know that once a font is selected in a blank paragraph, inheritance will take care to use it 
until another font is selected.
The point size selected for a text document must follow simple rules:
•	
The most comfortable point size range for body text is between 10 pt 
and 12 pt.
•	
Not every font appears equally when selecting the same point  
size (for instance, Arial or Calibri 12 are bigger than Times New 
Roman 12 pt).
•	
You can type intermediate half-point sizes in the Font Size combo 
box (try 10.5, 11.5, 12.5 etc.).
•	
Use a bigger font for headings.
•	
Use up to 14 or 16 pt size for the highest-level headings. Then, 
diminish the point size for subheadings by 1 or 0.5 points. 
Considering that if the headings are formatted using a sans serif 
font like Calibri, while the body text uses a serif font (like Times New 
Roman) it is probably bigger than the body text of the document.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

112
•	
Use the Increase font size and Decrease font size controls of the Font 
area of the Home tab of the Ribbon to easily increase or decrease the 
selected text by one point up to 12 pt, and by two points above it  
(or their associated shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+> and Ctrl+Shift+<).
Font Color
Microsoft Word can change the text color of your documents by both using the Font 
color tool, found in the Font area of the Home tab of the Ribbon (Figure 3-10), or the 
Font Color option, found in the Font tab of the Font dialog box.
Although there are a lot of colors to choose from, be judicious when you need to 
apply colors by following some simple rules: 
•	
Always use black for the body text: it is the better reading color for 
large amounts of text.
•	
Use colors in special text paragraphs, like chapter or title sections, 
headers, footers, and footnotes.
•	
Use colors for special characters and effects, like bullets, numberings 
(color just the number), and borders.
•	
Use a small set of colors in text: two or three colors at maximum. Less 
is more!
•	
Try to use shades of one single color (changing brightness) than 
multiple color tones.
•	
Avoid the use of close values or complementary colors in text, 
because they tend to decrease the contrast.
•	
It is better to use light colors instead of dark ones. The human eye is 
more prone to perceive subtle differences in light colors than darker.
•	
Once colors have been chosen for specific text paragraphs, keep 
consistency in their application through your entire document.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

113
•	
Take a walk around the bookstore and study some colored books to 
get good ideas of how to use color in text.
•	
And never forget that a colored book is costlier to print than a  
black-­and-­white one.
Underline, Bold, and Italic
Underline, Bold, and Italic are text attributes used to highlight text that can be selected 
both in the Font area of the Home tab of the Ribbon (Figure 3-10) and in the Font style 
list box of the Font dialog box (Figure 3-11). Microsoft Word has simple shortcuts to Bold, 
Italic, and Underline:
•	
Press Ctrl+U to activate/deactivate Underline.
•	
Press Ctrl+B to activate/deactivate Bold.
•	
Press Ctrl+I to activate/deactivate Italic.
Underline
In typewriter days, text had no way to be highlighted using bold or italic: one had to 
go back and retype an underscore below the typed text to emphasize it. That is why 
Microsoft Word and every other text processor offer Underline as a text highlight option: 
it is a strange way to be linked to the past.
And if you look at the Microsoft Word Font area in the Home tab of the Ribbon, you 
will note that you have not just the U control to underline text, but may also have arrows 
to select different underline types and colors.
Although Microsoft Word offers so many ways to underline text, don’t do it. It’s is like 
using typewriter technology in computer times: use just Bold or Italic instead.
Bold and Italic
Bold and Italic are the preferred tools to give emphasis to the text, and are mutually 
exclusive: use one or another, never both. And since they are text properties, once you 
turn them on, they will be used on everything next to it due to character formatting 
inheritance!
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

114
Follow these simple rules to use Bold and Italic:
•	
Use bold in headings if they are less than one line long;
•	
Use Bold whenever you want your text to scream;
•	
Use italic for a subtle, gentle emphasis;
•	
NEVER use Bold and Italic together: take one or another;
•	
Use bold and italic as little as possible in body text, or you will lose 
the point;
•	
On Serif fonts, both Bold and Italic work well, but Italic doesn’t work 
well on San Serif fonts. 
Attention  Some fonts may have a bold style and a semibold style, while others 
can be heavier than bold, using “black” or “ultra” in its name. Use them just on 
large sizes for headlines or chapter titles. They don’t work well in body text and 
should never be used there.
Subscript and Superscript
Superscript and Subscript are typographic resources that use a point size smaller than 
the text of the same line and appear above and below the main line of text, respectively. 
They can be selected both in the Font area of the Home tab of the Ribbon (Figure 3-10) 
and in the Effects area of the Font dialog box (Figure 3-11).
Superscripts are the small characters that appear partially above the x-line  
(see Figure 2-13), and are commonly used in mathematical or chemical formulas (like 
Einstein’s famous equation E = mc2) or to signal footnotes or endnotes in the text  
(like this one1—look to the end of this page).
Subscripts are the small characters that appear partially below the baseline  
(see Figure 2-13) and are used just in mathematical and chemical formulas (like the 
famous water chemical formula H2O).
Microsoft Word offers the Subscript and Superscript tools in the Font area of the 
Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 3-8). Just click any of them and type: inheritance 
1This is a footnote.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

115
will take care to continually create subscript or superscript characters until you click the 
same tool again.
You can also use keyboard shortcuts to turn on/off subscript or superscript: 
•	
Press Ctrl + Shift+ + to activate superscript characters;
•	
Press Ctrl + = to activate subscript characters;
•	
Press again any one of these two shortcuts to remove the subscript/
superscript and return to the normal text size.
Attention  If you accidentally activate subscript or superscript characters and 
want to remove this formatting option from the text, select the text first and press 
Ctrl+= twice: the first time everything will format as subscript; the second type will 
remove it.
Some professional OpenType fonts offer Subscript and Superscript character sets 
that may be slightly heavier than a smaller character should be, so that they’re 
more legible. They can also be partially positioned above the Ascender or Capital 
letters of the font (for superscripts).
Change Case
The names uppercase and lowercase come from Gutenberg time, when printers kept 
the type for those letters in different drawers of a desk: they put the capital letters in the 
upper type cases, and the small letters for more frequent use in the lower type cases.
Everybody has already had the experience of typing a good amount of text and 
suddenly realizing that it was all typed using uppercase due to the Caps Lock key being 
inadvertently pressed.
Microsoft Word offers the Change case tool in the Font area of the Home tab of the 
Ribbon (see Figure 3-8) from where you can fix what you type, changing the case of the 
selected text letters. This easy-to-use tool works like this:
•	
Select the text first. For each sentence found in the selected text  
(a sentence is considered the text from one period, exclamation 
point, or question mark to the next);
•	
Click on the Change case tool and select one of its options:
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

116
•	
Sentence case: just the first letter of the first word of the 
sentence is in uppercase.
•	
lowercase: all characters in the sentence are in lowercase.
•	
UPPERCASE: all characters in the sentence are in uppercase.
•	
Capitalize Each Word: each word of the sentence begins in 
uppercase;
•	
tOGGLE cASE: for each word, alternate uppercase and 
lowercase each time the command is selected.
Attention  When Caps Lock key is pressed, a light appears on your keyboard. By 
using Shift while Caps Lock is pressed, things will change places and the keyboard 
will now type in lowercase.
Using Shift+F3 to Change Case
You can also use the Shift+F3 function key shortcuts to change case of the selected 
text. Supposing that the text is entirely in uppercase, each time you press Shift+F3 
the text goes:
•	
from UPPERCASE to lowercase;
•	
from lowercase to First Word Of Each Letter In Uppercase;
•	
from First Word Of Each Letter In Uppercase to UPPERCASE
Try it for yourself; it’s quite easy!
All Caps
All caps is short for “all capitals” and is an option in the Effects area of the Font dialog 
that changes lowercase to uppercase in the selected text. It is equivalent to pressing the 
Caps Lock key of your keyboard and typing everything in uppercase, or selecting the text 
and pressing Shift+F3 until all letters change to uppercase.
The use of uppercase letters in regular text may lead the reader to lose interest in 
reading because it turns the words into a monotone sequence of big rectangles that 
decrease the speed and ease of reading; on the other hand, the varying size of the 
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

117
lowercase letters—short and tall letters, ascending and descending glyphs—makes 
reading less challenging, allowing the eyes to read entire words by shape, instead of 
letter sequence.
Don’t ever use uppercase letters in body text. Use it only in chapter and section titles 
and headlines shorter than one line, in headers and footers, or judiciously in very small 
phrases whenever you want to give emphasis to the text, but in this latter case, try to use 
Small caps (Figure 3-12).
Attention  Whenever you feel prone to use uppercase letters in text paragraphs, 
try to detach them from the text using borders or by changing their background 
color or font size. But if you really need to use uppercase letters, also apply some 
positive character spacing and kerning to improve legibility (see “Scale, Character 
Spacing, and Kerning” later in this chapter.
Small Caps
Small caps are another option in the Effects area of the Font dialog box that creates short 
capital letters having the size of lowercase letters (Figure 3-13).
Figure 3-12.  Two version of the same text paragraph, with uppercase (all caps) 
and lowercase letters
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

118
Text in Small caps can be used as alternative to uppercase, bold, and italic to detach 
text or give it emphasis or some distinctiveness, and that is why it is so frequently used 
for business cards of law firms’ names. Although it may be less jarring than all caps, try 
to avoid its use in larger amounts of text: use it judiciously in title and subtitle sections 
where all words begin with a capital letter, or it will lose its impact (Figure 3-14).
Strikethrough, Double Strikethrough, and Hidden
The Effect options Strikethrough, Double strikethrough, and Hidden are digitally used by 
Microsoft Word whenever its Track Changes options are checked in the Tracking area of 
the Review tab on the Ribbon.
Whenever you check the Track Changes option—which is excellent to track changes 
of shared documents created by different people at the same time, or the ones that are

119
suffering a digital copy desk service—Microsoft Word will use the Strikethrough effect 
to format deleted text, and the Double strikethrough effect to format moved text. Both 
options will also receive the Hidden effect so you can select the Original or No Markup 
options to hide them from view.
Attention  These options should not be used to format your documents since 
they may make the text unreadable.
Scale, Character Spacing, and Kerning
Scale, Character spacing, and Kerning are typographic resources to control the space 
horizontally occupied by any amount of text. They are frequently used in desktop 
publishing to make the text fit into a defined amount of space on the page (like 
newspapers do), and/or to avoid text paragraphs ending in split words or the appearance 
of orphan or widow lines.
Microsoft Word offers in the Character Spacing area in the Advanced tab of the Fonts 
dialog box fine adjustments for changing Scale, Character space, and Kerning (Figure 3-­15).
Figure 3-15.  The Advanced tab of the Fonts dialog box, where you can find 
adjustments for character spacing and kerning
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

120
Scale
Character scale stretches or shrinks the width of letters and the space in between them 
in a block of text: there is no change to the height of the letters, so they keep the same 
point size regarding line spacing.
Character space = 100% means a normal character size for the selected font. 
Amounts below 100% diminish the character’s width, while those greater than 100% 
increase it. Figure 3-16 shows how the expression “Character Scale” looks at different 
amounts of scale. Note how the horizontal space is affected by Scale: a Scale = 50% uses 
half the horizontal space required by Scale = 100% (normal character size), which is half 
the size of Scale = 200%.
Although it seems that character height changes with an increase or decrease in the 
Scale value, they don’t. Figure 3-17 shows the letter “a” with scales of 50%, 100%, and 
200% for the selected font (Utopia Std, 18 pt). There is no space character between these 
characters.
Figure 3-16.  This figure shows how Scale affects the character width for the 
selected text. A Scale = 50% uses half the horizontal width of Scale = 100% (normal 
text), which is also 50% the width of Scale = 200%. Character height is not changed! 
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

121
When applying character Scale, you can type the desired amount of scale using 
integer values. Don’t use too much or too small scale values when there is a need to 
stretch or shrink the text, respectively. Select the text and employ small increases or 
decreases until you get the desired effect. A well-done scale factor should be almost 
imperceptible to the reader.
Note however that Scale always distorts the type, producing undesirable results 
in printed text. That is why some fonts may include variations having a suffix like 
“condensed” or “expanded” that are designed with different horizontal spreads than the 
one applied to the plain style, and this font version will perform better when printed.
Spacing
Spacing, also called letterspacing or tracking, changes just the horizontal space between 
characters while keeping their proportions the same. No distortion is applied to the 
type. This control affects text legibility because small amounts of added spacing make 
characters emerge and be easily recognizable, which is especially true for smaller font 
sizes.
Microsoft Word uses Spacing = Normal to designate the default font character 
space. It uses the words Condensed and Expanded to smaller or greater space values, 
respectively.
Character spacing is used in accordance with changes made in Font size, Font weight 
(normal, bold), and letter case. There is a direct relationship between letter case, font 
size, and character spacing. Larger font sizes need smaller character spacing, and vice 
versa. The same is true for uppercase letters: their default space is designed to be the 
minimum necessary, and they will show better using an expanded character spacing.
Conversely, there is an inverse relationship between font weight and letter space: 
light typefaces are well complemented by using expanded character spacing, while bold 
typefaces go better by pulling letters close together.
Figure 3-17.  Character scale does not affect character height: the characters keep 
the same font size regarding line space, while changing its horizontal dimension.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

122
Follow these rules to correctly use Character spacing in text:
•	
Normal text (between 10 and 12 pt) should have Character Spacing = 
Normal.
•	
Large text size (> 12 pt) may be improved by a Character Spacing = 
Condensed.
•	
Smaller text size (< 10 pt) goes better with Character Spacing = 
Expanded.
•	
Use between 5–12% of the point size to increase character spacing 
without making noticeable alterations in text flow (for a 12 pt size 
font this means Spacing = Expanded between 0.6–1.4 pt).
•	
Use no less than 5% of point size to decrease character spacing, or 
the text characters will begin to be huddled, seeming to fall one over 
the other (for a 12 pt size font this means Spacing = Condensed not 
greater than 0.6 pt).
•	
Do not add too much space. If letters are spread too far apart, 
having space enough to fit more letters in between, it is because the 
Expanded effect is overused.
•	
Conversely, do not remove too much space. If letters begin to touch 
each other on their glyphs, it is because the Condensed effect is 
overused.
Figure 3-18 shows how character spacing impacts the sans serif Arial Narrow font 
and the serif Times New Roman font formatted using different character spacing options 
(from condensed to expanded). Look how text becomes huddled at greater condensing 
and how it grows at greater expansions.
Figure 3-18.  Different character spacing options and how they affect text legibility
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

123
Position
Position, typographically called baseline shift, allows raising or lowering the baseline of 
selected text without making any change to its size or appearance. It is considered a great 
typographical tool to vertically displace text characters and create special text effects that 
are quite subtle, and not available inside the font character set.
Microsoft Word Position command must be set to Normal (at the baseline), Raised 
(above the baseline), or Lowered (below the baseline), using increment values of 0.5 pt size.
Some examples of using Position:
•	
Diagonal fractions: use less than 10% of the Font size to raise 
and lower fraction items, while diminishing the font size by 1 pt 
for numerator and denominator, to avoid affecting the paragraph 
baseline displacement too much. The 12/19 fraction, which can be 
formatted as 12/19  in this line, formatted with Utopia, 9 pt, by using 
Utopia 8 pt and Position = 1 pt to raise the numerator and lower the 
denominator (note that the line spacing of this paragraph was not 
affected).
•	
Raise the @ symbol: use 2 pt size to raise the @ symbol in e-mail 
addresses so the inferior part of the @ character be positioned at the 
baseline: the flaviomorgado@gmail.com became flaviomorgado@
gmail.com where the @ character received Position = Raised = 1.5 pt 
for a 9 pt font.
•	
Lower the ™ trademark symbol: use Position = Lowered = 1.5 pt on 
the trademark symbol to align it to the x-line (height of lowercase 
letters): Apress books™ becomes Apress books™.
It is also used to create a jagged, jumpy visual text effect by raising or lowering 
intermediate characters, or even vertically repositioning parentheses, braces, brackets, 
bullets and other special characters commonly found in text (like @, $, ©, ™, etc.).
Attention  The Position option impacts the line spacing the same way as font 
size, meaning that if the Line space option of the Paragraph dialog box is not set 
to the Exactly option, the paragraph line where any character changes its vertical 
displacement may show a bigger line space.

Kerning
Kerning refers to adjusting the space of some specific pairs of characters so they can 
occupy less space and achieve a subtle, pleasant result, usually imperceptible to user 
eyes. It is most perceptible when using large font sizes (>14 pt), although it can be 
applied to any font size. It is applied when a letter has a diagonal or horizontal glyph that 
can serve as a hatch to the next letter, like WA, Wa, VA, Va, Ti, Ta, Yi, Ya …
Kerning is typographically considered as a good formatting practice and is 
recommended to be imposed to any text size. This is so true that most OpenType fonts 
may have tenths or hundreds of specific kerning pairs encoded inside it.
Microsoft Word offers the Kerning for fonts option in the Character Spacing area of 
the Advanced area of the Font dialog box (see Figure 3-15) unchecked by default. When 
you check it, you can select the smallest font size to where kerning must be applied 
(Microsoft Word offers 20 pt size as the default value, because kerning in small font size 
can make it difficult to correctly discriminate some pairs of letters).
Figure 3-19 shows some letter encounters with and without kerning, and how the 
word WAVE can change its appearance with and without kerning.
Attention  Professional desktop publishing programs, such as Quark XPress  
and Adobe InDesign, allow the user to define precise kerning controls in many 
different units.

OpenType Features
The OpenType Features area, found in the Advanced area of the Font dialog box, is 
logically applied to just OpenType fonts. It allows turn on the usage of alternate characters 
to the selected text, in case the options were implemented in the selected font.
Attention  See section “Knowing Which Font Types You Have Installed” earlier 
in this chapter to learn how you can identify the OpenType fonts installed on your 
computer.
If you are wondering if every OpenType font implements each OpenType feature, 
the answer is no. Some fonts implement no features, others implement just some, and 
almost none implement them all.
So, how you can know before trying these features? Simple: use the Symbol dialog 
box to explore the font character set.
Attention  See section “Symbols Command” earlier in this chapter to learn how 
you can evoke and use the Symbol dialog box.
To simplify our example, let us use the Calibri font: one of the most popular 
OpenType fonts (and one that already become a System font), Calibri was introduced 
with Microsoft Office 2007 so Microsoft Word could implement many of the OpenType 
Features offered by the Advanced tab of the Font dialog box.
By opening the Symbol dialog box (found in the Insert tab ➤ Symbols area) and 
selecting the Calibri font in the Font combo box, you will note that its subset combo box 
has an extensive list of OpenType features to select, among which you will find “Space 
modified letters,” “Superscripts and Subscripts,” “Currency Symbols,” “Number forms,” 
“Alphabetical Presentation Forms,” to mention just a few (Figure 3-20).
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

126
Ligatures
Ligature is the word used to indicate when glyphs from two or more characters collide. It 
is quite common in handwriting, when two characters have some of their strokes merged 
with one above or inside another, becoming a single letter. It is a typographic resource 
that may evoke an arcane way of printing that gives an old-fashioned look to the text; it’s 
a matter of taste whether to use it or not.
The character that best represent a ligature is the ampersand (&), which represents 
the ligature of letters e and t, forming the Latin word et (which means and).
In the metal typesetting times, some letters for specific fonts may have created a 
problem when put together, like the ff, fi, fj, fl encounters, but this problem doesn’t 
happen anymore in most digital fonts.
The Ligature options are as follows:
•	
None: no ligatures.
•	
Standard Only: combine just certain pairs of letters (like fi).
•	
Standard and Contextual: combine certain pairs of letters 
contextually positioned before or after them.
Figure 3-20.  The Symbol dialog box with the Calibri font selected, showing part of 
its extensive subset of OpenType features (like the “Alphabetic Presentation Forms,” 
popularly known as “ligtures”)
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

127
•	
Historical and Discretionary: more used on ck, sp, st, and rt letter 
pairs to give a decorative or fancy appeal.
•	
All: apply all types of ligatures whenever is possible. 
Figure 3-21 shows the Font dialog box in which the Calibri font was selected, and a 
pair or trio of letters like ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl was typed in the text, without and with ligatures, 
so you can see how the OpenType Feature Ligatures = Standard Only (the one offered by 
this font) appears in the Preview area of the Font dialog box and when applied to the text. 
Instead of the two letters typed, Microsoft Word changes the two typed characters to a 
single one in which the individual component letters are joined together by their glyphs.
Attention  Use font size up to 20 pt to see the effect in the Preview area of the 
Font dialog box.
Since a ligature uses a single character, it must not be used with the Spacing 
option, because the internal space of the letters associated will not change.
Figure 3-21.  The Calibri font OpenType Featere Ligatures = Standard Only option 
set to some pairs or trios of letters. Note how the two or three letters were replaced 
with a single one that runs them together by joining their glyphs.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

128
Attention  Ligatures are best used in some script fonts, like Gabriola, which is 
installed by default with Microsoft Word 2007 or later versions, and the reader is 
invited to use it to explore more about this issue.
Number Spacing
Number spacing is a typographic resource that allows a choice between Default, Tabular, 
or Proportional spacing between the numbers (Default = Tabular for the Calibri font).
Tabular is used when there is a need to precisely align numbers using the same 
text column in different lines of text, like in financial reports. Proportional makes each 
number occupy just the space it needs, so they will not align well in two different lines of 
text; this is preferable for numbers in the text or headlines.
Figure 3-22 shows two sets of numbers, one using the OpenType Feature Number 
spacing = Tabular (Default) and Proportional options. Note how the Tabular option 
misaligns the text between two different text lines.
Number Form
Number form is a typographic resource that can change the way numbers align to 
the text baseline. It can be set to Default, Lining, or Old-style (Default = Lining in the 
Calibri font).
Figure 3-22.  The Calibri font OpenType Feature Number spacing option set to 
Tabular (at left) and Proportional (at right). Note how the Proportional option 
uses just the space required by each number, making them misaligned in the two 
lines of text.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

129
Lining means that each number is aligned to the baseline, with all having the size of 
an uppercase letter. The Old-style option produces numbers with different heights and 
baseline alignments: some are the size of lowercase letters (normally 1, 2, and 0), others 
are the size of uppercase letters (normally 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and they have different 
baseline alignments (3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are positioned below the baseline, while 6 and 8 are 
positioned on it).
The Lining option can be used in any situation but goes better with uppercase letters. 
The Old-style option is preferred in body text with lowercase letters.
Figure 3-23 shows how the OpenType Feature Number Form appears for the Calibri 
font using Lining (Default) and Old-style options. Letters ABcep were put together to 
show how the Old-style option makes numbers the size of uppercase and lowercase 
letters, and how some align below the baseline (with letter p descender line) or at the 
baseline.
Stylistic Set
Stylistic set refers to specific alternate character sets that were built at specific positions 
inside the Unicode font. Each set consists of different characters’ styles grouped by 
similar variations of glyphs, and although the OpenType standard reserves space 
to implement up to 20 possible different Stylistic sets, it is rare to find a font that 
implements more than six of them.
The Stylistics set options are identified by numbers (Stylistics set=1 to Stylistics  
set =20) and are applied to certain characters at the beginning or end of words, 
according to the option selected.
Figure 3-23.  The Calibri fontOpenType Feature Number Form with the Lining 
(Default) and Old-style options. Note how Old-style uses different alignments and 
baseline displacements (uppercase and lowercase letters—one with a descender—
were inserted to allow alignment comparisons for the OpenType Old-style 
numbers).
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

130
It is normally used in certain OpenType script fonts (like Gabriola, installed by 
default with Word 2016) to give a flourish to the text, presenting an old-fashioned 
appearance typically found for marriage invites and other types of official certificates.
Table 3-2 shows how the Gabriola font changes its appearance with Stylistics set = 2, 
4, 5 and 6 (options Default and 1, 2, and 3 look the same).
Use Contextual Alternates
This option allows Microsoft Word to automatically apply alternate characters when 
special letter encounters are found in the text, so it can use specific OpenType alternate 
characters to improve both spacing and ligature connections. Whenever this option 
is checked and the OpenType font implements the feature, Microsoft Word can select 
specific alternate characters to the beginnings and ends of some words, or to some 
others that are next to punctuation or at the end of a paragraph.
The Text Effects Tool
Text Effects tools are located in the Font area of the Home tab of the Ribbon (Figure 3-­10). 
 It allows the selection of predefined color and font options, or the specification of 
the Outline, Shadow, Reflection, Glow, Number Styles, Ligatures, and Stylistics set to 
be applied to the text, as a shortcut to the same options found in the Font dialog box 
(Figure 3-24).

These coloring options, which can change letter outline and foreground colors, 
are seldom used in cursive text document formatting, but are very useful for posters, 
banners, and other fancy or decorative one-page publications.
Some of its options (like OpenType features) become enabled only when the cursor 
or selected text is formatted with an OpenType font. And since you can select a lot of 
different options, one by one, Microsoft Word also offers the Clear All Formatting tool 
(see Figure 3-10) to return the selected text to its default appearance.
Attention  Use the Text Effects tools as the simplest way to verify if the selected 
font is an OpenType one, and if it implements the desired OpenType Features: an 
OpenType face will enable Number Styles, Ligatures, and Stylistic Sets options.
Text Highlight
Besides some specific options found in the Text Effects tool (like Outline, Shadow, 
Reflection, and Glow), the Text Highlight tool is the only tool that does not has an 
equivalent command inside the Font dialog box.
Figure 3-24.  The Text Effects tool allows a quick access to the OpenType Features 
found in the Advanced tab of the Font dialog box. Some options will be available 
just when the text selected uses an OpenType font that implements the effect (such 
as Number Sytles, Ligatures, and Stylistic Sets).
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

132
Text highlight is used to mimic the highlight pens used to mark text, detaching 
important parts from the text that surround it: this is a resource used by many people to 
highlight whichever they consider most important, so it can be found quickly.
Its usage is straightforward:
•	
Click the Highlight tool arrow and select the desired color (default is 
bright yellow);
•	
Select the text first and then click the Text Highlight tool to detach it 
and automatically deselect the tool; or
•	
Click (or double-click the tool to lock it) and then highlight multiple 
parts of the document
To remove the highlight applied to the text you can
•	
Select the Highlight tool color used;
•	
Select the text and again apply the Highlight tool with the same color 
(or select the No color option);
•	
Use the Clear All Formatting tool (see Figure 3-10).
But when you have a large text document full of highlights and you want to remove 
then all, you can use one of these two strategies:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+A to select the entire document text and apply the Text 
Highlight tool twice: the first time will apply highlight to the entire 
text, and the second time will remove it;
	 2.	 Use the Replace dialog box to find any highlighted text and change 
it to normal text (see section “Find and Replace Font Attributes” 
later in this chapter).
Attention  The Shading tool, found in the Paragraph area in the Home tab of the 
Ribbon (see Figure 2-7), can also be used to highlight text with the same bright 
yellow default color used by the Highlight tool. Whenever this happens, you will not 
be able to remove the highlight using the Highlight tool; while it may seem to be the 
same formatting, it really is not. So, whenever you can’t remove text highlighting 
using the Highlight tool, try to use the Shading color tool instead, using the same 
technique cited before: apply it twice to the entire text: the first time will paint all text 
background with the selected color, while the second time will remove it.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

133
To remove text highlight made with the Highlight tool, use the tool No Color option, 
apply the same highlight color twice, or use the Replace command to find and 
replace it.
Text Highlight with the Shading Tool
It is also possible to highlight text with the Shading tool using the same bright yellow 
color defined by default in the Highlight tool. The final result will look the same, but the 
formatting applied is different, and it may be difficult to remove it in case you do not 
understand what has happened to the text.
Try to follow these steps using any text document:
	 1.	 Click the Shading tool arrow and select the same bright yellow 
color used by the Highlight tool;
	 2.	 Select the text to be highlighted;
	 3.	 Click the Shading tool to highlight the text.
The only difference you may perceive to indicate that the Shading tool was used to 
highlight text happens whenever the hidden pilcrow paragraph character ¶ was also 
highlighted, because Microsoft Word will highlight the text until it reaches its right 
indent character on the ruler (which is usually aligned to the right page margin).
Figure 3-25 shows the “Text Highlight.docx” Microsoft Word document (which you 
can extract from Chapter03.zip file), showing text paragraphs highlighted with the same 
bright yellow color using both the Highlight and Shading tools. They look the same, 
don’t they?
Note however that the second highlighted paragraph has its background highlighted 
to its right margin indent, as a clear indication that this formatting was made using the 
Shading tool.
The problem with the Shading tool is that its formatting is not easily removed: you 
must select exactly the same text highlight to remove it by applying its No Color option.
Let me be clear: if you select more text than the one that was originally highlighted 
with the Shading tool and apply to it a No Color option with the Shading tool, you will 
not remove the highlight! (Open the document and try for yourself).
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

134
But it gets even more complicated when both options were simultaneously used 
in selected text: you can’t remove the highlight using just the Highlight or the Shading 
tool—you must use both!
When this happens, you have two choices:
•	
Use the Clear All Formatting tool;
•	
Use the Format Painter tool.
Use the Clear All Formatting Tool
The Clear All Formatting tool (Figure 3-10) is supposed to remove every text formatting 
applied by the Font and Paragraph dialog boxes, returning the text to its original state. 
Just click the Clear All Formatting tool to select it and drag it over the text to
•	
Bring to the text the default paragraph font (the one applied to its first 
character, which is stored in the hidden ¶ character).
•	
Remove bold, italic, underline, subscript, superscript, character 
spacing, OpenType features, and so on. Text will use the regular font 
size and appearance.
Figure 3-25.  Text highlighted using the Highlight and Shading tool (or both 
simultaneously). When these tools use the same color, you cannot disinguish which 
formatting was applied to the text, which makes it harder to remove.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

135
•	
Remove any paragraph formatting: line spacing, alignment, spacing 
before and after, flow properties.
•	
Remove any tabulation marks.
•	
Remove any Shading and Border options.
It is almost perfect to remove formatting options, except for the fact that it doesn’t 
remove Highlight tool options: this format will remain in the text. (See for yourself!)
Use the Format Painter Tool
The easiest way to remove undesirable text format while keeping the format you want is 
to use the Format Painter tool (Figure 3-10) to copy the source format and apply it to a 
target text, following these steps:
•	
Select the text that has the desired source format.
•	
Click the Format Painter tool to copy all its formatting options 
(double-click it to lock the tool).
•	
Drag the mouse over the target text.
Using this simple method, you can easily remove both the Highlight and Shading 
tools with a click of the mouse!
Drop Cap
D
rop Cap is the typographic resource used to enlarge one or more letters that 
begin a new paragraph (like this large letter “D”) to signal that the text has a new 
beginning. It is commonly used to open a paragraph or a report, and was used from the 
4th century in codex books created by scribes and monks as a visual clue to clearly define 
when a new section or idea started in the text.
The large letter “D” that begins the first paragraph of this section is called a Drop 
Cap because it grows down into the text, taking up the left space of the initial text 
lines below it.
I
t is called an Initial when the character size grows above the baseline of the first 
paragraph line where it resides (like this large letter “I” you see here).
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

136
Since this text effect has both font and paragraph formatting, affecting the letter 
dimension and the paragraph left indent, respectively, Microsoft Word implements 
it using the Drop Cap tool found in the Text area of the Insert tab of the Ribbon 
(Figure 3-­26).
Microsoft Word enables the Drop Cap tool whenever the text is over a text paragraph 
with at least one single character typed, and as Figure 3-25 implies, it offers three 
different options:
•	
Dropped: is the most common usage, where it creates a first line 
indent to all lines affected by the drop cap letter;
•	
In Margin: left indent all paragraph lines, leaving the drop cap 
paragraph floating alone in the text;
•	
Drop Cap options: show the Drop Cap dialog box from where you can 
better define the appearance of the drop cap letter (Figure 3-27).
Figure 3-26.  Microsoft Word Drop Cap tool found in the Text area of the Insert tab 
of the Ribbon offers two options to left indent the paragraph that receives the Drop 
Cap letter: Dropped and In Margin.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

137
Use the Drop Cap dialog box to control the drop cap appearance, including the 
position, the number of lines to drop, and the distance from the text. And as Figure 3-26 
shows, Microsoft Word adds a frame with handles around the first letter used by the drop 
cap to detach it from the text and make the remaining text flow around it.
Use the next tips to remove and format drop cap letter from the text:
•	
To remove and replace a drop cap letter, just apply again the Drop 
Cap command. Alternatively, you can click the drop cap frame 
border and press the Delete key–but you will need to retype the first 
paragraph letter.
•	
Drag the drop cap frame handles to increase/decrease the drop  
cap size.
•	
Double-click the drop cap frame border to show the Frame dialog 
box, from which you can select other frame options (Figure 3-28).
Figure 3-27.  The Drop Cap dialog box allows you to control the drop cap type and 
its appearance, including its font, the lines to drop, and the distance from text
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

138
•	
To use more than one letter as a drop cap, first select the letters and 
then apply the drop cap command. Alternatively, click the drop cap 
frame and type more letters. 
•	
There is no rule on what font may be used for the drop cap–you can 
use the same paragraph font. But you may have better effects using 
decorative fonts.
•	
Avoid using drop caps of less than 3 lines in height: they aren’t 
effective in calling the reader’s attention or adding drama to the text.
•	
Avoid using drop caps of more than 7 lines in height. 
•	
Don’t use drop caps with center or right aligned paragraphs.
Find and Replace Font Attributes
Microsoft Word allows you to use the Find and Replace dialog box to search for specific 
text formatting and eventually remove it or replace it with another formatting option. 
This operation does not require that any character be searched or replaced.
Figure 3-28.  Double-click the drop cap frame margin to show the Frame dialog 
box, where you can precisely control the frame properties. Use the Remove Frame 
button to remove the frame, and consequentely the drop cap effect.

Let us suppose that you have a text document where the section title paragraphs 
were formatted with Arial, 14 pt, Underline, Left aligned and you want to change them to 
Times New Roman, 16 pt, Bold text, Center aligned. You can easily change the formatting 
options applied to all these section title paragraphs by following these steps:
	 1.	 Highlight the text to be changed and select the Replace command in 
the Home tab of the Ribbon to show the Find and Replace dialog box.
	 2.	 Click the Find what text box option to define the format to be 
searched.
	 3.	 Click the More>> button to expand the dialog box and select 
Format ➤ Font. 
	 4.	 In the Font dialog box, select the format to search for: Font = Arial, 
Font Style = Bold, Font size = 14.
	 5.	 Click OK to close the Font dialog box and see that these format 
options were placed below the Find what text box (Figure 3-30).
Figure 3-30.  Use the Format ➤ Font option of the Find and Replace dialog box 
to define within the Find what text box the font formatting options that must be 
searched for in the text (Arial, 14 pt, Bold).

	 8.	 Click OK to close the Font dialog box, and click Format ➤ 
Paragraph to show the Paragraph dialog box. 
	 9.	 In the Paragraph dialog box, select Alignment = Center and press 
OK to close it and see how these formatting options were placed 
below the Replace with text box (Figure 3-31).
	 10.	 Click Replace all to make all possible replacements.
Note in Figures 3-30 and 3-31 that the check box options found in the Font and 
Paragraph dialog boxes are grayed and checked by default. This formatting convention 
means that the option will not be removed in case it is already set, and neither set case it 
is not applied. Figure 3-31 also shows that the Page break found before in the Pagination 
area of the Line and Page Breaks tab of the Paragraph dialog box was checked (it is not 
grayed anymore), meaning that this option should be set by the Replace with option.  
See Figure 3-31.

142
Use these tips to search and replace text formatting:
•	
The font or paragraph attribute selected in the Find what text box 
doesn’t need to be selected in the Replace with text box: if you search 
for a font you don’t need to replace it.
•	
To search and remove markups made with the Highlight tool, click 
the Find what text box and select Format ➤ Highlight, then click the 
Replace with text box and select Format ➤ Highlight twice.

Extract “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Chapter 1-3 Unformatted.docx” file from 
Chapter03.zip and open it in Microsoft Word. This is a small document of 11 pages with 
the first three chapters of the famous Mark Twain book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, 
published in 1856.
When you open it for the first time in Microsoft Word, it may be similar to what you 
see in Figure 3-32.
Figure 3-32.  This is "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Chapter 1-3 Unformatted.

•	
Paragraph: Justify alignment, First line indent = 0.3, Line spacing 
= Single, Widow/Orphan control.
•	
Apply a Drop Cap to the first paragraph of every section.
Figure 3-33 shows Microsoft Word using a two-page view for this document version 
(“The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Chapter 1-3 Formatted.docx”, which you can extract 
from Chapter03.zip) that received all proposed changes.
Figure 3-33.  A two-page view of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Chapter 1-3

Attention  To change the section title’s formatting, search just for the Arial 
font. Then use the No Formatting button to clear the formats in the Find what 
and Replace with text boxes. To change the body text, search just for Times New 
Roman font. In both cases, use the Replace with text box to apply the desired 
format to titles and body text.
Exercise 2
The objective of this exercise is to fix document problems using Microsoft Word’s 
Replace command.
Extract “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Chapter 1-3 Bad Format.docx” file from 
Chapter03.zip and open it in Microsoft Word. This is also an 11-page document with just 
the first three chapters of Mark Twain’s book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but it is now 
full of trash: hidden characters, bad formatting, highlights made with the Highlight and 
Shading tools.
When you open it for the first time in Microsoft Word, it may be similar to what you 
see in Figure 3-34 (supposing that the Show/Hide tool is unselected).

To fix this document using Microsoft Word Replace command, you must
	 1.	 Click the Show/Hide button to show the document’s hidden 
characters and explore the document to recognize where 
unnecessary characters were inserted.
	 2.	 Use the Exercise section tips of Chapter 2 to remove all 
unnecessary hidden characters from the text.

Summary
Microsoft Word uses typographic principles to apply many different character formatting 
options to the text, using both the Font area of the Home tab of the Ribbon and the Font 
dialog box, which can be evoked any time using the right mouse button.
To make good use of such tools, you must understand the differences in the font 
types and how to use them, combining both serif and sans serif fonts to achieve better 
results, and use some typographic tips so your documents look better when printed.
As with paragraph formatting options, you can also use the Find and Replace dialog 
box to quickly change formatting options throughout the entire text.
In this chapter, you learned the following:
•	
Microsoft Word is a sophisticated typographic tool that uses many 
professional features to format the text.
•	
Typeface and fonts are not the same typographically, but are the 
same for computer usage.
•	
Fonts can be classified into four main groups: serif, sans serif, script, 
and decorative.
•	
Fonts can be monospaced or proportionally spaced.
•	
How to combine fonts so your documents have the most appeal to 
readers.
•	
What is considered a System font and how to install new fonts onto 
your Microsoft Windows system.
•	
How to insert symbols and other special characters into the text.
•	
How to use font attributes to format the text, making a better use of 
font type, size, style (underline, bold and italic), and color.
•	
Why you should not use underline formatting: use bold or italic.
•	
How to use Ctrl + = to apply subscript and Ctrl + + to apply 
Superscript (or use the associated tools of the Home tab of the 
Ribbon).
•	
How you can easily change the text caption using both the Shift+F3 
shortcut and Change Case tool.
Chapter 3  Character Attributes

148
•	
How to use All caps and Small caps effects.
•	
What Character space is and how to use it (Scale, Spacing, Position, 
and Kerning).
•	
What OpenType features are (Ligatures, Number spacing and form, 
Stylistics set) and how to implement them in the text.
•	
Text can be highlighted using both the Highlight tool and the Shading 
tool (using both together makes them more difficult to remove).
•	
You can use the Clear All Formatting tool to remove most text formatting 
options, but not Highlight format done with the Highlight tool.
•	
Highlighted text formatted with the Highlight tools can be easily 
removed by this same tool or using the Format button of the Find and 
Replace dialog box.
•	
You can easily change text formation for Font, Paragraph, Tabs, and 
Highlight using the Find and Replace dialog box.
In the next chapter, we will explore how to apply consistent formatting options to the 
text using the concept of text Styles.

CHAPTER 4
Select, Find, and Replace 
Text Characters
Microsoft Word documents can be quite long, and whenever this is the case you may 
need to move and search through the text to find and select specific characters, words, 
text sequences, sentences, and paragraphs, and then move them, copy them, and/or 
apply the desired formatting options to them.
In this chapter you will learn how to move through the text, select, find, and replace 
text strings to easily format them.
The documents used as examples and the ones cited in the Exercise sections can be 
found by downloading Chapter04.zip file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
Moving Through and Selecting Text
As most professional software does, Microsoft Word obeys to Microsoft Windows system 
rules regarding the use of keyboard keys to move or select text:
•	
Home, End: go to beginning and end, respectively.
•	
Arrows: make a discrete movement in the arrow’s direction.
•	
Page Down, Page Up: make a large move, down or up relative to the 
window size and zoom applied.
•	
Ctrl: (control key) multiply the movement made with Home, End, 
Arrows, Page Down, and Page Up.
•	
Shift: turn on the text select mode with Home, End, Arrows, Page 
Down, and Page Up.

150
This seem quite obvious but most people do not know how to take advantage of 
these keys, nor do they try them to realize what they do regarding moving through a 
Microsoft Word document. Let us see them in action: extract “The Count of Monte 
Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapters 1-5.docx” from Chapter04.zip file, a 31-page 
document that shows the first five chapters of the famous novel created by Alexandre 
Dumas (in collaboration with Auguste Maquet) in 1844, and open it in Microsoft Word 
(Figure 4-1).
Look to the status bar and note that it has 31 pages.

docx" document that you can extract from Chapter04.zip file, opened in  
Microsoft Word

151
Using Home and End Keys
Supposing that the text cursor is positioned at the beginning of the document (at left of the 
first word of the first document paragraph), make simple tests pressing Home and End keys:
•	
End: go to the end of line.
•	
Home: return to the beginning of line.
Since Shift turns on text selection, you will see the following (supposing that you are 
at the beginning of the first document paragraph):
•	
Shift+End: select text from cursor position to the end of the line.
•	
Shift+Home: select text from cursor position to the beginning of 
the line.
Since Ctrl is the multiplication move key, you will see the following (supposing that 
you are at the beginning of the first document paragraph):
•	
Ctrl+End: go to the end of the document (Figure 4-2).
Figure 4-2.  Press Ctrl+End to go to the end of the document. Press Ctrl+Home to 
go to the beginning.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

152
•	
Ctrl+Home: go to the beginning of the document.
And since Shift turns on text selection and Ctrl is the multiplication move key:
•	
Shift+Ctrl+End: select text from cursor position to the end of the 
document.
•	
Shift+Ctrl+Home: select the text from cursor position to the 
beginning of the document (Figure 4-3).
Figure 4-3.  Press Shift+Ctrl+Home to select text from current position to the 
beginning of the document. Press Shift+Ctrl+End to select from current position to 
the end of the document.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

153
Using Arrow Keys
The use of arrow keys alone is no mystery: Left and Right arrows move the text cursor a 
character at a time, while Down and Up arrows move the text cursor a text line at a time 
in the arrow’s direction.
Since Shift turns on text selection, pressing Shift+Arrow key will do the following:
•	
Left, Right arrows: select one or more characters in the arrow’s 
direction.
•	
Down, Up arrows: select one or more text lines in the arrow’s 
direction, up to the text column where the selection begins.
Since Ctrl is the multiplication move key:
•	
Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right arrows: move to the beginning of the next 
word in the arrow’s direction.
•	
Ctrl+Down, Ctrl+Up arrows: move to the beginning of the next 
paragraph in the arrow’s direction.
And by pressing Shift+Ctrl:
•	
Shift+Ctrl+Left, Shift+Ctrl+Right arrows: select one word at a time 
in the arrow’s direction.
•	
Shift+Ctrl+Down, Shift+Ctrl+Up arrows: select one paragraph at 
time in the arrow’s direction.
Using Page Down and Page Up Keys
Page Down and Page Up keys have an unanticipated behavior for the length of move 
through the text, because Microsoft Word, along with most other professional software 
packages, considers a page what you are currently seeing on the screen: or in other 
words, Page Up and Page Down relates to a screen page.
And since what you are seeing is relative to the window size and state (restored, 
maximized), and zoom factor applied to the document, whenever you press Page Down 
or Page Up the document window will displace a screen page in the direction of the key 
pressed (down or up), and this is not a perfectly predictable move.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

154
Since Shift turns on selection:
•	
Shift+Page Down, Shift+Page Up: should select what Microsoft 
Word considers as one screen page text at a time in the key direction 
(it has erratic behavior according to the page view used and cursor 
position in the document).
•	
Ctrl+Page Down, Ctrl+Page Up will have different behavior if:
•	
No search had been made in the document: in this case, it will 
move to the beginning of the next or previous page according to 
the page key direction.
•	
Any search had been made in the document: in this case, it will 
select the text found by the last Find operation in the document.
Attention  Microsoft Word 2016 has a bug here, because whenever you perform 
any Find operation in the document, even if you clean up the Find what text box 
(either in the Navigation pane or in the Find and Replace dialog box), it will no 
longer use Ctrl+Page Down and Ctrl+Page Up to go to the beginning of the next or 
previous page: it will try to do the search again and you will need to close and open 
Microsoft Word again to reestablish the normal Ctrl+Page Up and Ctrl+Page Down 
behavior.
•	
Shift+Ctrl+Page Down, Shift+Ctrl+Page Up: should select the next 
or previous page text, as Microsoft Word 2003 or previous versions 
did, but does nothing, as if no keys had been pressed.
Attention  Press Ctrl+A to select the entire document text.
Use the Navigation Pane ➤ Pages option to show page thumbnails and go to a 
specific page (see the section “The Navigation Pane” later in this chapter).
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

155
Selecting Text with Mouse
Selecting text with the mouse is quite obvious: just click and drag to select the desired, 
contiguous text. But by correctly positioning the mouse pointer and pressing the Shift 
and Ctrl keys, you can also select different amounts of text:
•	
Click the text to position the cursor inside the paragraph.
•	
Double-click to select the word under the cursor.
•	
Triple-click to select the paragraph.
Since Shift turns on selection:
•	
Press and hold Shift to select between two consecutive click points.
•	
Double-click to select a word, press and hold Shift, and click to select 
consecutive words
•	
Triple-click to select a paragraph, press and hold Shift, and click to 
select consecutive paragraphs.
Using the mouse, the Ctrl key is used to make noncontiguous selections:
•	
Double-click to select a word, press and hold Ctrl, and keep  
double-­clicking words to randomly select them.
•	
Triple-click to select a paragraph, press and hold Ctrl and keep  
triple-­clicking to select noncontiguous paragraphs.
•	
Press and hold Ctrl, double-click to select a word, triple-click to select 
a paragraph to add to the current selection.
Selecting Sentences
The Ctrl key is also used to select sentences, but Microsoft Word 2016 has a different 
behavior from previous versions:
•	
Click inside any paragraph that has more than one sentence.
•	
Press and hold Ctrl and click to select the sentence (Figure 4-4).
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

156
Attention  On previous versions of Microsoft Word, you could keep pressing Ctrl 
and click to continue selecting other sentences. The 2016 version obliges you to 
click anywhere in the desired sentence to position the text cursor inside it before 
you press Ctrl and click it again to select the sentence.
Selecting Text by Clicking the Left Margin
By clicking the left margin of the page, you can select different amounts of text. Point 
the mouse to the left margin of any paragraph until the text cursor turns a right 
pointing arrow and:
•	
Click at left margin to select a line.
•	
Double-click at left margin to select the paragraph.
•	
Triple-click at left margin to select the entire document (same as 
Ctrl+A, Figure 4-5).
Figure 4-4.  Click the sentence to position the text cursor; press and hold Ctrl and 
click again to select the sentence
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

157
Copy or Move the Selected Text
You can move the text selected, even if it is a noncontiguous selection, by using the 
keyboard or the mouse.
To move and copy the text selection with the mouse:
•	
Click and drag the text selection to move it to a new position.
•	
Press and hold Ctrl, and click and drag the text selection to copy it to 
a new position (Microsoft Word will add a “+” sign near the cursor to 
signal the copy operation, Figure 4-6).
Figure 4-5.  Point the mouse cursor at the left document margin until it turns into 
a right-pointing arrow. Click to select the line, double-click to select the paragraph, 
and triple-click to select the entire document.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

158
To move and copy the text selection with the keyboard (or with the aid of the 
Clipboard area of the Home tab of the Ribbon):
	 1.	 Select the desired text.
•	
Press Ctrl+X (or click Cut in the Clipboard area of the Home tab of 
the Ribbon) to remove the text to clipboard, or
•	
Press Ctrl+C (or click Copy in the Clipboard area of the Home tab 
of the Ribbon) to copy the text to clipboard
Figure 4-6.  Select the desired text, press and hold Ctrl key, and drag it to a new 
position. Microsoft Word will show a small “+” character near the mouse pointer to 
signal that you are making a text copy instead of performing a move operation.

159
	 2.	 Click the destination position.
	 3.	 Press Ctrl+V (or click Paste in the Clipboard area of the Home tab 
of the Ribbon) to paste the text from clipboard.
Find Text Characters
Microsoft Word offers more than one way to find text character sequences in the text, 
using the tools found in the Editing area of the Home tab of the Ribbon, from which you 
can click Find to expand its menu options and select
•	
Find: to show the Navigation pane with the Results option selected, 
from which you can make a quick document search (or use the Ctrl+F 
shortcut).
•	
Advanced Find: to show the Find and Replace dialog box, with the 
Find tab selected (or use the Ctrl+H shortcut).
•	
Go To: to show the Find and Replace dialog box with the Go To tab 
selected.
Attention  Use the Go To tab of the Find and Replace dialog box to go to the 
desired page number: type the page number and press Enter to show it.
Press F5 at any time to display the Find and Replace dialog box with the  
Go To tab selected.
The Navigation Pane
By pressing Ctrl+F, you can quickly show the Navigation Pane with the default Results 
view, which will appear by default docked at the left side of Microsoft Word document 
window (Figure 4-7).
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

160
Attention  Click and drag the Navigation pane title bar to undock it and make it 
float over the Microsoft Word window.
Click the text box inside the Navigation pane, type anything you want, and Microsoft 
Word will make a quick search in the document for this text string. All results found are 
highlighted in the document and show inside the Navigation pane as a list of items. The 
document text will also be displaced to show the first occurrence found.
Using the Navigation pane, it may be quite easy to select specific chapter and section 
titles inside the document, as long as they have some word in common (like the word 
“Chapter,” commonly found in romances and many other documents to indicate the 
beginning of a new chapter).
Figure 4-8 shows how you can easily find all occurrences of the word “Chapter,” to 
easily format the document’s chapter title paragraphs.
Figure 4-7.  Click the Find tool of the Editing area in the Home tab of the Ribbon 
(or press Ctrl+F) to show the Navigation Pane with the Results option selected
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

161
Below the text box is shown the number of items found (five results for the word 
“Chapter”), while the paragraph where those items were found is shown in the 
Navigation pane list (note that it shows occurrences of “Chapter 1” to “Chapter 5”).
Click the small arrows located below the right side of the Navigation pane text box 
to go to each occurrence found in the document, or click any item of the list to go to the 
document place where the occurrence found resides (scroll the list if necessary to show 
more items found).
If there are too many occurrences of what is searched, the Navigation pane will not show 
them in the list: it will warn you to use its Pages option to show page thumbnails of where 
each result is. You can then click each page to displace the text to this specific position.
Figure 4-8.  Type whatever you want to search in the Navigation pane and 
Microsoft Word will instantly search and highlight each occurrence in the 
document, while the Navigation pane list will show all paragraphs in which it 
appears
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

162
Figure 4-9 shows what happens when you try to search for the article “the” using 
the Navigation pane: it finds 1,254 occurrences in the first five chapters of the “Count 
of Monte Cristo” book text, highlights them in the text, and warns you to select the 
Headings or Page options to see each result using different contexts. Figure 4-10 shows 
the Navigation pane Pages view, which presents page thumbnails for each page where 
the search found the desired text characters.
Attention  Select any text you want and press Ctrl+F to put whatever is selected 
into the Navigation pane text box and automatically search for it in the document.
The Navigation Pane Headings view will be discussed in Chapter 7.
Figure 4-9.  When the text searched has too many occurrences in the text, the 
Navigation pane indicates the count but does not show them as a list of items. 
Instead, it shows a warning message asking you to use its Headings and Pages 
options.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

163
Setting Find Options
The Navigation pane allows configuring how the search will be made by clicking the 
magnifying glass (or the small triangle pointing down located at the right side of its 
text box) to reveal a pop-up menu to define what you want to search and set searching 
options for character sequences (Figure 4-11).
Figure 4-10.  The Navigation pane Pages view shows page thumbnails of each 
page where the text result was found
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

164
By choosing any of the options located below the Find area of this pop-up menu 
(Graphics, Tables, Equations, Footnotes/Endnotes, or Comments), if any had been 
inserted in the document, Microsoft Word will instantly jump to the first option found 
and you will need to use the small buttons located below the text box to go to the next 
and previous items that may exist.
Click Options to show the Find Options dialog box and define further character 
search options, which exhibit most of the options found in the expanded view of the Find 
and Replace dialog box (see Figure 3-30).
To test the Navigate pane Find Options, I will use the “The Count Of Monte 
Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapters 1-5.docx” document as an example, considering 
that just one search option is checked at a time, and that the text cursor is located at 
the beginning of the document (press Ctrl+Home to return to the beginning of the 
document between each search; otherwise, Microsoft Word will begin from the current 
cursor position). Use the next and previous buttons located below the right side of the 
Navigation pane text box to select the results shown.
Figure 4-11.  Click the right side of the Navigation pane text box to select what 
will be searched (below the Find area), or select the Option… command to show 
the Find Options dialog box, from which you can define how Microsoft Word will 
perform the search.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

165
Attention  Whenever you choose Options to show the Find Options dialog box and 
click OK to close it, Microsoft Word inadvertently clears the text you are searching for.
Two of the Find Options dialogs relate just to the Navigation pane and the way it 
shows the search results (and are checked by default):
•	
Highlight All: highlight the text found in the document (with a yellow 
highlight, default option).
•	
Incremental Find: search as you type, without the need to press 
Enter (by unchecking it, you will need to press Enter to begin the 
search).
Two options make the search more specific to whatever you type:
•	
Match case: search for words using an exact combination of upper 
and lowercase characters. (e.g., typing “count” will return 19 
results including: “count”, “counts”, “countenance”, “accountable”, 
“country”, etc., but will not find “Count”).
•	
Find whole words only: search for a character sequence that begins 
a sentence or has a space before and after it. (e.g., typing “count”, 
“COUNT” or any other case combination returns 2 results, including: 
“COUNT” and “count”).
Two other search options for words that begin or end with the text sequence are as 
follows:
•	
Match prefix: find text sequences that begin with the characters 
typed (type “count” to return 15 results, including: “COUNT”, 
“countenance”, “country”.)
•	
Match suffix: find text sequences that end with the characters typed 
(type “count” to return 5 results including: “count” and “account”.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

166
One option is used to make pattern searches:
•	
Use wildcards: perform complex searches based on wildcard 
character patterns. The most known wildcards are the interrogation 
mark “?” to find any single character (type “Th?s” to return 103 
results, including “with spectator”, “this”, “those”, “thus”, etc.); and 
the asterisk “*” to find any character sequence until it reaches a space 
character (type “Th*” to return 1931 results, including “the”, “24th”, 
“with”, “this”, “worthy”, etc.
Attention  Wildcard searching options are explored on the section “Making 
Wildcard Searches” later in this chapter.
Two options make the search using phonetic or contextual word variations (which 
disable Match case, Find whole words only, Match prefix, and Match suffix options):
•	
Sounds like (English): find phonetic variations of the term searched 
(type “sun” to return 38 results, including: “seen”, “sewn”, “Son”, 
“son”, “soon”.
•	
Find all word forms (English): find English word variations 
commonly found in verb conjugations, gerunds, etc. (type “go” to 
return 52 results including: “go”, “going”, “gone”, “went”).
Two search options for just the words typed, not considering any punctuation or 
spaces between them, are as follows:
•	
Ignore punctuation characters: search for two ore more consecutive 
words, ignoring punctuation (like .,;:?!) between them (type “M de” to 
return 3 results, including “am determined”, “M. de Villefort"
•	
Ignore white space characters: search for two or more consecutive 
words ignoring one or more spaces between them.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

167
Using Advanced Find
The Advanced Find option found when you click the Find command in the Editing area 
of the Home tab of the Ribbon shows the previously seen Find and Replace dialog box 
with the Find tab selected (use the Ctrl+H shortcut).
By clicking the More>> button, the dialog box expands to show the same options 
found in the Find Option dialog box accessed by the Navigation pane, but also shows the 
Format and Special buttons already discussed in Chapter 2 (Figure 4-12).
Since both the Navigation pane and the Find tab of the Find and Replace dialog 
box can make most character search options—including wildcard searches—and 
considering that the Find and Replace dialog box is the only way that you can also 
make replacement operations, it will be used through the remainder of this book as the 
preferred way to make searches in any Microsoft Word document.
Figure 4-12.  The Advanced Find option found in the Find command in the 
Editing area of the Home tab of the Ribbon shows the Find and Replace dialog box 
with the Find tab selected by default. By clicking the More>> button, the dialog 
box expands and shows the same options found in the Find Options dialog box 
accessed by the Navigation pane.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

168
Attention  The Search Options of the Find and Replace dialog box relate to the 
Find Options dialog box: any option set in one dialog box (including the Find what 
text box) is already set in the other.
Making Wildcard Searches
Wildcard searches are important because they allow you to find character patterns in the 
text instead of specific character sequences, making for interesting and productive Find 
and Replace operations.
Whenever you check the Use wildcards option (in Find Options or Find and Replace 
dialog box), Microsoft Word will disable the Match case, Find whole word only, Match 
prefix, and Match suffix options (along with the Navigation pane Incremental find), 
while also changing its search behavior:
•	
A wildcard search is always case sensitive, meaning that upper- and 
lowercase letters differ.
•	
As in the normal search, the Special button found in the Find what 
and Replace dialog box shows two different sets of options according 
to whether the cursor is positioned inside the Find what text box or 
the Replace with text box.
•	
It will consider as wildcards the following characters: ?-*!<>@()[]{}.
You can confirm that information by clicking the Find what text box and then 
clicking the Special button to show its list options for wildcard searches. Note that the 
first nine listed options (from “Any Character” to “0 or More Characters,” which show 
their associated wildcard characters to the right) allow you to build pattern searches 
(Figure 4-13).
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

169
Attention  Look with more attention to the Find what Special list options and note 
that it has no provision to search for the Paragraph mark character (^p) used in 
the regular Find and Replace operations already performed in some of this book’s 
exercises.
By clicking the Replace tab with text box and clicking the Special button, the 
list option presented is totally different. Now just the first list option (“Find What 
Expression”) can be used for a pattern replacement (and at its right its associated 
wildcard character is also presented), while the “Find What Text” appears as an 
alternative for replacing what is found (Figure 4-14).
Figure 4-13.  The Special list options when the Find what text box is selected and 
the Use wildcards option is checked
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

170
This interface behavior change has two important meanings:
•	
To search for any wildcard character as a single text character 
that may exist in the text, you must precede the desired wildcard 
character by a backslash character “\”. (e.g., to search for the asterisk 
“*” on the text you must type \*).
•	
You can’t reuse the wildcard characters used in the Find what text 
box in the Replace with text box.
Wildcard characters are not easy to understand at first because they produce a kind 
of low-level search language: a kind of encrypted text that is very scary for most people. 
The next sections will try to make sense of wildcards and leave a registry of how you 
can use them to create regular expressions to make character pattern searches and take 
advantage of them whenever necessary.
Figure 4-14.  The Special list options when the Replace with text box is selected 
and the Use wildcards option is checked

171
Microsoft Word Wildcards
To effectively make wildcard search and replacement operation, it is necessary to 
understand each possible wildcard syntax so you can build expressions that can find the 
character patterns that you are looking for and eventually perform the desired replace 
operation. Table 4-1 shows all Microsoft wildcards you can use in the Find what text box, 
along with their usage and meaning.
Table 4-1.  Microsoft Word Wildcards Allowed in the Find what Text Box

Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

172
Attention  The ^p sequence used to search for a paragraph break in a regular 
Find operation is not allowed when Use wildcards option is set. As Table 4-1 
implies, you need to use the ^13 sequence instead (and this is not shown on the 
Special list options).
Find Wildcard Patterns
The next list briefly explores each of these wildcards using the “The Count Of Monte 
Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapters 1-5.docx” document as an example, considering 
that just the Use wildcards options is checked and that the quotes are not typed. You can 
practice using both the Navigate pane and the Find and Replace dialog box, selecting its 
Find tab. Note however that just the Navigate pane will detach the finding options with 
the yellow color and show how many results had been found for each example.
•	
Type “^13” to find 568 results, meaning that this book has 568 
paragraphs. Since this is a hidden character it will not be highlighted 
by the Navigation pane (but will be selected if you use the Next or 
Previous buttons).
•	
Type “?hat” to find 288 results, including “Chateau”, “that”, “what”, ” 
hat”, “hate”, etc.
•	
Type “we* ” (with a space suffix, necessary to stop the search at the end of  
the word) to find 200 results, including “between ”, “were ”, “However ”, 
“twenty ”, “we ”, “twenty-four ”, “tower ”, “lower,” “lowered ”, etc.
Attention  Typing “*we” or “*we ” (with a space suffix), everything is selected, 
because Microsoft Word will find everything before the first “we”, then everything 
after it and before the next “we”… till the end of the file.
•	
Type “o@” to find 5676 occurrences of the letter “o” alone or in 
succession like in “look”, “boom”, “poor”, “good”, “door”, etc.
•	
Type “<wh” to find 325 results of words that begin with “wh”, 
including “when”, “which”, “what”, “who”, “whole”, "why”, "when”, 
“whim”, “whom”, “where”, etc.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

173
•	
Type “st>” to find 182 results of words that end with “st”, including 
“lost”, “most”, “rest”, “against”, “last”, “must”, “just”, “almost”, 
“honest”, etc.
•	
Type “<[yw]” to find 1631 results of words that begin with “y” or “w” 
lowercase letters (search is case sensitive), including “with”, “where”, 
“when”, “young”, “you”, etc.
•	
Type “<[YW]” to find 183 results of words that begin with “Y” or 
“W” uppercase letter, including “Well”, “Yes”, “You”, “Who”, “Why”, 
“Well”, etc.
•	
Type “[yw]>” to find 1173 results of words that end with “y” or 
“w” lowercase letters, including “by”, “February”, “immediately”, 
“specially”, “narrow”, “saw”, “follow”, etc.
•	
Type ” ?[wzk]?” to find 282 results of words that begin with any letter 
(there is a space before the “?” wildcard) followed by the “w”, “z”, or 
“k” lowercase letters followed by any letter, including “like?”, “dwon”, 
“crownd”, “bespoke”, “we”, “crew”, “sewn”, “make”, “like”, etc.
•	
Type “ t[!h]?” to find 757 results of words that begin with a “t” 
lowercase letter (there is a space before the “t” letter) that isn’t 
followed by the “h” lowercase letter, and ends with any letter, 
including “to”, “topsails”, “towards”, “turned”, “talk”, etc.
•	
Type ” m[!a-p]?” to find 170 results of words that begin with an 
“m” lowercase letter (there is a space before the “m” letter) and is 
followed by any letter different then the lowercase letters “a” through 
“p”, followed by any other letter, including “much”, “must”, “my”, 
“myself”, “muttered”, “murmured”, etc.
Attention  The [-] wildcard represents a range of character that obeys the ASCII or 
ANSI character sequence found in any font. This sequence normally establishes this 
order: numbers (0-9), followed by uppercase letters (A-Z), followed by lowercase 
letters (a-z). This means that to search for any upper- or lowercase Latin letter you 
need to use a wildcard pattern like [A-z]. You can confirm this order by inspecting 
the Symbol dialog box character list (Insert tab ➤ Symbol ➤ Show Symbol).
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

174
•	
Type “<?o{2}” to find 166 results of words that begin with any letter 
followed by two successive “o” lowercase letters, including “too”, 
“door”, “good”, “looking”, “took”, “soon”, etc.
•	
Type “<[dgl][!o{2}]?” to find 752 results of words that begin with 
“d”, “g”, or “l” lowercase letters not followed by two successive “o” 
lowercase letters, including “la”, “laden”, “laden”, “like”, “guys”, 
“left”, “leaned”, “great”, “gave”, etc;
Find and Replace Wildcard Patterns
Using all the preceding operations, case you need to operate in the text found, you must 
employ the Replace command found in the Editing area of the Home tab of the Ribbon 
to show the Find and Replace dialog box, considering that:
•	
By leaving the Replace with text box empty (with no formatting 
options set) the Replace all command will remove all results found;
•	
By leaving the Replace with text box empty and selecting any 
formatting option (like bold, italic, highlight, etc.) the Replace all 
command will just change the format of all results found;
•	
To keep the text pattern found and aggregate it with some added text, 
click the Replace with text box and click Special ➤ Find what text 
option. Microsoft Word will add ^& as the replacement operation 
wildcard, which means each pattern found.
•	
To remove any of the wildcard patterns searched, embrace them with 
the ( ) operator and then use their number with the \n syntax in the 
Replace with text box.
•	
By using the ( ) wildcard pattern count operator to isolate wildcard 
patterns, you can just use \n wildcards up to the number of ( ) 
wildcards used in the Find what text box (e.g., the presence of two ( ) 
wildcards means that you can use \1 and \2, but not \3, or Microsoft 
Word will generate an error).
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

175
•	
When ( ) wildcard pattern count operator is used, not using one of 
the \n possible replacement wildcards means removing that wildcard 
pattern in the replacement operation (e.g., (^13)([a-z]) searches for 
a paragraph break and paragraphs that begin with a lowercase letter; 
by using \2 on the Replace with text box, the replacement operation 
will remove any paragraph mark before a paragraph and join the 
lowercase letter to the previous paragraph).
Try the next exercise:
•	
Type “(Edmond) (Dantes)” (there is a space between the two 
names) in the Find what text box.
•	
Type /2 /1 in the Replace with dialog box (there is a space between 
the two wildcard replacement patterns).
•	
Click Replace all to change eight results.
This is equivalent to finding every occurrence of “Edmund Dantes” and replacing 
with “Dantes Edmund”.
Attention  You can always undo the last Find and Replace operations by clicking 
the text and pressing Ctrl+Z (or selecting the Undo arrow in Microsoft Word Quick 
Access Toolbar located in the left corner of its title bar.
Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to use the wildcard pattern search to fix bad formatting in 
documents.
For the record: since the Microsoft Office 2007 release, Microsoft Word has been able 
to easily create PDF files (using the File ➤ Export ➤ Create PDF/XPS command), the 
so-called Portable Document Format developed by Adobe and widely used to generate 
read-only files and also open PDF files nicely, converting them to the docx format, as 
long as the original PDF file has no encryption or protection.
But since many people don’t know that, it is quite common to use a PDF printer 
third-party software (like CutePDF, PDFWriter, PDF Redirect, etc.) to generate PDF files 
even from inside Microsoft Word!
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

176
There is no problem with such PDF printer results because PDF files are almost 
always used for reading and eventually printing using the Adobe Reader, Fox Reader, and 
many other free PDF readers.
The problem arises when somebody opens such a PDF file and then copies and 
pastes its contents inside a Microsoft Word document. The document text may look nice 
enough, but it isn’t. It may become full of paragraph breaks in each of its lines.
Extract “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapters 1-5, Bad 
Formatting.docx” document from Chapter04.zip file, and open it in Microsoft Word. 
This document was created by a copy/paste process from “The Count of Monte Cristo, 
Alexandre Dumas, Chapters 1-5.pdf” file (that you can also extract from Chapter04.zip), 
which was produced by printing the associated Microsoft Word document in one of 
those PDF printers from Microsoft Word 2016 interface.
Click the Show/Hide tool found in the Home tab of the Ribbon to show its hidden 
characters and note that the document text is a mess: each text line is broken using a 
Paragraph break character (Figure 4-15).
Figure 4-15.  This is "The Count Of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapters 1-5. 
Bad Formatting.docx" document open inside Microsoft Word with the Show/Hide 
tools checked to show its hidden Paragraph marks
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

177
Attention  The PDF files created by Microsoft Word using the File ➤ Export ➤ 
Create PDF/XPS command do not produce this kind of paragraph break for each 
text line.
Make a wildcard pattern search to quickly and easily correct this not-uncommon 
situation, producing a perfect document by removing the Paragraph marks of each text 
line and keeping them when the text has a paragraph break
Checking for Paragraph Breaks
Looking with more attention at the “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, 
Chapters 1-5, Bad Formatting.docx”, you will realize that every real paragraph break in 
the document:
•	
ends with a period, exclamation point, question mark, or double 
quote.
•	
has the next line beginning with an uppercase letter.
You can check this by making a wildcard search with the Navigation pane (Ctrl+F) 
using the Use wildcards option and the [".\!\?]^13 wildcard as search pattern, which 
means:
•	
[“.\!\?] searches for any of characters inside the brackets (”.!?).
Attention  Not e that since “!” and “?” are wildcards they need to be preceded 
by the backslash “\” to be found as text character. Otherwise, Microsoft Word will 
complain that the search pattern has invalid characters.
•	
^13 searches for a Paragraph break after any of the previously found 
characters.
Figure 4-16 shows that this Find operation results using the Navigation Pane 
returned 578 results in the document, which were highlighted in the text.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

178
Attention  The document received a 140% zoom and was divided to show two 
different areas (using the View ➤ Split command, which was renamed to Remove 
Split) so you can show the period (.) and double quote (”) characters (followed by 
the ¶ Paragraph mark) selected in the text.
Fixing Line Breaks
To make the change and fix the text, you need to do the opposite: fix the normal line 
breaks by changing every incorrect paragraph mark by a space. Or in wildcard search 
jargon, search for Paragraph mark characters followed by any lowercase letters and 
change them to a space followed by the lowercase text found. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the Replace command found in the Editing area of the Home 
tab of the Ribbon to show the Find and Replace dialog box.
	 2.	 Click More>> and check Use wildcards option.
Figure 4-16.  Using the Navigation pane, you check the Use wildcards option 
(expand the text box and click Options) and use the [".\!\?]^13 pattern to find each 
Paragraph mark that really defines a paragraph break
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

179
	 3.	 In the Find what text box, type “(^13)([a-z])” (without the quotes).
	 4.	 In the Replace with text box, type a space and “\2.” The Find what 
text box must receive the “ \2” wildcard pattern (there is a space 
before \2 wildcard replacement option).
	 5.	 Click Replace all button.
Microsoft Word will replace every Paragraph break followed by a lowercase letter by 
a space followed by the lowercase letter found (the \2 wildcard, Figure 4-17).
Figure 4-17.  To fix the text, use the Find and Replace dialog box with the Use 
wildcards options checked. In the Find what text box, type (^13)([a-z]), and in the 
Replace with text box type, “ \2” (without the quotes, with a space preceding the \ 
character). Click Replace all to make 727 replacements.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

180
And as explained before, this wildcard search and replace option works this way:
•	
The (^13)([a-z]) wildcard pattern typed in the Find what text box 
defines two different wildcard patterns:
•	
(^13) search for a Paragraph break (the Replace with text box 
recognizes it as \1 wildcard pattern).
•	
([a-z]) search for any lowercase letter (the Replace with text box 
recognizes it as \2 wildcard pattern).
•	
The “ \2” (without the quotes) wildcard pattern typed in the Replace 
with text box replaces whatever was found by a space followed by the 
second pattern searched (the lowercase letter), literally removing the 
Paragraph mark character.
The document is now ready to be formatted using other search and replace operations.
Quite cool, huh?
Attention  There is no guarantee that each and every Paragraph mark followed 
by an uppercase letter will really begin a new paragraph in the text. But such a 
search will approximate very well to the original text paragraph breaks.
Exercise 2
This objective of this exercise is to use a wildcard search to remove unwanted, hidden 
characters that insert line breaks in the text.
Extract “The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Daniel Defoe, Bad Formatting.
docx” document from Chapter04.zip file and open it in Microsoft Word. It is a 151-page 
document with the original text of the famous 19th-century book of Daniel Defoe.
Click the Show/Hide button and note that this is a document copied from a PDF 
file previously created with a PDF Printer (not with Microsoft Word File ➤ Export 
command): every line of text ends with a Paragraph mark (Figure 4-18).
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

181
Scroll through the text and note that it seems that this document begins its 
paragraphs using just an uppercase letter (no paragraph seems to begin with a  
” or — character). Do the next exercise list:
•	
Check the Use wildcard option (either in the Find Options or Find 
and Replace dialog box).
•	
Use the Navigation pane to search for each chapter title using 
wildcards (use CHAPTER*^13) pane and use the list results to quickly 
move for each of the 20 chapter titles (note the word CHAPTER in 
uppercase).
•	
Use the Replace command to find every chapter title paragraph and 
replace its format with these formatting options:
•	
Font: Garamond, 16 pt, Bold.
•	
Paragraph: Alignment = Centered, Spacing After = 24 pt, Page 
break before.
Figure 4-18.  This is the 151-page “The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, 
Daniel Defoe, Bad Formatting.docx” document that you can extract from the 
Chapter04.zip file
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

182
•	
Remove all 5,666 unwanted line breaks by finding any Paragraph 
mark not followed by an uppercase letter using these options  
(use Clear Formatting button to remove the Replace with formatting 
before clicking the Replace all button):
•	
Find what: (^13)([!A-Z])
•	
Replace with: “ \2” (without the quotes, there is a space before 
the \ character to substitute the Paragraph mark found).
•	
Scroll through the text and note that some paragraph breaks are 
still wrong: they end with a lowercase letter and a Paragraph mark, 
and the next line begins with an uppercase letter. Fix these 152 
occurrences using these options:
•	
Find what: ([a-z])(^13)([A-Z])
•	
Replace with: “\1 \3” (without the quotes; there is a space 
between the 1 and the \ character that follows it to replace the 
Paragraph mark in between the text found);
Attention  This last operation will wrongly affect the book title and author name 
(which became a single paragraph), joining it with the first chapter title; this will 
need to be manually broken by an Enter key and centered.
•	
Uncheck the Use wildcard option to search for every body text 
paragraph (in Find what option, set these Font properties:Calibri 
12 pt) and replace it with these formatting options (in Replace with 
option set these Font properties):
•	
Font: Trebuchet MS, 11 pt.
•	
Paragraph: Alignment = Justified, First line indent = 0.3, Line 
spacing = Single, Widow/Orphan control.
The document must now have 142 pages, and must be similar to the one you found 
by extracting “The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Daniel Defoe, Formatted.
docx” from Chapter 04.zip file, which received all these formatting options plus a manual 
change in the book title and author name formatting (Figure 4-19).

Summary
Microsoft Word allows you to quickly move and select the text of any document by using 
the Home, End, Page Up, Page Down, and arrow keys. With the aid of Ctrl, Shift, and Alt 
alone or together and the mouse, you can easily move or select the text you want and 
apply simple operations like cut, copy, paste, and format.
It also offers two different ways to search the document: using the Navigation pane 
and using the Find and Replace dialog box, with the Find or Replace tab selected.
You can make simple searches using different search options or make complex 
character pattern searches using wildcard characters.
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

184
In this chapter you learned the following:
•	
The Home and End keys can move to the beginning or end of a text 
line, and keeping Ctrl pressed allows you to move to beginning or end 
of the document.
•	
The Shift key turns on text selection, and Ctrl key is the multiply 
movement key.
•	
Using Ctrl+Arrows key, you can move from word to word or 
paragraph to paragraph.
•	
The Page Down and Page Up keys alone make Microsoft Word 
displace a screen of text.
•	
Using Ctrl+Page Down or Ctrl+Page Up, you can move to the 
beginning of the next or previous page.
•	
You can select a word with double-click and a paragraph with a 
triple-click.
•	
Ctrl+A selects the entire document.
•	
By moving the mouse cursor to the left margin, a single click selects 
the text line, a double click selects the paragraph, and a triple click 
selects the text.
•	
Ctrl+Click selects sentences.
•	
You can move the text selected by dragging it with the mouse, or 
copying it by keeping Ctrl pressing while dragging it.
•	
By keeping Alt left pressed, clicking and dragging the mouse through 
the text, you can make a columnar selection.
•	
You can make search operations using either the Navigation pane 
(Ctrl+F) or the Find tab of the Find or Replace dialog box.
•	
The Navigation pane highlights the text found in the document.
•	
Both interfaces have advanced search options that may restrict 
(whole word, match case) or extend what is searched (match prefix or 
suffix, sounds like, English word forms).
Chapter 4  Select, Find, and Replace Text Characters

185
•	
Wildcard searches are the most powerful search option because they 
operate based on search patterns.
•	
The ^p associated to a Paragraph mark in a normal search can’t be 
used in a wildcard search: use ^13 instead.
•	
The ( ) is used to identify wildcard patterns typed on the Find what 
text box, that are operated with \n option in the Replace with text box 
(where n represents the ( ) count).
In the next chapter, you will learn how you can create quick and consistent 
formatting options through one or many documents using Styles.

CHAPTER 5
Quick Document 
Formatting with Styles
After all this talk about typography, paragraph and text formatting in Chapters 2 and 3, 
you are probably thinking that text formatting is a very laborious and complicated task, 
very prone to errors due to the difficulty of equally implementing the same formatting in 
similar paragraphs scattered across the pages of long text documents.
Fortunately, this is not true! You can attribute many different formatting options to 
a style, name it, and then apply it to the same paragraph type to easily standardize the 
text format. By using different styles in a single document (for title, headings, body text, 
quotes, etc.), you can create what is called an “visual editorial standard” for a document, 
and then easily apply it to different documents that must share the same formatting 
options, making what is technically called “Desktop Publishing.”
In this chapter you will learn everything about styles: how to create, apply, change, 
and manage them in Microsoft Word documents.
The documents used as examples and the ones cited in the Exercise sections can be 
found by downloading Chapter05.zip file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
The Style Gallery
You already know that each new empty document opened in Microsoft Word has an 
empty paragraph, but chances are that you never noticed that this empty paragraph is 
formatted with the Normal style.

188
You can confirm this information looking to the Style Gallery found in the Style area 
of the Home tab of the Ribbon: the large control area full of “AaBbCcDd” items that 
Microsoft Word uses to show the selected style and a partial list of the styles available in 
the current document, where the Normal style is selected by default.
Each style name shown is formatted in the Style Gallery using its current font options 
(font, size, color, spacing, borders, etc.) so you can anticipate the appearance that each 
one will give to the text when selected (Figure 5-1).
Attention  The Style Gallery width changes accordingly as the Microsoft Word 
window width changes. It may show more or fewer styles in its first row depending 
on the monitor size, screen resolution, and window state (restored, maximized) you 
are using.
Click the small arrow at the bottom right of the Style Gallery to expand it and exhibit 
some other styles available for this document. Note that it also offers three different 
commands: Create a Style, Clear Formatting, and Apply Styles.
Figure 5-1.  The Normal style is applied by default to the empty poragraph found 
in every new Microsoft Word document
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

189
Figure 5-2 names some important elements of the Style Gallery.
Figures 5-1 and 5-2 show the Style Gallery with the Normal style selected, meaning 
that the current text paragraph is formatted, or associated to it.
Having the cursor positioned inside any text paragraph, you can easily see how it 
will look when receiving another style by just pointing the mouse over the desired style. 
Drag the mouse over the styles in the Style Gallery and note that some styles change the 
appearance of the entire text paragraph, while others change the appearance of just the 
word where the cursor is positioned.
By clicking any style you change the text association to it, meaning that the desired 
text is now formatted, or associated to the style chosen.
Figure 5-2.  Click the bottom right arrow of the Style Gallery to expand it and 
show some other styles available in the document, and its three command options
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

190
Try to successively click Heading 1, Heading 2, Title, and Subtitle (available in the 
first Style Gallery row) and notice how the selected paragraph immediately changes its 
appearance (font, size, color, etc.) by receiving all of the style format (Figure 5-3).
Now try to select one or more words and select a style such as NoSpacing, Heading1, 
or Emphasis in the Styles Gallery. Note that for most styles just the selected text will be 
formatted with the style options, while for a few, the entire paragraph is formatted. When 
just the selected words are formatted, the entire paragraph keeps its default formatting 
options. Figure 5-4 shows a Normal style paragraph that received the Heading1 style in 
some of its words. It remained formatted with Normal style while some words received 
the Heading1 style.
Figure 5-3.  Click anywhere in the text and select a new style to apply all its 
formatting options to the entire text paragraph: there is no need to select the text 
when selecting paragraph formatting styles
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

191
And as a last exercise, click the mouse inside any word (don’t select its characters, 
however) and drag the mouse over the styles named Subtle Em…, Emphasis, Intense E… 
and Strong, Subtle Ref…, Intense R… or Book Title (you may need to expand the Style 
Gallery to find them), and note that for these styles, just the word where the cursor is 
positioned receives the style format (Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-4.  You can apply some styles to just the selected text. In this case, the 
entire paragraph will be kept associated to its default style (Normal style in this 
case), while the selected words will receive the font formatting associated to the 
applied style.
Figure 5-5.  Some styles apply their formatting options to just the word under the 
cursor (or to the selected text). They are called character styles.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

192
This style behavior is possible because there are three main types of styles:
•	
Paragraph styles: apply formatting options to the  
entire text paragraph (whether or not some text inside it  
is selected).
•	
Character styles: apply formatting options to the word where the 
cursor is positioned (or to the selected text).
•	
Linked (paragraph and character): apply formatting style to the 
entire text paragraph if nothing is selected, or to just the selected text 
(as character styles do).
Attention  As you will see later, Microsoft Word also allows the creation of 
Table styles (a single style name that can be applied to different table parts), and 
List styles (which can be used to format bullets and numberings, using different 
formatting options for the bullet/number and text parts).
Recommended Styles
The style set offered by default in the Style Gallery are called Recommended styles. Most 
of them have meaningful names that indicate where in the document text they must 
be applied. Table 5-1 shows their names and probable usages in the order they are 
presented by the Style Gallery.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

193
The Styles Window
You may now wondering how you can easily differentiate styles by their usage: it is a 
paragraph style, a character style, or a linked style? The best way to do this is to click 
the (very) small square button located at the bottom right corner of the Style area of the 
Home tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 5-2) to show the Styles windows (Figure 5-6).

Microsoft Word Styles window is used to manage styles and by default shows the 
styles in the same order that they appear in the Style Gallery. It may appear as first 
docked at the right side of the document, but you can make it float over the Microsoft 
Word interface by clicking and dragging its title bar (where you read “Styles”) inside the 
document window. To dock it again, double-click its title bar (Figure 5-7).
Figure 5-6.  Microsoft Word Styles window docked at right of the document area
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

195
Attention  The Styles window does not change the text appearance when you 
scroll the mouse through its styles, as the Style Gallery does. You must keep the 
Show Preview option checked to see the style appearance in the list, or click the 
style to format the text.
The Styles window may show styles using different presentation formats. By default it 
has the Show Preview option checked so you can see each style name formatted using its 
own style options. It shows at the right of each style name a small icon that indicates the 
style type (Figure 5-8):
¶ Paragraph style
a Character style
¶a Linked (paragraph and character) style
Figure 5-7.  The Styles window floating over the document, after being dragged by 
its title bar
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

196
It also offers two main options:
•	
Show preview: enable/disable the preview format applied to the style 
name (checked by default).
•	
Disable linked styles: when checked, make styles defined as 
Linked (paragraph and character) behave as Paragraph styles: their 
formatting options will be always applied to the entire paragraph, 
whether or not some text has been selected.
The Styles window is the place from where you can best manage the styles available 
in any document. It allows you to create new styles and inspect and manage the styles 
that appear inside it. It also allows personalization, giving you the chance to select 
which styles must be shown and in which presentation order. It is also resizable when it 
is floating over the document, so you can extend or shrink both its height and width by 
dragging its borders or corners (try it).
Figure 5-8.  The Styles window in its floating state. It has icons to the right of the 
styles to indicate their type, and can show/hide the stype formatting.

The Style Pane Dialog Box
Click the Options… link located at the bottom right corner of the Styles window to show 
the Style Pane Option dialog box from where you can define how the styles are presented 
in the Styles window list (this option doesn’t apply to the Style Gallery, Figure 5-9).
Figure 5-9.  The Style Pane Options dialog box, which allows changing styles 
shown by the Styles window and their presentation order
The Style Pane Options dialog box may be too complex to be fully understood all at 
once, so I will teach about it throughout the book as its various functionalities need to be 
brought forward. For the sake of the present discussion, try to use some of these options:
•	
Select styles to show: use this combo box to choose which styles will 
appear in the Styles windows:
•	
Recommended: show the same styles that appear in the Style 
Gallery.
•	
In use: show just the styles that have been applied in the current 
document (even if they are not applied anymore).
•	
In current document: show all styles stored inside this 
document, having been applied or not.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

198
•	
All styles: show all styles available, including the ones stored 
in the document template and that are not visible in the Style 
Gallery (an enormous list of styles is available for use).
•	
Show how list is sorted: define the order that the styles appear in the 
Styles window:
•	
Alphabetical: style names in ascending order.
•	
As Recommended: style names use the same order presented by 
the Style Gallery.
•	
Font: style names sorted in ascending order by the font name it 
uses;
•	
Based on: style names sorted by the style on which they are 
based (if any).
•	
By type: style names sorted by its type name (Character, Linked, 
and Paragraph types).
Attention  As you will see later in this book, Microsoft Word allows implying style 
inheritance by making a style be based on another one. This means that if some 
formatting attribute is changed in the base style, all other styles that are based on 
it will instantly receive that attribute.
By changing the Select styles to show option, you can limit or expand the style 
list. For example, for the document shown in Figure 5-6 (which uses just the Normal 
and Heading1 styles) use the “In use” option to show just these two styles in the Styles 
window (Figure 5-10).
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

199
But when you select the “All styles” option, the Styles window will show all styles 
available both in the document and in the template upon which it’s based: the style list 
will be populated by many style names that do not appear in the Style Gallery.  
Figure 5-­11 shows the “All styles” option in action, keeping the Show how list is  
sorted = As Recommended.
Figure 5-10.  The Styles windows showing just the styles in use in the document 
sorted “As Recommended” (Normal and Heading 1, same Style Gallery sort order). 
The Clear All and Default Paragraph font are always shown.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

200
The Normal Style
As Figure 5-1 shows, every new Microsoft Word document has just a single text 
paragraph formatted with the Normal style. And since almost nobody realizes this or 
even knows what styles are, probably most Word documents created use just the Normal 
style, which makes it the most used style in the world.
Open any document you already produced in Microsoft Word (or any document 
cited on the Exercise sections of Chapters 2 and 3), scroll through the text, and note 
that every paragraph is formatted using just the Normal style. This phenomenon will 
probably repeat in almost all Microsoft Word documents you have at hand.
And since the Normal style is so used, you can quickly change the format of a 
text document without making any text selection by just updating the Normal style 
properties.
Figure 5-11.  The Styles window showing all available styles for the document, 
sorted “As Recommended.” Note that now you see Heading1 to Heading9 styles.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

Updating the Normal Style
Microsoft Word allows the Normal style properties to be changed in three different ways:
	 1.	 With the Font and Paragraph dialog box.
	 2.	 Using Match Selection option.
	 3.	 Using the Modify style dialog box.
The first option affects just the Normal style—and all other styles that are based on it, 
which makes it so special—while the second and third options can be used by any other 
style.
Updating Normal with the Font and Paragraph Dialog Boxes
The most easiest and complete way to update the Normal style is using the “Set as 
Default” button found in the Paragraph and Font dialog boxes.
By changing Font and Paragraph dialog box options and clicking their Set as Default 
button, you will receive a warning message that allows you to define if the changes made 
will be applied to this document only or to every other new document created with 
Microsoft Word (Figure 5-12).
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

202
Attention  Each dialog box will show a short description of the new Font and 
Formatting options that will be used by the Normal style.
Updating Styles by Match Selection
The second way you can update the Normal or any other style of the Style Gallery is quite 
simple:
	 1.	 Apply the style (or the desired style) to a text paragraph.
	 2.	 Change all formatting to this paragraph (font, paragraph, border, 
color, language, etc.).
	 3.	 Right-click the style name in the Style Gallery and choose “Update 
<style> to Match the Selection” command.
Figure 5-12.  Use the Set as Default buttons of the Font and Paragraph dialog 
box to redefine the appearance of the Normal style to the current or any other new 
Microsoft Word document
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

203
The style in use will be immediately changed to match the paragraph formatting 
options, and all other paragraphs that received this style will reflect such changes. 
Figure 5-13 shows how you can locally change a Normal paragraph style, right-click the 
Normal style in the Style Gallery, and choose Update Normal to Match the Selection, 
affecting all other Normal style paragraphs in the text.
Attention  There is no need to select the entire paragraph text to change it with 
the Match the Selection option: click anywhere inside the paragraph, right-click its 
name in the Style Gallery, and choose Update <style> to Match Selection.
Figure 5-13.  Apply the desired style to any text paragraph, right-click its name in 
the Style Gallery, and choose Update <style> to Match the Selection to update the 
style format. All paragraphs that received the style will be automatically formatted 
to reflect the style.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

204
Updating with the Modify Style Dialog Box
The third method used to update a style is by using the Modify Style dialog box:
	 1.	 Right-click the style name in the Style Gallery;
	 2.	 Select the Modify.... command.
Microsoft Word will open the Modify Style dialog box (Figure 5-14), which offers 
controls to change the Normal style name, inheritance, appearance, visibility in the Style 
Gallery, and scope of the change (this document only or any other new document).
Use the Properties area to change Normal style name, type, and inheritance properties:
•	
Name: the style name (as appears in Style Gallery and Styles 
windows).
•	
Style type: choose between Character, Paragraph, and Linked (character 
and paragraph). This option is disabled for styles already created.
Figure 5-14.  Right-click any style in the Style Gallery and choose the Modify… 
command to show the Modify Style dialog box
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

205
•	
Style for following paragraph: define the style inheritance, or the 
style applied in the next paragraph when you press Enter in any 
paragraph formatted with this style. By default, any Normal style 
paragraph generates another Normal style paragraph.
Use the Formatting area of the Modify Style dialog box to change the style 
appearance:
•	
Font properties: font, size, bold, italic, underline, and color.
•	
Paragraph properties: alignment, line spacing, increase/decrease 
the Space Before and After (by 6 pt each time), and increase/decrease 
Left indentation by the default tab stop value.
In the middle of the Modify Style dialog box, the white text box shows a preview 
example of current style formatting options. At the bottom left area of the Modify Style 
dialog box you can also define if the style must be shown in the Style Gallery and where 
the scope of the change it undergoes must be stored:
•	
Add the style to the Style Gallery: check to make the style appear in 
the Style Gallery. This option appears checked for all recommended 
styles already shown in the Style Gallery.
•	
Define where the changes must be stored:
•	
Only in this document: the style change affects just this 
document text-it will not be applied to new Microsoft Word 
documents.
•	
New documents based on this template: affects every new 
document created with Microsoft Word Normal.dotx template 
(the standard document template).
Also note that at the bottom left corner of the Modify Style dialog box, there is a 
Format button that expands when you click it, showing other style formatting options 
(Figure 5-15). Using the Format button, you can access the Fonts, Paragraph, Tabs, 
Border, Language, Frame, Numbering, Language, Shortcut key, and Text Effects dialog 
boxes to format the style.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

206
Associate the Normal Style with a Shortcut Key
From my point of view, the best way to apply some Microsoft Word styles is by 
associating them to a mnemonic shortcut key, so you can quickly apply them without 
needing to locate them using the Style Gallery or the Styles window.
For more than two decades I have been using Microsoft Word with its Normal 
style associated to the Ctrl+Space shortcut key, because it is quite easy to apply and 
remember, but you can select any other Ctrl, Shift, and/or Alt + letter combinations to 
create your preferred shortcut key. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Modify Style dialog box, click Format ➤ Shortcut key… command.
	 2.	 Microsoft Word will show the Customize Keyboard dialog box for 
the Normal style (or the style name you are editing), with focus on 
the Press shortcut key text box.
	 3.	 Press the shortcut key you want to associate to the style (press the 
Alt, Ctrl, Shift key combinations first and then type the desired 
character).
	 4.	 Microsoft Word will show the shortcut key typed in the Press 
new shortcut key option (Ctrl+Space). Note that below the 
Current keys option there is an indication if the desired shortcut 
is already assigned to another Microsoft Word command or style 
(Figure 5-16).
Figure 5-15.  Use the Format button of the Modify Style dialog box to bring the 
associated Microsoft Dialog box, from which you can select further style options
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

207
	 5.	 Since the Assign button has the focus, press Enter to assign the 
desired shortcut key to the selected style (or click the Assign 
button), to transfer the shortcut key to the Current keys option 
(Figure 5-17).
Figure 5-16.  Use Format ➤ Shortcut key… command of the Modify Style dialog 
box to show the Customize KeyBoard dialog box to associate a shortcut key to the 
style you are editing. Note that below Current keys option (which is empty), there 
is an indication if the typed shortcut key is currently assigned to another Microsoft 
Word command.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

208
Figure 5-17.  After typing the desired shortcut key, select the scope of the 
association (choose Normal.dotm to associate it to Microsoft Word, or <Document 
name> to store the association for just this document). Click Close to close 
Customize KeyBoard dialog box and create the shortcut key association.
	 6.	 Use the Save changes in option to define the shortcut scope:
•	
Normal.dotx: select this option to make the style shortcut 
available to every Microsoft Word document.
•	
<Document name>: use this option to store the shortcut style 
inside this document (it will not work in other documents).
	 7.	 Since the Close button received the focus, press the Enter key (or 
click the Close button) to close the Customize Keyboard dialog 
box, associate the style to the keyboard shortcut, and return to the 
Modify Style dialog box (Figure 5-17).
When you close the Customize Keyboard dialog box, the focus will return to the 
Modify Style dialog box. To really complete the keyboard shortcut association, you must 
close the Modify Style dialog box by clicking its OK button.
From this point on, try to use the associated keyboard shortcut in the text to apply 
the Normal style.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

209
Attention  From this point on in this book, I will suppose that you are using 
Ctrl+Space keyboard to apply the Normal style whenever necessary.
Global and Local Formatting
You already know that the Normal style is the default style used to format new 
documents, and that you can change the text formatting options for any amount of text, 
without the use of styles: just select the text and use the Font and Paragraph dialog box, 
for example.
What happens when you change the style applied to a text paragraph is that you 
apply a global formatting, and when you select text and change its formatting options, 
you apply a local formatting (like Figure 5-13 did before updating the Normal style using 
the Match the Selection option).
In Microsoft Word and many other professional software packages, local formatting 
has precedence over global formatting: a very reasonable decision meaning that the 
local formatting applied to the text will remain unchanged by a global formatting 
change.
In other words, if a text paragraph has the Normal style applied, and part of its text 
has a different formatting option (some of its characters or words received bold, italic, 
another character spacing, color, language, etc.), whenever you change the global 
formatting option (the style), this change will not affect the local formatting option 
applied to the selected text.
Let make this clear: if a Normal style paragraph needs some words to be formatted 
using italic, when you apply a Quote style formatted with regular font (not italic), the 
italicized words will remain italic.
Take on the next simple exercise:
	 1.	 Type two different text paragraphs using the default Normal style.
	 2.	 In one of these paragraphs, select some of its words and change 
the font used and some of its attributes (like bold, italic, color,  
size, etc.).
	 3.	 Using the techniques described in the previous section, change 
the Normal style font to a different font used either by the style or 
to the text words changed in step 2.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

210
The paragraph words that received the local font and attribute changes will not be 
automatically updated to reflect the new font associated to the Normal style. Or in other 
words, the local font formatting applied to some words of the Normal paragraph style 
will have precedence over the global font now used by the Normal style (Figure 5-18).
Figure 5-18.  Changes made in the Normal style do not apply to local text 
formatting. In this figure, the Normal style font was changed from Calibri to Comic 
Sans, and the bold and Verdana words were not affected.
So we can write a simple inheritance law to make a Global style change:
Any change made to a specific style attribute will also be made in all text 
formatted with this style (or any other style that is based on it) unless the 
text (or the style based on it) has this attribute locally defined.
Those global changes made in the Normal style may impact other recommended 
Microsoft Word styles that are based on it, leading to unexpected changes in other 
document paragraphs; this may make you feel that you have little control over text 
formatting.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

211
Normal Style Inheritance
To understand the Normal style inheritance, inspect any recommended styles that may 
be affected by changes made to the Normal style: Heading1, Heading2, Title, Quote, and 
Intense Quote:
	 1.	 Right-click the style in the Style Gallery.
	 2.	 Choose Modify… to show the Modify Style dialog box.
	 3.	 Note that in the Property area, the Style based on property is 
defined to Normal.
Attention  By right-clicking any style in the Style Gallery or the Styles window, 
you can select Modify… to inspect its properties without applying it to the text.
Figure 5-19 shows the Modify Style dialog box evoked to the Heading1 style.
Figure 5-19.  The Modify Style dialog box evoked for the Heading1 recommended 
style
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

212
Note that Heading1 has these style Properties set:
•	
Style Type = Linked (character and paragraph) (disabled).
•	
Style based on = Normal.
•	
Style for following paragraph = Normal.
Now look to the style example area and see its format appearance. Also look to the 
style description area and note the specific formatting option it received, which made it 
different from the Normal style upon which it is based:
•	
Font: (Default) +Headings (Calibri Light), 16 pt.
•	
Font color: Accent 1.
•	
Space Before: 12 pt
•	
Keep with next
•	
Keep lines together
•	
Level 1
•	
Style: Linked
•	
Show in the Style Gallery
•	
Priority: 10
These differences are the local style formatting options that will not change 
whenever the Normal style changes the same options. For example, Heading1 has the 
blue color called Accent 1. This means that no matter the color you apply to normal, 
Heading1 will always be a blue, Accent1 color (local style formatting).
But note that this style has no first-level indent option defined. This means that if the 
Normal style first-level indent value is changed, the Heading1 first-level indent level will 
be affected, because it is based on Normal. The same is true for other font and paragraph 
formatting options not locally applied to the Heading1 style, like Bold, Italic, Underline, 
Line spacing, Alignment, and so on.
Let us see this inheritance behavior in action with a simple exercise.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

213
Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to confirm the Normal style inheritance.
Extract the “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen Chapters 1-3 Calibri 11pt.docx” 
Microsoft Word document from Chapter05.zip file and open it in Microsoft Word. It 
should be similar to what you see in Figure 5-20 if you checked the Paragraphs mark 
option in the Display area of the Word Options dialog box (see the section “Choosing 
Which Hidden Characters to Show” in Chapter 2 for more information).
Figure 5-20.  The “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen Chapters1-3, Calibri 11pt.
docx” Microsoft Word document extracted from Chapter05.zip. The first paragraph 
is formatted with the recommended Heading1 style, and all the remaining text is 
formated with the default Normal style (Calibri, 11 pt)
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

214
Note that it is entirely formatted with default Microsoft Word Normal style 
(Calibri, 11 pt, left aligned, Line spacing = 1.15). It also has its first chapter (“Sense and 
Sensibility”) formatted with the Heading1 style.
Let’s quickly apply a Bold formatting to the entire text just changing the Normal style 
applied to the second paragraph:
	 1.	 Triple-click the second text paragraph formatted with the Normal 
style to select it (or select just the pilcrow ¶ character, if is visible, 
because paragraph formatting options are stored there).
	 2.	 Apply the Bold format.
	 3.	 Right-click the Normal style either in Style Gallery or in the Styles 
window and select the Update Normal to Match the Selection 
option.
All the document text will become bold, because it all has the Normal style. The first 
paragraph formatted with the Heading style also becomes Bold because it is based on 
Normal, and received Bold by inheritance (Figure 5-21).
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

215
Figure 5-21.  If you apply Bold to the entire text of any Normal style paragraph 
(or just to its hidden pilcrow ¶ character), by updating the Normal style to Match 
Selection, all Normal style pagraphs and the ones based on it (like Heading1) will 
receive bold by inheritance
Now try to make a Normal style change that will not propagate to any “based on 
Normal” style (like Headings1):
	 1.	 Select any word of a Normal style paragraph and change its color 
(select Red, for example).
	 2.	 Right-click the Normal style in either Style Gallery or the Styles 
window and select the Update Normal to Match the Selection 
option.
The red color applied to the text will change the default Normal style color, which 
will affect all Normal styles. But since Heading1 is formatted with the Accent 1 blue color, 
it will not react to the new Normal style color: its local formatting has precedence over 
global formatting option of the style that it is based on (Figure 5-22).
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

216
Creating New Styles
You can create your own set of styles to format your documents using one of these 
methods almost in the same way that’s used to modify an existing style:
•	
Create from selection: first format a text paragraph with all desired 
attributes and then associate them to a style name
•	
Create from scratch: evoke the Create a New Style from Formatting 
dialog, define the text attributes using the Format button, and then 
apply them to the text
I think the first option is preferred because you can format a text paragraph the 
way you want, applying all desired options like Font, Paragraph, Border, Shades, 
Color, Language, and so on, until it has the desired appearance, and then evoking the 
previously discussed Modify Style dialog box, using one of these methods:
Figure 5-22.  By changing the Normal style color to red, the Heading1 style will not 
be affected because it specifies its own color (local formatting)
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

217
•	
Use the Create Style command offered by the expanded Style Gallery 
(see Figure 5-2), which will show the Create a New Style from 
Formatting dialog box, from which you must type the new style name 
and choose Modify… (Figure 5-23)
Figure 5-23.  You can create a new style by either expanding the Style Gallery and 
selecting the Create a Style command, which will show the Create the New Style 
from Formatting dialog box, or clicking the New Style button of the Styles window
•	
Click the New Style button of the Styles window
Attention  If you click OK in the Create a New Style from Formatting dialog box 
shown by the Create a Style command, the style will be created using the Style 
Type = Linked (character and paragraph), which cannot be changed anymore. 
Use the Modify button instead to allow control of this property before the style is 
created.
Both options will end up showing the previously discussed Modify Style dialog 
box using the selected paragraph formatting options as a base for the new style being 
created, showing on its title bar the expression “Create a New Style from Formatting,” to 
remember that this style still doesn’t exist (Figure 5-24).
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

218
The “Create New Style from Formatting” dialog box will inherit all current paragraph 
formatting options, associate them to their formatting commands (font, size, bold, italic, 
underline, color, alignment, line spacing, space before and after, and left indent), and 
show the details in the style description area (see Figure 5-19 for a better description).
To create a new style, follow these instructions:
	 1.	 Format the text with the desired properties (you can change them 
later).
	 2.	 Show the “Create New Style from Formatting” dialog box and type 
the style name (default name is Style1, if it doesn’t exist).
	 3.	 Select the style Properties: Style type, Style based on, Style for the 
following paragraph.
Figure 5-24.  Whenever you try to create a new style, Microsoft Word will end up 
showing the Modify Style dialog box with the “Create New Style from Formatting” 
title, and showing all Properties options enabled
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

219
	 4.	 Change the basic formatting options using the dialog box control 
or click the Format button located to the bottom right to show 
additional formatting dialog boxes.
	 5.	 Finally, associate a shortcut key to the style.
	 6.	 IMPORTANT: click OK to create the style.
All new styles will appear at the first positions of the Style Gallery.
Figure 5-25 shows the Style1 style created using the default options you see in 
Figure 5-24 (a perfect copy of the Normal style) appearing at the right of the Normal style 
in the Style Gallery, at the bottom of the Styles windows, and selected in the Apply styles 
window (because it was applied to the default, empty paragraph of the new document).
Figure 5-25.  New styles appear at right of the Normal style in the Style Gallery, 
in the current sort order of the Styles window, and selected in the Apply Styles 
window, because it is also applied to the selected paragraph
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

220
Removing, Adding Styles from Style Gallery
You can remove or add the styles you created (or any other style) from the Style Gallery, 
following one of these options:
•	
To remove a style, right-click it either in the Style Gallery or in the 
Styles window, and choose Remove from Style Gallery. The style will 
not be deleted, and will continue to appear in the Styles window.
•	
To add a style to the Style Gallery, right-click it in the Styles window 
and select Add to Style Gallery.
Deleting a Style
Deleting an existing style is quite easy:
	 1.	 Right-click the desired style either in the Style Gallery or in the 
Styles window;
	 2.	 Select Delete <style name>…
Microsoft Word will show a dialog box to confirm the style deletion, and by accepting 
the confirmation, the style will be deleted and all paragraphs formatted with it will 
receive the Normal style.
Attention  You can undo the style deletion pressing Ctrl+Z (or choosing the Undo 
command at the Quick Access Toolbar located at the top left corner of Microsoft 
Word title bar).
Exercise 2
Let’s try to create some styles with a practical example. Extract “Sense and Sensibility, 
Jane Austen Chapters1-3.docx” file from Chapter05.zip the and open it in Microsoft 
Word.
Note that this document has just eight pages when you extract it from Chapter05.zip 
file, and is entirely formatted using just the Normal style that was updated to Times New 
Roman, 12 pt, Line spacing = single.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

221
Our target is to format this document text using four different paragraph styles:
•	
Normal: already applied to the entire text document.
•	
NormalFirst: must be applied to the first body text paragraph of each 
chapter.
•	
ChapterTitle: must be applied to the chapter titles.
•	
BookTitle: must be applied to just the Book title.
These paragraph styles must be formatted as specified in Table 5-2.
Figure 5-26.  The basic version of “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen Chapters1-3.
docx” Microsoft Word document, as you can extract from Chapter05.zip file
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

222
Since styles can be affected by style inheritance, let us first change the Normal style 
so you can see how the text can be affected by this change.
Changing the Normal Style from Selection
The style applied to the body text is the most important because it will be used to 
format the biggest part of the document. This document uses the Normal style to format 
the body text, so we may begin by changing the first text paragraph to the formatting 
standards proposed by Table 5-2 and then updating the Normal style to match the 
paragraph style.

Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Select all the text for the first body text paragraph (the one below 
Chapter1 that begins with “The family…”).
Attention  To easily select an entire text paragraph, triple-click it or point the 
mouse to its left border, and when the mouse pointer changes to a right pointing 
arrow, and double-click it.
	 2.	 Using the Font area of the Home tab of the Ribbon, apply to the 
selected paragraph the Georgia, 11 pt font, and a Justify alignment.
	 3.	 Show the Paragraph dialog box (right-click it and select 
Paragraph…), and define Indentation, Special = First Line, By = 0.5.
	 4.	 Click the Line and Page Breaks tab of the Paragraph dialog box 
and check Widow/Orphan control option (Figure 5-27).
	 5.	 Press OK to close the Paragraph dialog box and return to the 
document.
	 6.	 Right-click the Normal style in the Style Gallery and choose 
Update Normal to Match Selection option to update it.

Microsoft Word will update the Normal style and the entire document will receive 
the new formatting options, since all its paragraphs were formatted with the Normal 
style. Note that since the font size was changed to a new, small standard, the document 
will shrink and will now exhibit 7 pages: 1 page less (Figure 5-28).
Figure 5-28.  Once you have defined the body text format for the document, 
right-­click the style applied to the text in the Style Gallery and choose Update

standard, changing the appearance of the entire document.
Attention  On some occasions, you may need to select the entire text (press 
Ctrl+A) and apply the Normal style (press Alt+Space if you assigned it this 
shortcut) to guarantee that changes made in the Normal style will be applied to the 
entire document.

Creating NormalFirst Style
Now the Normal style was already formatted, let us use it as the template to create 
the NormalFirst style: the one that must be used to format the first paragraph of each 
chapter. As proposed by Table 5-2, it must have the same Normal font formatting 
options, no First line indent, and Space After = 11 pt.
To easily create the NormalFirst style, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Right-click Chapter 1 first text paragraph (the one that begins with 
“The family…”), select Paragraph to show the Paragraph dialog 
box, and define these options (Figure 5-29):
•	
Indentation, Special = None.
•	
Space, After = 11 pt.
Figure 5-29.  The NormalFirst style must have no First line indentation and Space 
After = 11 pt (to create an empty space proportional to an 11 pt single line spacing)

227
	 2.	 Press OK to close the Paragraph dialog box and return to the text.
	 3.	 Expand the Style Gallery (see Figure 5-2) and select the Create a 
Style option to show the Create New Style from Formatting dialog 
box (Figure 5-30).
Figure 5-30.  After you format the first Chapter 1 paragraph (no Left indent and 
Space before = 11 pt), expand the Style Gallery and select the Create a Style option 
to show the Create a New Style from Formatting dialog box
	 4.	 In Create New Style from Formatting dialog box, select the Name 
text box and type NormalFirst to name the new style.
	 5.	 Click Modify to show the expanded Create New Style from 
Formatting dialog box and define these options in the Properties 
area:
•	
Name: NormalFirst (the style name as it will appear in the Style 
Gallery, Styles, and Apply Styles windows).
•	
Style type: Linked (paragraph and character) (to allow its 
application either to the text selected or to the entire paragraph.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

228
•	
Style based on: Normal (the style from which it will inherit all 
other formatting options not implemented by this style; choose 
None to create styles with no inheritance).
•	
Style for following paragraph: Normal (the next style that 
follows NormalFirst when Enter key is pressed: default option is 
the same style name being created, Figure 5-31).
Figure 5-31.  The NormalFirst style must be based on Normal style and have the 
Style for the following paragraphs defined to Normal
	 6.	 In the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box, click  
Format ➤ Shortcut key to show the Customize Keyboard dialog 
box and attribute the Ctrl+Alt+Space shortcut to the NormalFirst 
style (Figure 5-32).
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

229
	 7.	 Click OK to close the Customize Keyboard dialog box and return 
to the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box.
	 8.	 Click OK to close the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box.
Since the Add to the Style Gallery option was selected by default, the style will appear 
in the Style Gallery, and will be selected as an indication that it has been applied to the 
selected paragraph (Figure 5-33).
Figure 5-32.  Associate the NormalFirst style to the Alt+Ctrl+Space shortcut
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

230
Attention  Once a style is added to the Style Gallery, you can remove it by  
right-­clicking its name and selecting Remove from Style Gallery command. The 
style will not be deleted: it will just not be shown anymore by the Style Gallery.
Creating ChapterTitle Style
The ChapterTitle style must also be created by example and applied to all chapter 
enunciator paragraphs using Microsoft Word Replace command.
Figure 5-33.  The just-created NormalFirst style applied to the first chapter of 
Chapter 1. Note that is has no First line indent (as the Normal style paragraphs 
that surround it have), but has a space afterward that separates it from the next
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

231
Follow these steps to create ChapterTitle style:
	 1.	 Select the Chapter 1 text paragraph (triple-click it) and apply the 
desired formatting options (use Home tab of the Ribbon and/or 
the Font and Paragraph dialog boxes):
•	
Calibri, 16, bold;
•	
Center alignment;
•	
Indentation, Special = None;
•	
Space After = 1.
•	
Page break before.
Attention  Since the Chapter 1 paragraph is formatted with the Normal style, it 
received by inheritance a First line indent = 0.5 that must be removed!
	 2.	 The Chapter 1 text paragraph must now begin on document page 2, 
since it has the Paragraph dialog box Page break before option set.
	 3.	 Follow steps 3 to 8 used early in the section “Creating NormalFirst 
Style” to create ChapterTitle style from the selection.
	 4.	 Using the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box, set the 
following style Properties (Figure 5-34):
•	
Name: ChapterTitle;
•	
Style type: Linked (paragraph and character);
•	
Style based on: Normal;
•	
Style for following paragraph: Normal;
•	
Shortcut: Alt+C.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

232
When you close the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box, Microsoft 
Word will apply the ChapterTitle style paragraph to the “Chapter 1” paragraph, and 
will show the style selected in the Style Gallery (because the Add to Style Gallery 
option was selected by default). Note that now “Chapter 1” begins on Page 2, the next 
style is NormalFirst followed by Normal, and the document now has 8 pages again 
(Figure 5-35).
Figure 5-34.  The Create New Style from Formatting dialog box showing the 
ChapterTitle properties and the associated keyboard shortcut. Note the style 
description with all its specific properties, plus the entire Normal style on which it 
is based.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

233
Replacing Chapter Titles with the ChapterTitle Style
Now that ChapterTitle style is created and associated to the Alt+C style, you can easily 
scroll through the text to find another chapter paragraph, click to select it, and press 
Alt+C to apply its Chapter title style, an operation that will automatically format the 
chapter title and insert a new document page.
Figure 5-35.  The ChapterTitle style applied to “Chapter 1” paragraph. Since the 
style has the Page break before option set, it forces the paragraph formatted with it 
to begin on a new page. Also note that it has a Space Before = 1” to separate it from 
the next paragraph (formatted with NormalFirst style).
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

234
This operation can be easily accomplished in “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen 
Chapters1-3 With Styles.docx” document, since it is just 8 pages long and has just 3 
chapters. But if you were desktop publishing the whole book text, you would probably 
spend a longer time scrolling through the text, finding every chapter title, and applying 
the ChapterTitle style (or you could be smart and use Word’s Find command to easily 
find chapter titles in the text).
But there is a better way: use Microsoft Word Replace command to find each chapter 
title and apply the ChapterTitle style following these steps:
	 1.	 Click Replace command found in the Editing area of the Home tab 
of the Ribbon to show the Find and Replace dialog box.
	 2.	 In the Find what text box, type “CHAPTER” (without quotes).
	 3.	 Click the Replace with text box.
	 4.	 Click Format ➤ Style to show the Replace Style dialog box.
	 5.	 Select ChapterTitle style and press Ok to close the Replace 
Style dialog box and return to the Find and Replace dialog box 
(Figure 5-36).
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

235
	 6.	 Under the Replace with text box you will now read Style: Chapter 
title. Press Replace all to make the desired style change just in 
chapter title paragraphs.
When you close the Find and Replace dialog box, the document will have 11 pages. 
Scroll through the text until you find “Chapter 2” paragraph and note that it begins on a 
new page, having 1 inch of space to separate it from the next, first chapter paragraph.
Click the first paragraph of Chapter 2 and press Ctrl+Alt+Space to apply the 
NormalFirst style. Do the same with the first paragraph of Chapter 3 (Figure 5-37).
Figure 5-36.  Use the Find and Replace dialog box to search for "CHAPTER" and 
replace it with the ChapterTitle style
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

236
Attention  Before doing such a “find and replace” operation, you must be pretty 
sure that what you are searching for exists just in independent text paragraphs, or 
the replace operation can make a mess by applying the replacement style to the 
wrong paragraphs.
Inserting a New Chapter Title
To see how style properties are important to paragraph inheritance, do this experiment:
	 1.	 Go to the end of the document (press Ctrl+End) and if necessary, 
insert a new paragraph.
	 2.	 Type Chapter 4 in the new paragraph at the end of the document 
and press Alt+C to apply the ChapterTitle style (or click this style 
in the Style Gallery).
Figure 5-37.  After the Replace operation, all chapter title paragraphs had their 
style changed to ChapterTitle style, which makes them begin on a new page 
because this style has the Page break before option set
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

237
	 3.	 The “Chapter 4” paragraph will jump to a new page (due to the 
ChapterTitle style having the Page break before option set). The 
document will now have 11 pages.
	 4.	 Press Enter to insert a new NormalFirst style paragraph (due to 
the ChapterTitle style having the Style for following paragraph = 
NormalFirst).
	 5.	 Press Enter in the first, empty NormalFirst paragraph to insert a 
new Normal style paragraph (due to the NormalFirst style having 
the Style for following paragraph = Normal) (Figure 5-38).
Figure 5-38.  Go to the end of the “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen Chapters 1-3.
docx” document (press Ctrl+End), type Chapter 4, and press Alt+C to apply the 
ChapterTitle style, which will force the paragraph to begin on a new page. Press 
Enter to automatically insert a NormalFirst style and press Enter again to insert a 
Normal style (both inserted by style inheritance).
Cool, isn’t it? Using the appropriate style properties, you can easily write and desktop 
publish the document at the same time!
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

238
Creating and Applying the BookTitle Style
The last style you need to create to format the “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen 
Chapters1-3.docx“ document is the BookTitle style. You do not really need to create it 
unless you are supposed to use the same document formatting options to format other 
similar public domain books. But is a good exercise to practice with styles, so follow 
these instructions to create it:
	 1.	 Select the first document paragraph (the book title: triple-click it) 
and format it according to the specifications of Table 5-1:
•	
Georgia, 18 pt, Bold;
•	
Center alignment;
•	
Indentation, Special = None
•	
Space Before = 2 in
	 2.	 Follow steps 3 to 8 used early in the section “Creating NormalFirst 
Style” to create BookTitle style from selection.
	 3.	 Using the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box to set the 
following style Properties (see Figure 5-34):
•	
Name: BookTitle.
•	
Style type: Linked (paragraph and character).
•	
Style based on: Normal.
•	
Style for following paragraph: Normal.
•	
Shortcut: Alt+Ctrl+B.
	 4.	 Close the Creating New Style from Formatting dialog box and 
verify that the BookTitle style is applied to the text.
	 5.	 Center align the author name and year paragraphs, and remove 
the first line indentation (received by inheritance from the  
Normal style).
Figure 5-39 shows the “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen Chapters1-3 With Styles.
docx” document (that you can also extract from Chapter04.zip file) with the BookTitle 
style applied to its first paragraph.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

239
This document has all the formatting options proposed for it, while also has a drop 
cap character with a height of 4 lines applied to every NormalFirst paragraph that begins 
a new chapter.
Cool, huh? Can you also make such changes in the “Sense and Sensibility, Jane 
Austen Chapters1-3.docx” document?
Exercise 3
The objective of this exercise is to make changes to the appearance of the “Sense and 
Sensibility, Jane Austen Chapters1-3 With Styles.docx” document by changing its Normal 
and ChapterTitle styles formatting options to Standards 1 and 2 proposed by Table 5-3, 
which uses a pair of serif/sans serif fonts to format the text:
Figure 5-39.  The “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen Chapters1-3 With Styles.
docx” document showing the BookTitle style applied to the first document 
paragraph and a drop cap of 4 lines height applied to the first paragraph of each 
chapter.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

240
Try these experiments:
	 1.	 Use the Modify to Match Selection option to change the styles’ 
format (apply the standards to a single paragraph and then update 
the style to match its formatting options).
	 2.	 Change the Normal style first and watch:
•	
The BookChapter and NormalFirst style updates by inheritance.
•	
The NormalFirst paragraphs lose their Drop Cap (you will need to 
rebuild them manually).
	 3.	 Change ChapterTitle first and then change Normal. Note that 
since ChapterTitle is based on Normal, it will lose the font 
formatting options when Normal is updated.
	 4.	 Change the font used by Normal and ChapterTitle styles for each 
standard (e.g., for Standard 1, Normal = Century, ChapterTitle = 
Constantia, 22).
	 5.	 Make your own choice of fonts and paragraph options to change 
ChapterTitle and Normal styles based on the typographical 
knowledge you’ve gathered so far from this book.

Conclusion
Microsoft Word styles are the heart of text processing operations, because they allow 
implementation of complex formatting options in different text paragraphs by a click of 
the mouse.
The styles offered by the Styles Gallery are called Recommended styles, and you can 
use them to change the appearance of your text. Or you can create a new set of styles 
giving them names that are more significant to the task at hand.
The Normal style is the default style used by most Microsoft Word documents, and 
is quite common to see long text documents using just the Normal style applied to all 
paragraphs.
Local formatting options have precedence over global formatting options, which 
affect style inheritance this way: any formatting change made in a base style carries 
through to the styles based on it, as long as these based styles do not locally implement 
other formatting.
And this is what explains the strong inheritance behavior for Normal.dot changes: 
most recommended styles (and new styles) are frequently based on it.
Summary
On this chapter you learned:
•	
Style is a name place to store a predefined set of formatting options 
that can be applied at once to the text.
•	
Microsoft Word calls “Recommended” the default style set offered by 
the Styles Gallery found in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
•	
The Style Gallery allows you to quickly format text by clicking any 
style it shows.
•	
You can expand the Style Gallery to show more styles or some 
commands to allow you to create or apply styles.
•	
You can show the Styles window using the small square that sits at 
the bottom right corner of the Styles area of the Ribbon.
•	
You can use the Styles window option to show all the styles that exist 
in the current document and present them in different sort orders.
Chapter 5  Quick Document Formatting with Styles

242
•	
Both the Style Gallery and the Styles window can be used to change, 
insert, and modify styles.
•	
Both the Style Gallery and the Styles window show the current style 
applied to the text as long as it’s visible in its style list.
•	
You use the Style Gallery to show the Apply Styles windows.
•	
Just the Apply Styles window synchronizes the style used in the text.
•	
Formatting options can be considered as local or global.
•	
Microsoft Word gives precedence to local formatting options over 
global ones.
•	
Normal style is the most used style in the world.
•	
Normal style is the base for many other recommended styles (or new 
created styles), unless it is manually changed.
•	
You can easily change the text formatting by just changing the 
Normal style.
•	
Styles have properties that allow them to be based on other styles, 
and a style applied to one paragraph will and select the style for the 
next paragraph that follows.
•	
You can associate any style to a shortcut key so it can be easily 
applied as you write, without need for taking your hands off of the 
keyboard.
In the next chapter, we will explore Microsoft Word Recommended styles and how to 
use the Design tab controls to easily change the appearance of any text document.

CHAPTER 6
Using Recommended 
Styles
Microsoft Word calls the styles shown by default in the Quick Style Gallery as 
“Recommended” because it offers different tools at the Document Formatting area of the 
Design tab of the Ribbon to professionally change any document appearance that makes 
use of them to format the text.
In this chapter, you will learn how to use the Recommended styles along with 
the Design tab tools to quickly and professionally change the appearance of any text 
document created with Microsoft word.
The documents cited in this chapter and the Exercise sections can be found by 
downloading Chapter06.zip file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
Recommended Styles
The Design tab of the Ribbon offers tools at the Document Formatting area of the Design 
tab of the Ribbon to professionally change any document appearance that makes use of 
Microsoft Word Recommended styles to format the text (Figure 6-1).

244
Note that the same interface defined by the Style Gallery to show single style 
formatting options is now used by the Style Set Gallery to show the formatting options of 
three special Recommended styles: visual examples of the Title, Heading1, and Normal 
styles format are shown in each option of this control (Figure 6-2).
And this is not all: among the tools that you can use to change the Recommended 
styles formatting options, you will also find:
•	
Themes: to change all formatting options.
•	
Colors: to change the color palette options.
•	
Fonts: to change the fonts options.
•	
Paragraph spacing: to change the spacing options.
•	
Set as Default: to set the selected options as the default formatting 
standards for new documents.
Figure 6-1.  The Design tab of the Ribbon is used to change the appearance of

Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

245
As cited in Table 5-1, each Recommended style has a name that indicates its main 
usage, and if you follow these recommendations, it will be quite easy to professionally 
format and change the appearance of any text document produced with Microsoft Word.
And since you may now have a better understanding of styles and how to create, 
modify, and use them, let’s see a practical example of Recommended styles usage and 
how you can use Microsoft Word Design tab tools to format a document.
Using Recommended Styles
To have an easier understanding of how Microsoft Word Design tools interacts with 
Recommended styles, extract file “Microsoft Word Recommended Styles.docx” from 
Chapter06.zip file and open it in Microsoft Word. Note that this document uses the 
recommendations for usage cited in Table 5-1, where each style name was applied to 
specific paragraphs of words (Figure 6-3).
For example, the Title style was applied to the first document paragraph; Subtitle was 
applied to the paragraphs that follow it. Character styles were applied to some words that 
represent the styles. To help you see the association made to each paragraph and some 
words, they were named and formatted with the associated style it received.
Style Themes
A Theme is a specific combination of fonts and formatting options used to format the 
recommended style set.
Using the Design tab, you can select different style themes to apply to any document 
that uses the Recommended style set to format titles, subtitles, headings, body text, 
quotes, and so on. The default Themes used in a new, empty Microsoft Word document 
is called “Office.”
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

246
By default, the Office theme is associated to the This Document style set: the first 
Style Set gallery item. Every other item of the Style Set Gallery has a name associated 
with it, like Basic (Elegant), Basic (Simple), Basic (stylish), Black and White (Capitalized), 
and so on.
To easily change the appearance of the Office theme applied to the document, click 
any style set.
Figure 6-4 shows the Microsoft Word Recommended Styles.docx file appearance 
after it has received the Shaded style set. Note that the This Document style set 
thumbnail was updated to reflect the style set in use.
Figure 6-3.  The Microsoft Word Recommended Styles.docx file has paragraphs 
and words already formatted with the Recommended style set
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

247
Like the Quick Style gallery does to show more styles, you can expand the Style Set 
Gallery to expose other style sets available by clicking the small arrow located at the 
bottom of its scroll bar (Figure 6-5).
Figure 6-4.  Use the Style Themes tool of the Document Formatting area of the 
Design tab of the Ribbon to easily change the appearance of any document 
formatted using the default “as Recommended” styles in the text
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

248
There will be two commands:
•	
Reset to the Default Style Set: return the document appearance to 
the default theme style set.
•	
Save as a New Style Set…: click to save the current style set as a new 
Microsoft Word Template. The new Style Set will appear as the second 
style theme in the beginning of the Style Set Gallery.
Attention  Templates will be discussed in Chapter 11). By default, they are saved 
in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\QuickStyles folder.
To remove a saved style set, right-click on the Style Set Gallery and chose Delete. 
Microsoft Word will delete the associated file from your disk and remove it from the 
Style Set Gallery.
Figure 6-5.  Expand the Style Set Gallery to reveal other style sets, reset to the 
default style, or save the current style set as a Microsoft Word Template dotx file.
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

249
Theme Colors
You can change the style set appearance by applying a different color palette using the 
Colors option of the Document Formatting area of the Design tab of the Ribbon: just 
click the Colors button to expand it and drag the mouse over the available color palettes 
to see how the Recommended styles area changed and the text is affected. Click the 
desired color palette to make the change permanent (note that not all styles are affected 
by a new color palette, Figure 6-6).
Figure 6-6.  Use the Colors button to apply a different color palette to the 
recommended styles applied to the text. Note however that not all styles will be 
affected by the new palette
Attention  Select the Office color palette to reset the recommended styles to the 
default color theme.
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

250
Theme Fonts
Like the Colors button, use the Fonts button to apply different font combinations to the 
current style set. The button also expands when you click it and shows different font 
pairs professionally combined to format the document title, subtitle, and body text.
Each font theme has a name. The default font theme is called Office, there is an 
Office 2007-2010 theme, and the other themes are named according to the font or font 
combination used by the theme.
Most font themes use a single sans serif font, but if you scroll through the list you 
will note that there are some sans serif/serif combinations (like Century Gothic-Palatino 
Linotype, TV Cen MT-Rockwell, etc.) or serif/sans serif fonts (like Times New Roman-­
Arial, Constantia-Franklin Gothic book, Garamond-TrebuchetMs, etc.), where the first 
font is used in title styles (Title, Subtitle, Heading1, Heading2) and the second in body 
text styles (Normal, Quote, Intense Quote).
As you drag the mouse through the font themes proposed, Microsoft Word changes 
the recommended styles font, which immediately reacts to better allow you to choose 
among them (Figure 6-7).
Figure 6-7.  Use the Font button to change the font theme applied to the Title/Body 
text recommended styles. Some font themes use a single font, while others offer 
pairs of serif/sans serif or sans serif/serif fonts (the first applied to title styles).
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

251
Paragraph Spacing
Using the Paragraph spacing button, you can change paragraph Space Before/After and 
Line spacing options for all recommended styles at once. There is a default paragraph 
spacing for each style set, and other spacing themes called No paragraph space, Compact, 
Tight, Open, Relaxed, and Double.
Use them to insert/remove space between text paragraphs so it can best fit into fewer 
or more document pages as needed (Figure 6-8).
Set as Default
Use this option to make the current formatting options become the standard format 
for new documents. It will affect all recommended styles and will become the default 
appearance for every new Microsoft Word document.
Figure 6-8.  Use the Paragraph Spacing button to easily change the Space and 
Line Spacing of all recommended paragraph styles, and easily make the text fit the 
desired number of pages
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

252
Theme Button
Use the Theme button to select an entire new theme (combination of font type, font, 
color, and paragraph spacing options) or to save the current options to a new theme.
The Theme button offers named themes, where the default is called Office. As you 
scroll through the list the recommended styles react to them, offering new ways to 
professionally format any document that uses this basic Microsoft Word style (Figure 6-­9).
Attention  To reset the recommended styles format to the original standards 
used by Microsoft Word, use the Theme button to select the default Office theme, 
expand the Style Set Gallery, and select Reset to Default Style Set (Figure 6-5).
Figure 6-9.  Use the Theme button to apply a totally different theme set to the 
recommended styles used in the document. You can also modify a theme and save 
it for future usage.
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

253
Finding the Style Applied to the Text
The Microsoft Word Recommended Styles.docx file is a good opportunity to show you 
that although Microsoft Word offers both the Quick Style Gallery and the Styles window 
to show/manage styles, both interfaces may fail to show which styles is in use by the text 
(character styles) or paragraph (paragraph styles) when you click the mouse to position 
the text cursor on it.
To see how this may happen, first change the Styles window appearance to make it 
show all the styles inside the document sorted in alphabetical order by following these 
steps:
	 1.	 Show the Styles window by clicking the small square located at the 
bottom right of the Styles area in the Home tab of the Ribbon  
(see Figure 5-2).
	 2.	 In the Styles window, uncheck the Show preview option, click 
Options… to show the Style Pane Options dialog box, and set these 
options:
•	
Select styles to show: All styles;
•	
Select how list is sorted: Alphabetical.
	 3.	 Close the Style Pane Options dialog box and click the first 
paragraph of the Microsoft Word Recommended Styles.docx file 
(the one with “Title” word formatted with the Title style).
Depending on the size of your screen, size of the Microsoft Word window, and your 
resolution, you may note that the style used by the text/paragraph selected may not be 
selected and may not be shown in either the Quick Style Gallery or the Styles window 
(Figure 6-10).
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

254
In fact, the Styles window did synchronize the selected Title paragraph style, but it 
doesn’t scroll the list to show what it selected: you have to do it manually to discover 
which style this paragraph has.
Don’t worry! Microsoft Word also offers the Apply Styles window that shows a combo 
box that reacts like the one used by Microsoft Word 2003 or older versions (expand the 
Quick Style Gallery and click the Apply Styles… command, see Figure 5-2).
By default the Apply Styles window is anchored at the right side of the Microsoft 
Word interface, but is can be dragged inside the document window to float over it, so 
you can better position it anywhere of the screen and always know which style is in use 
(Figure 6-11).
Figure 6-10.  Sometimes the size of Microsoft Word window doesn’t allow 
synchronyzation the style used by the selected text/paragraph in the Quick  
Style Gallery or the Styles window
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

255
Attention  From my point of view, I rather use the Apply Styles window to format 
text because it always show the style in use, and allow to reapply the style by 
either click on the Reapply button or by selecting again the style from the list. By 
keeping the Auto Complete style names option checked, you can also type the style 
initials on the list to easily find it by its name. Or open the Styles window to insert, 
modify and manage styles.
Although it is not specified, the Apply Styles window shows the same styles 
currently shown by the Styles window.
Figure 6-11.  The Apply Styles window can float over Microsoft Word window and 
always show the style in use when you click the text. It also allows you to reapply 
and modify the selected style, or show the Styles window.

Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to use the Design tab Style Set Gallery to quickly change 
the appearance of a document formatted with Recommended styles.
Extract file “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Chapter 1-3 Recommended Styles.docx” 
from Chapter06.zip file and open it in Microsoft Word.
Explore the file by clicking its title (“The Adventures of Tom Sawyer”), subtitle (“Mark 
Twain”), chapter titles (“Chapter1”, “Chapter 2”, and “Chapter 3”), and any body text 
paragraphs (“'Tom!”) and note that they were formatted using the Recommended styles 
Title, Sutbtitle, Heading1, and Normal, respectively (Figure 6-12).
Figure 6-12.  The “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Chapter 1-3 Recommended 
Styles.docx” file uses the Recommended styles Title, Subtitle, Heading1, and 
Normal to format the document title, subtitle, chapter titles, and body text, 
respectively.

Creating and Applying a Dialog Style
Authors and editors uses different typographic rules to signal the speech of a character 
or personage.
In the “Adventures of Tom Sawyer Chapter 1-3 Recommended Styles.docx” file you 
may note that every character speech begins and ends with a single quote character 
(as the 10th ‘Tom!’ paragraph shows in Figure 6-12). But also note that single quote 
characters are commonly used in the text to detach from words (do a Find operation  
by a single quote character and see for yourself).
As another exercise we must create a Dialog style to format every speech paragraph 
and, using Find and Replace techniques, apply this style to all other text speech 
paragraphs found in this document. Follow these steps to create the Dialog style:
	 1.	 Triple-click the first ‘TOM!’ speech character to select it (or point 
the mouse to its right and click to select the entire text line).
	 2.	 Apply Italic to the entire paragraph text.
	 3.	 Drag the Left indent control of the Ruler (the small square that sits 
in the gray area of the Ruler) to the first stop point to create a Left 
indent of 0.13 (show the Paragraph dialog to confirm, Figure 6-17).
Figure 6-17.  Select the first speech paragraph, apply Italic to all its characters, and 
drag the Left indent Ruler control to the right to the first Ruler position, creating an 
Indentation Left = 0.13 (show the Paragraph dialog to confirm the Left indentation 
value).
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

262
	 4.	 Using the techniques described in the section “Creating New 
Styles” from Chapter 5, use the Create from Selection technique 
to create the Dialog style based on the formatted paragraph 
(Figure 6-18).
Figure 6-18.  The Dialog style created from selection, applied to the first text speech
Now it is time to apply the Dialog style to all other text speech paragraphs. Since 
this document also uses the single quote to detach some words inside paragraphs, if we 
use the Find and Replace dialog box to search for a single quote character and apply 
the Dialog paragraph, many nonspeech text paragraphs will also be formatted using the 
Dialog style.
We need to find a way to unequivocally apply the Dialog style to just the speech 
paragraphs: the ones that begin with a single quote. Or in other words, we must replace 
every paragraph that begins with a single quote by a character not used in the document 
(like the { left brace), apply to them the Dialog style, and change again the character used 
by a single quote. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click Replace command found in the Editing area of the Home tab 
of the Ribbon to show the Find and Replace dialog box.
	 2.	 Click the Find What text box, click the More button to expand the 
dialog box, click Special button, and select Paragraph Mark option 
(Microsoft Word will use ^p to find the paragraph marks).
	 3.	 Type the single quote. ‘The Find What dialog box will become ^p’.
	 4.	 Click Replace with, click Special ➤ Paragraph Mark option 
(Microsoft Word will use ^p as replacement text).
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

263
	 5.	 Type { (left brace). The Replace with dialog box will become ^p{.
	 6.	 Press Replace All to find and replace all occurrences (Figure 6-19).
Figure 6-19.  Use the Find and Replace dialog box to search for every paragraph 
that begins with a single quote (^p') and replace it by a Paragraph Break and a left 
brace (^p{). Press Replace All to find and replace all 111 paragraph speechs.
	 7.	 Click the Find what text box delete its content and press the { left 
brace character.
	 8.	 Click the Replace with text box, delete its content, click More>> to 
expand the dialog box, click Format ➤ Style, and select the Dialog 
style.
	 9.	 Press Replace All button to find all 111 occurrences of { left braces 
and apply the Dialog style (Figure 6-20).
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

264
	 10.	 Finally, replace every { left brace by a single quote: in Replace with 
text box type ' (single quote) and press Replace All to change all 
occurrences (there is no need to clear the No Formatting button, 
Figure 6-21).
Figure 6-20.  Use the Find and Replace dialog box to search for every { left brace 
and replace the paragraph style with the Dialog style. Press Replace All to find and 
replace all 111 paragraph speechs.

Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

266
Inside Chapter06.zip you will find two public domain book extracts: “Sense and 
Sensibility, Jane Austen Chapters1-5.docx” and “The Last of the Mohicans, James 
Fenimore Cooper Chapters 1-5”. Extract both files and follow the next list to format them 
using Microsoft Word Recommended styles and the Design tab tools of the Ribbon:
	 1.	 Apply to the entire document the Normal style (both files are 
entirely formatted with the No Spacing style, which is not affected 
by most Design tab tools, like Font, Color, and Spacing).
	 2.	 Apply the Title Recommended style to the book title.
	 3.	 Apply the Subtitle Recommended style to the author name.
	 4.	 Apply the Heading1 Recommended style to all chapter titles 
(Introduction, Chapter 1 to Chapter 5)
Attention  use the methods discussed in Chapter 4 to find each chapter title 
paragraph and replace its text using the Heading1 format.
	 5.	 Update the Heading1 style, setting the following formatting 
options in the Paragraph dialog box:
•	
Space After = 24 pt.
•	
Break page before.
	 6.	 Both files use a single quote or a double quote to begin a text 
speech. Create a Dialog style and apply it to just these paragraphs 
using Find and Replace techniques.
	 7.	 “The Last of Mohicans” uses the * (asterisk) character to signal a 
quote. Use Find and Replace techniques to find these paragraphs 
and apply them the recommended Quote style.
	 8.	 Use the Design tab options to change the formatting options of 
one of these documents using a typographic standard that pleases 
you. Save this standard using the “Save as New Style Set” option 
and apply it to the other document, so they are equally formatted.
	 9.	 Delete the Style Set from the Style Set Gallery.
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

267
Attention  You can extract formatted versions of both files from Chapter06zip file. 
Their file names are suffixed with the word “Formatted.”
Conclusion
Microsoft Word Recommended styles are useful to allow quick document formatting that 
can be easily changed using the tools found in the Design tab of the Ribbon.
By correctly applying the Title, Subtitle, Heading1, Heading2, Quote, Normal, and 
other Recommended styles, you can quickly apply a new formatting theme to the 
document, change its font options, color palette, and/or paragraph spacing, change the 
Recommended styles formatting, and save and reuse the theme in other documents.
Summary
In this chapter you learned:
•	
Recommended styles have this name because they are used by some 
Microsoft Word tools to easily format any document.
•	
You can apply a theme set using the Style Set Gallery found in the 
Design tab of the Ribbon.
•	
The Style Set Gallery uses the first item to show the This Document 
Style set, and all other items have names associated to previously 
saved style sets.
•	
Once you use a Style theme set, you can change its formatting 
options by applying different Font themes, Color palettes, and/or 
Spacing options that change some key formatting options of the 
Recommended styles.
•	
The current style theme set applied to the document is associated to 
the Document Style set: the first Style Set Gallery item.
•	
Any style set can be saved as a document template to be reused later.
Chapter 6  Using Recommended Styles

268
•	
The last saved style set appears as the second style theme set in the 
Style Set Gallery (the first is always the Document Style set).
•	
You can use the Themes control to apply previously saved themes.
•	
Once you select any of the Themes available, you can apply any of the 
Style Themes set found in the Style Set Gallery.
In the next chapter, you will learn how to use the Recommended Heading styles 
(Heading1 to Heading9) to format document chapter and section tittles, apply automatic 
section titles numbering, create a document map, use Microsoft Word Outline view, and 
automatically generate the document TOC (Table of Contents).

CHAPTER 7
Using Heading Styles
Among the Recommended Styles, the so-called Heading styles are intrinsically related to 
some important Microsoft Word features to format and manage documents.
In this chapter, you will learn how to effectively format your documents using some 
Microsoft Word advanced features that are based in the correct usage of Heading styles.
The documents cited in this chapter and the Exercise sections can be found by 
downloading the Chapter07.zip file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
Why Are Heading Styles Important?
The expression Heading styles means the Recommended styles Heading1 and Heading2 
normally shown in the Microsoft Word Styles Gallery; but goes from Heading1 to 
Heading9 as one can see on the fully expand view of the Styles window.
They are important because when they are correctly applied to the document section 
titles, Microsoft Word can
•	
Hierarchically number the heading paragraphs.
•	
Quickly navigate through the document using it headings.
•	
Easily change the document format with the Design tab.
•	
Generate the document’s Table of Contents.
•	
Use the Outline view to manipulate the text.
Each of these features can be done just because Heading1 to Heading9 styles have 
the Paragraph Outline level property set to the appropriate hierarchical level each style 
represents.

270
Outline Level
Outline level is the last of Microsoft Word Paragraph dialog box options to need a 
comment in this book, and is associated to the hierarchy that the title paragraph has in 
the text.
By default, Outline Level 1 must be used for first-level title hierarchy (chapter titles or 
first-level section titles), Level 2 for the second sublevel, Level 3 for the third, and so on; 
up to nine different hierarchy levels are allowed to hierarchically define the document 
structure.
You can easily perceive how Microsoft Word uses Heading styles to control hierarchy 
of the document by extracting the “Heading1 to 3.docx” document from the Chapter04.
zip file, or by following these steps to create a Heading formatting document:
	 1.	 Open an empty Microsoft Word document.
	 2.	 Press Ctrl+F to show the Navigation pane and click it Headings 
view option.
	 3.	 Type “Heading 1” in the first paragraph and apply the Heading1 
style (note that the “Heading1” text appears in the Navigation 
pane).
	 4.	 Press Enter to insert another paragraph, type “Heading2”, and 
apply the Heading2 style (Microsoft Word 2016 will instantly 
show the “Heading2” text in the Navigation pane while the Styles 
Gallery begins to show the Heading3 style to the right of the 
Heading2 style).
	 5.	 Once more, press Enter to insert another paragraph, type 
“Heading3”, and apply the Heading3 style (once again, Microsoft 
Word 2016 will show the “Heading3” text in the Navigation pane 
while the Styles Gallery begins to show the Heading4 style).
Attention  Every time you apply a Heading style to the text, the next heading style 
level in the hierarchy is shows in the Styles Gallery (e.g., If you apply Heading2, 
Heading3 will become visible to it right).
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

271
Figure 7-1 shows a Microsoft Word document with three text paragraphs that 
received Heading1, Heading2, and Heading3 styles, with the Navigation pane showing 
the Headings view. Note how each Heading style is indented from the previous or next 
heading level.
Figure 7-1.  When Microsoft Word Heading styles are applied to title sectionl 
paragraphs, they appear in the Navigation pane Headings view, and the next 
Heading level still not applied to the text will appear in the Style Gallery list
Attention  You can also show the Navigation pane by clicking the Navigation 
pane option in the Show area of the View tab of the Ribbon.
This is possible because each Heading style is associated to a different Outline level: 
Heading1 receives Outline level = Level 1; Heading2 received Outline level = Level 2, 
etc. This can be confirmed by right-clicking any Heading style name visible in the Styles 
Gallery and choosing Modify to show the Modify Style dialog box, from which you can 
read in the style description the Outline level the style received.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

272
Figure 7-2 shows the Modify Style dialog box for the Heading1 style. Note that it 
description shows “Level 1” as the outline level set.
Select the Format ➤ Paragraph option in the Modify Style dialog box to show the 
Paragraph dialog box for the Heading 1 style and note that in has Outline level = 1, which 
is also disabled, meaning that this property can’t be changed for any Heading style 
(Figure 7-3).
Attention  Inspecting other Heading style properties, you will notice that 
Heading2 to Heading9 will receive Outline levels 2 to 9, respectively. In other 
words, the Outline level is associated to the Heading style number.
Figure 7-2.  The Heading1 properties shown in the Modify Style dialog box  
(right-­click the style name in the Styles Gallery and choose Modify). Note that the 
style description shows that it has “Level 1” outline priority.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

273
Attention  Not just Heading styles will appear in the Navigation pane: any 
paragraph that has it Outline level property set to anything different from Body Text 
will appear in the Navigation pane.
Numbering Heading Styles
Having any paragraph title in which a Heading style was applied, click the Multilevel 
List tool located in the Paragraph area of the Home tab of the Ribbon and choose any 
numbered list that uses Headings (look to it names). All Heading style paragraphs will 
automatically receive the associated numbering system, where each Heading receives 
the prefix defined to it Outline level property.
Figure 7-3.  The Paragraph dialog box for the Heading 1 style shows that in has 
Outline level defined to Level 1
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

274
Figure 7-4 shows how the second heading numbering system shows the paragraph 
hierarchy by using dots to indicate the Outline level (1 for first Level 1, 1.1 for first Level 
2, 1.1.1 for first Level 3, etc.).
Figure 7-4.  The Multilevel List tool can automatically number each Heading style 
formatted paragraph of the document, which is also shown in the Navigation pane
By continuing to insert more section titles and reapply styles Heading1 through 
Heading3 (or higher levels), the section title numbering system is restarted. Copy and 
paste multiple copies of the paragraphs formatted with Heading styles to see how 
Microsoft Word numbers them according to the system selected in the Multilevel List 
tool and the Outline level associated to the Heading style (Figure 7-5).
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

275
Heading Styles Shortcut
In is quite easy to apply Heading styles by clicking the desired style located in the Styles 
Gallery or the Styles window (although the Styles window may require you to scroll it 
style list), but you can become more productive by associating each Heading style to a 
keyboard shortcut, because you will no longer need to perform such an operation by 
pointing and clicking the mouse.
Use the Alt+n combination keys where n relates to the Heading style number, so you 
can easily associate each Heading style to a mnemonic key combination, very easy to 
press: Alt+1 apply Heading1, Alt+2 apply Heading2, and so in, until Alt+9 to Heading9.
Figure 7-5.  New Heading style paragraphs automatically receive the correct 
number or letter according to the current Multilevel Numbering system selected, 
and you can remove or change the number system at any time. The Navigation 
pane reflects in it Headings view all paragraphs formatted with Heading styles.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

276
Follow these steps to apply shortcuts to all Heading styles in your Microsoft Word 
copy:
	 1.	 Show the Styles window (see Figure 5.2);
	 2.	 Click Options to show the Style Pane Options dialog box.
	 3.	 In Select Styles to show, click All styles.
	 4.	 Click OK to close the Style Pane Options dialog box.
	 5.	 Scroll the Styles window list to show the Heading1 style.
	 6.	 Right-click Heading style and select Modify.
	 7.	 Click Format ➤ Shortcut and associate Heading1 to Alt+1 
shortcut.
	 8.	 Repeat steps 5 to 7 to associate Heading2 to Heading9 to the 
associated Alt+n key (associate Alt+2 with Heading2, Alt+3 with 
Heading3, etc.).
Once each Heading style is associated to an Alt+n key, try to change the style 
applied to any text paragraphs by pressing it keyboard shortcut. You will become more 
productive in desktop publishing the text while writing in; it’s easy to change Heading 
styles without even taking your hands off of the keyboard.
Attention  To effectively work with Heading styles in the text, keep the Navigation 
pane with the Headings view selected and look to it indentations: they reflect 
the current hierarchy applied to all document Heading paragraphs and are the 
best way to know if you are applying the correct Heading style to the current text 
paragraph.
Collapsing and Expanding Heading Styles
In is supposed that between two heading styles, an undetermined amount of text will 
be inserted to compose the body text of the document. By applying Heading styles to 
the text, you can easily navigate through in by using either the Navigation pane or the 
document window itself.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

277
In the Document window, click any paragraph formatted with a Heading style to put 
the text cursor in in and note that Microsoft Word shows a small slanted triangle at it left: 
the same small triangle shows in the Navigation pane (Figure 7-6).
This small slanted triangle allows you to collapse/expand the text inside two 
successive Heading styles applied to the document, so you can easily navigate through 
the text no matter how much text is inserted between them. Click any collapsed Heading 
style triangle to show it content again.
Figure 7-6.  Use the small triangles pointing down at the left of any Heading style 
to collapse/expand the document text or the Headings view of the Navigation pane
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

278
Attention  Triangles are shown next to the Heading styles that have text of a 
lower hierarchy inside in.
Note that when the text inside a Heading style is collapsed, the triangle keeps 
appearing at the left side of the Heading style paragraph, changing from a slanted 
triangle to one pointing right, to indicate that there is more text inside in. Also note  
that the Navigation Pane Headings view state is independent of the document pane 
view (Figure 7-7): in can keep showing all document Heading styles expanded while the 
Document window is collapsing them.
Figure 7-7.  The Navigation pane view is independent of the Document window 
view. When any Heading formatted paragraph is collapsed, Microsoft Word keeps 
showing the triangle at it left, which changes to a triangle pointing right.
Changing Heading Styles Prefix
If any paragraph formatted with a Heading style is deleted or receives another Heading style 
level, all remaining Heading paragraphs will be automatically renumbered, according to it 
Outline level. For example, if the second Heading 1 paragraph is deleted (the one numbered 
as 2), the 2.1 paragraph will become 1.2, and 2.1.1. will become 1.2.1 (Figure 7-8).
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

279
And if you change the numbering system using other options found in the Multilevel 
List tool, all paragraphs will change their numbering prefixes.
Figure 7-9 shows the first Heading numbering system in action, applying a paragraph 
prefix for each Heading level style: the first Heading1 style paragraph is prefixed with 
“Chapter 1” text, the first Heading2 style paragraph is prefixed with “Section 1.01”, the 
first Heading3 style with “(a)”, etc. (the words “Heading1”, “Heading 2”, and “Heading3” 
next to each prefix constitute the paragraph text typed in the document).
Figure 7-8.  Microsoft Word renumbers heading styles according to their Outline 
level: each paragraph receives the number, letter, or symbol associated to the 
current number system
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

280
Renumbering Heading Styles
To change the prefix associated to any Heading style paragraph, use the mouse and the 
Multilevel List tool to change any Heading paragraph number prefix applied by  
the Multilevel List tool using the mouse.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the desired paragraph to place the text cursor in.
	 2.	 Click the Multilevel List tool to expand in list.
	 3.	 Point the mouse to the Change List Level item to expand in list 
and click the desired level.
Be aware that you can apply any Outline level to any paragraph in the text: Microsoft 
Word will not care if some previous Outline level is missing.
Figure 7-9.  Select any other Headings numbering system available in the 
Multilevel List tool to change the prefix associated to each Outline level
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

281
Figure 7-10 shows that the first paragraph (where “Heading1” was typed) received 
the Heading2 style, and now is prefixed with “Section 1.01”, while the third paragraph 
(where “Heading 3” was typed) received the Heading1 style and is now prefixed with 
“Article 2” when their Heading styles were changed. The Styles Gallery shows the style 
applied to the text, while the Navigation pane shows it indentation level. The expected 
“Article 1” prefixed paragraph does not appear anymore in the document.
Define a Multilevel List
You can learn how Microsoft Word can number and renumber Heading style paragraphs 
by studying the way in produces the formatting applied to any Heading style formatted 
paragraph, like the ones shown in Figure 7-9.
Follow these instructions:
	 1.	 Apply any Multilevel List tool option for Heading styles to one or 
more Heading style formatted paragraphs.
	 2.	 Click any formatted Heading style paragraph, expand the 
Multilevel List tool, and select the Define New Multilevel List… 
option.
Figure 7-10.  Change the Heading style applied to a section paragraph to affect  
the section titles numbering system for the whole document
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

282
Microsoft Word will show the Define new Multilevel list dialog box, from which  
you may note how each Heading style is composed. Figure 7-11 shows how the  
“Article n” prefix is applied to any Heading1 style paragraph, while also show the 
sequence of “numbering” applied to all other Heading styles (Heading2 to Heading9).
At the top left of this dialog box you can click the number (1 to 9) associated to each 
Heading style and select in in the list box at it right. The numbering properties associated 
to the Heading style are shown in the Number format area below them, from which you 
can select one of the following:
•	
Enter formatting for number: Insert a text prefix to precede the 
Heading style text. Note that in has the style numbering option in 
gray, indicating that this is a Microsoft Word calculated field that will 
produce the autonumbering feature.
Figure 7-11.  The Define new Multilevel list dialog box, from which you can 
inspect and understand how any Multilevel List option is created to enumerate  
the Heading style paragraphs
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

283
•	
Font: Show the Font dialog box from which you can use any character 
attributes (including color) to format the Heading style prefix.
•	
Number style for this level: Choose the number style that must 
be applied to each Heading style. You can select between different 
numbering systems (including Arabic, upper- or lowercase Roman, 
upper or lowercase alphabetic, and many others), or use bullets, 
pictures, etc.
Attention  You can reinsert the autonumbering gray indicator by selecting another 
option in the Number style.
•	
Include level number from: This option (unavailable for Heading1) 
allows inclusion of the number of any superior Heading style to 
the Heading style selected (Heading2 can include Heading1’s last 
number; Heading3 can include Heading1’s and/or Heading2’s last 
number, and so in).
•	
Position: This indicates how the text prefix will be aligned before 
the Heading style paragraph text (Left (default), Center, or Right 
alignment).
•	
Aligned at: Use to indicate the Left indentation applied to the 
Heading style level.
•	
Text indent at: Use to indicate the Hanging indent alignment applied 
to the Heading paragraph.
•	
Set for all levels: Makes all Heading style levels left aligned the same 
way, with no indentation between them.
Click the More>> button of the Define new Multilevel list dialog box to expand it 
left side and show further options to define and create new multilevel numbering lists 
(Figure 7-12).

•	
ListNum field list name: Very technical setting; allows attributing a 
name to a Heading level so you can use in with Microsoft Word LISNUM 
field (by typing “myliststyle” to allow use of {LISTNUM “myliststyle” \1 }.
Attention  Microsoft Word does many of it tricks to insert document information 
in the text (like autonumbering paragraphs, inserting page number, system date 
and hour, etc.) using Fields (using the Quick parts command of the Insert tab of 
the Ribbon). These fields are always embraced by curly brackets, followed by it 
specific syntax, like {LISTNUM “myliststyle” \1}.
Microsoft Word uses Ctrl+F9 to insert the field’s curly brackets, and Alt+F9 to 
alternate the field view (field code) with field value. Try in!
•	
Start at: Define the starting number for the first item of the list 
(default is 1).
•	
Restart list after: Define the Heading Outline level where the current 
Heading level number must be restarted (unavailable for Heading1). 
By default, Heading2 restarts from 1 after every new Heading1 style, 
and so in.
•	
Legal style numbering: This option applies when the numbering 
system uses both Roman and Arabic numerals: Roman numerals used 
for higher level paragraphs (Chapter titles) will be changed to Arabic 
numerals in the current level paragraph (Chapter Section title).
Example: Heading1 uses “Article I” prefix (with Roman numeral 
for higher level); if Heading2 uses Include number from: Level 1 
option, and is prefixed with “Section” text, in may be numbered 
as “Section I.01”. By checking the Legal style numbering option, in 
will be numbered as “Section 1.01” instead (no Roman numeral on 
current level).
•	
Follow number with: Indicates the character to follow the text prefix 
(and number), before the Heading style paragraph text. Default is 
a Tab character that will align in the next default tab stop (at every 
0.5 in the Ruler or at the position defined by the Add tab stop at 
option). You can also set in to a Space character or nothing.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

286
•	
Add tab stop at: Define the horizontal ruler position of the next  
“Tab character”used by the Follow number with option.
Create a New Multilevel List
Use the Define a New List Style… option found in the Multilevel List tool options to 
create a new numbering system to be used in Heading style paragraphs. In will show the 
Define New List Style dialog box (which is very similar to the New Style dialog box), from 
which you can define the multilevel style name options (Figure 7-13).
Figure 7-13.  Use the Define New List Style… command found in the Multilevel 
List tool to show the associated dialog box, from which you can create a new 
numbering system
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

287
You can use these options to define a new numbering system:
•	
Name: Associate the new numbering system to a style name, which 
will be sequentially numbered as Style1, Style2, etc. (you can’t use 
a name already used). The style name will appear only when you 
expand the Multilevel List tool and point to the Lists Style area.
•	
Formatting area: Show basic options found in the Define new 
Multilevel list dialog box to define the stating number and Outline 
level, some character options (font, size, bold, italic, underline, 
and color), whether in will receive numbers or bullets, symbols or 
pictures, and it left indent. Also define if this numbering system 
will be stored inside this document or in the associated document 
template.
All the Formatting area options can be set by clicking the Format button at the 
bottom of this dialog box and selecting the Numbering option, which will show the 
Define new Multilevel list dialog box in Figures 7-11 and 7-12, from which you can  
fine-­tune the desired Heading numbering system.
Quickly Navigating with Heading Styles
Since most people don’t know what the Outline level property does, or about the 
Navigation Pane Headings view, in is not unusual to find body text paragraphs that 
received some Outline level options appearing in the Navigation pane Headings view: 
they were inadvertently formatted with Outline Level 1 to Level 9, probably selected 
out of pure curiosity when the user, trying to make sense of such properties, noted that 
nothing happened to the text and left in applied to the body text.
Let us see an example of such formatting: extract the “The Count of Monte Cristo, 
Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4 Bad Outline level.docx” document from Chapter07.zip 
file and open in in Microsoft Word.
Note that in has just the first 28 pages of the famous Alexandre Dumas book, where 
Title, Subtitle, and Heading styles were applied, along with the Elegant Style Set available 
in the Style Set Gallery found in the Design tab of the Ribbon (Figure 7-14).
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

288
The document seems to be quite well formatted, but when you show the Navigation 
pane with the Headings view selected (check the Navigation pane in the Show area of 
the View tab of the Ribbon, or press Ctrl+F and click Headings), you will note that in has 
a lot of body text paragraphs that received some Outline level property (as the file name 
implies, Figure 7-15).
Figure 7-14.  This is “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4 
Bad Outline level.docx” document, extracted from Chapter07.zip, which received 
the Title, Subtitle, and Heading Recommended styles (plus Normal for the body 
text), and was formatted with the Elegant Style Set, found in the Style Set Gallery of 
the Design tab of the Ribbon.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

289
Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to fix “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, 
Chapter 1-4 Bad Outline level.docx” document by manually changing any body text 
paragraphs that received an Outline view by reapplying the Normal style.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+F to show the Navigation pane and click the Headings 
option.
	 2.	 In the Navigation pane, click any body text paragraph that is not a 
Chapter title and appears in its Headings view.
	 3.	 Microsoft Word puts the text cursor at the beginning of such 
paragraphs in the Document window. Reapply the Normal style to 
remove it Outline level using one of these options:
Figure 7-15.  Use the Navigation pane Headings view to search for body text 
paragraphs that inadvertently received some Outline level property. Use the pane 
to quickly move through the document (by clicking any chapter heading) or easily 
select these badly formatted paragraphs.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

290
•	
Click the Normal style in the Styles Gallery, or
•	
Press Ctrl+Space (the recommended shortcut that should be 
associated with the Normal style).
	 4.	 Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there are no body text paragraphs 
appearing in the Navigation pane.
Attention  Before reapplying the Normal style, right-click the paragraph text 
and choose Paragraph in the Context menu to see it Outline level. Compare with it 
indentation in the Navigation pane.
The body text paragraphs will disappear from the Navigation pane Headings view as 
you reapply them the Normal style (which has Outline level = Body text, Figure 7-16).
Figure 7-16.  In the Navigation pane, click any body text paragraph to select in 
the Document window and reapply the Normal style to redefine in Outline level to 
Body text and remove in from the Headings view
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

291
Exercise 2
The objective of this exercise is to fix “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, 
Chapter 1-4 Bad Outline level.docx” document using the Replace command to 
automatically apply the Normal style.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the Replace command in the Editing area of the Home tab of 
the Ribbon to show the Find and Replace dialog box.
	 2.	 In the Find what text box, click in Format ➤ Style to show the Style 
dialog box and select the Normal style.
	 3.	 In the Replace with text box, click Format ➤ Style to show the 
Style dialog box and select the Normal style.
	 4.	 Press Replace all to find each Normal style paragraph and reapply 
the Normal style.
The body text paragraphs will disappear from the Navigation pane Headings view 
(Figure 7-17).
Attention  “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4 Heading 
styles.docx” document has a fixed version of the first four chapters of the famous 
Alexandre Dumas book, where just the Heading styles have the Outline level 
property defined. In was also formatted using the Formal style set found in the 
Style Set Gallery of the Design tab of the Ribbon.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

292
Attention  Microsoft Word gives incorrect messages regarding the number of 
paragraph styles found and replaced in the document.
Figure 7-17.  Use the Replace command to find each Normal style paragraph 
and replace in with a Normal style (reapply style). Microsoft Word will reaply the 
Normal style to all Normal formatted paragraphs, restituting the Outline level = 
Body text property.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

293
Creating TOC: Table of Contents
As you can see, Heading styles alone with the aid of the Outline level property creates 
the document TOC (Table of Contents), which is automatically shown in the Navigation 
pane Headings view.
So, to create any document’s Table of Contents, Microsoft Word just need to find 
those text paragraphs that have an Outline level property set and present them in a list, 
with or without their page numbers, wherever you want in the document.
Attention  Microsoft Word may use every paragraph that has an Outline level 
property set to compose the Table of Contents. So be aware that you must inspect 
the Navigation pane to guarantee that no body text paragraph is inadvertently 
formatted with some Outline level defined.
Figure 7-18.  “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4 Heading 
styles.docx”, where just Heading styles have an Outline level, using the Formal style set
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

294
The entire process needed to create the document TOC is as follows:
	 1.	 Show the Navigation pane (Ctrl+F, click Headings view).
	 2.	 Apply to the document paragraphs the correct Heading styles.
	 3.	 Click the desired document position where the Table of Contents 
must be inserted.
	 4.	 Execute Table of Contents command found in the Table of 
Contents area of the References tab of the Ribbon.
Although you can create the document’s Table of Contents anywhere in the 
document, in is normally inserted in an independent page after the document title page.
Suppose that we are interested in creating the Table of Contents for “The Count of 
Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4, Heading styles.docx” document shown in 
Figure 7-18, which is already formatted using just Heading1 styles (Outline level = Level 1).  
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4, 
Heading styles.docx” document in Microsoft Word.
	 2.	 Click the beginning of the “Chapter1” paragraph (Microsoft Word 
will insert the Table of Contents before the selected paragraph).
	 3.	 Click the Table of Contents command found in the Table of 
Contents area of the References tab of the Ribbon and select the 
first TOC style proposed.
Microsoft Word will run through all the document pages searching for paragraphs 
that have the Outline level set, and will insert the document’s Table of Contents at the 
desired document position (Figure 7-19):
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

295
Figure 7-20 shows the final result: all Heading1 style paragraphs that identify the 
first four chapters of the “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4, 
Heading styles.docx” were found and inserted in the document’s Table of Contents along 
with the page number where each one appears (this document shows the page number 
in the bottom right of the page).
Figure 7-19.  To create the Table of Contents for the “The Count of Monte Cristo, 
Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4, Heading styles.docx” document, click the 
paragraph that will receive in and click the Table of Contents command found  
in the References tab of the Ribbon.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

296
Fast, huh? How many times have you spent precious minutes (or hours) manually 
creating a document’s Table of Contents?
Understanding the Table of Contents
Let’s study what Microsoft Word did to understand how to better manipulate any of the 
automatically created Table of Contents.
•	
Table of Contents is an object inserted in the text: Click the Table 
of Contents and note that Microsoft Word surrounds in as a single 
object that can be easily deleted.
•	
Table of Contents is a calculated field: Press Alt+F9 and note the field 
code used by Microsoft Word to create the Table of Contents. Press 
Alt+F9 again to recalculate in and show it pages again (Figure 7-21).
Figure 7-20.  The “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4, 
Heading styles.docx” with the Table of Contents automatically created by  
Microsoft Word
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

297
Attention  When you press Alt+F9 to show Microsoft Word Field codes, you are 
actually checking the Show field codes instead of their values option found in the 
File ➤ Option ➤ Advanced ➤ Show document content area of the Word Options 
dialog box.
•	
Table of Contents entries are hyperlinks: Ctrl+click any table entry 
to instantly move to this part of the document (you can also use the 
Navigation pane to do this).
•	
Table of Contents uses special styles: Both the Table of Contents 
title and it text paragraph are formatted with special styles. Expand 
the Style Gallery, click the Apply Styles… command to show the 
Apply Styles window, and inspect them.
Figure 7-21.  Press Alt+F9 to alternate from Field code view and Field value view. 
This figure shows that the Table of Contents is a Microsoft Word calculated field. 
The Alt+F9 key combination forces the field to be updated.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

298
•	
The chapter titles formatted with Heading1 style received the 
TOC1 style (point the mouse to the left of each Table of Contents 
entry, click to select the entire paragraph, and check the style in 
the Apply Styles window, Figure 7-23).
Figure 7-23.  Each index entry is formatted with a TOCn style, where n is 
associoated with the paragraph Ouline level (e.g., Heading1 receives TOC1, 
Heading2 receives TOC2, etc.)
Figure 7-22.  The Table of Contents is an object that uses special styles to format it 
components: it title (CONTENT) is formatted using the TOC Heading style
•	
The CONTENTS title was formatted using the TOC Heading style 
and has the same formatting used by Heading1 style (Figure 7-22).
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

299
Attention  Just the Apply Styles window synchronizes the paragraph style when 
you click in in the text. The Styles window will also show in, but you will need to 
make in show all document styles (Options ➤ Select styles to show = All styles) 
and scroll it style list to see the style name selected.
There is a TOCn style for each Headingn Recommended style (TOC1 to Heading1, 
TOC2 to Heading2, etc.). This is one of the reasons that Microsoft Word has so 
many styles inserted in any document.
•	
TOC1 style is based in Heading1 style: Use the Modify… button of 
the Apply styles window to show the Modify Style dialog box and note 
that it Style is based in = Heading1.
•	
TOC entries uses a Right tab stop and leading dots: Click any 
TOC entry and double-click the Right tab stop located at the right 
paragraph margin to show the Tabs dialog box (Figure 7-24).
Figure 7-24.  Double-click the Right tab stop positioned at the right margin of any 
TOC entry and note that in is fulfilled with dot leaders between the end of the entry 
text and the page number
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

300
•	
TOCn styles updates automatically: Show the Modify Style dialog 
box for TOC1 style (or any other TOCn style) and note that in has 
these properties: Style based in = Normal and Automatically update 
checked. This means that in may inherit most Normal style changes, 
and that changes made to any paragraph formatted using TOC1 will 
instantly reflect in the style.
For example, drag the Chapter 1 table entry Right tab stop to the 
left to a new position and note that the entire Table of Contents 
will be reformatted (Figure 7-25).
As you can see, the knowledge gathered so far in this book has begun to pay dividends. 
Many formatting details discussed in previous chapters may now make sense to you.
Figure 7-25.  Since any TOCn style has the Update automatically option set, any 
change made to a TOCn paragraph updates the style property, immediately reflected 
in all paragraphs formatted with in. This figure changes the position of the Right tab 
of the first table entry, changing the entire Table of Contents appearance.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

301
Attention  Field codes appear with a gray background due to the Field  
Shading = As Select option found below the Show field codes instead of their 
values found in the File ➤ Option ➤ Advanced ➤ Show document content  
area of the Word Options dialog box.
Updating the Table of Contents
The automatically created Table of Contents may need to be updated for many reasons; 
the most probable ones are changes in the document by insertions, deletions, or changes 
in the body text or section titles formatted with Heading styles, which may impact the 
document page count or Table of Contents composition.
Whenever necessary, you can update the Table of Contents by first clicking the Table 
of Contents to select in (in will become grayed) and using one of these methods:
•	
Press the F9 function key.
•	
Click the Update Table command located above the Table of Contents 
object.
Both options will make Microsoft Word show the Update Table of Contents dialog 
box, from which you can select:
•	
Update page numbers only: Table of Contents entries will not be 
changed, just their page numbers; or
•	
Update entire table: to rebuild the Table of Contents.
Attention  Although the Table of Contents is a Microsoft Word calculated field, 
in entries are fully editable: you can insert paragraphs and text between them, 
change the entry titles, and so on. By selecting the first options, all changes 
manually made by you will be kept. The Updated entire table options rebuilds in, 
discarding any changes manually made to in.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

302
Let us see this in practice still using the “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre 
Dumas, Chapter 1-4, Heading styles.docx” document, performing these steps:
	 1.	 Right-click the “Chapter 1” paragraph (formatted with Heading1 
style) and choose Paragraph in the context menu to show the 
Paragraph dialog box.
	 2.	 In the Paragraph dialog box, select the Line and Page Breaks tab 
and check the Page break before option (Figure 7-26).
	 3.	 Close the Paragraph dialog box and note that now “Chapter 1” 
begins in a new page (in will now print in page 2, increasing page 
count to 27).
	 4.	 Right-click the Heading1 style in the Styles Gallery and choose 
Update Heading1 to Match Selection option (Figure 7-27).
Figure 7-26.  Right-click “Chapter 1”, choose Paragraph in the context menu, and 
in the Paragraph dialog box select the Page break before option
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

303
	 5.	 All other chapter titles formatted with the Heading1 style (or 
based in in) will now begin in a new page.
Attention  Since “CONTENT” header formatted with TOC Heading style is based 
in the Heading1 style, in will also receive the Page break before by inheritance, 
and will now print in page 2; Chapter 1 will print in page 3, and the page count will 
increase from 27 to 30.
	 6.	 Click the Table of Contents and use one of the methods proposed 
in the preceding (press F9 function key or click Update table 
command above the Table of Contents object) to show the Update 
Table of Contents dialog box, select one of it options, and press 
Enter to update the document’s Table of Contents (Figure 7-28).
Attention  Extract “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4, 
Heading styles with TOC.docx” document from the Chapter07.zip file. It Heading1 
style was formatted with the Page break before paragraph option, thus inserting it 
Table of Contents in the document’s second page (due to inheritance).
Figure 7-27.  Once “Chapter 1” paragraph formatted with Heading1 style has the 
Page break before option set, right-click Heading1 style in the Styles Gallery and 
choose Update Heading1 to Match the Selection option, to make every Heading1 
style begin in a new page.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

304
Attention  There is no way to control the appearance of “CONTENT” or “TABLE 
OF CONTENTS” paragraph above the automatically generated Table of Contents, 
whenever you use one of the first options proposed by this command. However, 
you can change this paragraph text or even manually delete in from the text (in will 
be reinserted whenever you need to rebuild the Table of Contents).
Deleting a Table of Contents Object
You can delete a Table of Contents object inserted in any document in two different ways:
•	
Use the Remove Table of Contents command found in the Table of 
Contents command of the Reference table or in the context menu 
found in the Table of Contents object header.
Figure 7-28.  To update the Table of Contents, click it entries (they will become 
grayed), press F9, and show one of the options available: update just the page 
numbers or update the entire table
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

305
•	
Use the mouse to select the title and table entries of the Table of 
Contents object (they will become grayed, with the table entries 
using a deep gray color) and press Delete.
Custom Table of Contents
Microsoft Word continues to support it standard way of creating a Table of Contents 
using the Custom Table of Contents… command found in References tab, Table of 
Contents command list, which will show the Table of Contents dialog box, which offers 
the same interface employed by all Microsoft Word versions prior to Microsoft Office 2007  
(Figure 7-29).
Figure 7-29.  The Custom Table of Contents… command shows the Table of 
Contents dialog box from which you can control how Microsoft Word will create 
the Table of Contents for the document
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

306
The Print Preview list shows the TOC appearance, while the Web Preview list shows 
in if you save the document with the HTML format. You also have these options:
•	
Show page numbers: Uncheck to hide the page numbers for 
the Heading styles found in the document (this option must be 
unchecked when you are formatting a document to be converted to 
some e-book format, like e-pub or MOBI formats).
•	
Right align page number: Makes the page numbers appear aligned 
to the right page border by inserting a Right tab stop in each TOCn 
style. Uncheck to make the number appear next to the Heading 
formatted paragraph text.
•	
Tab leader: Allows selection of the way Microsoft will fill the space 
between the last character of the Heading formatted paragraph and 
the page number (relates to the same option found in the Tabs dialog 
box; default is leading dots).
•	
Use hyperlinks instead of page numbers: Suppresses the page 
number when the document is formatted using the HTML format 
(since they will not make sense anymore).
•	
Formats: Allows selection of different formats to the Table of 
Contents (default is From template, but you can select among Classic, 
Distinctive, Fancy, Modern, Formal, and Simple).
Attention  When you select different options from the Formats list, Microsoft 
Word changes the formatting options of styles TOC1 to TOC9.
•	
Show levels: Uses numbers 1 to 9 to allow selection of which 
Heading styles will be automatically selected in the text to compose 
the document’s Table of Contents. Default value is 3, meaning that 
Heading1, Heading2, and Heading3 will be used.
•	
Options: Shows the Table of Contents Options dialog box that allows 
associating numbers 1 to 9 to the styles that must be used to compose the 
Table of Contents. Default association is Heading1 = 1, Heading2 = 2…  
until Heading9 =9, according to the Show levels option selected 
(Figure 7-30). Use this option to compose other types of Tables of 
Contents, like Chapter TOC, List of Tables, List of Figures, etc.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

307
Whenever you use the Custom Table of Contents… command to show the Table of 
Contents dialog box and click OK to close in, Microsoft Word will check if the document 
already has a Table of Contents object inserted. If this is true, in will select the first Table 
of Contents object found and will ask if you want to replace in. Use “Yes” to replace the 
existing Table of Contents by the new options selected. Use “No” to insert another Table 
of Contents object in the document at the text cursor position (Figure 7-31).
Figure 7-30.  Use the Table of Contents Options dialog box to create Table of 
Contents using any styles available in the document

308
Exercise 3
The objective of this exercise is to quickly format a document using Recommended 
styles and create two Table of Contents: one for the chapters and another for it figures.
Extract “The Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 1-4, Ilustrated.docx” 
document from Chapter07.zip file and open in in Microsoft Word.
Figure 7-31.  By answering “No” when Microsoft Word asks to “Replace the Table 
of Contents?”, a new Table of Contentes is created at the cursor position, with no 
title, and with the desired format and options chosen
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

309
Scroll through this document’s pages and note that in has some of the figures used to 
illustrate the original edition (created by G. Staal, J.A. Beauce, and other eminent French 
artists of the late 19th century), followed by a figure description paragraph, formatted in bold.
You must format this document by following these specifications:
	 1.	 Apply Title and Subtitle styles for the document title and author 
name, respectively.
	 2.	 Join each “Chapter n” paragraph with the next to produce the 
most concise Table of Contents and apply the Heading1 style, 
which must be changed to begin in a new page.
	 3.	 Make Microsoft Word automatically number each image 
description using “Figure n: ” as prefix (where n represents the 
figure count).
	 4.	 Guarantee that each figure and it paragraph description appear 
center aligned in the same page.
	 5.	 Create the document’s Table of Contents for chapter titles and the 
“List of Figures” for figure descriptions, keeping both indexed in 
the first page (after the author name).
Let’s get started!
Join Two Paragraphs and Apply Heading1 Style
This is a very simple task to do manually in such a small document: you just need to put 
the text cursor at the end of each “Chapter n” paragraph (press End key), type a colon 
followed by a space (“: ”), and press Delete to remove the Paragraph break and join in 
with the chapter title that comes next.
But if the document has all it chapters, this manual operation may take a long time to 
accomplish. Let’s do in using a Find and Replace wildcard operation:
	 1.	 Click the Replace command in the Editing area of the Home tab of 
the Ribbon to show the Find and Replace dialog box.
	 2.	 Click More>> to expand in and check the Use wildcards option.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

310
	 3.	 Click Find what text box and type: (Chapter*)(^13)(*13) 
(Chapter*) to find each chapter title; * finds it number, (^13) finds 
a Paragraph break that follows in, and the second (*^13) finds the 
next text paragraph and it Paragraph break.
	 4.	 Click Replace all text box and type: \1: \3 “\1: ” without quotes, 
represents the (Chapter*) wildcard used in the Find what text 
box, followed by a colon and a space; \3 represents the (*^13) 
wildcard that selects the next paragraph and it Paragraph break.
	 5.	 While in the Replace all text box, click Format ➤ Styles and choose 
Heading1.
	 6.	 Press Replace all to replace all for occurrences in the text and 
apply the Heading1 style (Figure 7-32).
Figure 7-32.  Use a Find and Replace wildcard operation to join each “Chapter n” 
paragraph with the next, while also formatting in with the Heading1 style
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

311
Figure 7-33.  Right-click any Heading1 formatted paragraph, show the Paragraph 
dialog box, and check the Page break before option. Then, right-click the Heading1 
style in the Styles Gallery and choose Update Heading1 to Match Selection.
These six steps join each chapter title with the chapter description and apply the 
Heading1 style. Now make the Heading1 style begin in a new page:
	 1.	 Right-click any Heading1 style formatted paragraph, select 
Paragraph in the context menu, click the Line and Page Breaks tab, 
and check the Page break before option.
	 2.	 Close the Paragraph dialog box.
	 3.	 Right-click Heading1 style in the Style Gallery and choose Update 
Heading1 to Match the Selection option (Figure 7-33).
The document will now have 28 pages with each chapter and description printing in 
a single line of text and beginning a new page.
Makes Image and Description Print in Same Page
To guarantee that each image paragraph and the paragraph description that follows in 
print in the same page you need to create two new styles:
•	
FigureCaption: bold, center aligned, numbered with prefix “Figure n”.  
Shortcut key Shift+Alt+F.
•	
Figure: center aligned with the Keep with next paragraph property 
selected. Style to follow = ImageCaption. Shortcut key Alt+F.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

312
To create the FigureCaption style, follow these instructions:
	 1.	 Scroll through the document and click any figure description 
paragraph (in bold, after each figure).
	 2.	 Center align this description paragraph.
	 3.	 Click the Numbering tool found in the Paragraph area of the Home 
tab of the Ribbon and select the Define New Number Format… 
command to show the Define New Number Format dialog box.
	 4.	 In the Define New Number Format dialog box, click the beginning of the 
Number format option and type “Figure ” (note the space, Figure 7-34).

caption was formatted with bold.
Create the Document’s Table of Contents
Now that the document has already been tagged with Heading1 and FigureCaption 
styles, in will be easy to create the document’s Table of Contents and List of Figures 
indexes by just following these steps:
	 1.	 Place the text cursor at the beginning of the “Chapter 1 - 
Marseilles - The Arrival” paragraph.
	 2.	 Click References ➤ Table of Contents and select the first Table of 
Contents option to generate the document’s Table of Contents for

Figure 7-35.  Click the beginning of “Chapter 1: Marseilles - The Arrival” paragraph, 
select References ➤ Table of Contents command, and select the first option to insert 
a Table of Contents above the first chapter title. Note that Microsoft Word put the 
wrong page number in the index (in does not consider that “Contents” TOC title is 
based in Heading1 and has the Page break before option set).
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

316
Attention  Since the Heading1 style has the Page break before option set, the 
Table of Contents will be generated in a new page. Note that in Figure 7-35 the 
“Chapter 1 - Marseilles - The Arrival” paragraph appears in page 2 in it table entry, 
which is a wrong guess, since in actually appears in page 3.
Microsoft Word 2016 has a bug here because in does not take into account that 
the “CONTENTS” may have the Page break before paragraph option set. Click the 
Table of Contents, press F9 to show the Update Table of Contents dialog box, and 
update the index, whenever is necessary.
	 3.	 Right-click the “Contents” paragraph above the Table of Contents 
(formatted with the TOC Heading style), select Paragraph to show 
the Paragraph dialog box, and uncheck the Page break before option.
	 4.	 The Table of Contents will now print in the first document page, below 
the Author name formatted with the Subtitle style (Figure 7-36).

Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

327
Attention  The “European Convention of Human Rights Formatted.docx” 
document found inside Chapter07.zip file received all these formatting options and 
the Simple Style set, found in Design tab.
Using the Outline View
Once your document is structured using the Recommended Heading styles, you can 
get more control over headings and the text itself using Microsoft Word Outline view: 
a powerful way to move text around and control the heading levels spread through the 
document.
To effectively use the Outline view, in is necessary that you have a document 
formatted with Heading styles of many levels, so this time I will use as example the 
“European Convention of Human Rights Headings.docx” document, which you can 
extract from Chapter07.zip file; this document was formatted using Heading1 to 
Heading4 for it section titles, and it received the Minimalist Style set found in the Design 
tab (Figure 7-43).
Attention  For those of you that are interested in how to apply Heading1 to each 
“CHAPTER n” paragraph and Heading2 to the text that comes next, with a Find 
and Replace wildcard operation, here goes the tip: first format each “CHAPTER n” 
paragraph and the next with bold (Find what: (CHAPTER*^13)(*^13)), Replace with: 
Bold), then change just “CHAPTER” paragraphs to Heading1, not bold (Find what: 
(CHAPTER*^13), Replace with: Heading1, Regular). Finally, replace what is still bold 
with Heading2 (Find what: Normal style, Bold, Replace with: Heading2, Regular).
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

328
To active the Microsoft Word Outline view, click the Outline view command found 
in the Views area of the View tab of the Ribbon. Microsoft Word will show and activate 
the Outlining tab next to the File tab and will put small circles at left of each body text 
paragraph (Figure 7-44).
Figure 7-43.  This is the “European Convention of Human Rights Headings.docx” 
document, which you can extract from the Chapter07.zip file; it has Heading1 
to Heading4 Recommend styles applied to key text paragraphs (look to the 
Navigation pane Headings view).
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

329
Attention  To deactivate Microsoft Word Outline view, click the Close Outline 
View button of the Outlining tab and use the Views area options of the View tab 
by clicking the Print Layout button located in the Microsoft Word status bar’s 
right side.
Selecting Outline Levels
Use the Show Level list of the Outlining tab to decide which outline levels must be 
shown. Each level selected shows the level selected and all precedent levels. For 
example, by selecting Level 1, just Heading1 paragraph styles are shown. Selecting 
Level 2, Heading1, and Heading2 paragraphs is shown.
Figure 7-45 shows Microsoft Word Outline view exhibiting the Heading1 and 
Heading2 style paragraphs applied to the “European Convention of Human Rights 
Headings.docx” document. Note that each heading level received a ⊕ symbol to it left 
as an indication that you can expand in to show the text inside the heading. Also note 
that the Navigation pane Headings view is not affected by the Outline view Show Level 
option.
Figure 7-44.  The Outlining tab shown with the Outline command in the View tab 
offers tools to manage Heading styles and it contents
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

330
Note that the Outlining tab has these options below the Show Level list:
•	
Show Text Formatting: checked by default, allows you to show the 
text formatting applied to each Heading style in the Outline view;
•	
Show First Line only: unchecked by default, shows just the first body 
text line inside each Heading style.
To partially reveal other possible headings inside a collapsed Heading style shown 
in Outline view, click the heading and use the + collapse button located in the Outlining 
tab (use the - collapse button to collapse in again). Figure 7-46 shows the “DIGNITY” 
paragraph expanded showing all Heading3 paragraphs that exist inside in. Click the + 
button again to show all Heading4 styles.
Figure 7-45.  The Outline view after selecting Show Level= Level 2 option. In now 
shows just Heading1 and Heading2 style paragraphs.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

331
To reveal all the text inside any Heading style, double-click the ⊕ symbol to it left 
(or use the Expand + button of the Outlining tab). Figure 7-47 shows the “DIGNITY” 
paragraph formatted with Heading2 style expanded with the Show First Line option 
checked. Note that all it subheadings (Heading3 and Heading4) are now shown in the 
Document window.
Figure 7-46.  Use the Expand and Collapse buttons of the Outlining tab to 
partially expand and collapse any Heading style
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

332
If you double-click any Heading style to expose all it contents, use the - collapse 
button of the Outlining tab to collapse the body text and show it lowest Heading level (in 
this case, Heading4 paragraphs). Keep pressing - button in the Outlining tab to collapse 
the headings.
Promoting and Demoting Outline Levels
The Outline view is perfect when you want to organize your thoughts by changing the 
outline levels of one or many headings at once using the Outlining tools to promote or 
demote Heading styles (Figure 7-48).
Figure 7-47.  Double-click the ⊕ symbol to the left of any Heading style in Outline 
view to expand in and show it contents. This figure has the Show First Line Only 
checked, showing just the first body text line of each Heading4 style.
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

333
As you can see, you can use the Promote button to make Heading2 become 
Heading1, or instantly promote any Heading style to Heading1. Or use the Demote 
button to make Heading1 become Heading2 or demote any Heading style to Body text 
(with Normal style).
There are simple rules to promote or demote any Heading style.
•	
Click the Heading text to act just in in (it subheadings must not be 
grayed).
•	
Click the Heading ⊕ symbol to select all it contents to act in in and all 
it subheadings (if any).
Suppose for example that you want to insert a new “ABOUT DIGNITY” Heading2 
style before the “DIGNITY” paragraph and demote the “DIGNITY” Heading2 and all 
it content to a lower outline level. Using the Outline view you just need to follow these 
steps.
	 1.	 Click at left of the “DIGNITY” Heading2 paragraph and press 
Enter to insert another Heading2 paragraph before in (the 
Navigation pane will show this new empty Heading2 style).
	 2.	 Type “ABOUT DIGNITY” into the paragraph text.
	 3.	 Click the ⊕ symbol at left of the “DIGNITY” paragraph to select all 
it content.
Figure 7-48.  Use the Outlining tab tools to promote or demote Heading styles in 
the Outline view
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

334
	 4.	 Use the Demote right-pointing arrow of the Outlining tab to 
demote in to Heading3 (all the Heading3 styles inside will be 
demoted to Heading4, and the Heading4 will be demoted to 
Heading5, Figure 7-49).
Figure 7-49.  Use the Outline view to insert new Heading styles and reorganize the 
Heading levels with the Promote and Demote tools found in the Outlining tab
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

335
Moving Heading Contents
Using the Outline view, you can move large blocks of text to a new position without 
needing to select, copy, and paste text in the document; instead, you can use the Move 
down and Move up tools found in the Outlining tab.
In quite simple to use, and they obey the same rules as the Promote and Demote 
tools:
	 1.	 If just the Heading style is selected (it content is not grayed), just it 
text will be moved.
	 2.	 If all the Heading style and it contents are selected (they are all 
grayed), all the text will be moved.
The easiest way to move Heading and contents is to first collapse in and then use 
the Move up or Move down tools of the Outlining tab, or just drag the Heading with the 
mouse to a new position and… voilà! All text will be repositioned inside the document.
Figure 7-50 shows how you can move “CHAPTER I” and all it contents below the 
CHAPTER II content. Easy, isn’t in?
Chapter 7  Using Heading Styles

336
Figure 7-50.  Use the Outline view to move Headings and in contents to a new 
position inside the document. Collapse the desired Heading first, click the ⊕ symbol 
at left, to select all it contents and drag in with the mouse to a new position (or use 
the Move up and Mode down tools of the Outlining tab).

337
Conclusion
Heading styles are among the most powerful of the Microsoft Word tools to format and 
organize the text.
They are based in the Outline level property found in the Paragraph dialog box to 
hierarchically define Heading precedence in the text. By using Heading1 to Heading9 
to format your document chapter and section titles, you can take full advantage of 
the Navigation pane and the Design tab tools, automatically create Table of Contents 
indexes, and use the Outline view to easily restructure your thoughts by changing 
Heading levels and moving large blocks of text with simple mouse operations.

CHAPTER 8
Page Formatting
Microsoft Word pages are easy to configure once you understand how it works and can 
differentiate types and usage. In this chapter, you will learn how to take the most from 
the Page Setup dialog box and the usage of the page Header and Footer areas to achieve 
better results in your document formatting and exporting.
You will learn how to create and manage different types of Header and Footer, how 
to correctly insert page numbers (and page count), and how to produce nicely formatted 
e-books, PDF files, and booklet printing using Microsoft Word options.
The documents cited in this chapter and the Exercise sections can be found by 
downloading the Chapter08.zip file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
Types of Documents
Text documents differ one another in the types of pages they use, and for the sake of this 
discussion they can be considered as
•	
Single-page documents: print on just one side of the paper and one 
or two types of pages: the first page and the others.
•	
Mirror page documents: print on both page sides and have two or 
three types of pages: the first page, odd pages (front), and even pages 
(back).
•	
Complex documents: may have different types of pages, not just 
changing which side of the paper they print on, but also presenting 
different page sizes and orientations.
Microsoft Word deals with such page variability inside any text document using the 
Page Setup dialog box (and its three tabs) to configure the pages, and the hidden Section 
break character to indicate where one page type begins and another ends.

340
The first step to master how to format different page sizes is to understand the Page 
Setup dialog box and how each document page is constituted.
Page Setup
Whenever you open a new, blank document in Microsoft Word, you receive a new blank 
page; the size of this page is associated to the page size defined in your default printer, 
so the first action to produce any printed document is to configure its page size: the 
medium in which it will be printed and becomes alive.
This is done using one of these methods:
•	
Using the Size command found in the Page Setup area of the Layout 
tab to select one of the already set-up page sizes (Figure 8-1).
Figure 8-1.  Use the Size command found in the Page Setup area of the Layout tab 
to select a predefined paper size or click on More Paper Sizes… to show the Page 
Setup dialog box
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

341
•	
Using the Page Setup dialog box, which can be shown by different 
methods:
•	
Double-clicking the ruler (the easiest way).
•	
Using the Size ➤ More Paper Sizes… command found in the Page 
Setup area of the Layout tab.
•	
Clicking the small Page Setup button found in the Page Setup 
area of the Layout tab.
•	
Using the File ➤ Print ➤ Margins ➤ Custom Margins… 
command.
Using any of these methods, you can change the options or show the Page  
Setup dialog box with the Paper tab selected (Figure 8-2), from where you use  
the Paper size area to select any of the page sizes presented by the Layout tab Size 
command (see Figure 8-1) or use the Width and Height text boxes to create a  
Custom Size.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

342
Attention  The Paper tab also allows selection of the printer tray used by the first 
page and other pages of the current document.
Paper orientation is selected in the Margins tab.
And once you have defined the paper size, it is time to adjust the document’s 
margins and header and footer sizes.
Figure 8-2.  Double-click the ruler or click the small button located on the bottom 
right side of the Page Setup area of the Layouo tab to show the Page Setup dialog 
box with the Paper tab selected
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

343
Margins, Header, and Footer
As seen in any other text-processing software, every Microsoft Word page has three main 
areas:
•	
Margins and the space inside them (where the document prints).
•	
Header: the space above top margin.
•	
Footer: the space below the bottom margin.
The text you type in any Microsoft Word document will appear inside the document 
margins of each document page, but whatever you type or insert in the Header or Footer 
areas will appear on every document page (that is why the Headers and Footers are used 
to convey document information like page number, page count, date printed, etc.).
Microsoft Word hides these areas from your eyes but you can get a hint about the size 
of these areas by
•	
Using the horizontal and vertical ruler.
•	
Setting two options found in the Show Document Content area of the 
Advanced option found in Word Options dialog box (File ➤ Options 
➤ Advanced):
•	
Show text boundaries
•	
Show crop marks.
Attention  It is not obvious to most people that both the Header and Footer are 
special document page areas, because everything you put in them will appear on 
every document page. They are mostly used to convey the page number, page

and so on.
Figure 8-3 shows how the white page looks when Crop marks are shown (appearing 
at the top left and bottom right page corners). It also shows the text boundary around the 
first empty page paragraph (with the Show/Hide tool checked so you can see the hidden 
Paragraph break character).

Accessing the Header and Footer Page Areas
There is more than one way to access the document page Header and Footer areas:
•	
Double-click the Header and Footer area (identify it by the dark 
gray area of the ruler, which is above the top crop mark or below the 
bottom crop mark).
•	
Use the Header ➤ Edit Header (or Footer ➤ Edit Footer) commands 
found in the Header and Footer area of the Insert tab of the Ribbon.
Whenever you access the Header or Footer area, Microsoft Word activates its content 
and deactivates the document content (the text of which becomes grayed), while it also 
activates and shows the Header & Footer Tools Design tab on the Ribbon, where you will 
find tools to manipulate this special document page area (Figure 8-4).
Figure 8-3.  The white page of a new Microsoft Word document showing Crop 
mark and Text boundary options set for its first paragraph. These options allow 
you to set the positions of the Header, Footer, and Page margins (top, left, right, and 
bottom margins).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

345
Once the page Header or Footer area is activated, you can alternate between the 
Header and Footer areas using the Goto Footer (or Goto Header) commands found in 
the Navigation area of the Header & Footer Tools Design tab of the Ribbon (Figure 8-5).
Figure 8-4.  Double-click the page area above (or below) the top (or bottom) 
crop mark to activate the page Header (or Footer). Microsoft Word will show the 
Header & Footer Design tab where you can find tools to manipulate this important 
document page area.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

346
Change Page Margin Size
Now that you know that the document page has the special areas called Margins, Header, 
and Footer, it is interesting to note that Microsoft Word has a dark gray area on its 
horizontal and vertical rulers to define the space used by its Left, Right, Top, and Bottom 
page margins, which also appear in the Header and Footer areas.
Figure 8-5.  To alternate between the page Header and Footer areas, use the Goto 
Footer and Goto Header commands found in the Navigation area of the Header & 
Footer Tools Design tab on the Ribbon
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

347
Since the page is the same for the entire document, whenever you change its 
margins, the entire document will obey these new margin values. And once more, this 
can be done in three different ways:
•	
Setting page, Header, and Footer margin sizes interactively, by 
dragging its Ruler guides (Left, Right, Top, and Bottom).
•	
Using the Layout and the Header & Footer Tools tabs.
•	
Using the Page setup dialog box.
Configuring Margins Using the Ruler
You can easily change the pages and header margins using the mouse to drag the ruler 
margin handles: they can be found where the horizontal and vertical ruler dark gray and 
white areas met.
Just point the mouse cursor to the ruler’s dark gray edge, until the mouse cursor 
changes shape to west-east arrow for both the left and right margins, or to a north-south 
arrow for the top and left margins, and then drag it to a new position.
Attention  The vertical ruler can be just shown in the Print Layout view (default 
Microsoft Word view), if the Show vertical ruler in Print Layout (found on Advanced 
➤ Display area of the Word Options dialog box) is checked. The dark gray area 
that represents the top and bottom page margins on the vertical ruler is shown just 
if the Show white space between pages in Print Layout (Display ➤ Page Display 
area) of the Word Options dialog box is checked (Figure 8-6).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

348
Figure 8-7 shows the mouse cursor positioned to change each page margin. Note 
that the horizontal ruler indicates the size of the left and right margins in its dark gray 
area, using the measurement unit defined by the Show measurements in units of option 
found in the Display area of the Advanced tab of the Word options dialog box (File ➤ 
Options ➤ Advanced), while the vertical ruler just shows it for the bottom margin (and I 
have no clue why Microsoft Word behaves this way).
Figure 8-6.  Check the Show white space between pages in Print Layout view 
(Display ➤ Page display options) and Show vertical ruler in Print Layout vie 
(Advanced ➤ Display options) of the Word Options dialog box (File ➤ Options) 
to ensure that the vertical ruler will appear correctly on the screen. Use the Show 
measurements in units of option to define the ruler unit measure.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

349
You may experience some difficulty in finding the left margin handle on the 
horizontal ruler, because it stays in between the First line indent and the Hanging indent 
controls. Be patient and try to correctly position the mouse cursor until the mouse cursor 
changes to a west-east arrow.
To change any margin size, just click the mouse on the ruler margin handle and drag 
it to a new position (Microsoft Word will show a horizontal or vertical dashed line in the 
document window).
Attention  Be aware that whenever you change any margin size, this change will 
affect the entire document forcing the text to reflux along its pages, meaning that 
you may need to update any Table of Contents object that may exist in it.
Figure 8-7.  Point the cursor to the dark gray edge of the horizontal or vertical 
ruler to find the left, right, top, and bottom margin handles
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

350
The same is true for Header and Footer top and bottom margins: whenever the 
Header is activated, you can drag its top margin handle on the vertical ruler to change its 
distance from the top edge of the page (by dragging the header vertical bottom margin 
handle, you change the associated document top page margin), or drag the Footer top 
margin handle on the vertical ruler to change its distance from the page bottom edge 
(Figure 8-8).
Attention  By dragging the Header or Footer horizontal left or right margin 
handles, you will change the document page’s left and right margins.
Attention  The changes made by dragging the Header or Footer top margins on 
the vertical ruler can also be made using numerical values typed into the Header 
from top or Footer from bottom controls found in the Position area of the Header & 
Footer Tools Design tab (see Figures 8-4 and 8-5).
Figure 8-8.  By dragging the Header or Footer top margins, you can change their 
distance from the page edge. Note that by dragging the Header (or Footer) bottom 
margin, you increase the Header (or Footer) height, but change the page top (or 
bottom) margin position.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

351
Configuring Margins Using the Layout Tab of the Ribbon
The Layout tab of the Ribbon offers the Margins command in its Page Setup area, from 
which you can select different margin profiles using the mouse. It will change the left, 
right, top, and bottom margins (and probably adjust the Header and Footer top margins) 
to give to your document a new appearance (Figure 8-9).
You can select among
•	
Normal, Narrow, Moderate, and Wide: to quickly change the size of 
the document margins and give it a new appearance;
•	
Mirrored: to create margins for documents printed on both paper 
sides (front and back), which produces odd and even pages whose 
margins are mirrored (left margin of an even page is the right margin 
of an odd page).
Figure 8-9.  Use the Margin command found in the Page Setup area of the Layout 
tab to easily change your document margins using different margin styles
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

352
Configuring Margins Using Page Setup Dialog Box
The most traditional way to configure the document page margins is using the Margins 
tab of Microsoft Word Page Setup dialog box, which can be shown using different 
methods:
•	
By double-clicking the ruler and selecting the Margin tab  
(the easiest way).
•	
By using the Margins ➤ Custom Margins… command found in the 
Page Setup area of the Layout tab (see Figure 8-9).
•	
By clicking the small Page Setup button found in the Page Setup area 
of the Layout tab (see Figure 8-9).
•	
By using the File ➤ Print ➤ Margins ➤ Custom Margins… command.
Any of these methods will show the Page Setup dialog box with the Margins tab 
selected (Figure 8-10), which offers these options:
•	
Margins area: used to define the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right 
margins, and the Gutter size and position.
Attention  Gutter is the typographical term for the page binding area that 
compensates for this unused paper part and gives the document real margins  
(it must not be used for single-page documents unless you plan to bind it by its 
entire left side).
•	
Orientation: alternates the page orientation between Portrait and 
Landscape, changing the position of the margins and the gutter.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

353
•	
Multiple pages: allows you to define if the document margins will 
change according to the document type:
•	
Normal: document prints just on front of paper, having just one 
type of margin.
•	
Mirror margins: document prints on both sides of paper, 
changing margin positions to the front or back of paper.
•	
2 pages per sheet: document prints two pages on a single  
paper side.
Figure 8-10.  The Page Setup dialog box with the Margins tab selected. Use it to 
precisely define the page margins, gutter size and position, page orientation, and 
number of pages used in the document (or when it is printed).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

354
•	
Book Fold: by selecting this option, you can print a booklet: a 
printing system that arranges two pages per side of the paper 
(creating what is called a signature of four pages into a single 
sheet of copy). These pages will then be folded in the middle 
and grouped to constitute the final print. The Sheets per booklet 
option defines how many consecutive pages will be printed on 
each sheet of paper.
•	
Apply to: this option appears in every Page Setup tab to indicate if the 
options set will apply to the whole document, this section, or from 
this point forward.
•	
Set as Default: click this button to redefine the default page size 
and margins used by Microsoft Word in every new document (it will 
change the Normal.dotx template).
Attention  Booklet is the name given to a small book (50 or fewer pages) where 
each paper page receives four (or multiple of four) document pages printed in 
front and back. These pages when stacked and folded in half compose the correct 
booklet page sequence, and the pages are stapled on the fold. You need a front 
and back printer to have better results.
Formatting E-books
Many people ask how to format a document in Microsoft Word so it can be used by an 
e-book reader (like the popular Amazon Kindle). It is important to know that this is more 
a matter of text formatting; there’s no need to bother with the page setup applied to the 
Microsoft Word document, because e-reader devices are quite variable in screen size 
and resolution.
In general, you must follow these formatting rules to create good-quality Microsoft 
Word documents that will be nicely read on most e-book devices:
•	
Body text: Font is unimportant because each reader has its own 
fonts. Format the Normal style with 10 pt size and a System font like 
Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

355
Paragraph alignment is unimportant because most e-readers use 
Left alignment. To detach each paragraph, apply a First line indent 
= 0.2 or a Space After = 6 pt size and Line spacing = single.
•	
Title, subtitle and section titles: Must be formatted with Title and 
Subtitle and the Heading styles, which must be no larger than 16 pt 
size. Heading1 can have the Page break before option set.
•	
Bold, Italic, Underline, and font formatting: Can be used at will.
•	
Header and Footer: Must be removed like in any new empty 
document.
•	
Page size, Margins, and Alignment: Must not be taken into account 
because these values will be ignored by the e-book converter.
•	
Table of Contents: Must be generated using the Custom Table of 
Contents… command and with the Show page number option 
unchecked (index entries must not be followed by page numbers; 
since page size is variable, page numbers do not make sense).
Once the document is correctly formatted you must save it on the disk and use an 
e-book converter software (like Calibre, GooReader, 2EPUB, etc.) to convert it to some 
popular e-book formats, like epub (preferred document format for Android and iOS 
devices, Kobo eReader, Barnes & Noble Nook, and Amazon Kindle Fire) or the also 
popular MOBI format (preferred document type for Kindle devices).
Simulating Kindle Paperwhite Screen
Since the first and most popular e-reader is Kindle, with Kindle Paperwhite having 
one of the smallest screens available (about 7”), you can use the Page Setup dialog box 
to simulate how the document will appear on the Kindle screen using these values 
(Figure 8-13):
•	
Page size; 3.5 × 4.75.
•	
Margins: 0.2 all around.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

356
Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to format a document to be used as an e-book and export 
it to Kindle MOBI format using Calibre free software.
You can verify how to format a document to be transformed into e-book by extracting 
“Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen eBook.docx” from the Chapter08.zip file and 
opening it in Microsoft Word. It has the full text of the famous 1811 Jane Austen book.
Follow these steps to verify how this document was formatted for e-book publication:
	 1.	 Verify that the document uses 174 pages to show the full book text 
using the current page size.
	 2.	 Double-click the ruler to show the Page Setup dialog box (or use 
the Margins and Size commands found in the Page Setup area of 
the Layout tab) and verify that:
•	
Page size = Letter (8.5 × 11.5).
•	
Margins = Normal (Top = Bottom = 0.98, Left = Right = 1.18).
	 3.	 Verify that the document has clean Header and Footer areas.
	 4.	 Explore the document text formatting:
•	
Book title and Author name received Title (Calibri 16 pt) and 
Subtitle (Calibri 11 pt) styles, both center aligned (Figure 8-11).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

357
•	
All “CHAPTER n” title sections received Heading1 style (Times 
New Roman 16 pt, center aligned, Space After = 24 pt, Page break 
before).
•	
Body text received Normal style (Times New Roman, 10 pt, left 
aligned, First line indent = 0.06, Widow/Orphan control.
Figure 8-11.  This is “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen eBook.docx”, which you 
can extract from Chapter08.zip file. It has the full book text presented in a 174-page 
document, formatted with Letter page size and Normal margins.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

358
Figure 8-12.  The “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen eBook.docx” document’s 
Table of Contents has no page numbers. Each “CHAPTER” section was formatted 
with Heading1 style (Times New Roman 16 pt, Page break before). Body text was 
formatted with Normal style (Times New Roman 10 pt, First line indent = 0.06).
	 5.	 The document’s Table of Contents uses just the Heading1 style 
without page numbers for its index entries (Figure 8-12).

359
Figure 8-13.  Use the Page Setup dialog box to simulate a Kindle Paperwhite 
screen (of 7”), using a Paper size Width = 3.5 and Height = 4.75. Define 0.2 margins 
all around the page.
	 6.	 Use the Page Setup dialog box to simulate the Kindle Paperwhite 
screen (Figure 8-13):
•	
Page size; 3.5 × 4.75.
•	
Margins: 0.2 all around.
Once you change the Paper size for simulating the Kindle Paperwhite screen, note 
that the page count increased to 573 pages!

Tips to Use Calibre to Produce E-books
Calibre is a free software e-book converter that you can download from this web site:
https://calibre-ebook.com/download
Open the Calibre interface and follow these steps to use a Microsoft Word document 
to produce an e-book:
	 1.	 Click the Add Books tool and select the Microsoft Word document 
file (Calibre will add it to the beginning of its list of files).
	 2.	 Click the Edit Metadata tool and fill the Title and Author name 
(click the arrows at the right of each field to fill the Title sort and 
Author sort text boxes).
	 3.	 If this is a book that already exists on the Internet, use the Edit 
Metadata dialog box Download Metadata button to search for its 
metadata.
Figure 8-14.  The “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen eBook Kindle.docx” 
document, formatted with a 3.5 × 4.75 page size and 0.2 of margins, now with 573 
pages, makes a good simulation of a Kindle Paperwhite screen.

format (MOBI for Kindle, EPUB for other e-readers).
	 9.	 Click OK to convert the document.
Calibre creates the Documents, Calibre Library folder where you will find the Author 
name folder (as defined in steps 2 through 4) with a different folder for each book 
converted. There you will find your MOBI or EPUB file, ready to be transferred to your 
e-reader.
Changing the Document Layout
A Microsoft Word document can print differently according to the selections made in the 
Layout tab of the Page Setup dialog box (Figure 8-15).
•	
Section: This option allows configuration of which type of section 
this page belongs to. Normally a document has just one section 
which begins on a new page (default option).
Attention  Section and its types were discussed earlier in Chapter 9,  
“Section Breaks”.
•	
Different odd and even: allows defining if the odd and even pages 
will have different Header and Footer areas (which is desirable in 
documents that will be printed on both sides of the paper).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

362
•	
Different first page: allows defining if the first document (or section) 
page will have a different Header and Footer area.
Figure 8-15.  Use the Layout tab of the Page Setup dialog box to configure how 
Microsoft Word manages the document page Header and Footer and the vertical 
alignment of the text
•	
From edge: use the Header and Footer options to change the top 
margin—or distance from page edge—for the Header and Footer 
areas (as you can do by dragging their top handles on the vertical 
ruler or by changing the Header from top or Footer from bottom 
options found in the Header and Footer Design tab, see Figures 8-4 
and 8-5).
•	
Vertical alignment: define how the text will be vertically aligned on 
each page of this document section. Default is Top, meaning that text 
begins to print on the top page margin (you can select center bottom 
or Justify vertical alignments).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

363
Header and Footer for Normal Documents
For the sake of this discussion a Normal document is one formatted with Multiple Pages 
= Normal in the Margin tab of the Page Setup dialog box, intended to be printed using 
just the front of the page.
Figure 8-16 shows Normal documents A, B, C, and D, which have different 
numbering options (and consequently different types of pages) according to the state of 
the Different odd and even and Different first page options found Page Setup dialog box 
Layout options:
•	
Document A: pages numbered on the top right side of the page 
(single page with a Header)
•	
Document B: pages numbered alternating the top left and top right 
side of the pages (two page types, with an Odd Page Header and an 
Even Page Header)
Figure 8-16.  Normal document types (A, B, C, and D) numbered according to the 
state of the Different odd and even Layout option (right column) and the Different 
first page option (lower row)
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

364
•	
Document C: first page numbered on Footer (center aligned). All 
others numbered on the top right side of the page (two page types, 
with a First Page Header and a Header)
•	
Document D: first page numbered on Footer (center aligned). All 
others pages numbered alternating the top left and top right side of 
the pages (three page types, with a First Page Header and an Odd 
Page Header and an Even Page Header)
You can reproduce such behavior in Microsoft Word following the next steps:
	 1.	 In a new Microsoft Word document, double-click the ruler to 
show the Page Setup dialog box and format a small page size of  
2 × 2, with 0.2 margins all around.
	 2.	 Close the Page Setup dialog box and press Ctrl+Enter twice to 
insert two hidden Page break characters (the document must have 
two pages).
	 3.	 Show the document Header area (double-click the top page area) 
to activate it and show the Header and Footer Design tab.
	 4.	 Note that the document has just one type of page (with a Header 
and Footer area, Figure 8-17).
Figure 8-17.  A normal document with two page breaks and a single type of page 
has just a Header and a Footer area
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

365
	 5.	 Check the Different first page options located in the Options area 
of the Header and Footer Design tab and note that now the first 
page has the First Page Header and First Page Footer areas, while 
all other pages have the Header and Footer areas (Figure 8-18).
	 6.	 Check the Different Odd & Even Pages options located in the 
Options area of the Header and Footer Design tab and note that 
now the document has on its first page the First Page Header and 
First Page Footer areas, on its second page the Even Page Header 
and Even Page Footer, and on its third page the Odd Page Header 
and Odd Page Footer areas (Figure 8-19).
Figure 8-18.  A normal document with the Different first page option set has the 
First Page Header and First Page Footer areas on its first page, while all other pages 
have just the Header and Footer areas
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

366
Follow these tips to navigate to the different types of pages produced by the Different 
first page and Different Odd & Even Pages options using the Navigation area of the 
Header & Footer Design tab tools:
•	
When the Header is activated and selected, use the Go To Footer 
button to select the Footer of the same page (vice versa with the Go 
To Header button).
•	
Press the Next button to go forward on the different page Headers or 
Footers.
•	
Press the Previous button to go backward on the different page 
Headers or Footers.
•	
Keep the Show document text selected to see the document text 
grayed (deactivated) when the Header/Footer is activated.
Figure 8-19.  When the Different First Page and Different Odd & Even Pages 
options found in the Options area of the Header and Footer Design tab are 
checked, a normal document will have three different page types: the first page, the 
even pages, and the odd pages
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

367
Inserting Header/Footer Objects
You can consider the Header and Footer page areas as mini text editors where you can 
insert anything, from a single text line, to a table, figure, shape, or object. What you must 
consider is that everything inserted in the Header or Footer areas will appear on every 
page of the same type (every normal page, first page, odd or even pages).
You can confirm that by activating any document Header (double-click the top of 
page Header area) and using the Shapes tool located in the Illustrations area of the Insert 
tab to insert any kind of shape into the page (Figure 8-20).
Figure 8-20.  Whatever you insert into the Header or Footer page areas will 
appear behind the text of every document page of the same type (even if it is 
floating in the document text area)
Close the Header area (double-click the document text area) and note that although 
the star shown in Figure 8-20 was inserted in the page Header area, it is floating outside 
the Header area over the document text area (inside the document margins). Press 
Ctrl+Enter to insert another document page and note that it now appears at the same 
position, behind the text of any document page of the same type (Figure 8-21).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

368
Figure 8-21.  Type some text and note that the shape was positioned behind the 
document text. Press Ctrl+Enter to insert a new page and note that the shape will 
now appear on every document page of the same type.
Attention  This is the principle used to create a page watermark: use the Header 
or Footer area to insert whatever you want to appear as watermark (figure, word 
art, table, etc.) floating over the page.
Microsoft Word explores this concept offering the Header and Footer tools found in 
the Header and Footer area of the Header & Footer Design tab to offer different types of 
built-in information and shapes that you can insert in the Header or the Footer area of 
your document (Figure 8-22).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

369
Attention  The Header and Footer commands are also found in the Head & Footer 
area of the Insert tab of the Ribbon, whenever the document text is active.
Each available built-in Header and Footer option has a name, and some of them 
were specifically tailored to be inserted in the First Page Header, Even Page Header, Odd 
Page Header, or normal Header.
Figure 8-22.  Use the Header and Footer tools found in the Header & Footer 
design tab to select different built-in texts and objects that you can insert in your 
document Header or Footer areas to compose its pages
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

370
Figure 8-23.  This is the “Builtin First, Even and Odd Header.docx” document, 
which received built-in formatted options on its first, even, and odd pages
You will find items to insert page number, author name, document title, date, etc., 
left, center or right aligned; it’s a matter of choice and taste to select what is available to 
quickly compose nice and professional formatting pages.
Figure 8-23 shows a Microsoft Word document that has the Different First Page and 
Different Odd & Even Pages options checked in the Layout tab, receiving the built-in 
Banded, Faced (Even page), and Faced (Odd page) inserted into its first, even, and odd 
pages, respectively.
Inserting Header/Footer Page Numbers
The document information most used in the Header or Footer area of Microsoft Word 
documents is page numbering, which must be inserted as a calculated field in the 
Header or Footer page areas, so it can appear on all document pages.
To number the document pages, use the Page Number control found in the Header 
& Footer area of the Insert tab (or in the Header & Footer Design tab that appears 
whenever the Header/Footer area is activated, Figure 8-24).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

371
You can select to put the page number calculated field at any of the following locations:
•	
Top of Page: meaning the page Header.
•	
Bottom of Page: meaning the page Footer.
•	
Page Margins: positioned at the left or right page margins.
•	
Current Position: where the text cursor is positioned, either in the 
Header/Footer area or in the document text.
As with the Header and Footer tools, there are many different page numbering 
options to choose from (Figure 8-25), and you must select them according to the page 
side (right or left), desired style, and state of the Different First Page and Different Odd & 
Even Pages options found in the Header & Footer Design tab:
Figure 8-24.  Use the Page Number control found in the Header & Footer areas of 
the Insert tab or the Header & Footer Design tab shown when the Header/Footer is 
activated
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

372
•	
For Normal documents printed just on one side of the page, insert a 
right aligned page number in the Header or Footer area.
•	
For documents that print on both page sides, check the Different Odd 
& Even Pages option and insert a left aligned page number in the 
Even Page Header (left page) and a right aligned page number in the 
Odd Page Header (right page).
•	
For documents that need a different first page style, check the 
Different first page option and:
•	
avoid numbering the first page for documents where the first 
page is counted, but not numbered.
•	
center align the page number in the Footer area using one of the 
center aligned options found in the Page Number ➤ Bottom of 
Page command.

Inserting Document Properties for Cover Page, Header, 
and Footer
Every Microsoft Office document has special properties associated to it, some read only 
(like date and time created and last modified, total editing time) and others read/write 
(like Title, Author, Description, Tags, etc.)
You can access any of the Microsoft Word document properties by selecting the File ➤ 
Info command, which will show the Info window, from which you can explore or change the 
read/write properties available (click to see if it can be edited), or click the Properties button 
and select Advanced Properties to show the <document name ➤ properties dialog box 
(Figure 8-26), where you can fill in the following types of information (and many others):
•	
Title: use to insert the document title.
•	
Subject: complement to the document title.
•	
Author: document author name (not the one who edited it).
•	
Tags: appears just in the Info window, use it to add document 
information like author name publication, year, etc.
•

Inserting Cover Pages
By selecting the Cover Page command found in the Pages area of the Insert tab of the 
Ribbon, you can select different page styles to compose the document’s first page, which 
will take advantage of the document Properties you entered to identify the document: 
Title, Tags, and Author.
Figure 8-28 shows the built-in Austen cover page style, which uses the document 
Title and Subject properties to compose the cover title, inserting the Author property at 
the bottom of white rectangle.

Inserting Header/Footer Information
The same is true for the Header and Footer commands found in the Header & Footer area 
of the Insert tab of the Ribbon (which can also be found in the area of the Header & Footer 
Design tab): they allow inserting professionally formatted header and footer information 
that takes advantage of the document Properties inserted by you, to easily create a nice-
looking document. Figure 8-29 shows the built-in Semaphore header style inserted in the 
second page of the “Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen eBook.docx” document.

Attention  The Built-in Cover Page designs are associated to the built-in Header 
and Footer designs: there is a Semaphore Cover page, Header, and Footer design 
that you must apply together to get the best formatting effect for your document.
Now it is your turn to try the Cover Page, Header, and Footer option to quickly create 
different document cover, header, and footer layouts for your documents! Try it!

Formatting Header/Footer Information
Whenever you have a new, empty Header or Footer area active, you have in fact a mini 
text processor where you can insert any text information needed to format your page 
headers.
Figure 8-30 shows a new empty Header, with its default empty paragraph (note the 
pilcrow ¶ character), which is formatted by default as left aligned with two tab stops: 
a Center tab stop positioned in the middle of the page and a right tab stop positioned 
on the right page margin. Although you can insert your own tab stops in any Header 
paragraph, these default tab stops are there to help you easily insert three different 
pieces of Header information aligned at left (press Tab), center (press Tab), and right 
margin.
Figure 8-30.  Default Header/Footer paragraph, formatted with a left alignment 
and two tab stops: a Center tab in the middle of the page and a Right tab on the 
right page margin
When you use the Page Number control to insert a Header/Footer left, center, or 
right aligned page number, Microsoft Word inserts a new paragraph at the Header/
Footer area, inserts a Page number field in it, and changes the paragraph Alignment to 
Left, Center, or Right according to your page number selection: it does not require any 
tab character to make use of these tab stops (Figure 8-31).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

380
Figure 8-31.  The Page Number control inserts a new paragraph in the Header/
Footer, inserts a Page number field, and aligns the paragraph according to the 
number alignment selected
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

381
This is important because if you want to compose the Header, you will do better 
using a Left aligned paragraph that can take advantage of using Tab stops to produce the 
desired effect.
Extract the “Formatted Header and Footer.docx” document from Chapter08.zip 
file, open it in Microsoft Word, double-click its Header area, and note how its Header 
paragraph was formatted to present the document title (“Microsoft Word Secrets”), 
chapter title (“Formatting Header Paragraphs”), and page number (Figure 8-32).
Figure 8-32.  This is the “Formatted Header and Footer.docx” file which you can 
extract from Chapter08.zip file, format its Header area using three tab stops  
(Right tab, Bar tab, and Right tab) and hidden Tab characters to perctly align them 
on the page
The Header paragraph was composed by using these steps:
	 1.	 The Header paragraph was Left aligned
	 2.	 The desired information was typed (document and chapter 
names), separated by a Tab character. Another Tab character was 
inserted to separate the Chapter name from the page number and 
formatted with Small caps.
	 3.	 The page number was inserted using the Page Number tool and 
selecting the Current Position ➤ Plain Number option.
	 4.	 The default Center tab stop was dragged away from the ruler.
	 5.	 A Right tab stop was inserted on the ruler and dragged to correctly 
position the Chapter name.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

382
	 6.	 The Bar tab stop was inserted and positioned on the ruler (the Right 
tab stop located at the Right paragraph margin was already there).
	 7.	 The Border tool found in the Home tab of the Ribbon was used to 
add a Bottom border to the Header paragraph.
While the Header & Footer Design tab is shown, check the Different Odd & Even 
Pages options and note that the Header will become Odd Page Header. Since the 
document has three pages created by two Manual Page Breaks, press the Next button in 
the Navigation area of the Header & Footer Design tab to navigate to the second page 
and show the Even Page Header: note how its paragraph was formatted to convey the 
same Odd Page Header information, which is now mirrored (Figure 8-33).
Figure 8-33.  The “Formatted Header and Footer.docx” document Even Page 
Header is also Left aligned, and it has Bar, Left, and Right tab stops to perfectly 
mirror the Header (now Odd Page Header) formatting and text presentation
Now the Even Page Header is a mirrored view of the Odd Page Header. It is still Left 
aligned with the page number filed inserted as its first character. It then has a Tab stop, 
the Chapter title, and the Book title, separated by a tab stop. Now a Bar tab and a Left tab 
stop were inserted on the ruler to correctly position the Even Page Header information 
(the Right tab located in the right paragraph margin was already there).
Click the Previous button in the Navigation area of the Header & Footer design tab to 
return to the first document page and check the Different First Page options. Note that 
the Odd Page Header changed to First Page Header. Click the Go to Footer control in 
the Navigation area of the Design tab and look how the First Page Footer was formatted 
(Figure 8-34).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

383
The First Page Footer was created by following these steps:
	 1.	 The Footer paragraph was center aligned.
	 2.	 The page number was inserted using the Page Number tool and 
selecting the Current Position ➤ Plain Number option.
	 3.	 The Border tool found in the Home tab of the Ribbon was used to 
add a Bottom border to the Header paragraph.
	 4.	 The paragraph Left and Right indents on the ruler were dragged 
to the center of the page to create the small border above the page 
number.
Attention  It is interesting to note that once a Header, Even Page Header, and First 
Page Header are formatted in the document, they will remain there, ready to be 
used; you can also hide them by unchecking the Different First Page and Different 
Odd & Even Pages options.
Figure 8-34.  The “Formatted Header and Footer.docx” document First Page 
Footer is center aligned with a top margin, and it had its Left and Drag indent 
dragged to the center of the ruler to create this simple effect

384
Using Calculated Fields
The Header, Footer, and Page Number tools found in the Header & Footer area of the 
Layout tab (or in the Header & Footer Design tab) have options that insert fields in the 
Header or Footer page area.
The most common of these fields is the Page number and the Page count, which can 
create page numbering using the Page x of y style, where x is the page number and y is 
the page count.
Figure 8-35 shows the Bold Number 1 option (found in Page Number ➤ Top of 
Page tool) inserted in the Header area and selected with the mouse, so you can see that 
both the page number and the page count are Microsoft Word calculated fields (press 
Alt+F9 to show the field codes instead of their values and note that the page number is 
represented by the Page field, and the page count by the NumPages field).
Figure 8-35.  The Page Number insert the page number and page count on the 
Header or Footer areas using calculated fields (Page and NumPages, respectively). 
Press Alt+F9 to alternate between the field value and field code
Microsoft Word has many different field codes that can insert useful system (date, 
time, folder) and document (page, page count, words count, document name, author, 
etc.) information. You can show all available fields by selecting the Quick Parts tool 
Field… option (found in both the Header & Footer Design tab and the Insert Tab of the 
Ribbon), which will show the Field dialog box, from where you can select a field category 
and a field value to be inserted anywhere in the document text.
Figure 8-36 shows the Field dialog box with the NumPages field selected in the Field 
names list (which is part of the Document Information category), and the many format 
and numeric formats it offers.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

385
Use these fields to compose better Header and Footer numbering systems. For 
example, the Page Number tool has the Accent Bar 1 (left aligned) and Accent Bar 2 
(right aligned) numbering option which respectively insert the n | Page or Page | n 
(where n is the page number) nicely formatted styles of page numbering (the Page word 
received a Calibri font with character spacing Expanded = 3 pt, using the Advanced tab 
of the Font dialog box). By using the NumPages field found in the Field dialog box, you 
can change them to n of m | Page or Page | n of m, where m represents the NumPages 
field (Figure 8-37).
Figure 8-36.  Use the QuickPart tool Field… option (found in the Text area of 
the Insert tab of the Ribbon) to show the Field dialog box, from where you can 
select many different types of system and document information to insert into the 
document as a calculated field
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

386
Attention  This kind of page numbering, which offers both the page number and 
the page count, is good for documents that will be printed and need to give to the 
reader the idea that no page was lost.
Attention  The “Header & Footer with Accent Bar and NumPages field.docx” 
document found in Chapter08.zip has such page numbering formatting inserted in 
the First, Even, and Odd page Header and Footer areas.
Saving New Page Number Formats
Once you have created a new page number format, you can save it so it can be reused 
later in new documents. To save changes made to the AccentBar 1 page number style 
shown in Figure 8-33, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Select the entire Header/Footer row that has the number format 
you want to save.
Figure 8-37.  Use the Field dialog box to insert different types of system/document 
ionformation into the Header and Footer areas of your documents. This figure 
shows how the Numpages field was inserted in the Even Page Header to format the 
Accent Bar 1 Page Number ➤ Top of Page numbering option.

387
	 2.	 Use Save Selection as Page Number… option found in the Page 
Number tool Top of Page, Bottom of Page, or Current Position options 
to show the Create New Building Block dialog box (Figure 8-38):
•	
Name: use it to give a consistent name to the page number format.
•	
Gallery: define the Page Number command where the page number 
format must appear (Top of Page, Bottom of Page, Current Position).
•	
Category: choose the category that best fits to the page number 
style that’s been saved.
Figure 8-38.  The Create New Building Block
•	
Description: use it to give a brief description of the page number 
style that’s been created.
•	
Save in: use Building Blocks.dotx (en-US) to save it so that it’s 
available in all Microsoft Word documents. Use Normal.dotx to 
have it available to all documents based on this template only.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

388
•	
Options: define how the building block will be inserted in a 
document. This option will have no effect in page number 
formats inserted on Header/Footer areas:
	
a.	 Insert content on its own page: place the building block on a 
separate page with page breaks before and after the building block.
	
b.	 Insert in own paragraph: place the building block into its 
own paragraph.
	
c.	 Insert content only: place the building block as a word 
sequence inside a sentence.
Figure 8-39 shows the Create New Building Block fulfilled to create a variation of 
the Accent Bar 1 page number format. Note that since it adds the NumPages field, it 
was saved as Accent Bar 1.1 in the Building Blocks.dotx (en-US) template, so it can be 
available in any Microsoft Word document produced from my computer.
Figure 8-39.  When creating new page number formats based on existing page 
numbers, use a name variation so it can appear next to the same page number in 
the Page Number tool options.

389
Attention  To remove any page number format inserted, right-click it in the Page 
Number tool gallery and choose the Organize and Delete… option to show the 
Building Blocks Organizer dialog box, from where you can change, edit, or delete 
any available building block.
Formatting PDF Files
PDF—Portable Document Format—is an industry standard created by Adobe to 
generate electronic read-only documents that can be opened by Adobe Reader, Fox 
Reader, Nitro PDF Reader, PDF-Xchange Editor, and many other free software packages 
available on the Internet.
Although you print a PDF file from any Microsoft Windows program by installing and 
using a PDF Printer program (like CutePDF, DoPDF, PDFCreator, etc.), Microsoft Word 
can easily create PDF documents using its File ➤ Export command (which also allows 
you to create an XDF file).
Attention  XDF is the XML version of a PDF file, which was once supposed to 
become the most used electronic, read-only file type—a forecast that has been 
confirmed so far.
In general, you must follow these formatting rules to create good-quality PDF files 
from Microsoft Word documents:
	 1.	 Use a popular page format (like Letter or A4).
	 2.	 Use Heading styles (Heading1 to Heading9) to format chapter and 
section titles.
	 3.	 Add Header and Footer information for the first page, odd and 
even pages to
•	
Identify the document title on each page.
•	
Add page number and page count to each page.
By using Heading styles, you can use Microsoft Word File ➤ Export command and 
click the Create PDF/XPS button to show the Publish as PDF or XPS dialog box and 
define the PDF options desired (Figure 8-40).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

Figure 8-40.  Use Microsoft Word File ➤ Export ➤ Create PDF/XPS Document 
to show the Publish as PDF or XPX dialog box. Click Options and select 
Create bookmarks using Headings option to create the PDF Table of Contents 
(Bookmarks).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

391
The Create PDF/XPS Option dialog box offers these options:
•	
Standard (publishing online and printing): document receives the 
best quality output.
•	
Minimum size (publish online): document receives minimum 
image quality settings.
•	
Options: use this button to show the PDF Options dialog box, from 
where you can use
•	
Page Range area: decide which pages must be exported to the 
PDF file.
•	
Publish what: only document text or text and markups (if any).
•	
Include nonprinting information:
	
a.	 Create bookmarks using: select Headings to use Heading 
styles to create the PDF Table of Contents.
	
b.	 Document Properties: save all document properties in PDF, 
like author name, date created, etc.;
	
c.	 Document structure tags for accessibility: tags are for 
accessibility; they indicate the structure of a document so it 
can be read for persons with disabilities. They communicate 
the reading order and determine exactly which items will be 
read.
•	
PDF Options:
	
a.	 PDF/A Compliant: PDF/A is a new electronic document 
standard that guarantee that the final PDF will preserves its 
visual appearance over time independent of the tools that will 
be used in the future to open it.
	
b.	 Bitmap text when fonts may not be embedded: convert 
text to bitmap when it is not possible to insert the font 
information in the document.
	
c.	 Encrypt document with a password: protect the document 
with a password, which will be needed to open and read it.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

392
Attention  Whenever your document has Heading styles applied to its chapter 
and section titles, define the Create bookmarks = Headings. This will make the 
PDF reader software exhibit the Bookmarks pane, from where you can navigate 
through the PDF document just like you do using Microsoft Windows Navigation 
Pane Headings view.
Exercise 2
The objective of this exercise is to produce a nicely formatted PDF file using the “The 
Last of the Mohicans.docx” document, which you can extract from the Chapter08.zip 
file; this contains the entire text of the famous James Fenimore Cooper book published 
in 1826.
Note this document’s formatting options:
•	
Letter paper size with 1” margins all around.
•	
Formatted with the Black and White (Capitalized) Style set.
•	
The first two paragraphs received the Title and Subtitle styles  
(for book title and author name, respectively).
•	
Heading1 style formatted with Paragraph ➤ Page break before option 
checked.
•	
Table of Contents object inserted in its first page because the 
CONTENT paragraph (formatted with TOC Heading style, which is 
based on Heading1 style) has its Page break before option unchecked 
(Figure 8-41).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

393
The final PDF must have Header/Footer information and Bookmarks to allow easy 
navigation and better page format whenever necessary.
Attention  The Page Cover, Header, and Footer text and designs proposed in this 
exercise were chosen solely for educational reasons.
Open “The Last of the Mohicans.docx” document in Microsoft Word and follow 
these steps:
	 1.	 Use the File ➤ Info ➤ Properties ➤ Advanced Properties to show 
the document Properties dialog box and note how some of its key 
properties were defined (Title, Subject, Author, Tags, Figure 8-42).
Figure 8-41.  This is “The Last of the Mohicans.docx” document, which you can 
extract from the Chapter08.zip file with the full book text spread over 256 Letter-­
size pages (using 1” margins all around and formatted with the Black and White 
(Capitalized) Style set, with Heading1 style formatted with the Paragraph ➤ Page 
break before option set)

Attention  Delete the fields inserted by the Filigree cover page at the bottom of 
the page (Date Company name and Company address) and insert the author name 
(James Fenimore Cooper) in their place.
	 3.	 Double-click page 2 Header area to activate it, and check the 
Different first page (must be checked) and Different Odd & Even 
pages options.
Attention  Whenever you insert a Cover Page, Microsoft Word will automatically 
set the Different first page options and use some unexpected mechanism to 
number this cover page as page 0 (zero). That is why the next page has an Odd 
Page Header (page number 1). It seems to be a bug…

Formatting Booklets
The term Booklet is usually attributed to a small book made up of to 40 pages, where 
each sheet of paper is printed on front and back, receiving two pages on each paper side 
(constituting what is called a four-page signature), usually having an outer cover page 
made up of paperboard (or any other paper of bigger grammage).
Figure 8-48.  This is Acrobat Reader DC 2017 screen showing “The Last of 
Mohicans for PDF.PDF” file, which has Bookmarks created by using Heading1 
styles in the original Microsoft Word file.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

401
To compose a booklet, we can print these four-page sheet signatures and
•	
individually fold them in the middle, composing a notebook of 
one sheet of paper; the booklets are then stacked in the right order, 
receiving staples or spirals to bind the booklets, or;
•	
stack each four-page signature in the right order, and fold the stacked 
sheets in the middle to compose a single notebook that is then 
stapled together in the middle to bind the booklet.
Attention  A variation of this process is to create notebooks of up to ten stacked 
four-page signatures folded in the middle, which are stacked with other similar 
notebooks that will be spiral bound to compose the final booklet.
Microsoft Word creates booklets by printing sheet signatures of four document 
pages, choosing which document pages will be printed on each sheet signature side 
according to the Sheets per page option that appears whenever you set Multiple Pages 
options to Book Fold (found in the Page Setup dialog box, Margins tab, Figure 8-49).
Figure 8-49.  Whenever you select Multple pages = Book fold in the Margins tab of 
the Page Setup dialog box, Microsoft Word will show the Sheets per booklet option to 
allow selection of how each sheet signature of four document pages will be created
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

402
The Sheets per booklet options are as follows:
•	
All: default value, includes all document pages to compose the sheet 
signatures, which need to be stacked and folded in the middle to 
compose the final booklet.
•	
Auto: includes up to 40 successive document pages to compose 
notebooks of up to ten sheet signatures (of four pages each), which 
need to be stacked and folded in the middle. The notebooks will be 
then stacked together to compose the final booklet.
•	
4: use four successive document pages to compose sheet signatures 
that create notebooks of single sheets of paper. The single-page 
notebooks are then stacked together to compose the final booklet.
•	
8: uses eight successive document pages to compose sheet 
signatures, which create notebooks of two successive sheets of paper 
that need to be stacked together and folded in their middle. The 
two-page notebooks are then stacked together to compose the final 
booklet.
•	
12 to 40: indicates the number of successive sheet signatures that will 
create notebooks of a multiple of four sheets of paper that need to be 
stacked together and folded in their middle (12 = 3 sheet signatures, 
16 = 4 sheet signatures, 40 = 10 sheet signatures).
Figure 8-50 shows how this process works using an eight-page document as example 
and the Sheets per booklet = 4 successive pages.
Figure 8-50.  How the Sheets per booklet = 4 option influences the printing process 
of an 8-page document using booklet signatures of 4 pages
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

403
As you can see, when Sheets per booklet = 4 pages, each sheet of paper will receive 
four successive document pages. At the left side of the figure you can see that on the 
first printed sheet signature of four pages (front page), the internal side of the page will 
receive pages 2 and 3, while the outer side (back of page) will receive pages 1 and 4. The 
second printed sheet signature will receive pages 5 and 6 (front) and 7 and 8 (back). 
Since each sheet signature is composed by four successive pages, each one must be 
folded in the middle to compose a single notebook of four successive document pages, 
which will then be stacked to bring the right document page sequence to the final eight-­
page booklet.
Figure 8-51 shows how this process works for the same eight-page document with 
Sheets per booklet = 8 successive pages.
This time things are completely different. When Sheets per booklet = 8 pages, each 
sheet signature will no longer receive four successive document pages. Since it will 
use 8/4 = 2 sheet signatures to create each notebook, each sheet signature will receive 
the page numbers that will give the right page sequence when two successive page 
signatures are stacked and folded.
At the left side of the figure you can see that on the first printed sheet signature of 
four pages (front page), the internal side of the page will receive pages 4 and 5, while the 
outer side (back of page) will receive pages 3 and 6. The second printed sheet signature 
will receive pages 2 and 7 (front) and 1 and 8 (back). Since these two page signatures 
must be stacked and folded together to create a two-page notebook made up of eight 
successive pages, that will bring the right document page sequence to the eight pages of 
the final booklet.
Figure 8-51.  How the Sheets per booklet = 8 option influences the printing process 
of an 8-page document using booklets of 4-page signatures
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

404
Attention  Microsoft Word uses the Sheets per Booklet = Auto = 40 pages as a 
maximum value, because 40/4 = 10 sheet signatures is the maximum number of 
pages that can be stacked and folded together without creating too much bulk.
If you have long text documents like Sense and Sensibility or The Last of the 
Mohicans, which have more than 150 pages (according to page size, margins, and 
formatting options used), and want to print them and bind them into booklets, you must 
set Sheets per booklet = Auto or 40, to not end up with many sheets of paper to stack 
and fold, which will not work for staples or even for the final document paper fold itself, 
unless if you plan to cut the sheet of papers in the middle using a professional paper 
cutter, and spiral bind them together.
Whenever you select Multiple pages = Book fold to produce a booklet, Microsoft 
Word will
•	
Change the document’s page Orientation to Landscape.
•	
Change page width to half the original height of the paper size 
selected (if the original page size was Letter, 8.5 × 11, the document 
page will receive a width = 5.5).
•	
Double the number of document pages.
•	
Print the document as expected, but not show how the pages will be 
printed, either in document view or in the File ➤ Print window.
So, follow these rules whenever you want to produce an appropriate booklet 
printing:
•	
Use a font size between 10 pt and 12 pt for the body text.
•	
Use a font size not bigger than 16 pt for chapter and section titles.
•	
Change page margins to half the original size.
•	
Set the Different Odd and Even options in the Headers and footers 
area of the Layout tab of the Page Setup dialog box.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

405
•	
Set Sheets per booklet = All, if you plan to cut the sheet signatures in 
half, using a professional paper cutter.
•	
Set Sheets per booklet = Auto, if you plan to spiral bind the final 
booklet, to create notebooks of up to 10 successive sheet signatures 
(of four pages each).
•	
Print the book using a PDF printer (like CutePDF) so you can store 
and see the final result before printing the book (the File ➤ Export to 
PDF/XPS option will not work this time).
•	
Use a double-side printer for better results. If you don’t have such a 
printer, print all the odd pages first, invert the printed stack of sheets, 
put them on the printer tray again (with printed side up), and print 
all the even pages.
Exercise 3
The objective of this exercise is to show you how to produce a booklet using Microsoft 
Word and a PDF Printer software to store and show the final result, so it can be easily 
reprinted in the future. It uses the “European Convention of Human Rights.docx” 
document, which you can extract from the Chapter08.zip file.
Formatting Tips
Open the “European Convention of Human Rights.docx” document in Microsoft Word 
and note that the document has 13 pages, receiving Title, Subtitle, Heading1, and 
Heading2 styles formatted with the Simple style set (selected from the Design tab Style 
Set gallery). Heading1 style was changed by checking the Paragraph ➤ Page break before 
option, and Heading2 style was changed by checking the Paragraph ➤ Keep with next 
option (Figure 8-52).
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

406
Double-click the ruler to show the Page Setup dialog box, and note in the Page tab 
that it is formatted with a Letter size page (8.5 × 11), and in the Margin tab that it has 
Top, Bottom, and Outside margins = 0.5 and Inside margin = 1, with Multiple Pages = 
Mirror Margins (the inside margin is bigger than outside). In Layout tab note that it has 
Different odd and even and Different first page options checked, which gives it different 
first page, odd, and even page headers (Figure 8-53).
Figure 8-52.  The “European Convention of Human Rights.docx” received styles 
Title, Subtitle, Heading1, Heading2 (see the Navigation pane), and Normal. It was 
formatted with the Simple style set selected in the Design tab’s Style Set gallery.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

407
Close the Page Setup dialog box, press Page Down key to move to page 2, and note 
that it has a Table of Contents. Look to page 2 and 3 headers and note they received the 
modified Accent Bar 1 and 2 header styles (by adding the NumPages field), and that 
there is just one Right tab stop positioned at the inside margin of the Even Page Header 
and likewise at the outside margin of the Odd Page Header (right margin of both page 
types).
With the Show/Hide button selected in the Home tab of the Ribbon, note that both 
the Odd and Even Page Header text received just one Tab character to correctly align its 
text (Figure 8-54).
Figure 8-53.  Double-click the ruler to show the Page Setup dialog box and note 
that the “European Convention of Human Rights.docx” document uses a Letter 
page, with 0.5” Top, Bottom, and Outside margins, and 1” inside margin, with 
Different odd and even and Different first page header options checked

Formatting the Document to Booklet
To convert this document to a booklet and print a PDF of it, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Double-click the ruler to show the Page Setup dialog box, select 
the Margins tab, and set these options:
•	
Multiple Pages = Book Fold.
•	
Sheets per booklet = All
	 2.	 Note that page Orientation changes to Landscape and becomes 
disabled, and page margins Top and Inside exchange their values 
(Top = 1“ and Inside = 0.5”, Figure 8-­55).
Figure 8-54.  The Even and Odd Page Headers for the “European Convention of 
Human Rights.docx” document has just one Right tab stop positioned at the inside 
even page margin and outside odd page margin (right margin of both page types)
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

409
	 3.	 Close the Page Setup dialog box, look at the ruler scale, and note 
that although the document paper size is still Letter (8.5 × 11), the 
document page width is now half of the height of a Letter size page 
(5.5”), and its height is the page size width (8.5”). The document 
text reflux has increased its page count to 23 pages (Figure 8-56).
Figure 8-55.  When Multiple pages is changed to Book Fold, page Orientation 
changes to Landscape and Top and Inside margins exchange their values. Paper 
side remains Letter.
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

410
	 4.	 Select File ➤ Print and note that Microsoft Word does not 
show the final appearance of the booklet’s four-page signature 
(although it will print correctly if you try, Figure 8-57).
	 5.	 To see how each page (front or back) will be printed, you 
must select a PDF printer from the Printer list. If you don’t 
have a PDF printer installed, you can select the Microsoft XPS 
document writer, which will print a XPS document (XML Paper 
Specification).
	 6.	 The PDF or XPS printer selected will ask for a folder and file name 
to save the final file (CutePDF writer will offer to save it with the 
same file name using the PDF extension).
Figure 8-56.  When the Page Setup ➤ Margins ➤ Multiple pages command is 
changed to Book Fold, the document page remains the same, but it changes its 
orientation to Landscape with each document page changing its width to half the 
page height and its height to the page width
Chapter 8  Page Formatting

411
Since Figure 8-55 used Sheets per booklet = All, all pages were used to generate 
the final print, and that is why the first XPS page (front) has a white page at left and 
document page 1, while second XPS page has document pages 2 and 23 side by side.
To create the final booklet, you just need to print all 12 pages of the XPS or PDF 
document using a front and back printer, fold the final print in the middle, and add its 
staples to the fold (don’t forget the paperboard cover!).
	 7.	 Open Windows Explorer (press Window key+E), navigate to the 
folder where the XPS or PDF file was saved, and double-click it to 
show how its booklet pages were generated.
Figure 8-57 shows the XPS Viewer window with the “European Convention of 
Human Rights.xps” document opened, showing its first two pages, which must be 
printed on a single sheet of paper, using front and back printing (duplex printing).
Figure 8-57.  This is the “European Convention of Human Rights.xps” document 
opened in Microsoft Windows XPS Viewer, showing the first two XPS pages, which 
must be printed on a single sheet of paper, using front and back. Page 1 (front) has 
an empty page (booklet’s last page) and document page 1. Page 2 has document 
pages 2 and 23, side by side.

Attention  The Chapter08.zip file has both the “European Convention of Human 
Rights Booklet.docx” Microsoft Word document and the “European Convention of 
Human Rights.xps” XPS booklet printing, which you can extract to see how they 
were created.
Conclusion
In this chapter, we discussed page formatting: size, orientation, margins, and header and 
footer areas.
You learned how to access these areas using a double-click, and how to format them 
using the ruler controls or the page setup dialog box.
Microsoft Word offers the Header & Footer Tools Design tab full of important tools 
that allow creation of a different first header page, and different odd and even pages for 
documents that can be printed on both sides of paper.
We also talked about how to create well-formatted e-books, how to export good PDF 
documents (using the Table of Contents to generate the PDF BookMarks), and how to 
create booklets by setting the Multiple pages option to Book Fold, and the differences 
that may arise by selecting the Sheets per booklet options.

CHAPTER 9
Section Breaks
Although Microsoft Word doesn’t have a “page style” resource, which is commonly 
found in other popular text processors (like BROffice, LibreOffice, or professional 
desktop publishing tools like Quark XPress and Adobe InDesign), it can produce 
different page styles in a single document by dividing the document into sections.
In this chapter, you will learn how to use the different types of Section Breaks to 
control page formatting and have greater control over the document text flow, including 
the use of columns, numbering, page size, orientation, and vertical alignment. All the 
documents cited in this chapter can be found by downloading the Chapter09.zip file 
from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
What Is a Section Break?
Section Break is the traditional way that Microsoft Word uses to allow changes to the text 
flow and alignment inside a single page or to use different page formatting options in a 
single document, including page numbering.
There are two main types of section breaks:
•	
Continuous: used to change the text flux inside a page, allowing the 
creation of columnated text.
•	
Page break: used to insert a new page, allowing page numbering 
control inside the document.
Every Microsoft Word document has at least one section called “Section 1”. 
Earlier versions showed this information by default on the Status bar, but this gave 
more confusion than explanation, and since the advent of Microsoft Office 2007, this 
information is no longer available by default: but it is still there!

416
To show section number information, right-click Microsoft Word status bar to show 
the Customize Status Bar menu and click Section at the top of the list to see that the word 
“Section 1” appears at the left of the page number (Figure 9-1).
Figure 9-1.  Right-click Microsoft Word Status bar to show the Curstomize Status 
Bar pop-up menu and click Section to see section number information for any 
document
Inserting Section Breaks
You can insert a Section Break, or in other words, create another section in any Microsoft 
Word document, by using the Section Breaks area of the Breaks tool found in the Page 
Setup area of the Layout tab of the Ribbon (which can also be used to insert Page Breaks, 
Figure 9-2).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

417
Types of Section Breaks
You can select among these types of Section Breaks to insert into a document:
•	
Continue: type of section break used to produce text columns on the 
document page.
•	
Next page: type of section break that is also a page break, in the sense 
that the next page begins on a new document section.
•	
Even page: type of section break that is also a page break, but makes 
the next page receive the next even number available.
•	
Odd page: type of section break that is also a page break, but makes 
the next page receive the next odd number available.
For those who are wondering why there are so many different types of section breaks, 
you may note that some Section Breaks are also page breaks (the ones that have the word 
“page” on it), and these will work this way:
Figure 9-2.  Use the Breaks tool found in the Layout tab of the Ribbon to select 
different types of section break to be inserted in the current position of the 
document and create another section
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

418
•	
Continue: doesn’t break the document into another page.
•	
Next Page: will insert a new page using consecutive numbering.
•	
Even Page and Odd Page: will insert a new page that will receive the 
next even or odd numbering.
The “Different Section Breaks.docx” document, which you can extract from 
Chapter09.zip, has all four types of section breaks: Continue, Next Page, Even page, and 
Odd page. Figure 9-3 shows the first document page (Page 1) with the Show/Hide tool 
checked, so you can see that this page has Continuous and Next Page section breaks, one 
after another, with some paragraphs inserted in between them.
Attention  Although the Section Break appears as a double line with a title 
showing the section break type, I use the term “Section Break Character” because 
you can select the section break in the text as you do to select any single text 
character: press Shift+Right arrow or drag the mouse over it.
Figure 9-3.  The “Different Section Breaks.docx” document has all possible section 
break types. Page 1 has a Continuous and a Next page section break. They are 
visible because the Show/Hide tool is checked in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

419
Note that the document first page shown on Figure 9-3 has the text cursor positioned 
in a Section 2 paragraph (continuous section) and that it has seven logical pages (Status 
bar indicates Page 1 of 7). Do the following exercise using the “Different Section Breaks.
docx” document:
•	
Press Ctrl+Page Down on page 1 to go to page 2 (even page); note that 
the Status bar considering it as Section 3, Page 2 of 7, and that it has a 
Section Break (Even Page) (Figure 9-4).
•	
Press Ctrl+Page Down in Section 3, Page 2 of 7 to go to the next page 
and note that the Status bar considered it as Section 4, Page 4 of 7 
(even page). There is no page 3 due to the Section Break (Even Page) 
inserted in physical page 2, and it has another Section Break (Next 
Page) inserted (Figure 9-5).
Figure 9-4.  The second page of “Different Section Breaks.docx” document, 
numbered as Page 2 of 7, has an Even Page section, being part of Section 3
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

420
Figure 9-5.  Section 4, Page 4 of 7 of “Different Section Breaks.docx” document is the 
3rd physical document page due to the Section Break (Even Page) inserted in Section 3, 
Page 3 (there is no Page 3 of 7). It also has a Section Break (Next Page) inserted
Figure 9-6.  Section 5, Page 5 of 7 of “Different Section Breaks.docx” document is 
the 4th physical document page and has a Section Break (Odd Page) inserted
•	
Press Ctrl+Page Down in Section 4, Page 4 of 7 (physical page 3) to go 
to next page and note that the Status bar considered it as Section 5, 
Page 5 of 7, which also has a Section Break (Odd Page) (Figure 9-6).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

421
•	
Press Page Down in Section 4, Page 5 of 7 to go to the last document 
page and note that the Status bar considered it as Section 6, Page 7 of 
7 (physical page 4). There is no page 5, due to the Section Break  
(Odd Page) inserted in logical Page 5 of 7 (Figure 9-7).
You may note that I am using the term physical page, because different page breaks can 
lead to a disagreement between the real page sheet printed and its logical page number.
Whenever any Microsoft Word document logical even page number receives an Even 
Page section break, the next page will miss the next sequential odd number, receiving 
instead the next logical even number. The same is true for when any logical odd number 
page receives an Odd Page section break; the next page will be the next odd number, and 
the even page number in between them will not exist in the document.
Changing Section Break Type
You can change the section break type by two ways:
•	
Deleting the hidden Section Break character and inserting another 
Section Break of the desired type; or
•	
Using the Page Setup dialog box to change the Section Break type.
Figure 9-7.  Section 6, Page 7 of 7 of “Different Section Breaks.docx” document is 
the 5th physical document page due to the Section Break (Odd Page) inserted in 
Section 5, Page 5 of 7, and has a Section Break (Next Page) inserted
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

422
Both methods will work, but the first one (delete and insert another Section Break) 
may lead to losing some section information (like section Header/Footer text), which 
is not recommended. So, use the Page Setup dialog box to change the section type 
following these steps:
	 1.	 Click the document Section where you want to change the Section 
Break type (look to Microsoft Word Status bar to recognize the 
section number).
	 2.	 Double-click the Ruler to show the Page Setup dialog box.
	 3.	 In the Section area of the Layout tab use the Section star control 
to select the type of section (it will show the current type of break 
used by this section).
	 4.	 Look to the Apply to option located at the bottom of the Page 
Setup dialog box and confirm that it is set to “This section”.
	 5.	 Press OK to close the Page Setup dialog box and change the 
section type.
Figure 9-8 shows how you can change the 6th page of the “Different Section Break.
docx” document from Odd Page to New Page, effectively inserting a Page 6 of 6 in 
the document (which does not exist due to the Section Break (Odd Page) inserted on 
Page 5).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

423
Attention  To apply the same breaks to the entire document, press Ctrl+A to 
select the document text and use Section start option located in the Apply tab of 
the Page Setup dialog box to define the default Section Break type. The Apply to 
combo box must show “Selected Sections” to indicate that all selected sections 
will be affected by this change.
Figure 9-8.  Whenever you need to change any Section break type, use the Page 
Setup dialog box instead of delete and reinsert a new Section Break
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

424
Changing Page Size/Orientation
Section breaks are used to change the page size and orientation of select pages inside 
any document by just following these steps:
	 1.	 Locate the page that you want to change the page size or 
orientation.
	 2.	 Make sure it has a Section Page Break before it (and unless it is the 
last document page, make sure it also has a Section Page Break 
after it).
	 3.	 Double-click the Ruler to show the Page Setup dialog box.
	 4.	 Use the Page Setup dialog box Margins tab to change page 
orientation (usually from Portrait to Landscape).
	 5.	 If necessary, use the Paper tab to select the page size.
	 6.	 Look to the Apply to option located at the bottom of the Page 
Setup dialog box and confirm that it is set to “This section”.
	 7.	 Press OK to close the Page Setup dialog box and apply the change.
Figure 9-9 shows the “Different Section Breaks, Different Page.docx” document, 
which you can extract from Chapter09.zip file, with a 20% zoom and Many Pages 
view option selected. Note that just its third page (Page 4, Section 4, Page 4) has the 
Landscape orientation (double-click the Ruler to show the Page Setup dialog box and 
note that just this page has this orientation).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

425
Attention  Double-click the zoom tool at the right of Microsoft Word status bar to 
show the Zoom dialog box, from where you can select the Many pages option.
Whenever you need to use a page of different size in any document, be careful to 
select the printer tray from where this page size must be drawn. Note that this kind 
of selection may lead to printing problems with printers that do not have multiple 
trays from which they can draw pages.
Changing Page Vertical Alignment
Section Breaks are also fine to change page vertical alignment, which is a document 
resource seldom used on purpose but commonly activated unintentionally, leading to 
odd behaviors in the document.
Figure 9-9.  This is the “Different Section Breaks, Different Page.docx” document, 
which has a single page of different orientation
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

426
You can change the page vertical alignment using the Vertical alignment option 
found in the Page area of the Layout tab of the Page Setup dialog box, and it is a great 
resource to vertically center align any cover page text, which must convey the document 
title and author name. Of course, this page must be in its own section, otherwise the 
entire document will receive such vertical alignment.
Extract the “Different First Page, Vertical Alignment.docx” document from 
Chapter09.zip, open it in Microsoft Word, and note that its first page (which has just 
three paragraphs) is perfectly center aligned between the top and bottom page margins 
(Figure 9-10).
Figure 9-10.  This is the “Different First Page vertical alignment.docx” document 
you can extract from Chapter09.zip. Its first page has just three paragraphs center 
aligned between the top and botton page margins, using the Vertical Alignemnt 
command found in the Layout tab of the Page Setup dialog box.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

427
Section Inheritance
You already know that the Section Break is a hidden Microsoft Word character that is not 
part of the paragraph: it is positioned in between two paragraph breaks, can be viewed 
whenever you check the Show/Hide tool in the Paragraph area of the Home tab of the 
Ribbon, and can produce a numbering change in the document pages according to the 
type of section break inserted.
So you must be aware that whenever you insert a section break into a document:
	 1.	 A new section is created below the current section, receiving 
consecutive numbering (Section 2, Section 3, etc.).
	 2.	 All page formatting options (including Header/Footer formatting 
and text) are inherited by the new section from the previous 
section.
	 3.	 The hidden Section Break character holds all the formatting 
options used to format the section below it, until it finds another 
section break or the end of the document.
Let’s see a practical example of how this happens. Extract “Section Inheritance.docx” 
document from Chapter09.zip file and open it in Microsoft Word. Note that it has just 
a single page, with the Header text “Section 1 FIRST PAGE HEADER”. Double-click the 
Header area and note in the Header & Footer Tools Design tab that both the Different 
First Page and Different Odd & Even Pages options are checked, meaning that this 
document has three different types of headers (first, even, and odd page, Figure 9-11).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

428
Double-click the text area and press Ctrl+Enter twice, to insert two new empty 
pages in the document (one even [page 2] and one odd [page 3]). Use Ctrl+Page Up and 
Ctrl+Page Down to show the beginning of each document page and see that both the 
odd and even pages already have Header text inserted (Figure 9-12).
Figure 9-11.  The “Section Inheritance.docx” document, which you can extract 
from Chapter09.zip file, has just one page and the text “Section 1 FIRST PAGE 
HEADER” inserted in its First Page Header. It has the Different First Page and 
Different Odd & Even Pages options checked.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

429
Although “Section Inheritance.docx” has no “Section 1” section break hidden 
character, it still stores the information regarding the text for its headers area somewhere 
inside the document, as you may realize by inserting two new pages in the document to 
reveal the Even and Odd Page Header texts.
Supposing that you are on the third empty document page, press Enter to insert a 
new paragraph and use the Layout ➤ Breaks ➤ Next Page command to insert a section 
break hidden character that will break the document into a new section (Section 2), 
inserting its fourth document page. Double-click Section 2, Page 4 Header area and note 
that it is named First Page Header - Section 2 (Figure 9-13).
Figure 9-12.  Press Ctrl+Enter twice in the “Section Inseritance.docx” document to 
insert two new pages (even and odd) and note that its Section 1 already stores its 
Even and Odd Page Header text
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

430
As you can see, Section 2, Page 4 begins another document section that inherits all 
Section 1 formatting options: since Section 1 has the Different First Page option checked, 
Section 2 will also have it, inheriting not only the section formatting but also the default 
“Section 1, FIRST PAGE HEADER” text!
Once more, while the cursor is at Section 2, Page 4 first paragraph, press Ctrl+Enter 
twice again in Section 2, Page 4 to insert two new empty document pages (odd page 5 
and even page 6), and note that they both inherited the Section 1 Odd Page Header and 
Even Page Header texts (Figure 9-14).
Figure 9-13.  Whenever you insert a new Section Break (even a Continuos one), 
the next section will inherit all previous section formatting options. Since Section 
1 has the Different First Page option checked, Section 2 will also has a First Page 
Header, inheriting Section 1 First Page Header text.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

431
And this behavior will continue, on and on, as new section breaks are inserted in the 
document.
Attention  Even if the Different First Page option is checked, the Continuous 
section break creates a new document section that does not generate a new First 
Page Header, but creates Odd and Even Page Headers if the Different Odd & Even 
Pages option is checked.
Figure 9-14.  By inserting two new empty pages in Section 2 (pages 5 and 6), since 
Section 1 has the Different Odd & Even Pages option checked, they will also inherit 
Section 1 Odd and Even Page Header texts
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

432
Linked Header/Footer Sections
Carefully look at the bottom of Figure 9-13, showing Page 4, First Page Header - Section 2, 
 and at Figure 9-14, showing Pages 5 and 6 Odd Page Header - Section 2 and Even Page 
Header - Section 2 page header areas. Note that at the right margin of each Section 
2 header (pages 4, 5, and 6) there is a “Same as Previous” indicator, which is a 
confirmation of section inheritance in the sense that the current section has the same 
header/footer of the previous section.
This section inheritance behavior is quite desirable for most documents based on 
chapters (like books, manuals, etc.) because whenever you insert a new section page 
break, it recreates in the new section the same document structure used in the previous 
section.
You can appreciate this behavior by extracting “Page Numbers Only.docx” document 
from file Chapter09.zip, which was formatted using a A5 page size and Narrow margins 
(defined in Layout tab, Size and Margins tools), having the Different First Page and 
Different Odd & Even Pages options checked, where the document’s First Page Footer, 
Even Page Header, and Odd Page Header received the Circular page number style (using 
the Insert tab, Page Number tool).
It has six pages, divided by a Next Page section break inserted in Section 1, Page 3, 
which makes Section 2, Page 4, First Page Footer inherit the Section 1, Page 1, First Page 
Footer (the same behavior for Section 2 pages 5 and 6, Figure 9-15).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

433
Figure 9-15.  This is the “Page Number Only.docx” document, which you can 
extract from Chapter09.zip file. It has six pages and two sections, using three 
different page types per section (First Page, Even and Odd pages), which had 
received the Circular page number style on its First Page Footer, Even and Odd 
Page Header
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

434
When Microsoft Word tells us that a Header/Footer is “Same as Previous” it is not 
kidding: it is indeed the same content! Try for example to delete First Page Header - 
Section 2 Circle page number style (click it and press Delete key) to realize that it will 
also be deleted from First Page Header - Section 1 (Figure 9-16).
The same is true for any other Header/Footer content that shows the “Same as 
Previous” title at its right side.
This linked header/footer content is the default Microsoft Word behavior for every 
new section created, but you can break such linkage using the Link to Previous tool 
found in the Navigation area of the Header & Footer Tools Design tab (Figure 9-17).
Figure 9-16.  Since each new section page break is linked to the section before, 
whenever you make a change in any Header/Footer content, this change will be 
reflected in the previous linked section. This figure shows that by deleting Section 2,  
Page 4, First Page Header Circle style page number, it will also be removed from 
Section 1, Page 1, First Page Header, because they are indeed the same object

Breaking Section Link
The Link to Previous tool found in the Navigation area of the Header & Footer Tools 
Design tab allows breaking the link that may exist between two consecutive sections’ 
Headers and Footers (including the First Page, Odd Page, and Even Page Header/
Footer). It is important to note that you can break the link between two consecutive 
Header sections while keeping the link between its Footer sections (and vice versa).
We need to break a section link to the previous section whenever the headers of 
the two consecutive sections must be different, which mostly happens in some types 
of publications (e.g., books and manuals) where the Header/Footer area conveys the 
chapter name that begins each new book section.
Take any book from your library and look at its headers (technical books are more 
prone to make such formatting). Note that some of them will change the Header/Footer 
areas of the odd/even page to give information about which chapter title the page 
belongs to. More commonly, books use the even page header (left page) to convey the 
chapter title, and the odd page header to convey the book or section title.
To create such complex even/odd page headers in which text content changes 
according to the chapter or section title, it is imperative to use unlinked section breaks, 
with each one holding its own information. And you will better understand this process 
by following the steps of the next exercise.
Figure 9-17.  Use the Link to Previous tool found in the Navigation area of the 
Header & Footer Tools Design tab to break the link between the two consecutive 
sections, allowing the creation of different types of Header/Footer in each 
document section
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

436
Automatically Inserting Section Breaks
Look again to Figure 4-14 and note that the Find and Replace dialog box does not offer in 
the Replace with text box Special button an option like “Section Break”, meaning that you 
cannot easily search for text and automatically insert a Section Break before or after it.
But we can do this by using the Clipboard Contents option found in the Special 
button, using a Find and Replace operation, following these steps:
	 1.	 Insert the desired Section Break type in the text.
	 2.	 Select the Section Break on the page and cut it to Clipboard  
(press Ctrl+X, Figure 9-­18).
	 3.	 Press Ctrl+H to Show the Find and Replace dialog box.
	 4.	 In the Find what text box, type whatever you want to search for.
	 5.	 In the Replace with dialog box, use the Special ➤ Clipboard 
Contents (^c) and Special ➤ Find What Text (^&) to insert the 
Clipboard content before the Find what text search.
Figure 9-18.  To automatically insert Section Breaks of the same type in the text, 
insert the first Section Break, click at its left, press Shift+End (or Shift+Right arrow) 
to select it, and press Ctrl+X to cut it to Clipboard
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

437
Section Breaks and Spacing Before
You may not have noticed, but whenever any paragraph has its Spacing Before options 
set to any amount of spacing and it also has the Page break before option checked, it 
does not obey the Spacing Before on the new page.
To me, this seems to be a bug in Microsoft Word.
The good news is that this behavior disappears whenever this paragraph is preceded 
by a Section Break of any type.
Try the next experiment:
	 1.	 Open a new, blank document in Microsoft Word and check the 
Show/Hide tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
	 2.	 Press at least an Enter key to insert a second paragraph.
	 3.	 For this second paragraph, show the Paragraph dialog box  
(right-click it and select Paragraph) and set these options:
•	
Spacing Before = 40.
•	
Page break before = checked.
	 4.	 Close the Paragraph dialog box and note that this paragraph 
begins on another page, but does not implement the Spacing 
Before = 40 pt.
	 5.	 With the next page paragraph still selected, insert any type of 
Section Break before it.
The paragraph will now implement the Spacing Before = 40 pt (Figure 9-19).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to exemplify how to create different even/odd page 
headers for a document that uses mirror margins, having different first page, even and 
odd headers in each book section. It will use the “European Convention of Human 
Rights.docx” file, which you can extract from Chapter09.zip file.
Open the “European Convention of Human Rights” document from the Chapter09.
zip file in Microsoft Word and note that it is formatted with a Letter size paper (8.5 × 11) 
and Normal margins (choose with the Size and Margins tools of the Page Setup area of 
the Layout tab). It received the Title, Subtitle, Heading1, and Heading2 styles and was 
formatted with “Lines (Distinctive)” style set (choose in the Style Set Gallery found in the 
Design tab), which produced an 11-page document.
Figure 9-19.  Insert a Section Break of any kind before a paragraph that must 
begin on a new page to make its Spacing Before option be implemented on that 
page
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

439
It has the Different First page and Different Odd & Even Pages options checked, 
which respectively received the Accent Bar Bottom, Accent Bar 1, and Accent Bar 2 
header styles (choose with the Footer and Header tools found in the Header & Footer 
Tools Design Tab) (Figure 9-20).
Figure 9-20.  This is “The European Convention of Human Rights.docx” document 
extracted from the Chapter09.zip file. It has an Accent Bar Bottom page number 
on its First Page Footer, and Accent Bar 1 and 2 page numbers on its Odd and Even 
Page Headers.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

440
You must insert a Next Page Section Break before each document chapter title and 
unlink each new section from the previous to produce personalized headers to each 
chapter, showing the chapter number at its even and odd pages.
Automatically Add a Next Page Section Break
Follow these instructions to add a Next Page Section Break before “CHAPTER 1: 
DIGNITY” text of “The European Convention of Human Rights” document:
	 1.	 In the “European Convention of Human Rights” document, show 
the Navigation pane (press Ctrl+F) and click Headings to show all 
paragraphs formatted with Heading styles.
	 2.	 Double-click the ruler to show the Page Setup dialog box, select 
the Paper tab, and change page Height = 5 to force the creation of 
new document pages, so each chapter may have first, even, and 
odd pages (document will now have 32 pages).
	 3.	 Click “CHAPTER 1: DIGNITY” entry on Navigation page 
(formatted with Heading1 style) to select it in the document 
window.
	 4.	 Use the Breaks tool found in the Page Setup area of the Layout 
tab of the Ribbon to insert a Next Page Section Break before this 
paragraph.
	 5.	 With the Show/Hide tool checked in the Home tab of the Ribbon, 
click at left of the Next Page Section Break (or at right of the 
pilcrow Paragraph Break that preceded it) and press Shift+End (or 
Shift+Right arrow) to select it in the text.
	 6.	 Press Ctrl+X to remove the Next Page Section Break to Clipboard 
(Figure 9-21).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

441
Now use the Find and Replace dialog box to make a normal search for every 
“CHAPTER” text formatted with Heading1 style and precede it by the Next Page Section 
Break inserted in Clipboard.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Use the Replace command (Ctrl+H) found in the Editing area of 
the Home tab of the Ribbon to show the Find and Replace dialog 
box.
	 2.	 Click Find what and use these search parameters to find all 
Heading1 style “CHAPTER” text paragraphs:
•	
Find what: CHAPTER
•	
Select Special ➤ Style ➤ Heading1 on Find Style dialog box.
Attention  The parenthesis pair allows use of the \n wildcard in the Replace with 
text box.
Figure 9-21.  Insert a Next Page Section Break before the “CHAPTER 1: DIGNITY” 
text, select it in the text, and press Ctrl+X to cut it to Clipboard
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

442
	 3.	 Click the Replace with text box and use these options:
•	
Select Special ➤ Clipboard Contents (to insert a ^c)
•	
Select Special ➤ Find What Text (to insert a ^&). The Replace 
with must become: ^c^&
Attention  The ^c^& inserts the Clipboard Contents followed by whatever is 
found in the document text (^&) as specified by the Find what text box.
	 4.	 Press Replace All to replace all seven occurrences and insert seven 
Next Page Section Breaks, one before each Heading1 “CHAPTER” 
text (Figure 9-22).
Figure 9-22.  Make a normal Find and Replace operation to search for each 
Heading1 “CHAPTER” text paragraph and insert the Next Page Section Break that 
is inside Clipboard before each occurrence found
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

443
Break Section Links and Personalize Headers
The document will now have 35 pages spread across eight sections after you inserted 
all seven Next Page Section Breaks before each of its seven “CHAPTER…” paragraphs 
(Figure 9-23).
Figure 9-23.  After inserting a Next Page Section Break before each Heading1 
“CHAPTER…” title, the document must have 35 pages, and “CHAPTER VII…” must 
be in Section 8, Page 32 of 35
Attention  By inserting new sections in the document, they will all inherit the 
same First Page, Even and Odd Page Header text: all sections will have the Link to 
previous option set.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

444
It is time to break the link between each section so each one can have its own Header 
text. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+Home to go to the first document page; double-click its 
Header area.
	 2.	 Click the Next command found in the Navigation area of the 
Header & Footer Tools Design tab, until you reach Section 2, Odd 
Page Header (Page 9 of 35).
	 3.	 Click Link to Previous button to uncheck the option and break the 
link between Section 2 Odd Page Header and Section 1 Odd page 
header.
	 4.	 Select the “Page” text in Section 2 Odd Page Header and change 
it to “Chapter I” text, to create a personalized odd page header for 
this document section.
	 5.	 Press Next command again to go to Section 2, Even Page Header 
(Page 10 of 35) and click Link to Previous button to uncheck the 
option and break the link between Section 2 Even Page Header 
and Section 1 Even page header.
	 6.	 Select the “Page” text in Section 2 Even Page Header and change it 
to “Chapter I” text, to create a personalized even page header for 
this document section (Figure 9-24).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

445
	 7.	 Repeat steps 6 to 9, searching for the next section’s Odd and Even 
page headers, breaking its link with the previous section and 
creating personalized “Chapter n” titles in its headers (note that 
they will inherit the precedent “Chapter n” title).
	 8.	 When all chapter sections’ odd and even page headers are 
personalized to show the chapter numbers in their headers, click 
the Close Header and Footer button at the right of the Header & 
Footer Tools Design tab (or double-click the document text) to 
select the document text.
	 9.	 Press Ctrl+A to select the entire document text and double-click 
the Ruler to show the Page Setup dialog box and change the Page 
Height = 11 to make the pages have a Letter size again (or use the 
Size ➤ Letter command in the Layout tab of the Ribbon).
Figure 9-24.  Uncheck the Link to Previous command found in the Navigation 
area of the Header & Footer Tools Design tab to break the link between Section 2 
and Section 1 Odd Page Headers and change the “Page” work to “Chapter I”
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

446
Attention  If you inadvertently change any header text before breaking the link 
it has with the previous section, you will in fact change both headers’ text. It is 
always a good formatting practice to use the Previous button to go backward in 
document sections to confirm that they were adequately personalized.
Note that after you changed again the document page Height from 5 to 11, the 
text will reflux and many chapters’ odd/even headers will disappear—they are still 
there, ready to be used if more text is inserted, the document Style Set is changed, 
or you press Ctrl+A to select the document text and change its page size and 
margins.
The document will now have personalized Odd and Even Page Headers for each chapter 
(the “European Convention of Human Rights Unlinked Headers.docx” that you can extract 
from Chapter09.zip file has these personalized odd and even section headers).
Setting Page Columns
Another usage for Section Breaks is to produce columnated text using two or more 
columns to make the text flow across the document page, which can be formatted by 
following two simple steps:
	 1.	 Select the text you want to flow in columns.
	 2.	 Choose the desired column count using the Columns tool found 
in the Page Setup area of the Layout tab of the Ribbon.
If you do not select any amount of text, all the document text will be columnated 
until you insert another Section Break and define it as a single column text.
Let us see follow a simple example with the “European Convention of Human Rights 
Unlinked Headers.docx” used in the last section; this document has a Preamble section 
that must be flow in two columns inside the first document page.
Follow these instructions:
	 1.	 In the “European Convention of Human Rights Unlinked Headers.
docx” document, select all the paragraphs inside the “Preamble” 
section (begin with “The People…” and end before the “Contents” 
paragraph).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

447
	 2.	 Click the Columns tool in the Layout tab and select Two columns.
Voilà! All the “Preamble” paragraphs (not including the “Preamble” text formatted 
with Subtitle style) will instantly flow in two columns on the same page (Figure 9-25).
Attention  By not selecting any amount of text, all the document text—or current 
section, if there is any Section Break—will be columnated.
Figure 9-25.  To make the text flow into columns inside a page, select the text 
first and then use the Columns tool found in the Page Setup area of the Layout 
tab to define how many columns you want (by not selecting any text, the entire 
document—or current section—will be columnated)
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

448
To understand what really happens when you ask Microsoft Word to format text 
using columns, click the Show/Hide tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon and search for 
the two Continuous section breaks that were inserted in the document: one before the 
first and another after the last columnated paragraphs.
The example created with the “European Convention of Human Rights Unlinked 
Headers.docx” document is very didactic for this purpose because the “Preamble” 
paragraph that precedes the columnated text is right aligned, allowing you to see 
that it has a section break at its right (as said before, Section Breaks are placed 
in between paragraphs, and are not made part of them): click the “Preamble” 
paragraph and Left align it to show the two Section Breaks used to create such 
columnated text (Figure 9-­26).
Figure 9-26.  Check the Show/Hide tool found in the Home tab of the Ribbon and 
eventually change some paragraph alignment so you can see the two Continuous 
Section Breaks that encompass the columnated text
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

449
And once the text is columnated, you can play with it using the Columns tool:
•	
Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to insert a hidden Column break character, 
allowing control of where a given column ends (use this technique to 
define the column height).
•	
Use the Columns tool to select Three, Left, and Right commands and 
change the way text is columnated (Left and Right creates different 
column widths with the narrowest at left or right, respectively).
•	
Select More Columns… to show the Columns dialog box from where 
you can choose further column formats (Figure 9-27).
Figure 9-27.  Use the Columns ➤ More Columns… command to show the Columns 
dialog box from where you can choose more column formatting options
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

450
Among the possibilities that the Columns dialog box offer to format columnated text, 
you will find:
•	
Number of columns: allows defining up to twelve columns per 
section.
•	
Line between: check to insert a vertical line that separates the 
columns.
•	
Width and spacing: use to precisely define each column width.
•	
Equal column width: use to make all columns have the same width.
Note that whenever you have a columnated text and click any text column, Microsoft 
Word ruler will show controls that allow you to change the column margins (and 
consequently the column or columns width according to the state of the Equal column 
width option of the Columns dialog box).
Figure 9-28 shows how the columnated text appears after selecting the Line in 
between option of the Columns dialog box, and how you can drag the left column’s right 
margin to narrow both columns (since the Equal column width option is checked).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

451
How Column Information Is Stored
Column formatting information is stored inside the section, meaning that the top 
Section Break is the one responsible for storing how the text that comes before it will be 
formatted.
This is important because if you delete the top Section Break that begins any 
columnated text, all the text above it will receive the same column formatting, effectively 
propagating the columnated text to the previous document section.
You can see an example of such propagating by deleting the Section Break 
(Continuous) that is at the right of the “Preamble” paragraph: the text before it will also 
be columnated (Figure 9-29).
Figure 9-28.  Using the Line between width and dragging any column margin, we 
can interactively change one or all column widths (according to the Equal column 
width option stated in the Columns dialog box)
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

452
Figure 9-29.  By deleting the Section Break (Continuous) that begins the 
columnated text, you will effectively propagate the same column formatting to 
the previous document section. By deleting the Section Break (Continuous) at the 
bottom of the columnated text, it will return to the default one-column format
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

453
Attention  Since the column formatting is copied to the previous section 
whenever the top Section Break is deleted, it is clear that the column formatting is 
stored in the bottom Section Break. Select the bottom section break (place the text 
cursor at the left of the Section Break and press Shift+Right arrow), copy it, and 
paste it in any other single column document part to recreate the same column 
formatting above this place. Try it!
The European Convention of Human Rights Unlinked Headers & Columns.docx” 
document, which you can extract from Chapter09.zip, has the columns and diving 
lines shown in Figure 9-29.
The lesson here is quite simple, if you want to remove column formatted text from 
any document: first remove the bottom Section Break (Continuous) that ends the 
columnated text, effectively propagating the one-column format to the section above 
(the columnated one), and then remove the Section Break (Continuous) that was used to 
begin the columnated text!
Numbering Complex Documents
For the sake of this discussion, I will consider as a “complex document” one that needs 
to change page numbering style and/or page count, whether or not its first page (which 
is usually the document cover) is counted or numbered.
Such complex documents also need to be divided by Section Breaks to perfectly 
control their page numbering and number style. Figure 9-30 shows some examples 
of how they look for both Normal (printed in one side of paper) or Mirror documents 
(printed on both side of paper), which may have the Different first page option set, 
allowing numbering or counting the first page (cover).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

454
All document examples number their first pages using Roman numeral styles, 
restarting the page numbering at some point using Arabic numerals, and with one or 
more pages whose Orientation was set to Landscape.
Also note that in Figure 9-27, the spot where each page breaks must be placed to 
change the page numbering style from Roman to Arabic numerals, restarting the page 
count or changing some page Orientation to Landscape.
Figure 9-30.  Normal (printed in one side of page) and mirror (printed in both 
sides of page) documents that have complex formatting
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

455
Renumbering Pages
Figure 9-30 shows different ways to count and/or number the first document page. 
Its top left example counts and numbers all it pages, including its cover page, using 
Roman numerals, and then inserts a Section Break to restart page counting using Arabic 
numerals.
This document numbering style can be imposed by using the Microsoft Word 
Format Page Numbers… option found in the Page Number tool found in the Header & 
Footer area of the Insert Tab of the Ribbon, which will show the traditional Page Number 
Format dialog box (Figure 9-31).
You have the following options to format the document or section page numbers:
•	
Number format: use to select different numbering systems (Arabic, 
Letters, Roman uppercase or lowercase).
•	
Include chapter number: this option works with Heading styles that 
use the Numbering tool to automatically number them. When you 
check it, you can select which Heading style number will be used and 
add a separator to prefix the page number.
Figure 9-31.  Use the Page Number ➤ Format Page Numbers… command to show 
the Page Number Format dialog box, from where you can control the number 
format style and each section’s first page number
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

456
•	
Page Numbering: use this area to select which page number must be 
associated to the first section page:
•	
Continue from previous section: default option, allow 
consecutive page numbering from section to section.
•	
Start at: allow changing the section’s first page number, ignoring 
all precedent pages.
Based on the knowledge gathered so far, you may anticipate that to create two 
different numbering styles in any document, you must:
	 1.	 Use the Page Number tool to insert a page number in the Header.
	 2.	 Insert a Next Page Section Break to separate the two different 
numbering section styles.
	 3.	 Double-click any Section 1 page Header area to show the Header 
& Footer Tools Design tab.
	 4.	 Use the Page Number ➤ Format Page Number command to show 
the Page Number Format dialog box for Section 1 and define:
•	
Number format = I, II, III or i, ii, iii (Roman numerals).
	 5.	 Close the Page Number Format dialog box and click Next button 
to show Section Header.
	 6.	 Evoke again the Page Number Format dialog box for Section 2 and 
define:
•	
Number format = 1,2,3 (Arabic numerals).
•	
Start at =1
	 7.	 Close the Page Number Format.
You can see an example of such page numbering style by extracting the “Cover 
Counted and Numbered, Different number styles.docx” document from Chapter09.zip 
file and opening it in Microsoft Word.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

457
This document has six pages, with a Next Page Section Break inserted into its third 
page, receiving these formatting options in its two sections (Figure 9-32):
•	
Section 1: Number format = i, ii, iii (lowercase Roman numerals).
•	
Section 2: Number format= 1,2,3, Start at = 1
Showing the Logical Page Number on Status Bar
Microsoft Word may cause some confusion regarding the Even and Odd Page Headers 
and the even/odd page numbers whenever the we use the Page Number Format dialog 
box to restart any Section numbering.
You may eventually find the document on a logical even page (like page 2 or ii) 
while the Header title area shows “Section 2, Odd Page Header” (vice versa for odd page 
numbers).
For those moments, you can show the logical page number associated to this 
physical page in Microsoft Word Status and take a better decision about how to format a 
given Header/Footer text:
	 1.	 Right-click the Status bar to show the Customize Status Bar pop-
up menu.
	 2.	 Check the Formatted Page Number option.
From this point on, Microsoft Word will begin to show “Page n” page number as its 
first Status Bar information, where n is the logical page number. Use it to guarantee that 
you are at an even and odd page and correctly align the right header/footer even and 
odd page text (Figure 9-33).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

458
Figure 9-32.  This is the “Cover Counted and Numbered, Different number styles.
docx” document showing its third and fourth pages, separated by a Next Page 
Section Break. It uses different numbering styles and page renumbering between its 
two sections
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

459
Hiding First Page Number
The Figure 9-30 top middle example differs from the top left example just because it 
doesn’t show the cover page number, while still counting it as Page i (1).
This can be easily accomplished in “Cover Counted and Numbered, Different 
number styles.docx” document by using the Previous command found in the Navigation 
area of the Header & Footer Tools Design tab to show Section 1 Header and checking the 
Different First Page option, which will make Microsoft Word show the First Page Header, 
which does not receive a page number (Figure 9-34).
Figure 9-33.  Right-click the Status bar to show the Customize Status Bar context 
menu and click Formatted Page Number to show the logical page number as 
additional important page information
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

460
Not Counting the First Page
The Figure 9-30 top right example differs from the top left and middle examples because 
it doesn’t count or show the cover page number, which is an effect that is very simple to 
achieve by following these steps:
	 1.	 Insert a Next Page Section Break in the first document page 
(Section 1, cover).
	 2.	 In Section 2 (2nd page), show the Page Number Format dialog box 
and set Start at = 1.
Figure 9-34.  To remove the any document’s (or section’s) first page number, just 
check the First Page Different option and remove its page number
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

461
Attention  You cannot set the Start at option to a negative number, but can 
set it to 0 (zero) as long as you use the default Number Format = 1,2,3 (Arabic 
numerals). But you cannot set Start at = 0 when a section uses Roman or Letter 
numbering system.
So, to make a document not count or show any number on its first page, restarting 
page numbering from 1 on its second page (using any numbering system), you need to
	 1.	 Insert a Next Page break on its cover page (Section 1).
	 2.	 Format Section 2 with: any Number Format and set these options:
•	
Different First Page = unchecked.
•	
Link to Previous = unchecked.
•	
Start at = 1.
Figure 9-35 show this effect in the “Cover Counted and Numbered, Different number 
styles.docx” document, which received a New Page Section Break on its first page and 
these formatting options for Section 2:
•	
Different First Page = unchecked
•	
Link to Previous = unchecked.
•	
Number Format = i, ii, iii (lowercase Roman numerals).
•	
Start at = i.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

462
Attention  Complex documents with Mirror margins obey the same rules. Since 
they mostly use Odd Page Section Breaks to begin a new chapter, they tend to lack 
some page numbers (as Figure 9-30 shows in its two bottom examples, which has 
empty “even” pages at left of page number “1”).
Figure 9-35.  To not count or number the cover and start numbering at the 2nd 
document page, you need to insert a Next Page Section Break in the first page, and 
in Section 2, first page (2nd document page) set Number Format = i, ii, iii and Start 
at = i

Exercise 2
The objective of this exercise is to show how you can format a Microsoft Word document 
using columns and different number systems (Roman and Arabic numerals) to number 
its pages, having the chance to see how some formatting options can add complexity to 
the document regarding its section count.
It will use the “Moby Dick, Herman Melville.docx” document that you can extract 
from the Chapter09.zip file, which has the famous 1851 Herman Melville novel (this 
book was a commercial failure at the time it was published). It needs 325 A4 pages to 
spread its introduction, 135 chapters, and an epilogue.
It has no Section Break (has just Section 1), uses Title, Subtitle, Quote, Heading1, 
Heading2, and Normal Recommended styles, plus the Citation style created by myself 
(to format some special paragraphs found in book introduction) and was formatted with 
the Basic (Elegant) Style set (Figure 9-36).
Figure 9-36.  This is the “Moby Dick, Herman Melville.docx” document that you 
can extract from Chapter09.zip file, with Herman Melville’s famous 1851 novel 
published in full text. It uses Recommended styles (Title, Subtitle, Quote, Heading1, 
Heading2, Normal) and was formatted using the Basic (Elegant) style set.

Insert a Cover Page
Let us begin formatting the “Moby Dick, Herman Melville.docx” document by changing 
its first page: it has Properties that allow you insert a built-in Cover Page as the first 
document page:
	 1.	 Click File ➤ Info Properties ➤ Advanced Properties to show the 
Moby Dick, Herman Melville Properties dialog box and inspect 
the document properties (Figure 9-37).
	 2.	 Return to the document page and use the Insert ➤ Cover Page 
tool to select a built-in page. This exercise will use the Ion (Dark) 
cover page due to its blue detail that resembles the ocean.
Figure 9-37.  Use File ➤ Info ➤ Properties ➤ Advanced Properties to show the 
Moby Dick, Herman Melville dialog box and note how it uses the Title, Subject, and 
Author fields to identify the document allowing the use of Cover Page, Header and 
Footer built-in objects
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

465
	 3.	 Inspect the built-in cover page and how it uses the Title, Subject, 
and Author fields to define some document properties.
•	
At the top of the Ion (Dark) page there is a small control showing 
year 1900: click it and type the book publication year (1851).
•	
At the bottom of the Ion (Dark) page there are two controls to type 
the Company name and Company address. Use or delete them at 
will (I typed in the Apress name and address, Figure 9-38).
Figure 9-38.  Use the Insert ➤ Cover Page ➤ Ion(Dark) tool to insert a built-
in cover page that uses the Title, Subject, and Author document properties to 
personalize the first page
•	
Double-click the Ion (Dark) cover page Header area to show the 
Header & Footer Tools Design tab.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

466
	 4.	 Execute the Page Number ➤ Format Page Numbers… command 
to show the Page Number Format dialog box.
	 5.	 Note that now the document Section 1 has these properties (and 
the Status Bar, Formatted Page Number = Page 0, Figure 9-39):
•	
Number format: 1,2,3 (Arabic numerals).
•	
Page numbering: Start at = 0.
	 6.	 The built-in page inserted as the first document page must not be 
counted or numbered, so you need to change the Page Break it 
has on its top to a Section Break (Next Page):
•	
Click at the left of the Page Break in the page begin and press 
Delete (document text will reflux to the cover page).
•	
Use the Layout ➤ Breaks ➤ Next Page option to insert a Section 
Break (Next Page) and force the text to reflux again to the document’s 
Section 2 first page (second document page, Figure 9-40).
Figure 9-39.  Double-click the cover page Header area to show the Header & 
Foooter Tools Design tab and use the Page Number ➤ Format Page Numbers… 
command to show the Page Number Formats dialog box and note that it sets 
Section 1, Page numbering Start at = 0
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

467
Attention  By inserting a Section Break (Next Page) on the Cover Page, the 
second document page is now in document Section 2, which received by default 
the Link to Previous option set and inherited all Section 1 properties: Number 
format = 1,2,3 and Start at = 0.
Make “Whale Definitions” Flow in Two Columns
Now that the document has a Cover Page that uses its Properties, it is time to further 
format it using columns and section breaks.
Figure 9-40.  The Ion (Dark) Cover Page received a Next Page Section Break, 
making Section 2 (book text) inherit all its properties, including first page 
numbered as 0 (zero)
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

468
Note that the “Moby Dick, Herman Melville.docx” document has an “ETYMOLOGY” 
section on its second page that has twelve whale definitions in different languages (from 
“KETUS Greek” to “PEKEE-NUEE-NUEE Erromangoan”). Make them all flow into a two-­
column format by following these steps:
	 1.	 Select all these twelve whale definitions on second document 
page (drag the mouse from “KETUS Greek” to “PEKEE-NUEE-
NUEE Erromangoan”).
	 2.	 Use the Layout ➤ Columns ➤ Two command them flow in a two-
column format.
	 3.	 Drag first column Left margin control on the ruler to the right to 
give it a bigger Left indent from the page Left margin (Figure 9-41).
Figure 9-41.  Select the 12 whale definitions in different foreign languages and 
use the Layout ➤ Columns ➤ Two command to make them flow in a two-column 
format. Then select the six paragraphs of the first text column and drag it Left 
indent control on the ruler to increase its left indentation
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

469
Attention  By inserting the “whale definitions” in a two-column format, Microsoft 
Word also inserted two new Continuous Section Breaks in the document, which 
now has Section 2 (columnated text) and Section 4 (remaining text).
Both Section 3 and Section 4 received by default the Link to Previous option set, 
and inherited all Section 2 properties: Number format = 1,2,3 and Page numbering 
Start at = 0 (cascade inherited from Section 1).
Add a Bottom Border to the Citation Style
Open the Apply Styles window (see Figure 5-2) and note that the “Moby Dick…” 
document “EXTRACTS…” section has some pages of “extract” paragraphs, which may 
have different numbers of sentences but always end with the author or source.
Each of these “extract” paragraphs were formatted with the Citation style, having 
as many Manual line Break characters as needed to separate each of its sentences from 
one another and from its author/source, located in the last paragraph line: a formatting 
technique that guarantees that all its sentences belong to a single Paragraph break, no 
matter how long they are (Figure 9-42).
Figure 9-42.  The “Moby Dick…” document “Extract…” section has “extract” 
paragraphs formatted with the Citation styles. They have Manual Line Breaks 
inserted at the ends of sentences to separate them from one another and from its 
author/source.
We must update the Citation style by adding a bottom border, so each “extract” 
paragraph be better separated from the next!
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

470
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Select the first two Citation style paragraphs (“Leviathan…” 
and “Now the Lord…”), click the Border tool, and select Inside 
Horizontal Border to insert a border between them (Figure 9-43).
Figure 9-43.  Select any two extracts paragraphs formatted with the Citation style 
from the “EXTRACTS (Supplied by a Sub-SubLibrarian)” section, and use the 
Border ➤ Inside Horizontal Border command to insert a bottom border in between 
them
	 2.	 Right-click the Citation style in the Styles window and choose 
Update Citation from Selection to update the style, adding a 
bottom border between every two consecutive Citation style 
paragraphs (Figure 9-44).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

471
Make “Extracts” Flow on Two Columns
Now that each “extract” paragraph formatted with the Citation style has a border to 
separate it from the next, it is time to make them all flow through a two-column format 
by following these steps:
	 1.	 Click the beginning of the first Citation paragraph (“Leviathan…” 
on document page 3), press and hold Shift, and press Page Down 
successively until you reach the last Citation paragraph (“Oh, the 
rare …” on page 9, right before “Chapter 1” text).
Figure 9-44.  After inserting the Inside Horizontal Border to the Citation style 
paragraph, right-click it in the Styles window and choose Update Citation to 
Match Selection
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

472
	 2.	 Use the Layout ➤ Columns ➤ More Columns… command to show 
the Columns dialog box and check these options (Figure 9-45):
•	
Presets: Two (or Number of columns = 2).
•	
Line between (checked).
•	
Equal column width (checked).
	 3.	 Close the Columns dialog box and press the Left arrow to return to 
the first Citation paragraph (“Leviathan…”).
	 4.	 Use the Border toll to add a Top border (Figure 9-46).
Figure 9-45.  Select all “extract” paragraphs formatted with the Citation style and 
use the Layout ➤ Columns ➤ More Columns… command to show the Columns 
dialog box, from where you can select Preset = Two, and check the Line Between 
option to make the text flow in a two-column format with a line in between them
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

473
Attention  By inserting the “extract” paragraphs in a two-column format, 
Microsoft Word inserted again two new Continuous Section Breaks in the 
document, which now has Section 5 (“extract” columnated paragraphs) and 
Section 6 (remaining text).
Both Section 5 and Section 6 received by default the Link to Previous option set, 
and inherited all Section 4 properties: Number format = 1,2,3 and Page numbering 
Start at = 0 (cascade inherited from Section 1).
Figure 9-46.  Format all Citation paragraphs using a two-column layout with a 
line dividing them
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

474
Make “Chapter 1” Begin on an Odd Page
The “Chapter 1” section is where the book text really begins, and must begin on an odd 
right page, which needs the insertion of an Odd Page Section Break right before it, by 
following these steps:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+F to show the Navigation pane.
	 2.	 Click Navigation Pane Headings option, to show document 
Heading styles.
	 3.	 Click “Chapter 1” to select it in the document text.
	 4.	 Use the Layout ➤ Breaks ➤ Odd Page command to insert a 
Section Break (Odd Page) before “Chapter 1” paragraph (which 
will be put in document Section 7).
Attention  Once more, Section 7 received by default the Link to Previous option 
set, and inherited all Section 6 properties: Number format = 1,2,3 and Page 
numbering Start at = 0 (cascade inherited from Section 1).
Insert Page Numbers
The “Moby Dick… ” document must have now seven sections divided by six section 
breaks (one on the cover, four to enclose the two columnated texts, and one before 
“Chapter 1”), and is time to number its pages.
This is a nice learning example because the document is now quite complex with its 
many Section Breaks, all of them inheriting Section 1 properties, defined by the insertion 
of the Cover Page as the first document page (Number format = 1,2,3 and Start at = 0).
Our intention is to apply different page number styles to this document:
•	
Cover page: not counted or numbered.
•	
Restart page numbering using Roman numerals on page 2 “Etymology”, 
which must be numbered in its Footer area. All other pages before 
Section 7 (“Chapter 1”) must be numbered in the Odd/Even Headers.
•	
Restart page numbering using Arabic numerals in Section 7, “Chapter 1”  
page in its Footer area. All other pages till the end of the document 
must be numbered in its Odd/Even Headers.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

475
To correctly create and format these Footers, Odd and Even Headers using different 
numbering styles in such a complex document, you must use the tools found in the 
Header & Footer Tools Design tab and pay close attention to the text, the Formatted Page 
Number shown in the Status Bar, and the Section type you are formatting (first, even or 
odd section page).
Creating Section 2, First Page Footer
The “Moby Dick…” document must have the cover page not counted or numbered, and 
the first book page, inserted in Section 2, must be numbered in its Footer, using Roman 
numerals.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+Home to go to the first document page (with the Ion 
(Dark) built-in page).
	 2.	 Double-click the first page and note that the Different First Page 
and Different Odd and Even Pages options are checked  
(see Figure 9-38).
	 3.	 Click Next command to go to Section 2, First Page Header  
(second document page).
	 4.	 Click Go To Footer command to go to Section 2, First Page Footer 
area.
	 5.	 Click Center alignment tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon  
(or press Ctrl+E) to center align the footer text.
	 6.	 Use the Page Number ➤ Page Number Formats… command to 
show the Page Number Format dialog box and set these options to 
Section 2:
•	
Number format: I, II, III (uppercase Roman numerals).
•	
Page numbering: Start at = I
•	
Close the Page Number Format dialog box and look to the Status 
Bar: the Formatted Page Number must show Page I, Section 2, 
while Page number shows Page 2 of 328.
	 7.	 Use the Page Number ➤ Current Position ➤ Two Bars option to 
numbering Section 2, First Page Footer (Figure 9-47).
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

476
	 8.	 Click the Link to Previous tool to uncheck it and break the link 
between Section 2 and Section 1, First Page Footer.
Attention  The order that you uncheck Link to Previous tool is important. If you 
uncheck it after set Section 2, Page numbering Start at = 1 (as proposed by this 
exercise), the Cover Page will inherit these options and it will be counted as Page 1, 
which will make the document page count go from 328 to 329.
	 9.	 Press the Go to Header button to select the First Page Header area, 
and if necessary, uncheck the Link to Previous option.
	 10.	 Press Next button tab to go to the next section header.
At this point, you may reach the third document page, an Even Page Header 
with Microsoft Word Status Bar indicating that it is Page II, Section 4, Page 3 of 329 
(Figure 9-­48).
Figure 9-47.  Section 2, First Page Footer area, must have Link to Previous 
unchecked, Number Format = I, II, III; define its Page numbering to Start at = I, so 
its First Page Footer receive page number I (Roman uppercase numeral)
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

477
Attention  When Section 2 received Number format = I, II, III and Page 
numbering: Start at = I, all sections after it will receive these same formatting 
options. Use the Page Number ➤ Format Page Numbers… tool to show the Page 
Number Format dialog box and see for yourself.
Creating Section 4, Even Page Header
The “Moby Dick…” document has Title, Subject, and Author properties set (using the File 
➤ Info page) allowing use of Microsoft Word Header and Page Number tools to create 
nice page headers (as explained in “Exercise 2” of Chapter 8).
Since this document is formatted with Mirror margins with the Different Odd and 
Even Pages option set, even pages (left pages) must be numbered on its left (outer) 
margin, so follow these steps to create Page II, Section 4, Page 3 of 329 Even Page Header:
	 1.	 Click the Header tool found in the Header & Footer Tools Design 
tab and choose Filigree built-in header to insert the Author and Title 
document properties right aligned in Section 4, Even Page Header.
Figure 9-48.  The third document page is at Section 4 due to the two Continuous 
Section Breaks inserted in the 2nd document page (Section 2, Page I) to columnate 
part of its text. Since it has the Link to Previous option set, it cascade inherited all 
Section 2 page properties (Number format = I, II, III and Page numbering Start  
at = I), receiving an Even Page Header and Formatted Page Number = Page II
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

478
	 2.	 Click the Left align tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon (or press 
Ctrl+L) to left align the Filigree header text.
	 3.	 Press the Tab key two times to right align the Filigree built-in 
header with the Right tab stop of the Even Page Header.
	 4.	 Drag the Right tab stop to the right to right align the Filigree 
header with the even page right margin.
	 5.	 Press Home key to go to the beginning of the Even Page Header 
and use the Page Number ➤ Current Position ➤ Plain number 
tool to insert the next page number (ii) left aligned on the Even 
Page Header.
	 6.	 Optionally, select the entire Even Header Text and use the Font 
Color tool found in the Home tab of the Ribbon to format it with 
Automatic color (Black).
Figure 9-49 shows how the Section 4, Even Page Header must be defined and 
formatted after following these last steps.
Figure 9-49.  Use the Header tool to insert a Filigree built-in header in Section 4, 
Even Page Header. Left align it and press Tab twice to align it to the Right tab stop. 
Press the Home key to go to the Even Page Header beginning and use the Page 
Number ➤ Current Position ➤ Plain number tool to insert a left aligned page 
number.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

479
Renumbering Section 5 First Page
Considering that the text cursor is still positioned in the now-formatted Even Page 
Header of Page II, Section 4, Page 3 of 329, press the Next button found in the Header & 
Footer Tools Design tab to reach the 5th document page header: it will be again an Even 
Page Header considered as Page II, Section 5, Page 5 of 329.
This fifth document page received Formatting Page Number = Page II because it has 
the Link to Previous option set, and had received by inheritance the same Section II page 
properties: Number Format = I, II, III and Page numbering Start at = I.
To make it appear with an Odd Page Header, receiving the Formatted Page Number = 
Page III, you must set Section 5 Page numbering = Continuous from last section.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click Page Number ➤ Format Page Numbers… to show the Page 
Number Format dialog box for Section 5, Page 5 of 329.
	 2.	 Set these options:
•	
Number format: I, II, III (uppercase Roman numerals).
•	
Page numbering: Continue from last section.
	 3.	 Close the Page Number Format dialog box.
Attention  When you close the Page Number Format dialog box, Microsoft Word 
will go back to Page II, Section 4, Page 3 of 329 (Even Page Header). Click the Next 
button to now reach an Odd Page Header, with the Status Bar showing Page III, 
Section 5, Page 5 of 329.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

480
Creating Section 5, Odd Page Header
Since this document is formatted with Mirror margins with the Different Odd and Even 
Pages option set, odd pages (right pages) must be numbered in its right (outer) margin, 
using the same information inserted in Section 4, Even Page Header text: it must left 
align the Filigree built-in header and right align the Page Number, Plain number.
Follow these steps to create Section 5, Odd Page Header:
	 1.	 Click the Header tool found in the Header & Footer Tools Design 
tab and choose Filigree built-in header to insert the Author and 
Title document properties right aligned in Section 5, Odd Page 
Header.
	 2.	 Click the Left align tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon (or press 
Ctrl+L) to left align the Filigree header text.
	 3.	 Press the End key twice to go to the end of the line and press the 
Tab key twice to insert two tab stops.
	 4.	 Use the Page Number ➤ Current Position ➤ Plain number tool 
to insert the next page number (III) right aligned in the Odd Page 
Header.
	 5.	 Drag the Right tab stop to the right to align the page number with 
the odd page right margin.
	 6.	 Optionally, select the entire Odd Header Text and use the Font 
Color tool found in the Home tab of the Ribbon to format it with 
Automatic color (Black).
Figure 9-50 show how the Section 5, Odd Page Header must be defined and 
formatted after following these last steps.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

481
Creating Section 7, Odd Page Header
Considering that the text cursor is still positioned in the now-formatted Odd Page 
Header of Page III, Section 5, Page 5 of 329, press the Next button found in the Header & 
Footer Tools Design tab until you reach the Even Page Header of Page VI, Section 5,  
Page 8 of 329, and note that you cannot go further using the Next button.
Microsoft Word gets stuck on this page and you will need to press the Page Down key to 
arrive at the First Page Header of “Chapter 1” text, located on Page 1, Section 7, Page 9 of 329.
Click the Go To Footer button (or use Page Down key) to select the First Page Footer 
area and note that, due to the action of inheritance, it received the same Section 2 
First Page Footer, using the same page properties: Number format = I, II, III and Page 
numbering Start at = I (Figure 9-51).
Figure 9-50.  Use the Footer ➤ Filigree tool and the Page Number ➤ Current 
Position Plain Number to create Section 5 Odd Even Header. This time, since this is 
an odd (right) page, the page number must be right aligned.
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

482
To make it appear as Page 1, Section 7, Page 9 of 329 you just need to change its 
Number format = 1,2,3. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click Page Number, Format Page Numbers… to show the Page 
Number Format dialog box for Section 7, Page 9 of 329.
	 2.	 Set these options:
•	
Number format: 1,2,3
•	
Page numbering: Continue from last section.
	 3.	 Close the Page Number Format dialog box and watch the  
Section 7, First Page Footer (Figure 9-52).
Figure 9-51.  “Chapter 1” begins on Page I, Section 7, Page 9 of 329. It received this 
Formatted Page Number because it inherited Section 2 page properties: Number 
format = I, II, III and Start at = I
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

483
Attention  When you close the Page Number Format dialog box, Microsoft Word 
will move the focus to the page First Page Header. Click the Go to Footer button 
and inspect the First Page Footer, with the Status Bar showing Page 1, Section 7, 
Page 9 of 329.
Inspecting Section 7, Even and Odd Page Headers
Considering that the text cursor is still positioned in the First Page Header of Page 1, 
Section 7, Page 9 of 329, press the Next button found in the Header & Footer Tools 
Design tab to reach Section 7, Even Page Header, which received the next chapter page 
number: Page 2, Section 7, Page 10 of 329. It inherited Section 2 Even Page Header text 
(page number left aligned, book information right aligned), using Section 7 Number 
format = 1,2,3 to correctly continue numbering “Chapter 1” pages.
Figure 9-52.  Change Section 7 Number Format = 1,2,3 and note that will inherit 
Section 2, First Page Footer, but will use Arabic numerals to restart the page 
numbering
Chapter 9  Section Breaks

484
Press Next button again to reach Section 7, Odd Page Header, which received again 
the next chapter page number: Page 3, Section 7, Page 11 of 329. Once more time, it 
inherited Section 4, Odd Page Header text (book information left aligned, page number 
right aligned), using Number format = 1,2,3 to correctly continue numbering the book 
pages (Figure 9-53).
Attention  The “Moby Dick, Herman Melville, Formatted.docx”, which you can 
extract from Chapter09.zip file, contains a formatted version of this exercise.
Figure 9-53.  Due to inheritance, Section 7 Even and Odd Page Headers received 
the same text used by Section 2, Even Page Header and Section 4, Odd Page 
Header. By using Number format = 1,2,3 it changes the document header number 
format

Conclusion
This chapter gave the opportunity to learn and to use Section Breaks to create different 
page formatting options, considering the page number style, page renumbering, and 
columnated texts.
The exercises gave you a chance to learn how Microsoft Word uses inheritance to 
convey Header/Footer text and formatting between consecutive document sections. 
By using the Page Number Format dialog box (accessed just by the Page Number tool 
found in both the Insert tab and the Header & Footer Tools Design tab), you can use the 
Number format and Page numbering options to create different page number styles, 
restarting the document page numbering whenever be necessary.
Summary
In this chapter you learned:
•	
That Microsoft Word uses Section Breaks to allow creation of different 
pages inside the same document.
•	
That you can select between four different Section Breaks: Continue, 
Next Page, Even Page, and Odd Page.
•	
To change a section break it is better to use the Page Setup dialog box 
Section start option.
•	
That each Section Break can store the First, Even, and Odd Header/
Footer text, even though it is not being used in the document.
•	
Whenever you delete and insert another Section Break to change 
its type, you will lose the First, Odd, and Even Header/Footer 
information typed in the deleted Section Break.
•	
That Section Breaks have a strong inheritance that is passed for the 
next inserted Section Break.
•	
How to use the Header & Footer Tools Design tab Link to Previous 
option to set or break a Section Break text and properties inheritance 
from the previous section.

CHAPTER 10
Formatting Tables
In this chapter, we will have the opportunity to discuss how to manage the tables that 
you may need to insert in your documents.
We will start with very basic operations (insert and delete table, rows, columns, 
and cells), table formatting, and how to resolve misbehaving tables inserted in your 
documents, discussing how to take advantage of the many table format interfaces 
available in Microsoft Word.
All documents cited in this chapter can be found by downloading the Chapter10.zip 
file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
Inserting Tables
Microsoft Word tables are the modern way to tabulate text (tab stops were the typewriter 
way, and even today, tab stops have their place). Although there is more than one way 
to create a table (you can use Tab stops), I think that it is better to create it using the 
intuitive Table control found in the Illustrations area of the Insert tab of the Ribbon, 
which drops down a visual tool from where you can select the size of the table to be 
created: see the cursor’s position in Figure 10-1.

488
Figure 10-1 created a 3×4 table (12 cells) on the document page. Note that each of 
cell of the figure shows the “¤” hidden character, which defines where the cell text ends, 
because the Show/Hide command found in the Paragraph area of the Home tab of the 
Ribbon is checked.
Each table cell can hold any amount of text, and you can navigate through its cells by 
directly clicking it with the mouse, or using the Tab key: each time the Tab key is pressed, 
Word moves to the next cell.
Attention  To insert another table row, click the last table cell and press the Tab 
key. Inheritance will take care to copy the current row format to the new table row.
Typing Text in Table Cells
You can consider Microsoft Word table cells as minidocuments where you can insert 
and format paragraphs like you do in any other document area. You can press Enter and 
insert one or more paragraphs in any cell, or press Ctrl+Enter to insert a Line break, or 
even press Ctrl+Tab to insert one or more Tab characters inside a single cell. And for 
each of these paragraphs, you can define all available formatting options (alignment, 
indentation, line space, space before and after).
Figure 10-1.  To insert a new table in the document, use the Insert tab Table 
command to define the number of rows and columns that the table must have. This 
figure draws a 3-row-by-4-column table. Click the mouse to finish the operation.

Now, with all the knowledge you have gathered so far in this book, think about the 
mess we can create in a single cell if we are not aware of such hidden characters…
Figure 10-2 shows what happened to the first table cell after I inserted a Tab, a 
Shift+Enter (Line break), and two Enter keys and changed the alignment of its last 
paragraph. Note that all other cells in the same row now have the same height. The figure 
shows the same table with the Show/Hide option checked and unchecked so you can 
draw your own conclusions!
Figure 10-2.  Consider Microsoft Word table cells as minidocuments where you 
can insert paragraphs and hidden characters. This figure shows a cell with hidden 
characters inserted, which changed the height of that cell, affecting all other cells 
of the same row. Without the Show/Hide tool checked, one cannot anticipate what 
will happen to a table that gets such a high height row.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

490
And this is not all. Microsoft Tables are so versatile that you can also insert another 
table inside any of its cells. Figure 10-3 shows two tables: the first one is the same table 
used by Figure 10-1 that now has tables inserted inside two of its cells (cells (1,2) and 
(2,3)—the first number index describe the row number and the second the column 
number), while the second table is a more common problem: a one-cell table (external, 
which has two Enter keys so you can see it better) that received another table inside it.
Convert Table to Text and Vice Versa
It is necessary that you understand that once a table exists in the document, you can 
always convert it to text (and conversely convert any text to table), and this double 
conversion process may sometimes be the only way to correctly re-create a table.
Figure 10-3.  This figure shows two different tables, both having tables inserted 
inside table cells. The second case shows a single-cell table with a table inserted 
inside it.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

491
To convert any table to text, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click anywhere inside the table to select it (or click the “+” square 
in the top left table corner to select the entire table);
	 2.	 In the Table Tools ➤ Layout tab that appears on Ribbon whenever 
a table is selected, click the Convert to Text command;
	 3.	 Microsoft Word will show the Convert Table to Text dialog box, 
asking how you want to separate the table values;
	 4.	 Choose the separator character to be used as cell content 
delimiter and press Enter to finish the conversation process.
Figure 10-4 shows what happens when we convert to text an empty 5×4 table using 
Tab stops as cell separator. Note that Word inserts n-1 tab stops to delimit each table cell 
value (where n = the table columns count), using a pilcrow paragraph mark to separate 
each table row.
Figure 10-4.  You can convert any table to text selecting the table and using the 
Table Tools ➤ Layout tab ➤ Convert to Text command. Microsoft Word will ask to 
select the cell separator character that must be used to separate each cell content 
(default is Tab).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

492
You are now in a position to appreciate the need to understand what a Tab character 
means. Looking to Figure 10-4, you must clearly understand that, although no text was 
inserted in the table, the three tab stops of these five paragraphs can represent a 5×4 
table (with the first cell content being at left of the first Tab character)!
To reconvert the selected text to a table, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Select just the text paragraphs that you want to convert to a table 
(no less, no more);
	 2.	 In the Insert tab of the Ribbon, click the Table ➤ Convert Text to 
Table… command;
	 3.	 Microsoft Word will show the Convert Text to Table dialog box, 
guessing the table dimensions and cell separator character it will 
consider to create the table, relative to the text you selected;
	 4.	 If everything is OK, press Enter to convert the text to a table.
Figure 10-5 shows how easy it was to reconvert the perfect 5×4 table, which was 
previously converted to text, using Tab stops as cell character separator.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

493
But if the table is too complex, like the ones shown in Figure 10-3, where a cell has 
a table inserted in it, the conversion of table to text may create paragraphs with very 
different quantities of Tab characters (or any other text separator character chosen, 
Figure 10-6), so that it may become impossible to reconstruct the original table design 
using the Table ➤ Convert Text to Table command (Figure 10-7).
Figure 10-5.  To convert text to table, select just the paragraphs you want to 
convert (no more, no less), click the Insert tab on the Ribbon, and apply the Table 
➤ Convert Text to Table command. Microsoft Word will show the Convert Text to 
Table dialog box, making a guess of which type of table it can create based on the 
selected text.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

494
Attention  If you have a table inserted in another table cell and want to convert it 
to text inside the cell, select just the inserted table before applying the Layout ➤ 
Convert to text command.
Figure 10-6.  Complex table designs may create very uneven text paragraphs, 
having different numbers of Tab stops (or any other text separator character used 
by the Convert Table to Text dialog box).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

495
Selecting and Deleting Tables and Cells
Once a table is inserted in any Microsoft Word document, it is not obvious how to delete 
it: it is very persistent in the document, neglecting to react to the so-obvious Delete key.
There are many strategies to delete a table from the document, using the mouse or 
the keyboard.
To delete a table using the mouse, you can follow these next steps:
	 1.	 Right-click any table cell, which makes a small floating toolbar 
appear above it.
	 2.	 In the floating tool bar, click Delete and select Delete table.
Figure 10-7.  When you try to reconvert uneven paragraphs to a table, the Convert 
Text to Table dialog box may not be capable of “guessing” which type of table you 
want to create, and the result may be a table quite different from the one that 
generated that type of text.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

496
Or use another method:
	 1.	 Click any table cell.
	 2.	 Click the small square at the top left table corner (the one with a 
“+” character) to select all table cells.
	 3.	 Right-click any selected table cell, and in the pop-up menu that 
appears, choose Delete table (Figure 10-8).
Figure 10-8.  To delete a table using the mouse, right-click any of its cells and select 
the Delete ➤ Delete Table command in the small toolbox that appears. Or you can 
click the small box with a “+” character in the top left table corner to first select the 
entire table, right-click any selected cell, and select Delete Table in the pop-up menu.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

497
To delete a table using the keyboard, you can
	 1.	 Insert one empty paragraph after the table;
	 2.	 Select the table and this empty paragraph;
	 3.	 Press Delete key.
Selecting All Table Cells to Delete a Table
Another way to delete a table from any document is by first selecting all table cells and 
then using Shift+Delete.
Once again, you can select all table cells by using different strategies:
•	
Click the first table cell and drag the mouse to select all its cells;
•	
Click the first table cell, press and hold Shift, and click the last table cell;
•	
Click any table cell and then click the small square in the small box at 
the top left table corner (the one with a “+” character);
•	
Alt+Double-click at left of any table row (point the mouse cursor to 
the left of any table row until it becomes a normal mouse pointer 
before performing the operation).
Once the table is selected, you can easily delete it pressing Shift+Delete (or 
eventually convert the table to text and delete the associated text).
Try for yourself!
Selecting a Single Cell
Use the mouse to select any amount of contiguous table cells and apply a desired format 
to them:
To select a single cell, anywhere in the table;
	 1.	 Point the mouse to the left of any cell (inside it) until the cursor 
turns into a small black arrow pointing up (indicating that just one 
cell will be selected);
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

498
	 2.	 Click to select just this cell (Figure 10-9).
Selecting and Table Rows and Columns
You can select an entire row or column by dragging the mouse or using the right mouse 
cursor for the task.
To select a row or column by dragging the mouse:
	 1.	 Click first cell row/column cell.
	 2.	 Drag the mouse to left (or down) to select the entire row  
(or column).
To select an entire row using the mouse cursor:
	 1.	 Point the mouse to the left of any row (outside the table) until the 
cursor changes to a regular mouse arrow.
	 2.	 Click to select the entire row (Figure 10-10).
Figure 10-10.  Point the mouse to the left of the first table column until it changes 
to a normal mouse arrow and click to select the entire row. Displace it toward the 
bottom of the row to show the “add row” circular control and click to insert a new 
row below it.
Figure 10-9.  Point the mouse inside any cell inner left side until it changes to a 
small black arrow and click to select it
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

499
To select an entire column using the mouse cursor:
	 1.	 Point the mouse to the top of any row (above the table) until the 
cursor changes to a small black arrow pointing down.
	 2.	 Click to select the entire column (Figure 10-11).
Inserting Table Rows, Columns, and Cells
You can insert rows, columns, and cells in any Microsoft Word table by using different 
methods using the mouse and menu commands. Let’s see them!
Using the Mouse with Table Handles
As Figures 10-10 and 10-11 explain, you can easily insert a new row or column in a 
table by selecting the desired row(s) or column(s), displacing the mouse to point to the 
bottom of the last row selected (or to the right of the last column border) to show the 
circular control with a “+” character, and clicking it.
The row(s) (or column(s)) will be inserted below (or to the right of) the last row (or 
column) selected (Figure 10-12).
Figure 10-11.  Point the mouse to the top of any table column, above the first table 
row until it changes to a small black arrow pointing down and click to select the 
entire column. Displace it toward the right column border row to show the “add 
column” circular control that, when clicked, inserts columns to its right.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

500
Attention  The number of rows or columns selected is equal to the number of 
rows or columns inserted.
Using Table ➤ Insert Command
Microsoft Word will also insert new cells to left or right of the current cell, allowing you to 
create tables that have different numbers of columns among its rows.
To insert a new cell in any table:
	 1.	 Right-click the cell that will be neighbor to the cell to be inserted 
and choose Insert ➤ Insert cells to show the Insert Cells dialog box;
	 2.	 In the Insert cells dialog box, select Shift cells left or Shift cells 
right option to insert a single cell;
	 3.	 Choose Insert entire row to insert a row below (or Insert entire 
column to insert a column to the right);
	 4.	 Press OK to make the desired insertion.
Figure 10-12.  Click the circular control (with the “+” character) that appears 
whenever you select one or more entire rows (or columns) and point to the bottom 
left (or top right) of the selection, to easily insert rows at the bottom (or columns to 
the right) of selection.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

501
Figure 10-13 shows how you can insert a cell to the left of a given cell using the Shift 
cells right option to create a table with an uneven number of columns.
Using Split Cells
Microsoft Word also allows inserting more cells in any table without displacing cells to 
the left or right by splitting a cell into the desired number of rows and columns.
If you split the cell into more than one row, all other cells of the same row will receive 
the same row height as the split cell.
Attention  If the text inside the split cell does not fit any more in the new cell 
width, the cell height will also be enlarged.
Figure 10-13.  Right-click any cell and select Insert ➤ Insert cells to insert a cell to 
the left or right of the selected cell (you can also insert a row above or a column to 
the left of it).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

502
To split a cell into rows and columns:
	 1.	 Select the desired cell.
	 2.	 Right-click it to show the pop-up menu.
	 3.	 In the pop-up menu, select Insert ➤ Split cells to show the Split 
cell dialog box.
	 4.	 Use the Number of columns and Number of rows controls to 
define how the cell may be split.
	 5.	 Press OK to split the cell.
Figure 10-14 shows what happens when the table shown in Figure 10-13 (which 
received a new cell in its first row) has its first cell (cell 1,1) split into two columns and 
two rows using the Split cells dialog box.
Figure 10-14.  Microsoft Word also allows inserting cells in a table using the Split 
Cells dialog box. In this case, the inserted cell will not displace the remaining cells’ 
position, but may impact on the row height of the split cell.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

503
Attention  As explained before, by splitting a table cell into two or more rows/
columns, you will create a complex table that, if it’s converted to text by using the 
Layout ➤ Convert Table to Text command, will not be able to be rebuilt it from its 
paragraphs using the Insert ➤ Table ➤ Convert Text to table command.
Merging Cells
You can also create tables having rows with different column counts by merging one or 
more of its cells into a single cell.
To merge table cells:
	 1.	 Select the cells you want to merge;
	 2.	 Right-click the selection and choose Merge cells.
If the merged cells had text inside them, the text of each cell will be separated by 
hidden paragraph characters, with each cell using text rows inside the merged cell.
Figure 10-15 merges the four cells produced in split cell 1,1 into a single cell again.  
It then merges all remaining row 1 cells and merges them again into one single cell 
again, creating a single, big cell in row 1 with two rows of text.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

504
Changing Cell, Column, or Row Dimensions
Once a table has been inserted in a Microsoft Word document page, you can use the 
mouse to change any individual cell, column, or row dimensions, independently or all  
at once.
Figure 10-15.  Use the Merge command to join individual cells into one. If these 
cells have some text, the text will be separated by hidden paragraph characters 
inside the merged cell.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

505
Follow these simple rules:
•	
To change any cell width or height you must first select the desired 
cell. The width of all other cells in the same column will not be 
affected, but the height of all cells of the same row will be.
•	
To change any column width, you must select the entire column or 
no cell at all.
•	
Whenever you change any cell width, the entire row width will be 
changed.
Changing Cell Dimensions
To change any cell width, you must first select the desired cell (point the mouse to its 
inner left side and click). Then you can drag its right border to change just the selected 
cell width, or its down border to change the entire row height (Figure 10-16).
Figure 10-16.  To change any cell’s width, select it by pointing the mouse to its 
inner left side (the cursor will change to a small black arrow) and then drag its 
right border to the desired dimension. Whenever you drag any cell bottom border, 
the entire row height will change.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

506
If you could not diminish the row height by dragging any of its cells’ bottom border, it 
is due to one of these reasons:
	 1.	 There are one or more hidden characters (like Enter, Shift Enter, 
Tab, etc.) inserted in one or more of its cells.
	 2.	 Any cell line spacing is greater than 1.
	 3.	 Any cell has Space Before and/or After defined.
To correct issue 1, click the Show/Hide tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon, and 
remove all unnecessary hidden characters.
To correct issues 2 and 3:
	 1.	 Select the entire row (point the mouse to the left of the row and 
click).
	 2.	 Change all cells Line Spacing = 1.
	 3.	 Set the Space Before and After = 0.
Changing Column Width
You can change the any column width by dragging its right border to a new position, but 
to affect all cells of the same column and make them have the same width you must either
•	
Not select any cell; or
•	
Select all cells of the entire column.
But since Microsoft Word tables can have cells of different widths, you may first need 
to adjust some cell widths so Microsoft Word can understand which cells belong to the 
desired column.
Note however that you can’t drag the right border of any cell or column past the left 
border of the column at its right.
Consider for example the complex table of Figure 10-17, which has different 
numbers of cells in each of its rows. Which cells belong to column 1, column 2, etc., 
according to Microsoft Word column counts?
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

507
To determine this, you must first point and click the mouse over any column cell 
(over the first row cell of each column) to realize which cells are selected in column 1, 
column 2, and so on.
Figure 10-18 shows that when the mouse is over the first cell of the first row 
(supposedly selecting cells from the first table column), Microsoft Word selects cells 
from columns 1 and 2. By clicking over the second cell of the first row (supposedly 
selecting cells from the second table column), the selection may take cells from the third 
column. And when clicking over the third cell of the first row (supposedly selecting cells 
from the last table column), this column and all remaining cells below it will be selected.
Figure 10-17.  A complex Microsoft Word table, made by splitting some of its cells to 
create rows with different numbers of cells. Which cell belongs to each table column?
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

508
Deleting Table Cells, Rows, and Columns
You can also delete a single cell, an entire row, or an entire column from a table. Note 
however that by deleting a single table you will create a hole in the table, which will 
oblige Microsoft Word to make a decision about what to do with the remaining cells of 
the row or column to which it belongs: shift all cells at its right to the left, or shift all cells 
at its bottom upward.
To delete a single cell, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Select the cell to be deleted (point the mouse to the cell’s inner left 
and click).
	 2.	 In the small context toolbar that appears, click Delete ➤ Delete 
Cells… to show the Delete Cells dialog box.
	 3.	 Select the method that Microsoft Word must use to treat the 
remaining cells at its left or below (if any):
•	
Shift cells left: all cells at left of the selected cell will be displaced 
to the left (leaving a hole at the right of the cell row).
•	
Shift cells up: all cells below the selected cell will be displaced up.
Figure 10-18.  When a table has uneven number of cells in its many rows, it may 
be difficult to select all cells of a column by just point-and-click. You need to first 
redefine some cells’ width before selecting each column individually.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

509
Attention  By selecting the Shift cells up option, since Microsoft Word can just 
leave holes in the right table column, if the deleted cell is not at the last table 
column, a new empty cell will be created in the same column and last table row.
Figure 10-19 shows an example of what happens when you delete a single cell and 
select either Shift Cells Right or Shift Cells Up.
To delete an entire row or column from a table, you can use one of these methods:
	 1.	 Select any cell from the row/column to be deleted.
	 2.	 Use the Delete ➤ Delete cells… command to show the Delete 
Cells dialog box.
	 3.	 Select either Delete entire row or Delete entire column to proceed.
Figure 10-19.  To delete a single cell or an entire row or column, select the cell first 
and right-click it to show the small tool bar from where you can click Delete ➤ 
Delete cells… command to show the Delete Cells dialog box; once that has been 
done, you can take the desired action.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

510
You can also use a faster method:
	 1.	 Select the entire row or column (point the mouse over the column 
or at left of the row and click).
	 2.	 Right-click the selection and choose Delete Row or Delete Column 
options (according to selection).
Table Alignment and Position
Every Microsoft Word table can be inserted as a text object in its own paragraph, or float 
above the page with text paragraphs flowing around it.
This versatile way of positioning tables on the page is indeed one of the biggest 
sources of difficulties that most people have with table formatting, because they did not 
even suppose that it could be done, and keep fighting with the document page flow.
To see how a table is inserted on the page:
	 1.	 Right-click the table and select Table Properties in the context 
menu (Figure 10-20).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

511
	 2.	 Use the Text wrapping area to define the table behavior regarding 
how the text wraps around it:
•	
None: the table is inserted as a text element having it own 
paragraph.
•	
Around: the table is floating over the document page, with text 
flowing around it.
	 3.	 Use the Alignment command to define the table position on the 
page (Left, Center, or Right aligned).
Note in the Table Properties dialog box that the Alignment option has an Indent from 
left option that is only enabled when Alignment = Left and Text wrapping = None, to 
allow defining the table distance from the page left margin.
Figure 10-20.  Right-click a table and select Table Properties to show the Table 
Properties dialog box from where you can use Text Wrapping to define that the 
table is a text object (None) or floats over the page (Around).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

512
Use these tips to better control a table inserted in your document:
•	
Use Text wrapping = None to make the table be inserted as a text 
element so you can better control the text that is above and below it.
•	
Click the small square at the top left table corner (the one with a 
“+” character) and drag the mouse to displace the table from the 
page’s left margin (changing the Indent from left option of the Table 
Properties dialog box).
•	
To give a standard cell size to all or some table cells (row height and/
or column width), select all desired table cells first and then use the 
other Table Properties dialog box tab controls.
Changing Table Row Size
It is not uncommon to find tables with different row heights—a formatting change that 
can be defined either by dragging any table row bottom border, or by inserting and 
removing Paragraph or Manual Line Breaks in some of its cells.
Whenever this happens, you need to check for two different options that can affect 
any table row height:
•	
Paragraph formatting options: select the entire table and check if 
all its cells have the same Line Spacing and Space Before and After 
options.
•	
The row height increase, defined in the Table Properties Row tab.
The Table Properties Row tab offers special controls that allow changing all selected 
rows’ height at once and the way a table will behave whenever it’s big enough to fit on a 
single page (Figure 10-21).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

513
Figure 10-21.  Use the Table Properties Row tab to define the selected cells’ row 
height and the way a table behaves when it is too big to fit on a single page
Attention  Any table row height is first defined by any of its cells’ Font and 
Paragraph properties. For better results use the same Font type and size, Line 
spacing = 1, and Space Before = After = 0 for all table cells.
•	
Specify height: this option defines the amount of vertical space 
added to a table cell.
•	
Row height is: use At Least to define a minimum cell height; use 
exactly to define a fixed cell height.
•	
Allow row to break across pages: uncheck this option to make each 
cell appear on a single document page.
•	
Repeat as header row at the top of each page: check this option 
to make a table that is big enough not to fit on a single page, 
automatically repeat its first row at the top of the next page (tables 
that fit on a page will not react to this option).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

514
Changing Table Column Size
Column widths can be easily controlled using by dragging the column right border, but 
to easily give to all column cells the same width, you will do better using the Paragraph 
Properties Column tab Preferred width control, which can be defined as table width 
percent or by specific inch value (Figure 10-22).
Figure 10-22.  Use the Table Properties Column tab to apply the same column 
width to all selected cells, using a table width percent value or a defined column 
width in inches
Attention  To easily adjust a cell column width according to the column cells’ 
content, use the same Microsoft Excel approach: double-click the column right 
border to make Microsoft Word adjust the column width to the widest column 
content.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

515
Changing Cell Dimensions and Vertical Alignment
Use the Table Properties Cell tab to define selected cells’ width and vertical alignment 
(since cell height may be defined by another cell of the same row or to the options set in 
the Table Properties Row tab).
Figure 10-23.  Use the Table Properties Cell tab to define selected cells’ width and 
vertical text alignment
Attention  These options can also be set using the Table Tools Layout tab 
controls, as you will see in the next section.
Use the Table Properties Alt Text to insert a table text description that can be used 
by people with vision or cognitive impairments.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

516
Formatting Tables
Besides the Table Properties dialog box, Microsoft Word offers many different tools to 
format a table using the Table Tools Layout and Design tabs of the Ribbon that appears 
when a table is selected.
This section will try to make sense of many different ways of changing a table 
appearance—and some problems that may arise from tweaking these options—by using 
one of the default tables that can be easily created using the Insert ➤ Table ➤ Quick 
Tables… option (it will use the “With Subheads 1” quick table, Figure 10-24).
Attention  The Insert ➤ Table ➤ Quick Tables command has some interesting 
ready-made tables that are worth exploring to understand how to use the rich 
resources offered by Microsoft Word to format tables.
Figure 10-24.  Use the Insert ➤ Table ➤ Quick Tables command to insert a “With 
Subheads 1” table in any document to follow the next exercise.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

517
Table Styles
Figure 10-25 shows the “With Subheads 1” quick table selected in a Microsoft Word 
document page with the Table Tools Design tab selected. Note that it offers on its left 
side the Table Style Options area, which allows defining which type of table styles can be 
applied to the selected table, with the Style Gallery showing the default Table Style set 
applied to format it.
As you can see, any table can have different styles applied to specific rows and 
columns: the Header (first row) and Total row (last row), First and Last column, and 
Banded Rows and Columns (creating a vertical or horizontal “zebra” effect in alternating 
rows and columns).
This is possible because Microsoft Word allows you to create a Table Style that has 
these substyles (header and total row, first and last column, banded rows and columns) 
to allow an easy customization of any table, which is the work done by the Table Styles 
gallery.
Figure 10-25.  This is the “With Subheads 1” quick table created by Microsoft Word 
using the Insert ➤ Table ➤ Quick Tables command.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

518
Whenever you expand the Table Style gallery, what you see is an enormous variation 
in how these substyles can be defined so they can be easily applied to the selected table.
Note however that not every style set implements all substyles. Figure 10-26 shows 
how the “With Subheads 1” table became after it received the “Grid Table 2 - Accent 1” 
style set, which implements the Banded Rows and Columns, and had the Banded Rows 
option selected in the Table Tools Design tab.
Figure 10-26.  By using the Table Styles gallery you can select different style sets 
that may use the substyles for header and total rows, first and last column, banded 
rows and columns. The Grid Table2 - Accent 1 style set implements the Banded 
Rows and Columns, which allow you to apply a shaded effect to the background of 
alternate table rows.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

519
You can inspect how this style set was built: click the small arrow located in the 
bottom right corner of the Table Styles gallery to expand it and select the Modify Table 
Style… command, which will open Microsoft Word Modify Style for the selected table 
style (Figure 10-27).
The Modify Style dialog box for a style set is the best interface to quickly format all 
table cells, because it offers the Apply formatting to list, from where you can select what 
must be changed in the table style (Figure 10-28).
Figure 10-27.  Expand the Table Styles gallery and select Modify Table Style… 
command to show Microsoft Word Modify Style dialog box for the selected table style

Use these tips whenever you need to use the Modify Style dialog box to change any 
table appearance:
•	
Whole table: select this option to make adjustments to the Font and 
Paragraph options of all table cells.
•	
Header row and Total row: select these options to make adjustments 
to the first and last table rows.
Figure 10-28.  Use the Modify Style dialog box “Apply formatting to” list to select 
what must be changed in the Table Style. You can define options for the Whole 
table, and for the format of specific rows and columns.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

521
•	
Odd and Even banded rows and columns: use these options to 
define the alternate color used in odd and even table rows and 
columns (if needed).
•	
Top and Bottom Left and Right cells: use these options to make 
specific formatting options for table corner cells.
Although you can use the Styles window, New Style button to create a new table 
style, you will do better by selecting an existing table style from the style pane, applying 
the desired changes, and then saving it with a new name.
Follow these steps to create a new table style:
	 1.	 Create a new empty table (which will be formatted with the Table 
Grid style set), or select any existing table in your document.
	 2.	 Expand the Table Style gallery and select the Modify Style… option 
to show the Modify Style dialog box (see Figures 10-27 and 10-28).
	 3.	 In the Modify Style dialog box, set these options:
•	
Name: name the new style you want to create.
•	
Style based on: select Table Normal for use an empty style or any 
other table style already saved (and available in the Table Style 
gallery).
•	
Apply formatting to: use each option to define the appearance 
of header and total rows, first and last column, odd and even 
banded rows.
	
Use the font, size, and Format button options to set each possible 
substyle (you will do better by making a single choice for Whole 
table option).
	 4.	 Close the Modify Style dialog box to save your new style.
The new table style create will appear in the Table Style gallery at the same table style 
group from which the Style based on option was defined (you may need to expand the 
Style Gallery and point the mouse for a similar preview to find it on the list).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

522
Attention  Since the Modify Style dialog box Style based on option doesn’t have 
a “No Style” option (as you found for paragraph, character or list styles), there is 
no way to create a new table style that is not based on the Table Normal style, 
because every table style has Style based on = Table Normal. This way, whenever 
you create a new style based on another style, you are indeed cascade inheriting 
Table Normal, which also inherits the Normal style.
Normal Style Inheritance
The most common disturbing effect in table formatting comes from Normal style 
inheritance.
Look to Figure 10-28 and note that the Grid Table 2 - Accent 1 table style is based on 
Table Normal style. And even if you could shake Microsoft Word upside down, you could 
not find any trace of the Table Normal style to change any of its settings, like the “Style 
based on = Normal” style.
Yes, it’s true. Every table style inherits the Table Normal style which by itself inherits 
the Normal style, meaning that any change made to the Normal style will be instantly 
reflected in all table styles and consequently seen in all document tables formatted with 
them, respecting the previously explained principle that a global format change cannot 
change a local format change.
You can make a simple experiment about how a simple Normal style change can 
disturb the “With Subtitles 1” quick table, by following these next steps:
	 1.	 Right-click the Normal style in the Style Gallery found in the 
Home tab of the Ribbon and select Modify… command to show 
the Modify Style dialog box.
	 2.	 In the Modify Style dialog box for the Normal style, click Format 
button and choose Paragraph to show the Paragraph dialog box.
	 3.	 In the Paragraph dialog box Indentation area, set this option:
Special = First line = 0.49 (Figure 10-29).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

523
	 4.	 Close the Paragraph dialog box and close the Modify dialog box to 
add a first line indentation to the Normal style and all paragraphs 
based on it.
Now, every “With Subtitle 1” quick table cell (and every other document table) has a 
First line indent = 0.49, which completely affected the table formatting options. Figure 10-30  
shows how this simple change affected the table Header row (first row), where the third 
column header (Graduated students) doesn’t fit anymore on a single row.
Figure 10-29.  Use the Modify Style dialog box to show the Paragraph dialog box 
and add an Indentation = Special = First line = 0.49
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

524
Also note that every other table cell now has a 0.49 first line indentation, which 
makes its values further apart from the cell left border.
Attention  The only way you can avoid the Normal style inheritance in table cells 
is by not using a table style. You will need to create your own Paragraph styles to 
be applied to specific table rows (like TableTitle, TableFirstRow, TableLastRow, and 
TableCells). All of them must set property Style based on = No style, and they must 
be manually applied to the desired table rows.
Figure 10-30.  The First line Indentation = 0.49 of the Normal style will be cascade 
inherited by any table style because they are all based on Table Normal (which is 
based on Normal style)
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

525
Formatting Row Height
Some formatting options applied to table cells—or the ones inherited from changes to 
Normal style—can pose difficulties in keeping (or changing) a table format, which is 
especially true regarding table row height, which can be affected by font or paragraph 
formatting, and must be manipulated to force the entire table to fit onto a single 
document page.
The “With Subheads 1” quick table can be used as an example because it has no 
Paragraphs or Line breaks inserted in any of its cells (check the Show/Hide tool in the 
Home tab of the Ribbon and see for yourself), but it does have widely spaced rows whose 
height cannot be lessened by dragging any row bottom border up or by changing the cell 
Height option found in the Cell Size area of the Table Tools Layout tab (Figure 10-31).
Whenever this happens, the problem you face to change the table row height resides 
in font or formatting options imposed on specific cells, which affect the entire row 
height, probably arising from changing some Paragraph options, like Space Before or 
After and Line spacing for one or more row cells.
By inspecting the “With Subheads 1” quick table column cells Paragraph options,  
you will realize that the first table column has no formatting options set (Line spacing =  
Single, Space Before = After = 0), but its second, third, and fourth columns have some 
Figure 10-31.  You cannot lessen any “With Subheads 1” quick table row height by 
dragging any row bottom border up. It is an indication that at least one row cell 
has a different Paragraph Line Spacing or Space Before or After set.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

526
cells with a Space before option set (Line spacing = Multiple = 1.15, Space After = 10 pt, 
Figure 10-32).
To have greater control over the table row height, you need to act on cell Paragraph 
formatting by following these steps:
	 1.	 Click the small square at the top left table corner (the one with a 
“+” character) to select all table rows.
	 2.	 Show the Paragraph dialog box and clear all the options that can 
produce such odd results:
•	
Indentation Left = 0
•	
Indentation Right = 0
Figure 10-32.  The “With Subheads 1” quick table has some cells that set Line 
spacing = 1.15 and Space After = 10 pt, which avoids reducing some of its rows’ 
height
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

527
•	
Indentation Special = None
•	
Spacing Before = 0
•	
Spacing After = 0
•	
Line spacing = Single
Figure 10-33 shows the final effect on “With Subheads 1” quick table, which now has 
all its rows with the smaller possible height for the font size selected.
Formatting Column Width
Another simple action commonly performed in table formatting is to change column 
width to make the table fit the page width, or to give it a better appearance.
Figure 10-33.  The easiest way to diminish a table vertical length that has no 
unused Paragraph or Line breaks in its cells is to select the entire table and remove 
all Paragraph options that can disturb cell formatting: Indentation Left = Right = 0, 
Special = None, Space Before = After = 0 and Line spacing = Single
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

528
You can make changes to the table column widths by using different techniques:
•	
Double-click the right border on any column width (to adjust the 
column width to the widest cell content).
•	
Drag each column right border to the desired width (Figure 10-34).
Figure 10-34.  Double-click a table column right border to make its width fit the 
widest cell content
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

529
•	
Use the Cell Size area commands of the Table Tools Layout tab 
(Figure 10-35).
Figure 10-35.  Use the Cell Size area controls of the Table Tools Layout tab to 
define table column widths
The Cell Size area of the Table Tools Layout tab of the Ribbon has five controls to 
allow you to adjust the column widths of a table:
•	
AutoFit: allows automatically adjusting column width and row height 
according to current font and paragraph settings:
•	
AutoFit Contents: adjust column width, row height to the 
smallest possible values that fit cell content (Figure 10-36).
•	
AutoFit Window: adjust table width to page width and distribute 
column widths.
•	
AutoFit Column Width: same as double-clicking the column 
right border, adjusting column width to fit the widest column cell 
content.
•	
Cell Height and Width: show current cell height and width and 
allow defining a numeric value for both sizes (using the current ruler 
measurement unit).
•	
Distribute rows and Distribute columns: make the selected rows/
columns receive the same width.
The easiest way to make a table adjust its columns and rows to use the smallest cell 
height and width is by using AutoFit ➤ AutoFit Contents command (Figure 10-36).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

530
But if want your table to spread its cells across the entire page width (between 
page left and right margins), use AutoFit ➤ AutoFit Window command (Figure 10-37). 
The resulting table will have different column widths, according to the widest column 
content.
Figure 10-36.  Use the AutoFit ➤ AutoFit Contents command to make the best row 
height and column width adjusments possible to a table
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

531
To make some table columns have the same width, select them all (point the mouse 
over the first column until it turns into a small black down arrow and drag through 
the columns) and use the Distribute Columns command found in the Cell Size area 
of the Table Tools Layout tab (or right-click selected columns and choose Distribute 
Columns). Note however that this command may not make the best width adjustment 
for all columns, as you can see in Figure 10-38, where the 3rd column title does not fit on 
a single row).
Figure 10-37.  Use the AutoFit ➤ AutoFit Window command to make a table 
adjust its content to the page width. Note however that it has different column 
widths.

533
Fixing Tables That Don’t Fit on a Page
Sometimes a table seems not to fit on a page, spreading its columns past the right page 
margin, and you don’t know how to access these out-of-bounds cells to fix the table 
column widths (Figure 10-24).
Figure 10-39.  This table column is hugging the right page margin. Which size 
does it have?
Whenever such a problem occurs in a document you can easily fix it by using two 
different methods:
	 1.	 If the table is simple, without merged cells, convert it to text and 
reconvert the text to table (as explained earlier in this chapter).
	 2.	 For any table (especially the complex ones, full of merged cells), 
use Microsoft Word Draft view (located in the Views area of the 
View tab of the Ribbon) and then change the column size.
Microsoft Word Draft view is a special view that does not show the page document 
margins and the gray document area that surrounds it: the white page representation. 
It shows the text flowing as older DOS text processors, using a dashed line to indicate a 
page break, and allows viewing entire tables no matter how wide they are. Figure 10-40 
shows Figure 10-39 table as it appears in Microsoft Word Draft view.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

534
Figure 10-40.  Use Microsoft Word Draft view to show all document width  
(the real document width used by the table that do not fits on page width), 
disregarding the page margins. This figure show how the entire table in  
Figure 10-­39 appears in Draft view.
To fix the table width you need to interact with the table formatting, changing:
•	
each table column width (select the entire table and double-click any 
column right border line to make an autofit to the column content).
•	
the table font size and font (use a smaller font size so the text fits 
within the desired table limits).
You will need to begin changing the margins of the first columns to the left, one by 
one, until the right column right margin fits inside the page margin (inside the white 
scale of the ruler). Then use the tools discussed in the previous section to adjust the table 
width (Figure 10-41).
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

535
Cell Margins
Cell Margins is a command found in the Alignment area of the Table Tools Layout tab 
(see Figure 10-35) that allows adding margins and a second border to all table cells, 
which sometimes confuses the Microsoft Word user about where its odd formatting 
comes from (I myself have been confused by its strange effects at times).
Whenever you click the Cell Margins command, Microsoft Word will show the Table 
Options dialog box (Figure 10-42), which can be also evoked from the Table Properties ➤ 
Table ➤ Options… command button (see Figure 10-20).
Figure 10-41.  To fix an overly wide table using Microsoft Word Draft view, drag 
each right border of the first left columns to the left, until you have space to drag the 
right margin of the rightmost column so it fits inside the page margins. You may 
eventually need to change font size.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

536
Figure 10-42.  Use the Table Options dialog box, evoked by using the Table 
Properties dialog box Options… command button, or by clicking the Cell Margins 
control found in the Alignment area of the Table Tools Layout tab.
•	
Default cell margins: use these options to add horizontal (Left and 
Right) and vertical (Top and Bottom) space from cell borders (by 
changing the Top and Bottom options you will increase the row 
height).
•	
Default cell spacing: check Allow spacing between cells and define a 
space amount to add a white border around each table cell.
•	
Automatically resize to fit contents: checked by default; table row 
height and column widths are automatically resized whenever you 
insert or delete text in a cell.
Figure 10-43 shows what happened to the “With Subheads 1” quick table after it 
received the AutoFit ➤ AutoFit Window and Distribute Columns commands and had the 
Allow spacing between cells = 0.08 checked in the Table Options dialog box. Note how 
the cell border now has a white space to separate each cell.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

537
Attention  The lesson here is quite simple: whenever you need to remove the odd 
white space found between table cells, use the Cell Margins command to evoke 
the Table Options dialog box and uncheck the Allow spacing between cells option.

command found in the Alignment area of the Table Tools Layout tab (and in the

538
Alignment and Text Direction
The Alignment area of the Table Tools Layout tab offers interesting controls that allow 
defining the text orientation and how text will be horizontally and vertically aligned 
inside a table cell (Figure 10-44). The alignment controls are all self-explanatory and 
positioned according to the horizontal and vertical effect they apply to the cells. The Text 
Direction just needs a click for its results to be seen.
By using these controls along with the Merge cells and controlling table column 
width, you can produce interesting table formatting options, which will be the objective 
of the exercise found in the next section.
Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to teach how you can use the knowledge gained so far 
with the aid of Microsoft Word Table Tools tab to quickly format a table so it can fit on a 
single page.
Extract the “Table Formatting Exercise.docx” document from the Chapter10.zip file 
and note that it has a single text page, whose first paragraphs were extracted from the 
US NCES (National Center for Education Statistics) web site (Figure 10-45), from this 
Internet address:

Inspect the Normal Style
Your first step in this exercise is to inspect the document Normal style, because it will be 
inherited by any table inserted in the document.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Right-click Normal style in the Style gallery in the Home tab of the 
Ribbon and choose Modify… command to show the Modify Style 
dialog box.
	 2.	 In the Modify Style dialog box, look to the Normal style 
description (or click Format ➤ Paragraph) and note that it has 
these properties set:
•	
Indentation = Special = First line = 0.49.
•	
Line spacing = 1.5
	 3.	 Close the Modify Style dialog box.

Insert “With Subheads 2” Quick Table
Go to the end of the “Table Formatting Exercise.docx” document and insert a copy of 
“With Subheads 2” quick table, by following these steps:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+End to go to the end of the document.
	 2.	 Use the Table ➤ Quick Table command found in the Insert tab of 
the ribbon to insert a “With Subheads 2” quick table at the cursor 
position.
	 3.	 Note that the table inherited the Normal style formatting, applying 
it in all of its cells (First line indent = 0.49, Line spacing = 1.5), 
making the table spread to the next document page (Figure 10-46).
Figure 10-46.  The “With Subheads 2” quick table spread through two document 
pages because its cells inherited a First line indentation = 0.49 and Line spacing = 
1.5 from Normal style

541
Remove Table Paragraph Formatting
To try to make the “With Subheads 2” quick table fit on a single page, remove all 
paragraph formatting properties inherited from Normal style, by following these steps:
	 1.	 Click the small square at the top left table corner (the one with a 
“+” character) to select all table rows.
	 2.	 Show the Paragraph dialog box and clear all Normal style 
inherited properties:
•	
Indentation Special = None
•	
Line spacing = Single.
	 3.	 Close the Paragraph dialog box and note that the table now fits on 
a single document page (Figure 10-47).
Figure 10-47.  Select all “With Subheads 2” table cells, show the Paragraph dialog 
box, and type a 0 (zero) value on all its properties to default values
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

542
Format the Table
We will now format the “With Subheads 2” table by using the Table Tools Layout 
tab and some techniques approached in this chapter, by removing the subheads 
“Undergraduate” and “Graduate” from the original position (on a line above their 
contents), and putting them aside, rotated on the first table column at left of its content 
(Figure 10-48).
To choose such formatting options, you will need to take these intermediate steps in 
the table:
	 1.	 Insert a new first table column.
	 2.	 Drag Subheads to a new position in the first table column.
	 3.	 Remove old subhead lines.
	 4.	 Merge and rotate subhead cells.
	 5.	 Make table cells fit their contents.
Figure 10-48.  Change the “With Subheads 2” quick table appearance using the 
Table Tools Layout tab to rotate its Subheads into the first table column
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

543
Insert a New First Table Column and Drag Subheads
To make table subheads appear rotated in the first table cell, we need to insert a new first 
table column by following these steps:
	 1.	 Point the mouse over the first table column (cursor changes for a 
small black arrow pointing down) and click to select it.
	 2.	 In the floating tool bar that appears, select Insert ➤ Insert Left 
(Figure 10-49) to insert a new first table column.
	 3.	 Click the View Gridlines option found in Table area of the Table 
Tools Layout tab to make Microsoft Word show the table cells.
	 4.	 Select the “Undergraduate” text in cell (2,2) and drag it to cell (3,1) 
(to the left of first cell “Cedar University” in cell (3,2)).
	 5.	 Select the “Graduate” text in cell (8,2) and drag it to cell (9,1) (to the 
left of second cell “Cedar University” in cell (9,2)) (Figure 10-50).

545
Delete Unused Rows
After the subheads were moved to the new first table column, the “With Subheads 2” quick 
table has two empty rows (rows 2 and 8) that can be deleted, by following these steps:
	
1.	 Point the mouse to the left of row 2 first cell (mouse cursor will 
change to a normal pointing arrow) and click to select the entire row.
	 2.	 In the floating toolbar that appears, click Delete ➤ Delete Rows 
command to delete the selected row.
	 3.	 Repeat steps 1 and 2 to delete the empty row above the “Graduate” 
cell (row 7, after the row deletion) (Figure 10-51).
Merge and Rotate Subhead Cells
The subhead cells positioned in the first table column must now be merged with all the 
empty cells below them, so the text can be rotated.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click cell (2,1) with the “Undergraduate” text and drag the mouse 
down to select all empty cells below it (cells (2,1) to (61)).
	 2.	 Use the Merge Cells command found in the Merge area of the 
Table Tools Layout tab to merge them in a single cell.
Figure 10-51.  Select the unused rows (point the mouse to its left side and click) 
and use the Delete ➤ Delete Rows command to remove them from the table

546
	 3.	 Repeat steps 1 and 2 to merge the “Graduate” cell with all empty 
cells below it (Figure 10-52).
	 4.	 Select both merged cells and double-click the Text Direction tool 
to make them rotate 45 degrees upward (Figure 10-53).

547
Adjust Table Cells
The table is now produced but needs adjustment in its cells, which can be easily 
achieved by using the AutoFit and Cell Margins tools.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 To quickly adjust all table cells for the best fit row height and 
column width, use the AutoFit ➤ AutoFit Contents command found 
in the Cell Size area of the Table Tools design tab (Figure 10-54).
Figure 10-53.  Use the Text Direction tool to rotate upward the merged subhead 
cells in column 1

The table formatting is ready, and the table fits on the first document page!
Attention  Extract “Table Formatting Exercise, Done.docx” document from 
Chapter10.zip file for a final version of this table exercise.
Table Calculation
Most Microsoft Word users don’t even imagine that it is possible to make calculations 
using data inserted in a document table cell using the Formula command found in the 
Data area of the Table Tools, Layout tab of the Ribbon (see Figure 10-44).
When the cursor is positioned in a table cell and you click the Formula tool, 
Microsoft Word will show the Formula dialog box, from where you can type a formula 
or use the Paste function list to select a common, predefined function to create a table 
formula (Figure 10-58).
The Formula dialog box has these options:
•	
Formula: must begin with the “=” operator (without the quotes) and 
operate over identifiable document cells or bookmarks.
•	
Number format: use to select the format to present the formula 
result.
Figure 10-58.  Use the Formula dialog box to build a formula in any table cell with 
the aid of the Paste function list, from where you can select different and popular 
math functions
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

552
•	
Paste function: use to select one of the functions available to insert it 
in the Formula control.
Attention  It is out of the scope of this book to approach each possible function 
available from the Paste function list. Perform an Internet search on the desired 
function to obtain more explanation about its syntax and return result.
Using Positional Arguments in Formulas
The formulas created by the Formula dialog box can relate one or all table cells, 
other formula results, and any field codes inserted in the document that can be 
mathematically evaluated.
You can use functions AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, PRODUCT, and SUM to operate over 
table cells surrounding the formula using the self-explanatory positional arguments 
LEFT, RIGHT, ABOVE, and BELOW.
For example, the bottom right table cell (last table cell) can sum all cells in the same 
row above it using this formula:
=SUM(ABOVE)
Attention  Microsoft Word will sum all cells using positional arguments, 
discarding all non-numerical values found in the positional range direction. To 
avoid formula errors, it is advised to insert a 0 (zero) value in all empty cells.
You can use the Microsoft Word list separator (“,’” for United States Windows 
version) to sum different positional arguments. For example, the next formula sums 
all values to the left and above the selected cell:
=SUM(LEFT,ABOVE)
Using RnCn or A1 Reference Style in Formulas
Use the RnCn Excel style reference to relate specific table cells in a formula, where n 
is the row or column number. Table 10-1 show how to use the RnCn syntax to relate to 
different table cells.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

553
For example, you can sum all cells from row 10 using this formula:
=SUM(R10)
Or you can sum all cells from row 2, column 1, to row 10, column 4 using this formula:
=SUM(R2C1:R10C4)
You can also use Microsoft Excel A1 reference style in table formulas, where each 
table column is associated to a consecutive letter and each table row to a consecutive 
number. Table 10-2 shows how to use the A1 style to relate different table cells.

Or you can sum all table cells of a 4×4 table using this formula:
=SUM(A1:D4)
Updating Table Formulas
Whenever a formula is inserted in a table cell, Microsoft Word will try to update and 
present its value using the Number format defined by the Formula dialog box (if any).
If you change data in any cell that affects the formula scope, the formula will not be 
automatically calculated: you must manually update the affected formula(s) using the F9 
function key.
To update:
•	
Just one cell: select the cell table that contains the affected formula 
and press F9.
•	
Entire table: select all table cells and press F9.
•	
Entire document: press Ctrl+A and press F9.
Attention  To show a cell formula instead of its value, use the same strategy 
explained before to alternate between Microsoft Word field values and field code: 
press Alt+F9 function key to alternate between cell value and cell formula.
Exercise 2
The objective of this exercise is to learn how to insert and copy formulas in a Microsoft 
Word document table to make data calculations.
Extract the “Table Formulas Exercise.docx” document from the Chapter10.zip file, open 
it in Microsoft Word, and note that it has a changed version of the “With Subheads 1” quick 
table which received a Total Students column to its right (Figure 10-59), where we must 
insert formulas to sum the New Students and Graduating Students columns for each row.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

555
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the first empty cell of the Total Students column (cell F2  
or R2C6).
	 2.	 Click the Formula tool found in the Data area of the Table Tools 
Layout tab of the Ribbon to show the Formula dialog box and set 
these options:
•	
In Number format select #.##0 option (this format always shows 
a zero; add a thousand separator character, if necessary).
•	
In Paste function list, select SUM function. This will automatically 
create the =SUM(LEFT) formula that uses the LEFT positional 
argument to sum all left cells values (Figure 10-60).
Figure 10-59.  This is the “Table Formulas Exercise.docx” document, which you 
can extract from Chapter10.zip file; in this file, you can practice inserting formulas 
in the Total Students column to add the New and Graduating students of each row.
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

556
	 3.	 Click OK to close the Formula dialog box; insert and evaluate the 
formula in cell F2 (Figure 10-61).
Figure 10-61.  Note that the =SUM(LEFT) formula inserted in cell F2 evaluates 
correctly because it just operates over the two numbers found in row 2: the New 
and Graduating students column cells.
Figure 10-60.  Use the Paste function list to select the SUM function and 
automatically create the =SUM(LEFT) formula in the Formula text box
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

557
	 4.	 Press Alt+F9 to alternate cell value to cell formula and note that cell 
F2 has the { =SUM(LEFT) \# "#.##0" } formula (Figure 10-­62).
	 5.	 Press Alt+F9 again to return to cell value and reevaluate cell F2 
formula.
	 6.	 Select cell F2 value (213) and press Ctrl+C to copy it to Clipboard.
	 7.	 Select all other empty cells of the Total Students columns and 
press Ctrl+V to paste the same formula (the calculated value of 
213 will be repeated in each cell, Figure 10-­63).
Figure 10-63.  Select cell F2 value, press Ctrl+C to copy to Clipboard, select all 
empty cells of Total Students column, and press Ctrl+V to paste the same formula. 
Values will not be updated.
Figure 10-62.  Press Alt+F9 to alternate from cell value to cell formula and note 
that cell F2 now has the { =SUM(LEFT) \# "#.##0" } formula
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

558
	 8.	 Considering that the cells where the formula was pasted are still 
selected, press F9 to force recalculation.
	 9.	 All but the last cell in the Total Student column will now 
recalculate to the right values (Figure 10-64).
	 10.	 Note that the last table cell (cell F12, the bottom right cell) had 
incorrectly added the Change column (90) to the total number of 
New and Graduating students (1,998).
	 11.	 Click cell F12 to select it and click the Formula tool found in the 
Data area of the Table Tools Layout tab to show the Formula 
dialog box with the cell inserted in this table cell.
	 12.	 In the Formula dialog box, delete the Formula text box and insert 
this formula to sum the New and Graduating students for row 12:
=C12+D12
Figure 10-64.  Press F9 in the cells that received the paste formula to update their 
values. They will now reflect the correct values
Chapter 10  Formatting Tables

559
	 13.	 Close the Formula dialog box to insert the new formula and 
evaluate the result (Figure 10-65).
The document table now has all formulas necessary to correctly calculate the sum of 
New and Graduating students for all its rows.
Try to change some values, select the entire table, and press F9 to recalculate it! Try 
for yourself!!!
Conclusion
In this chapter you have had the opportunity to understand how Microsoft Word inserts 
and formats tables in its documents.
Among other things, you learned how to convert a table to text (and vice versa), 
how to select, insert, and delete rows and columns, and how to use the many interfaces 
available to manage table properties.
Not all table formatting options were explored in this chapter, not only due to the 
huge number of tools offered by Microsoft Word in the Table Tools Design and Layout 
tab, but also due to the lengths of this chapter and book, which have already surpassed 
all initial expectations.
Figure 10-65.  Click cell C12 and click the Formula tool to evoke the Formula 
dialog box for this cell. Change cell F12 formula to =C12+D12 to correctly sum the 
New and Graduating students for row 12.

560
Among them we can cite the Borders area and the Shading tools found in Table Tools 
Design tab, along with the Draw, Rows & Columns, and Data area tools found in the 
Table Tools Layout tab.
I will leave these tools as an exercise to the reader to explore to master Microsoft 
Word table formatting.

CHAPTER 11
Creating and Using 
Templates
A template is a special kind of file that allows you to start a new document using a 
predefined set of formatting options. Templates are available for the main Microsoft 
Office applications (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), and you can also create them to allow 
customization of different documents with the same appearance.
In this chapter you will learn about how you can download, use, and create your own 
Microsoft Word Template files. All the documents cited in this chapter can be found by 
downloading the Chapter11.zip file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
What Is a Template?
A Microsoft Word template is indeed a common .DOCX document that has the extension 
changed to .DOTM to allow it to be treated differently by the program (the.dotm file 
extension means DOcument Template with Macros).
By default, Microsoft Word doesn’t open a template: it uses its structure to create a 
new, unnamed document that is a perfect copy of the original. Yes! A template is a kind 
of document that can make copies of itself without disturbing its own content.
Whenever you open Microsoft Word 2016, it will show you the Start Up screen  
(also called New window) from where you can decide which template will be used to 
create a new, unnamed document (Figure 11-1).

564
This window is opened by default due to the Show the Start screen when this 
application starts option found in the General ➤ Start up Options area of the Word 
Options dialog box (displayed by the File ➤ Options command, Figure 11-2).
Attention  By unchecking the Show the Start screen when this application 
starts option, Microsoft Word will immediately show a new, empty copy of a blank 
document when it is opened.
Figure 11-1.  The Microsoft Word New window shows many different templates 
from where you can create a new document
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

565
Types of Word Templates
The New window (shown by clicking File ➤ New command) offers different types of 
Templates that can be used to save time when you have a need to create well-formatted 
special-purpose documents. It is also a source of inspiration and possibilities that you 
can achieve by mastering Microsoft Word features.
Figure 11-2.  Uncheck the Show the Start screen when this application starts 
option, which isfound in the General ➤ Start up option area of the Word Options 
dialog box ( found using File ➤ Options)
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

566
Try for example the “Take a Tour” template: a document that gives basic guidance 
about how to take the most from Microsoft Word 2016, focusing on the use of the “Tell 
me what you want to do” option, which is always shown in the Ribbon. Also note that 
although you opened the “Take a Tour” template, Microsoft Word document window 
shows Document1 as the document name (Figure 11-3).
There are a lot of different Microsoft Word templates to choose from, and they can be 
divided into three main groups:
•	
Empty templates: creates empty documents to work with (as the 
New Document.dotm and Single Spaced Blank.dotm shown in 
Figure 11-1).
Figure 11-3.  The Take a Tour template is a simple document prepared to guide 
the user to make the most of the Tell Me tool always visible above the Ribbon’s right 
corner
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

567
•	
Templates with page and style formatting: shows special formatting 
pages, with graphic and design elements, from where you can type text.
•	
Templates with formatting and Controls: shows documents 
that have special page and style formatting options, and also have 
Controls that guide the user to where the information must be typed.
To understand the different types of templates, you must open and try them to see 
what they offer, how they were formatted, and how they work. Let’s try.
Templates with Formatting and Controls
Many templates found in the New window have both page and style formatting and 
use Microsoft Word Controls to guide the user to insert the information in the right 
document places.
Since the New window changes the Templates as you select them, let’s have a  
simple introduction about Controls using the Suggested Search: Design Sets ➤ Invoice  
(Red design) template (Figure 11-4).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

568
By double-clicking the Invoice (Red design) template and clicking Create:
	 1.	 Microsoft Word will download it from the Office site and store it in 
the default Templates Folder
	 2.	 Will create a new, empty copy of it so you can work with the 
document, insert your own data, and save it wherever you want 
on your hard disk, leaving the original template untouched 
(Figure 11-5)
Figure 11-4.  Select different Microsoft Word templates using the Suggested Search 
option. This figure shows the Design Sets category, with the Invoice (Red design) 
template appearing as the first business template.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

569
Figure 11-5.  The Invoice (Red design) template opened as Document3 (see the 
title bar) inside Microsoft Word. It uses tables to insert information in the page  
and footer.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

570
Explore the document using these tips:
•	
Press Tab key and note how the Invoice (Red design) document copy 
moves the focus between its controls, in the order they appear in the 
document.
•	
Check that document has three tables: for the invoice header, Invoice 
details, and company contact (in page footer).
•	
Click any document table and check the View Gridlines option in the 
Table area of the Table Tools Layout tab to see table cell borders.
•	
Click the red “Company” title and note that it becomes grayed as a 
clear indication that it is a Document Control, where you can insert 
text (the Company name, Figure 11-6).
•	
Try the Date control and note that it expands and shows a Calendar 
control, from where you can select the date (Figure 11-7).
Figure 11-6.  The Invoice (Red design) template uses Microsoft Word Controls to 
allow inserting information, like the company name
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

571
How Microsoft Word Controls Work
The Invoice (Red design) template shown in Figures 11-6 and 11-7 allow to insert 
information in specific document places using Microsoft Word Controls.
Such controls are used to create what is called a “Microsoft Word Form”, which must 
be used in Execution mode, and can be put in Design mode to allow inserting, deleting, 
formatting, and defining control properties.
To understand how this is done, you must first show the Developer tab on the 
Ribbon, by following these steps:
	 1.	 Use File ➤ Options to show Word Options dialog box.
	 2.	 Click Customize Ribbon option.
	 3.	 In the right list box, check the Developer option (Figure 11-8).
Figure 11-7.  The Invoice (Red design) template has a lot of Microsoft Word 
Controls inserted in the document that protect the document content leaving the 
user to use just the document controls to insert text
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

572
	 4.	 Close the Word Options dialog box.
Now your Microsoft Word copy must show the Developer tab of the Ribbon (noted in 
many figures of this book), from where you will find the tools used to manage Microsoft 
Word Controls and Templates (Figure 11-9).
Figure 11-8.  Use the Word Options dialog box, Customize Ribbon option to show 
the Developer tab
Figure 11-9.  Use the Developer tab Controls and Templates area tools to manage 
Microsoft Word Controls and Templates
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

573
Controls Design Mode
The Controls area of the Developer tab of the Ribbon offers the tools needed to insert 
different types of controls in the document, plus the Design Mode, Properties, and 
Group commands.
The Design Mode command is the one responsible for switching Microsoft Word 
Forms view from Execution mode to Design Mode (when checked).
Check the Design Mode tool and note how the Invoice (Red design) template change 
its appearance and now shows the controls inserted in the document surrounded by tags 
with the control name (Figure 11-10).
Figure 11-10.  When the Design Mode tool is checked, Microsoft Word shows all 
Controls inserted in the document, enclosed by tags that identify them by Name 
property
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

574
Control Types and Basic Properties
Whenever the Design Mode tool is checked and the text cursor is not positioned inside 
the tags that enclose any Control inserted in the document, Microsoft Word 2016 enables 
nine Content Control tools plus the Legacy tools that give access to the old Forms and 
ActiveX control types used by Microsoft Office 2003 or older versions (Figure 11-11).
You can use these Content Control types:
Rich Text
Allow typing and formatting the text inside the control
Plain Text
Allow typing text, but not formatting it
Picture
Insert a picture in the document
Building Block 
Gallery
Allow the user to choose specified building blocks
Check Box
Insert check box in the document
Combo Box
Insert a text box with a list of predefined values
Drop-down List
Insert a list of predefined values
Data Picker
Insert a calendar control to choose dates
Repeating Section
Insert a content control that can receive other controls inside it and 
create copies of itself
Legacy Tools
Insert Forms and ActiveX controls used by Microsoft Office 2003 or 
previous versions
Figure 11-11.  Microsoft Word enables the Control tools whenever the Design 
Mode tool is checked and the text cursor is not positioned inside a Control inserted 
in the document
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

575
Each control type has properties that allow controlling its appearance and the way 
it works when the Design Mode tool is unchecked, meaning that the Microsoft Word 
document is in Form mode.
Click any Control inserted in the document and click Properties (or right-click and 
choose Properties) to show the Content Control Properties dialog box (Figure 11-12).
Some of properties are common to all Content Controls, like the following:
•	
Title: specify the control name as appears inside the tags that  
enclose it.
•	
Tag: property used by VBA programmers, not available to the 
common user.
Figure 11-12.  Select any Content Control and click in the Properties tool found in 
the Controls area of the Developer tab to show its properties. Different control types 
can have different properties to set.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

576
•	
Show as: define how the control will appear when Design Mode is 
unchecked:
•	
Bounding Box: add a title and a border when control is selected.
•	
Start/End Tag: show tags with control name enclosing the 
control.
•	
None: (default value) hide control title, borders, and tags.
•	
Color: set background control color (default is Automatic, same 
as paper color).
•	
Use a style to format text typed into the empty control: when 
checked, activates the Style Combo box and the New Style command 
button, allowing you to select or create a style to format control text.
•	
Remove content control when control is edited: checked by 
default; allows you to type text tips inside the Control tags when 
Design Mode is checked, which is automatically removed when the 
user begins to type information inside the control.
Attention  The invoice (Red design) template keeps checked the Remove content 
control when control is edited option to show to the user which information must 
be typed in each document control. For example, the red “[Company]” text (without 
quotes) was typed inside the Company Plain Text control with the Design Mode 
option checked. It will be removed as soon as the user selects the control and 
presses a key in it.
•	
Content control cannot be deleted: available only when property 
Remove content control when control is edited is unchecked, 
avoids having the control deleted by the user when Design Mode is 
unchecked.
•	
Contents cannot be edited: locks the control value when Design 
Mode is unchecked, avoiding its being changed by the user.
•	
Allow carriage returns (multiple paragraphs): check to allow user 
to insert text with the Enter key breaking text lines.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

577
Insert and Delete Controls
Is quite easy to insert and delete any of the Content Controls available in the Developer 
tab Controls area once the Design Mode option is checked:
	 1.	 Position the text cursor inside the document where the control 
must appear.
	 2.	 Click the desired control to insert it.
As soon as the control is inserted in the document, click the Properties command 
found in the Controls area of the Developer tab (or right-click it and choose Properties) 
to show the Content Control Properties dialog box and give a name to the control. This 
name will appear in the tabs surrounding the control that determine its limits.
Removing any control is even easier:
•	
Right-click the control and select Remove Content Control; or
•	
Drag the mouse over the entire control to select it (with its tag 
boundaries) and press the Delete key.
Restrict Document Editing
After formatting a Microsoft Word document using Controls and putting the document 
in Execution mode by unchecking the Design mode command, the document users may 
use its controls to type data, but they also has a chance to put the document in Design 
mode again, or even worse, delete the controls inserted in the document.
To make a Microsoft Word Form document protected against user changes, you can 
employ enforcement protection against changes, with or without a password.
This is done using the Restrict Editing tool found in the Protect area of the Developer 
tab, which shows the Restrict Editing pane to allow the user to select the kind of 
restriction that must be applied to the document when the Yes, Start Enforcement 
Protection button is clicked (Figure 11-13).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

578
The Restrict Editing pane has three steps in the following sequence, which may offer 
some options:
•	
Formatting restrictions: check the Limit formatting to a selection of 
styles and use the Settings button to show the Formatting Restriction 
dialog box to select formatting options allowed.
•	
Editing restrictions: check the Allow only this type of editing in the 
document and use the list options to define which type of editing is 
allowed:
•	
Tracked changes: allow users to turn on Track Changes in the 
document.
•	
Comments: allow users to insert comments in the document 
(show the Exceptions list, which allows different users to add 
comments: allow by selecting Everyone).
Figure 11-13.  Use the Restrict Editing tool to show the Restrict Editing pane from 
where you can select the restricions that must be applied to the document when the 
Start Enforcement button is clicked
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

579
•	
Filling forms: use this option to allow just Content Controls to be 
selected to insert data.
•	
No Change (Read only): (default value) locks the documents 
against any change.
•	
Start enforcement: by selecting one of the two first options of 
restriction, you must click the Yes, Start Enforcement protection 
command button, which will show the Start Enforcement Protection 
dialog box, from where you can define a password to unlock 
protection (Figure 11-14).
Figure 11-14.  Use the Start Enforcing Protection dialog box to start the document 
protection against the changes restriction selected. By typing and corfirming 
a password, Microsoft Word will ask for this password to allow changes to the 
document.
By using a password to start the document editing protection, Microsoft Word will 
ask for this password to unlock the document again. Leave the password blank to start 
protection and test the document.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

580
Attention  Well-designed Microsoft Word form documents that use Controls must 
enforce editing protection, with or without a password, to guarantee that the user 
will have access to just the controls content, without disturbing the document 
formatting options.
It is out of scope of this book to give a detailed explanation of how to use Microsoft 
Word Controls to create guided documents, but I am supposing that by now you 
will be very comfortable to explore and try such templates, exploring the Controls 
properties to allow you create your own documents that use such resources.
Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to improve the Invoice (Red design) template, by adding 
a Repeating Section control inside the Invoice details table, using formulas to calculate 
the invoice, and saving it as a new document template.
Formatting Invoice Details Table Columns
Before you begin, you must be aware that the =PRODUCT( ) table function does not 
work well with Positional arguments when it finds empty or text cells in the argument 
direction.
That is why the exercise proposes to put the Invoice details Description as the first 
table column.
Follow these steps to format the invoice table found in the Invoice (Red design) 
template:
	 1.	 Use Microsoft Word File, New window to select the Design Sets 
templates category and load the Invoice (Red design) template 
(see the section “Templates with Formatting and Controls”).
	 2.	 Check the Design Mode command in the Controls area of the 
Developer tab of the Ribbon.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

581
	 3.	 Delete all but the first Invoice details table empty row cells of 
column Quantity, Description, Unit Price, and Total (cell range 
R3C1:R12C4 or A3:D12, Figure 11-15).
	 4.	 Select the Description column and drag it to the left, to the first 
table column position (Figure 11-16).
Figure 11-15.  Delete all but first row empty cells of Quantity, Description,  
Unit Price, and Total columns of the Invoice details table found in the Invoice  
(Red detail) template
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

582
	 5.	 Adjust the Invoice details table to the page width and adjust the 
Description, Quantity, Unit Price, and Total column widths:
•	
Apply the AutoFit ➤ AutoFit Windows command found in the 
Table Tools Layout tab.
•	
Drag Unit Price column right border to the right to straighten the 
Total column.
•	
Drag Quantity column right border to the right to straighten the 
Unit Price column (to fit the Total Due by [Date] text).
•	
Drag Description column right border to the right to enlarge it 
to the maximum value that fits Quantity column header column 
(Figure 11-­17).
Figure 11-16.  Select the Description column, and click and drag the selected 
column to the left of the first table column
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

583
Insert Form Controls
Now that the numbering columns Quantity and Unit Price are side by side in the Invoice 
details table and it has just one, empty row to insert detail records, it is time to insert 
controls in the Invoice details table, so Design Mode can be unchecked and the users 
can use them as a guidance to fill the document with relevant data.
This first and unique empty row of the Invoice details table must first receive a 
Repeat Section Content Control, because this control can add copies of itself. And 
Description, Quantity, and Unit Price columns empty cells must receive individual Plain 
Text Content Controls, to guide the user where to type each type of information.
Follow these steps to insert the Repeating Section Control in the Invoice details table:
	 1.	 IMPORTANT: Uncheck the Design Mode command found in the 
Developer tab to stop the Execution mode.
	 2.	 Select all cells of the first empty row of the Invoice details table 
(cells A2:D2).
Figure 11-17.  Use the AutoFit ➤ AutoFit Window command found in the Table 
Tools Layout tab to fit the invoice table column to page width and drag its columns 
to give the maximum horizontal space to the Description column
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

584
	 3.	 Click the Repeating Section control to insert it in the second, 
empty table row (Figure 11-18).
Attention  The Repeating Section Content Control requires that entire rows be 
selected before being inserted in a table to represent its cells.
	 4.	 Insert a Plain Text Content Control in each empty cell of the 
Description, Quantity, and Unit Price columns (inside the 
Repeating Section control) and in the Total column cells at right of 
the Sales/Tax and Shipping and Handling cells:
Figure 11-18.  Select the second Invoice table row and click the Repeating Section 
control to insert it in the table. Note that it has two tabs that show the cells it will 
repeat in the table when Design Mode is unchecked.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

585
•	
Click the desired empty column to select it.
•	
Click the Plain Text Content Control to insert it in each cell 
(Figure 11-19).
•	
Change the “Click or tap here to enter text” text inside each Plain 
Text control by the associated column header text for the second row 
cells and by 0.00 for the Sales/Tax and Shipping and Handling cells 
(Figure 11-20).
Figure 11-19.  Click inside the Repeating Section control Description column and 
click the Plain Text Content Control to insert it in the second row’s first cell. Repeat 
this operation to insert other Plain Text controls in the Quantity and Unit Price 
columns.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

586
Insert Total and Subtotal Table Formulas
The Invoice detail table now has a Repeating Section control inserted in its first 
line, which has received inside it three Plain Text controls to allow the user to type 
information in the table cells.
The table is already prepared to receive formulas in its rightmost column, so it can 
correctly calculate the Total cell of each item, and the Subtotal cell:
•	
The Total cell inside the Repeating Section control must receive this 
formula:

Follow these steps to insert these formulas:
	 1.	 Click the Total column empty cell (cell D2 or R2C4) inside the 
Repeating Section control, at the left of the control closing tag.
	 2.	 Click the Formula command found in the Data area of the Table Tools 
Layout tab to show the Formula dialog box and define these options:
•	
Formula: =PRODUCT(LEFT)
•	
Number format: #,###.00
	 3.	 Close the Formula dialog box to insert the Total cell formula.
	 4.	 Click cell D3 to select it (cell in Total column at right of the 
“Subtotal” cell).
	 5.	 Click the Formula command to show the Formula dialog box and 
define these options:
•	
Formula (proposed by default): =SUM(ABOVE)
•	
Number format: #,###.00
	 6.	 Close the Formula dialog box to insert the Subtotal formula.

Bookmark Cells and Insert Total Due Formula
Since nobody knows in advance how many Invoice detail items will be inserted by the 
user in the Invoice details table, there is a technical need to Bookmark the Subtotal, 
Sales/Tax, and Shipping and Handling cells in the Total column, so the Total Due cell on 
the table bottom right border can correctly calculate using a formula like this:
=Subtotal + SalesTax + ShippingHandling
To bookmark a cell (or any text selection) means to associate a cell to a name, so you 
can easily return to it at any moment or refer to it in other Microsoft Word contexts.
Follow these steps to bookmark the Subtotal, Sales/Tax, and Shipping and Handling 
associated values in the Invoice details table Total column:
	 1.	 IMPORTANT: First select the entire cell value that you want to 
associate to a bookmark.
	 2.	 Click the Bookmark command found in the Links area of the 
Insert tab to show the Bookmark dialog box.
	 3.	 Type an associative name for the cell value (considering that 
Bookmark names can have up to 40 characters and must not 
contain spaces).
	 4.	 Click Add to add associate the cell value to the Bookmark name 
Figure 11-22) and insert it in Bookmark name list.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

589
	 5.	 Click Close to close the Bookmark dialog box.
Figure 11-23 shows the Bookmark dialog box after associating cells D3, D4, and D5 to 
Bookmark names Subtotal, SalesTax, and ShippingHandling.
Figure 11-22.  Drag the mouse over the cell value to select it and use the Bookmark 
command to show the Bookmark dialog box to associate the value with a name
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

590
Attention  To know where the Bookmark name is associated in the text, select it 
in the Bookmark name list of the Bookmark dialog box and click Go To. Microsoft 
Word will immediately jump to the document part where the bookmark resides.
Bookmarks can be easily deleted when the text it refers to is deleted from the 
document. This is another reason to imply document protection by using the 
Restrict Editing tool.
Once the desired cells have been appropriately bookmarked, you no longer need 
to worry about how many Invoice items will be inserted in the Invoice details table so 
the Total Due cell formula (cell D6) can correctly relate to the Subtotal, SalesTax, and 
ShippingHandling cells.
Follow these steps to insert the Total Due formula in cell D6 of the Invoice details table:
	 1.	 Click cell D6 (bottom right corner table cell).
	 2.	 Click the Formula command found in the Data area of the Table 
Tools Layout tab to show the Formula dialog box and use the 
Paste bookmark list of the Formula dialog box to select bookmark 
names and create this formula:
•	
Formula: =SubTotal+SalesTax+ShippingHandling
•	
Number format: #,###.00
Figure 11-23.  Bookmark names associated to the Invoice detail table cells
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

591
	 3.	 Close the Formula dialog box to insert the Total Due cell formula 
(Figure 11-24).
Test and Save the Template
The document created by the Invoice (Red design) template that receives Controls and 
Formulas in its Invoice table details is ready to be tested and saved as a new template.
Test the Invoice Details Table Formulas
To test the document you must first prepare it to receive data from the user by following 
these steps:
	 1.	 Click the Invoice details table and uncheck the View Gridlines 
option found in the Table Tools Layout tab.
	 2.	 Uncheck the Design Mode tool found in Developer tab of the 
Ribbon. The Detail will show just one empty row to receive data 
(Figure 11-25).
Figure 11-24.  Click the last Invoice details table cell (cell D12, Total Due) and use 
the Formula command found in the Table Tools Layout tab to insert a formula to 
sum the SubTotal, SalesTax, and ShippingHandling Bookmarks
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

592
	 3.	 Type these values for the first Invoice item (press Tab to move 
between fields):
•	
Description = Item 1.
•	
Quantity = 10.
•	
Unit Price= 1.28
Figure 11-25.  The Invoice details table with Design Mode unchecked and the 
Description Plain Text Content Control selected. Note how each control inside the 
Repeating Section control inserted in the second table row now has its own tip 
(grayed); all Total columns show 0.00 values (returned from formula results or 
other Plain Text controls).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

593
	 4.	 Click the “+” handle of the Repeating Section control at the right of 
first Invoice detail item to insert another empty row in the Invoice 
details table with the same Plain Text controls and formula in 
Total column (Figure 11-26).
	 5.	 Insert a second Invoice detail item in the new row inserted in the 
table (Item 2, Quantity = 20, Unit Price = 2.15).
	 6.	 Repeat steps 4 and 5 one more time to insert a third Invoice detail 
item (Item 3, Quantity = 30, Unit Price = 4.77).
	 7.	 Press Tab on the last Unit Price invoice item to go to the Sales/Tax 
control and type 10.
	 8.	 Press Tab on the Sales/Tax control to go to the Shipping and 
Handling control and type 20.
	 9.	 Press Ctrl+A to select the entire document and press F9 to 
recalculate it (Figure 11-­27).
Figure 11-26.  After inserting the first Invoice detail item, press the “+” handle of 
the Repeating Section control at the right of the Total column to insert a new table 
row with the same set of controls and formula
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

594
Attention  Note that new items inserted by the Repeating Section control “+” 
handle left align the Unit Price field—and there is not anything you can do about it!
Once the Invoice detail table is correctly calculating its formulas, you must remove 
all data from the Invoice detail table before you save the document as a new template. 
You can do this using two strategies:
•	
By removing all but the first Invoice detail table rows to leave it like 
Figure 11-25.
•	
By inserting a desirable number of empty rows in the Invoice detail 
table.
Either way, you must select each Plain Text Control (in Invoice details table,  
Sales/Tax, and Shipping and Handling) and delete its contents; press Ctrl+A and F9 to 
recalculate the table before saving it as a new, reusable Microsoft Word template.
Figure 11-28 shows how this table will look like after you clear the controls and use 
the Repeating Section control “+” handle to insert 10 new empty rows in the table  
(note how the Repeating Section control left aligned all new Unit Price controls).
Figure 11-27.  To recalculate the Invoice detail tables, press Ctrl+A to select the 
entire document and press F9 to recalculate all its fields and formulas
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

595
Saving the Template
To save a document as a template, use the File ➤ Save As command to evoke the Save as 
dialog box and type:
•	
File Name: the template name
•	
Save as Type: and select one of the two possible template types:
•	
Word Template (*.dotx).
•	
Word Macro Enabled Template (*.dotm).
Figure 11-28.  Clear the Invoce details table controls and use the “+” handle to 
insert some new, empty new rows, before saving it as a new document template
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

596
Attention  The *.dotm template may store macros (VBA code) inside the file. Such 
type of templates with macros may be considered by antivirus programs as files 
capable of infecting your computer and be transferred to the antivirus quarantine folder.
No matter the folder you had selected, whenever you select one of the possible 
Template types (.dotx or .dotm) Microsoft Word Save As dialog box will instantly change 
to this folder (where <UserName> is your login name in Microsoft Windows system):
C:\Users\<UserName>\Documents\Custom Office Templates
This folder is specified by the Options ➤ Default personal templates location option 
found in the Save documents area of the Word Options dialog box (Figure 11-29).
Figure 11-29.  Microsoft Word defines the default location for all Microsoft Office 
personal templates using the Word Option dialog box (File ➤ Options, Save area ➤  
Default personal templates location)
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

597
Attention  The “Invoice (Red Design Formulas) Calculate.dotx” template 
document, which you can extract from Chapter 11.zip file, has a copy of Invoice 
(Red design) template shown in Figure 11-28, with Microsoft Word Repeating 
Section and Plain Text Content Controls and Formulas.
Open a Saved Template to Create Documents Based on It
To open a saved template, you must navigate to the folder where it is stored and use 
Microsoft Word Open dialog box to open it.
By opening the template you are indeed opening the file that should be used to 
generate copies of it, so be careful to save the changes you make in this file.
But whenever you want to create new copies of a personal template created by you, 
follow these steps:
	 1.	 Select File ➤ New.
	 2.	 Click the Personal option to show all templates stored in  
\Documents\Custom Office Templates folder.
	 3.	 Select the desired template and click the desired template to open 
a copy of it inside Microsoft Word (Figure 11-30).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

598
Attention  All .dotx templates will automatically create new .docx documents, 
while all .dotm templates will automatically create .dotm (macro enabled) 
documents.
The Normal.dotm Template
Every time Microsoft Word opens and you click the Blank document option to create a 
new document, you are indeed creating a copy of the Normal.dotm template document, 
which is the file responsible to bring the default white page and all Recommended style 
formatting options (including Normal and Heading styles).
Figure 11-30.  Use the Personal option found in the New window (File ➤ New 
option) to show your templates and select the one that must create a new document 
copy of it
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

599
Without knowing it, you may have already changed the Normal.dotm template more 
than one time using some of this book’s exercises and tips:
	 1.	 by clicking the Set as Default command button found in the Font 
and Paragraph dialog box to change the Normal style formatting 
options.
	 2.	 when you used the New Style dialog box to create a new style and 
selected the option “New documents based on this template”.
	 3.	 when you associated a Style shortcut to Normal or Heading styles 
using the Customize Keyboard dialog box, which by default offers 
to store it in the Normal.dotm template (see Figure 5-16).
When you make such basic changes and they are propagated in the Normal.dotm 
template, you begin to notice that this special Microsoft Word Template can store more 
than just document formatting options like page properties and styles information. It can 
also store:
•	
AutoText and AutoCorrect entries.
•	
Macro codes.
•	
Shortcut keys.
•	
Toolbars and custom menu settings (when available).
As you can see, the Normal.dotm template is the file that stores your Microsoft Word 
preferences regarding formatting and personalization, which leads us to suppose that 
there is more than a single reason to know how to correctly manipulate it:
•	
to not to lose the hard defined personalizations made in your 
Microsoft Word copy.
•	
to copy your Microsoft Word preferences between computers.
•	
to change the appearance of new Microsoft Word documents.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

600
Where Normal.dotm Is Stored
Although your personal templates are stored by default in \Documents\Custom Office 
Templates\ folder, the Normal.dotm and all templates downloaded or available in the 
File ➤ New window Featured option are stored in this deep, very hidden, almost secret 
folder:
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates
You can check or change this folder using the top-secret File Location dialog box 
found when you click the File Locations… command button found in the General area of 
the Advanced options of Word Options dialog box (Figure 11-31).
Figure 11-31.  Microsoft Word stores templates in the path specified by the User 
Templates options found in the File Locations dialog box (accessed using the  
File ➤ Options ➤ Advanced ➤ General ➤ File Location command button)
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

601
Attention  The C:\Users folder and all folders inside it are hidden, protected 
system folders that may require you to log into Microsoft Windows with 
Administrator privileges to access its content.
Microsoft Word will always check for the Normal.dotm file when it opens. If it is not 
found in the specified folder, a new, empty default copy will be created.
Normal.dotm Is Protected
Since every time you open Microsoft Word it automatically opens the Normal.dotm 
template to load the user preferences for page, styles, autocorrection, and so on and 
eventually creates a new, empty document that is a copy of it, this template is locked 
against editing, and you can change its appearance.
Many people search for information on the Internet about how to change this 
default, empty document, and knowing that Normal.dotm template is locked against 
editing, you need to follow the next sequence to change it using Word, without losing 
your preferences stored inside it:
	 1.	 Make a Normal.dotm copy.
	 2.	 Change the Normal.dotm copy.
	 3.	 Replace the original .dotm copy with the changed version.
Let’s see each of these steps with more detail.
Make a Normal.dotm Copy
Whenever you need to change the default Normal.dotm blank document, you must first 
make a security copy of it by following these steps:
	 1.	 Navigate to the Microsoft Word templates folder:
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates.
	 2.	 Right-click the Normal.dotm file, drag it to an empty place in 
the folder, and select Copy here to save it in the same folder as 
Normal - copyedit file.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

602
	 3.	 Open the Normal - copyedit file, format it to the way you want so 
that every new, empty document looks like it, and save it.
	 4.	 Close Microsoft Word.
	 5.	 Rename the original Normal.dotm file name to Normal2.dotm.
	 6.	 Rename the new Normal - copyedit file to Normal.dotm.
Exercise 2
The objective of this exercise is to produce a change in the Blank document template 
to make Microsoft Word always insert a watermark on its pages, and default header text 
(an operation that can be used to tag every document produced by a hypothetical office 
using its Microsoft Word copies and computers).
Follow these steps to create the Normal.dotm copy:
	 1.	 Navigate to the Microsoft Word templates folder:
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates
	 2.	 Right-click the Normal.dotm file, drag it to an empty place in the 
folder, and release the mouse button.
	 3.	 Select Copy here to create the Normal - copyedit file in the same 
folder.
Attention  Now your Microsoft Word folder will have a security copy of the 
Normal.dotm file.
	 4.	 Open Microsoft Word, and select Open Other Documents ➤ 
Browse to show the Open file dialog box.
	 5.	 Navigate to the Microsoft Templates folder:
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates
	 6.	 Select Normal - copyedit file produced in Step 3 and click Open.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

603
Attention  It is important to note that you cannot use the File ➤ New option, nor 
double-click the Normal - copyedit template, because you will create a copy of the 
file structure, and will lose the personal data inserted in Normal.dotm. You MUST 
open the file copy.
	 7.	 Use the Watermark tool found in the Page Background area at the 
right of Design tab to insert any of the available watermarks in the 
Normal - copyedit page.
	 8.	 Double-click the page Header area to show it.
	 9.	 Verify that the watermark is a WordArt object inserted in the 
Header, and vertically aligned on the page (Figure 11-32).
Figure 11-32.  Use the Design tab Watermark command to insert one of the 
available watermarks in the Normal - copy.dotm file. Double-click the page header 
and note that the watermark is a WordArt object inserted in the Header page area 
and vertically centered on the page.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

604
	 10.	 Save Normal - copyedit document again on the Microsoft 
Templates folder.
	 11.	 Close Microsoft Word.
At this point the Normal - copyedit file stored in Microsoft Word secret Templates 
folder already has all changes needed to use the company formatting options (we add just 
a watermark, but you can also make changes to page size, styles formatting, headers etc.).
Follow these steps to replace Normal.dotm by the Normal - copyedit file:
	 1.	 Supposing that Microsoft Word is closed, use Windows  
Explorer to navigate to the secret Templates folder located in 
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates
	 2.	 Right-click the Normal.dotm file and choose Rename (or click it a 
second type to edit the file name).
	 3.	 Change the Normal.dotm file name to Normal2.dotm file name.
Attention  Now Normal2.dotm file is your security copy for the original Normal.
dotm file, without any changes.
	 4.	 Right-click the Normal - copyedit file (the one changed) and 
choose Rename.
	 5.	 Change the Normal - copyedit file name to Normal.dot.
Now, every time you open Microsoft Word and select the Blank document template, 
you will receive a blank page with a watermark. Try it!
Attention  I personally dislike such approach of tag the Microsoft Word Blank 
document with personal data. From my point of view, it is better to leave it as 
is—a new, empty, normal blank document—and produce other templates with all 
desired formatting, that can be saved in the \Documents\Custom Office Templates 
folder and used whenever necessary.
Always make copies of your Normal.dotm file to quickly adapt any Microsoft Word 
copy to your needs.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

605
Creating Your Own Templates
Whenever you need to create and distribute your own templates, begin with a new, 
empty document derived from Normal.dotm (or from another template that has all the 
formatting you need).
Then follow this checklist to define the document standards:
•	
Use the Page Setup dialog box to define page properties (size, 
margins, multiple pages, position and type of headers and footers).
•	
Define the style set to be used.
•	
Define the first page formatting.
•	
Define the headers/footers formatting (for first, even and odd page).
•	
Save the document as .dotx or .dotm format.
Attention  Remember that some antivirus programs may incorrectly interpret 
.dotm files (Word Macro Enabled Templates) as treats because they have the 
potential to carry VBA code that may produce damage.
Use Your Template
Once a template is created and saved, you can use its formatting options two different 
ways:
•	
Use all its formatting options (page and styles formatting), by creating 
a copy of it using one of these methods:
•	
Selecting it using the File ➤ New ➤ Personal option (that shows 
the \Documents\Custom Office Templates folder).
•	
Double-click the .dotx or .dotm file in the folder it resides in.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

606
•	
Use just the template styles (ignoring all its page setup formatting), 
by associating the document to the desired template using:
•	
The Document Templates command found at the right of the 
Developer tab (see Figure 11-9).
•	
Any .dotx document template saved using the Save as New Style 
Set… command found in the Style Set Gallery menu of the Design 
tab (see Figure 6-5).
•	
Any Microsoft Word document that can be selected by the Browse 
for Themes… option of the Themes tool found at left of the 
Design tab (see Figure 6-9).
Insert a Document Text in an Empty Template
To use all the formatting options of any Microsoft Word Template (page and styles 
formatting) you must begin to type in a copy of this template, or more commonly insert 
any other document text inside a new, empty copy of this template.
There are two different ways that you can insert a document text in a new, empty 
document based on any template:
•	
By using the Object ➤ Text from file option found in the text area of 
the Insert tab of the Ribbon (Figure 11-33).
Figure 11-33.  Use the Insert ➤ Object ➤ Text from file tool to select all the text of 
another Microsoft Word document and inserting at the current cursor position
•	
By selecting the entire document text (Ctrl+A), copying it to 
clipboard, and pasting it into the new document based on the desired 
template.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

607
All styles used in the original document (Normal and Recommended styles, if 
any), will automatically become formatted with the same style used in the destination 
template.
Attention  Since the Section Break holds all page information, the document you 
insert in the template must not have any Section Breaks to avoid that template 
page properties being overidden by other document page properties.
You may eventually need to make an advanced Find and Replace operation using 
the same style in the Find what and Replace with options to reapply each template 
style to the document text pasted inside the template copy.
Most publishers—Apress included—use such methods to make their book 
templates available. They offer a template file from where you must delete the text 
and insert your own text to send the document to an expected format, so the book 
page count can be anticipated with accuracy.
Associating a Document with a Template
You can also associate a document to an existing template, which will update equivalent 
document styles to the same template styles formatting while also making available all 
template styles to the document. The template page formatting options will not be used.
You can do such operations using the Document Template command found at right 
of the Developer tab, which will show the Templates and Add-ins dialog box from where 
you can select a template file to be attached to this document (Figure 11-34).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

608
As Figure 11-34 shows, the Document1 opened by the Microsoft Word is attached 
to Normal.dotm template. And the same way that most styles inherit the Normal style 
formatting options, by attaching a document to a template you make it permanently 
inherit all template styles formatting.
Any changes made to the template styles will be automatically applied to the 
document whenever it is opened, which is a quite good formatting rule to quickly 
change documents based on the same template.
Attention  Any Microsoft Word .dotx or .dotm template cannot be attached to 
another template. Both the Document template and the Attach button will become 
unavailable in such file types.
Figure 11-34.  Use the Templates and Add-Ins dialog box to attach a template to 
a document. By doing this, all template styles becomes available and active in the 
current document.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

609
Using the Template and Add-ins Dialog Box
The Template and Add-ins you see on Figure 11-34 allows you to
•	
attach a document to a template;
•	
indicate to which template a document is attached to;
•	
automatically update the document styles to the current template 
styles formatting;
•	
define which template—and its styles (besides Normal.dotm)—must 
be loaded whenever Microsoft Word starts.
The Templates and Add-ins dialog box controls are as follows:
•	
Attach: click the Attach button to show a File Explorer window from 
where you can select a new template to be attached to this document.
Attention  Any Microsoft Word document can be attached to just one template at 
a time.
•	
Automatically update document styles: Check this option to 
automatically update all document styles to the same styles that may 
exist in the attached template.
•	
Global Templates and Add-ins: Click Add button to select all 
templates whose styles you want to be available whenever Microsoft 
Word is opened (you need to check the templates so its styles become 
available in the Styles pane).
•	
Organizer: Show the Organizer dialog box (Figure 11-35) from where 
you can copy styles from one file/template to another.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

610
Attention  Whenever you need to use one or more styles that already exist in 
a Microsoft Word template or document, you don’t need to recreate it: just use 
the Organizer dialog box to copy them between the selected documents. Use the 
Styles available in list and the Close file button below each list to open the source 
(left list) and destination (right list) files and the Copy, Delete, and Rename buttons 
to manage the styles.
Use the Macro Project Items of the Organizer dialog box to transfer macro codes 
between Microsoft Word documents.
Exercise 3
The objective of this exercise is to show how a document text with section breaks 
inserted in a Template overrides the Template page properties.
Figure 11-35.  Use the Organizer dialog box to transfer styles (and macros) from 
the source (left list) to the destination (right list) document. You can use the Close 
File button to close and open documents from where you want to exchange macros 
and styles.

	 4.	 Extract file “Moby Dick, Herman Melville, Formatted.docx” 
document from Chapter11.zip file.
	 5.	 Use the Insert ➤ Object ➤ Text from File tool to show the Insert 
File Microsoft Windows Explorer dialog box and select the “Moby 
Dick, Herman Melville, Formatted.docx” document.
	 6.	 Press OK to insert all document pages in the empty document based 
on “6x9 Book.dotx” template. Document will receive about 630 pages.
	 7.	 Press Ctrl+Home to move to its beginning and note that it lost the 
template First Page Heather and there is at least two different page 
sizes (Figure 11-40).
Figure 11-40.  The “Moby Dick, Herman Melville, Formatted.docx” document 
has six section breaks, each one carring its page formatting. When it is inserted 
in an empty document based on the “6x9 Book.dotx” template, its Section Breaks 
override the template page formatting.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

616
Attention  Since the “Moby Dick, Herman Melville, Formatted.docx” document 
(created in “Exercise 2” section of Chapter 9) has six different Section Break types, 
each Section Break used its own page formatting option.
Remove all section breaks from the source document before inserting it in a new 
template. The reader is invited to remove all Section Breaks from the source 
document before trying to reinsert it in the empty document based on the “6x9 
Book.dotx” template.
You can also extract the “Moby Dick, Herman Melville, No Section Break.docx” 
document from Chapter11.zip file to this exercise. After inserting it in the document 
based on the “6x9 Book.dotx” template, you may need to follow all steps from 
“Exercise 2” section of Chapter 9 to reformat it!
Exercise 4
The objective of this exercise is to easily adapt a ready-made and formatted document 
for the popular 6×9 book format using its associated Microsoft Word Template, which 
has a specific style set and different page layouts for first, even and odd pages.
It supposes that you had already extracted the “6x9 Book.dotx” template to the  
\Documents\Custom Office Templates folder (as specified by the first steps in Exercise 3).
It will also use “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain.docx” document, which 
you can also extract from the Chapter11.zip file; this document has the entirety of Mark 
Twain’s 1876 book, formatted in a 134 Letter page size document (without Section 
Breaks).
The “6x9 Book.dotx” template has these special styles:
•	
Chapter Number: to format each “Chapter N” paragraph (if any).
•	
Chapter Title: to format each chapter title text (if any).
•	
BodytextFirst: to format the first paragraph of each chapter (the one 
that follows a Chapter N or Chapter Title style paragraph, if any).
•	
BodyText: to format all other body text paragraphs.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

617
Since “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain.docx” document uses 
Recommended styles to format its paragraphs (Heading1 for “Chapter N” titles and 
Normal for body text), the strategy that must be used to apply these Template styles to 
the text is to execute successive Find and Replace wildcard operations.
Base a Document on the “6x9 Book.dotx” Template
As usual, we first need to create a new, empty document based on the “6x9 Book.dotx” 
template, in which we must insert “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain.docx” 
document text.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Use the File ➤ New ➤ Personal command to show the contents  
of the \Documents\Custom Office Templates folder, and click  
the “6x9 Book.dotx” template to create a nonempty copy of it  
(see Figure 11-38).
	 2.	 In the new .docx document based on the “6x9 Book.dotx”, 
press Ctrl+A to select the entire text and Delete key to clean the 
document (see Figure 11-39).
	 3.	 Execute the Insert ➤ Object tool ➤ Text from File command to 
show the Insert File dialog box and select “The Adventures of Tom 
Sawyer, Mark Twain.docx” document to insert it in the new, clean 
document based on the “6x9 Book.dotx” template.
	 4.	 Since the source document has no Section Breaks, it will adapt to 
the empty document page formatting options, which will flow the 
text to fit on 227 pages using a single section (Figure 11-41).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

618
	 5.	 Press Ctrl+Home to go to the text beginning and note that the 
first two paragraphs are formatted with the Title and Subtitle 
Recommended styles, and that all pages received the document 
page formatting and headers (Figure 11-42).
Figure 11-41.  In a clean, empty copy of the “6x9 Book.dotx” template, use the 
Insert ➤ Object ➤ Text from File command to insert the “The Adventures of Tom 
Sawyer, Mark Twain.docx” document text
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

619
Changing Odd and Even Headers
The “6x9 Book.dotx” template has default text inserted in its First page footer (page 
number), even and odd page Headers. You must first change the default Even and Odd 
Page Header texts so whenever you insert Section Breaks in the document, the new 
section inherits the appropriate Headers.
Figure 11-42.  These are the first pages of Document1.docx based on “6x9 Book.dotx”  
template, which received the text from “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark 
Twain.docx” document
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

620
You must apply these changes:
•	
Even Page Header: type the author name (“Mark Twain”) over  
“Book Title” text.
•	
Odd Page Header: type book title (“The Adventures of Tom Sawyer”) 
over “Chapter n: Chapter title” text.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Go to the document’s second page (even page 2) and double-click 
its page header;
	 2.	 Type “Mark Twain” over “Book Title” indicator.
	 3.	 Click Next button located in the Navigation area of the Header & 
Footer Tools Design tab to go to the next header (odd page 3).
	 4.	 Type “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” over the “Chapter n: 
Chapter title” text (Figure 11-43).
Figure 11-43.  Type the author name (Mark Twain) and the book title (The 
Adventures of Tom Sawyer) into the Even and Odd Page Headers of the document 
based on the “6x9 Book.dotx” template that received “The Adventures of Tom 
Sawyer, Mark Twain.docx” document text
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

621
Changing Text Styles
Now you must apply the Template styles to the document text. Since it has the 
BodytextFirst style that must be applied to the first paragraph that succeeds each 
“CHAPTER N” text (formatted with Heading1 style), we can make such formatting  
using two successive Find and Replace operations:
•	
First Find and Replace will format each “CHAPTER N” and next 
paragraph with a blue color.
•	
Second Find and Replace operation will search for every Normal style 
with blue color and change it to the BodytextFirst style.
Apply BodytextFirst Style to Each First Chapter Paragraph
Follow these steps to format the desired text with a blue color:
	 1.	 Double-click the document text to close the Header page area  
(if still opened).
	 2.	 Press Ctrl+Home to go to the document begin, click the first 
paragraph of “Preface” section, and apply the BodytextFirst style 
using the Styles Gallery.
	 3.	 Press Ctrl+H to show the Find and Replace dialog box with the 
Replace tab selected (or select the Replace command in the Home 
tab of the Ribbon).
	 4.	 Click More ➤ to expand the Replace dialog box and check User 
wildcards option.
	 5.	 In the Find what text box type: 
(CHAPTER*^13)(*^13)
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

622
Attention  The wildcard search is case sensitive. The (CHAPTER*^13) will select 
every paragraph that begins with “CHAPTER” and has any other text (*) and a 
Paragraph Break (^13). The (*^13) will select the next paragraph that succeeds it. 
The parenthesis pair ( ) allows you to use the \n option in the Replace with text box.
Always use the Find Next button to verify if the desired text is being selected by the 
wildcard operation.
	 6.	 In the Replace text box, type click Special ➤ Font to show the Font 
dialog box and use the Font color tool to choose a blue color.
	 7.	 Click Replace All button to change 35 occurrences (Figure 11-44).
At this point, all “CHAPTER N” paragraphs formatted with the Heading 1 style and 
the Normal style ones that succeed it must be formatted with the selected blue color in 
the text. It is time to search for every Normal paragraph with a blue color and change it to 
the BodytextFirst style.
Figure 11-44.  Use the Find and Replace dialog box Replace tab
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

623
Now follow these steps to change all Normal style blue paragraphs to a BodytextFirst 
style:
	 1.	 In the Find and Replace dialog box, uncheck the Use wildcards 
option.
	 2.	 Click the Find what text box and select as follows:
•	
Click Special ➤ Style to show the Find Style dialog box and select 
Normal style.
•	
Click Special ➤ Font to show the Font dialog box, and click Font 
Color tool select the same Accent 1 blue color used in the last 
search operation.
	 3.	 Click the Replace with text box and set these options:
•	
Click No Formatting button to remove the previous formatting 
options:
•	
Click Special ➤ Style to show the Find Style dialog box, 
BodytextFirst style.
•	
Click Special ➤ Font to show the Font dialog box and click Font 
color control select Automatic (or Black).
	 4.	 Click Replace all to change 35 occurrences, applying the 
BodytextFirst style to each first chapter paragraph (Figure 11-45).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

624
Apply Bodytext Style to All Normal Styles
Now that all first paragraphs of each chapter are correctly formatted with the 
BodytextFirst style, it is time to change each remaining Normal style to a Bodytext style.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 In the Find and Replace dialog box, click Find what text box and 
set these options:
•	
Click No Formatting to remove all previous Find what formatting 
options.
•	
Click Special ➤ Style to show the Find Style dialog box and select 
Normal style.
Figure 11-45.  Once all first paragraphs after a “CHAPTER N” paragraph have 
been tagged with a blue color, use another Find and Replace operation without 
wildcards to search for each Normal, Font color = Accent 1 paragraph and change 
to BodytextFirst, Font color = Auto (black)
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

625
	 2.	 In the Replace with text box, set these options:
•	
Click No Formatting to remove all previous Replace with 
formatting options.
•	
Click Special ➤ Style to show the Find Style dialog box and select 
Bodytext style.
	 3.	 Click Replace all to apply the Bodytext style to all Normal style 
paragraphs (Figure 11-­46 shows that Microsoft Word shows an 
erroneous number of replacements).
Figure 11-46.  After applying the BodytextFirst style to each first chapter 
paragraph, use the Find and Replace dialog box to search for every Normal style 
and replace it with a Bodytext style
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

626
Apply Chapter Number Style to All Heading1 Styles
Now that the body text received the BodytextFirst and BodyText styles, let’s change each 
Heading1 style to the Template Chapter Number style.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 In Find and Replace dialog box, click Find what and set these 
options:
•	
Click No Formatting to remove all previous Find what formatting 
options.
•	
Click Special ➤ Style to show the Find Style dialog box and select 
Heading1 style.
	 2.	 In the Replace with text box, set these options:
•	
Click No Formatting to remove all previous Replace with 
formatting options.
•	
Click Special ➤ Style to show the Find Style dialog box and select 
Chapter Number style.
•	
Click Special ➤ Font to show the Font dialog box and click Font 
color control select Automatic (or Black).
	 3.	 Click Replace all to change 35 occurrences, applying the Chapter 
Number style to all Heading1 style paragraphs (Figure 11-47).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

627
At this point, the document based on the “6x9 Book.dotx” template that received 
“The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain.docx” will be formatted like Figure 11-48.
Figure 11-47.  The last Find and Replace operation must search for each  
Heading1 style and change it to a Chapter Number style with Font color = 
Automatic (since all “CHAPTER N” Heading1 styles are still formatted with the 
Accent 1 blue color)
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

628
Insert an Odd Page Section Break Before Chapter
To finish this exercise we must insert an Odd Page Section Break before each “CHAPTER N” 
text paragraph, formatted with the Chapter Number style, so each chapter receives the 
First Page Header formatting, with the semi-ellipsis in its First Page Header and page 
number in its First Page Footer (see Figure 11-38).
Figure 11-48.  This is “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” inserted in a document 
based on the “6x9 Book.dotx” template, after receiving the right Even and Odd 
Page Headers and the ChapterNumber, BodyTextFirst, and BodyText styles
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

629
As explained before you can automatically do this by first inserting an Odd Page 
Section Break in the document, cutting it to Clipboard (Ctrl+X), and using a Find and 
Replace operation.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Check the Show/Hide tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon.
	 2.	 Click anywhere in “CHAPTER I” text on the document’s first page 
and press Home to position the text cursor at the beginning of this 
paragraph.
	 3.	 Use the Layout ➤ Breaks ➤ Odd Page command to insert a 
Section Break (Odd Page) hidden character before this paragraph.
Attention  Since you inserted an Odd Page Section Break, the “CHAPTER I” text 
will now begin on document page 3, automatically receiving a First Page Header 
(Figure 11-49).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

630
	 4.	 Click the Section Break (Odd Page) and press Shift+End  
(or Shift+Right arrow) to select it and press Ctrl+X to cut it to 
Clipboard.
	 5.	 Press Ctrl+H to show the Find and Replace dialog box, click 
More>>, and unselect Use wildcards.
Attention  There is no need to use a wildcard search in this Find and Replace 
operation.
Figure 11-49.  When you insert an Odd Page Section Break before “CHAPTER I” 
text, it makes this chapter begin on the next odd page number (page 3), and a First 
Page Header style is applied

631
	 6.	 In Find what text box, set these options:
•	
Click No Formatting to remove all previous Find what formatting 
options.
•	
Click Special ➤ Style to show the Find Style dialog box and select 
Chapter Number style.
•	
Type this search string: CHAPTER
	 7.	 In the Replace with text box, set these options:
•	
Click No Formatting to remove all previous Replace with 
formatting options.
•	
Click Special ➤ Clipboard Contents to add a ^c as replacement 
string.
•	
Click Special ➤ Find What Text to add a ^& to the replacement 
string, which must become (Figure 11-50): ^c^&
Figure 11-50.  Once you have cut the Odd Page Section Break to the Clipboard, use 
the Find and Replace dialog box to search for every “CHAPTER” text in a Chapter 
Number style paragraph, and use Special ➤ Clipboard Content (^c) and Special ➤ 
Find What Text (^&) to precede each chapter with an Odd Page Section Break
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

632
	 8.	 Click Replace all to change all 35 occurrences.
The document will now have an Odd Page Section Break preceding every 
“CHAPTER” text formatted with the Chapter Number style, with the first chapter page 
formatted using the “6x9 Book.dotx” template First Page Header. I end up having 235 6×9 
pages (considering that you manually inserted an Odd Page Section Break before its last 
chapter, “Conclusion”).
Attention  The file “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain 6x9 Book.docx” 
has this exercise done for your appreciation.
Exercise 5
The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate that by attaching a document to a new 
Template file, just the Template styles are applied, in a similar fashion used by the Style 
Set Gallery found in the Design tab of the Ribbon.
It uses the document produced in the last exercise (“The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, 
Mark Twain 6x9 Book.docx”) and the “7x10 Book.dotx” template (both found inside 
Chapter11.zip).
Follow these steps to inspect the “7x10 Book.dotx” template:
	 1.	 Extract the “7x10 Book.dotx” template to the \Documents\Custom 
Office Templates folder.
	 2.	 Open the “7x10 Book.dotx” template (or a document based on it) 
and note that it is quite similar to the “6x9 Book.dotx” template 
used in Exercises 3 and 4. It has:
•	
The same style set name (Chapter Number, Chapter Title, 
BodytextFirst, and BodyText) with different formatting options.
•	
A 7×10 page size with personalized First, Even and Odd Page 
Headers, which brings different page styles (Figure 11-51).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

633
	 3.	 Open “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain 6x9 Book.
docx” document.
	 4.	 Use the Document Templates command found in the Templates 
area of the Developer tab to show the Templates and Add-ins 
dialog box.
	 5.	 Click the Attach button of the Template and Add-ins dialog box to 
show the Attach Template Windows Explorer dialog box.

template, select it, and click OK to close the dialog box and point 
to the desired template association.
	 7.	 Check the Automatically update document styles option and click 
OK to close the Templates and Add-ins dialog box.
Figure 11-51.  The “7x10 Book.dotx” template has the same style set name found 
in the “6x9 Book.dotx” template, using a different font set and formatting options. It 
also has a 7×10 page size with its own First, Even and Odd page footers and headers.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

634
Since “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain 6x9 Book.docx” document has 
the same style set name found in the “7x10 Book.dotx” template, the document styles 
will be instantly updated, but will not update its default 6×9 page size (Figure 11-52).
Figure 11-52.  Whenever you attach an existing document to a new template, all 
template styles become available for the document, and the ones with the same 
name will be automatically updated to the template formatting standards. The 
document page properties will not be changed.
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

635
Exercise 6
The objective of this exercise is to prove that whenever you have a document formatted 
with the appropriate style set, having no Section Breaks, you can easily change its 
appearance by inserting it in another template and updating both its styles and its page 
formatting.
It uses the document produced in the last exercise (“The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, 
Mark Twain 6x9 Book No Section Break.docx”) and the “7x10 Book.dotx” template (both 
found inside Chapter11.zip).
Follow these steps, supposing that you have placed a copy of the “7x10 Book.dotx” 
template in your \Documents\Custom Office Templates folder:

is full of style examples, press Ctrl+A to select the entire text and 
Delete to clean the document content.
	 3.	 Use the Insert ➤ Object ➤ Text from File command to show the 
Insert File dialog box from where you must select “The Adventures 
of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain 6x9 Book No Section Break.docx”.
Attention  It is important to insert the right document version—without Section 
Breaks—so the document can inherit all template page and styles formatting.
	 4.	 Press Ctrl+Home to go to the document begin and note that it now 
has 144 7×10 pages (Figure 11-53).

(Conclusion), the document will have 163 7×10 pages, with each chapter beginning on 
an odd page with a different page style.
Figure 11-53 shows the appearance of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain 
7x10 Book.docx” (which you can extract from Chapter11.zip file); this now reflects the 
state of the document after undergoing all these exercise steps. It now has the template 
formatting options, including page formatting and styles.
Attention  The reader is invited to study to “7x10 Book.dotx” template format, 
including the fonts used in the text (styles, headers and footers) and the Header/
Footer text formatting.
Conclusion
In this chapter, you have seen how to take the best from Microsoft Word Templates 
offered by the File ➤ New window and how to use your own Templates to quickly format 
long text documents using the same formatting standard for similar text paragraphs 
(document title, subtitle, chapters, body text for the first and other paragraphs).
Chapter 11  Creating and Using Templates

638
You also learned about how Microsoft Word can also use the Developers tab Controls 
and Form mode, and how to use Formulas in its tables to make rudimentary—and not so 
trustworthy—calculations, which require manual recalculations.
Summary
In this chapter you learned:
•	
That a Template is a special kind of document that automatically 
creates copies of itself.
•	
That Microsoft Word has different types of templates (empty 
templates, templates with one page formatting, templates for long 
documents).
•	
That you can create a document based on an existing Template by 
using the File ➤ New windows or by double-clicking the template in 
the folder it resides in.
•	
How to use Microsoft Word Controls and the Design Mode option to 
insert and use Controls in documents.
•	
How to restrict document editing using the Restrict Editing tool 
found in the Developer tab.

it is indeed bringing you a copy of the Normal.dotm template.
•	
That the Normal.dotm template is hidden in this system folder:
C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates
•	
That the Normal.dotm template cannot be changed while Microsoft 
Word is opened.

CHAPTER 12
Master and  
Subdocuments
In this chapter you will learn about Microsoft Word Master and Subdocuments feature, 
which allows you to manage independent documents (called Subdocuments) in a single 
file (called Master documents), to produce a final document that constitutes the essence 
of the collaborative work of different people enrolled to pursue the same task, such as the 
production of a book that contains independent chapters from many different authors.
Using the Master and Subdocuments approach, you can define a template of chapter 
and section names and from there create, split, and merge the subdocuments needed to 
compose the final product.
All documents cited in this chapter can be found by downloading the Chapter12.zip 
file from this Internet address:
https://github.com/apress/msft-word-secrets
The Master and Subdocuments Approach
Microsoft Word’s Master and Subdocuments feature is implemented by the Outline view 
option, which has already been introduced in the section “Using the Outline View” of 
Chapter 7.
There, you learned that whenever you turn on Outline view, you can best manage the 
Heading style paragraphs of your document, collapse and expand Heading paragraphs, 
and promote or demote the Outline level of one or many Heading style paragraphs with 
a click of the mouse, and easily change the position of big blocks of text by dragging 
one or more collapsed Heading style paragraphs to a new position (or moving them 
with the Move Up or Move Down tools and its associated shortcuts Alt+Shift+Up or 
Alt+Shift+Down arrows).

642
Microsoft Word also uses the Master document area of the Outlining tools tab to 
store the tools needed to deal with the Master/Subdocument approach of managing 
different files as a single one.
To show these tools, you must
	 1.	 Click the Outline tool found in the Views area of the View tab.
	 2.	 Select the Outlining tab that appears at the beginning of the 
Ribbon.
	 3.	 Click the Show Document command of the Master Document 
area of the Outlining tab (Figure 12-1).
Figure 12-1.  Use the Ouline view to show the Outlining tab, from where you 
can click the Show Document option of the Master Document area to show all 
available Master/Subdocument tools
Master Document Commands
By inspecting the Master Document area of the Outlining tabs you may note that it has 
different commands to deal with the Master/Subdocuments relationships (see Figure 12-­1).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

643
They are as follows:
•	
Show Document: expand the Master Document area to show other 
commands to deal with Master/Subdocuments.
•	
Collapse Subdocuments: alternate the Outline view (and Print 
Layout view) between file path (Collapsed Subdocument mode) and 
content (Expanded Subdocument mode).
•	
Create: allow creating a subdocument for any Heading paragraph 
style. The entire Heading branch (including its subheadings) will be 
included in the subdocument.
•	
Merge: allow merging one or more selected subdocuments in Outline 
view Expanded Subdocument mode into a single subdocument.
•	
Insert: show the Insert Subdocument dialog box from where you can 
navigate to the folder that contains the Microsoft Word file that must 
be inserted as a subdocument.
•	
Split: the inverse of the Merge command, allows splitting the current 
subdocument in Outline view Expanded Subdocument mode from 
text position to its end, in two different subdocuments.
•	
Unlink: load all subdocument content into the master document, 
breaking the Master/Subdocument link.
•	
Lock Document: lock the Master document from changes in any 
subdocument. Just the Master document text can be changed.
Establishing Master/Subdocument Relationships
The Master document is an empty main document that may (and probably will) have 
text inside it, and to succeed using Microsoft Word Master/Subdocument tools you must 
also follow these two basic rules:
•	
All documents (Master and Subdocuments) must be based on the same 
Template, to guarantee that they use the same style set and page sizes.
•	
All documents must use Heading styles to format their chapter and 
section paragraphs (or styles that have the Paragraph dialog box 
Outline level option set to any level different from Body text).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

644
You can establish Master/Subdocuments relationships by first creating the Master 
document based on the desired template and then use one of those two methods:
•	
Use Heading styles to create the first approach to the final document 
structure, defining chapter and section names (formatted with 
Heading1 to Heading9 styles).
•	
Insert the links to subdocuments that represent the document 
chapters.
The first approach is used when you can anticipate in advance how the final 
document must be, and then distribute the subdocuments created by it. The second 
approach is used when you already have the document chapters made in independent 
Microsoft Word files and need to join them together to assemble the final document.
Let’s see them both in more detail.
Creating Subdocuments from a Master Document
If you need to produce a document—like a book or manual—that is written by different 
people, or produced with a given “Table of Contents” structure, you will do better by first 
creating a document (called Master) that defines the final document content structure, 
and then creating the subdocuments from it.
You will need to follow these steps:
	 1.	 Create a new, empty document based on the same Template that 
all subdocuments are also based on.
	 2.	 Type each chapter name in its own paragraph (Chapter 1,  
Chapter 2…), formatting them with Heading 1 style (Outline level = 1).
	 3.	 Optionally, type inside each “Chapter n” Heading 1 style the 
section names, formatting them with Heading2 style.
	 4.	 Check the Outline command found in the Views area of the View 
tab of the Ribbon to show and select the Outlining tab.
	 5.	 Use the Create command found in the Master Document area of 
the Outlining tab to transform Heading1 style paragraph in an 
independent subdocument.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

645
Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to create a Master/Subdocument relationship based on a 
predefined document structure based on Heading styles.
Follow these simple steps:
	 1.	 Open a new document in Microsoft Word.
	 2.	 In the first paragraph type “Master Document” and format it with 
the Title style found in Style Gallery.
	 3.	 Insert three successive paragraphs, each one identifying a chapter 
number (Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and Chapter 3).
	 4.	 Apply the Heading1 style to each “Chapter” paragraph.
	 5.	 Click View ➤ Outline to show the Outline view and the Outlining tab.
	 6.	 Click Show Document button to show the Outline tools.
	 7.	 Select all three “Chapter” Heading1 paragraphs and click the 
Create command found in the Master Document area of the 
Outlining tab.
	 8.	 Close the Outline view.
Microsoft Word will transform each “Chapter” Heading1 style paragraph into a 
subdocument, surrounding it by a rectangle, with a subdocument icon placed at its left, 
using what is considered as Expanded Subdocument mode (Figure 12-2).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

646
Figure 12-2.  Type the Heading1 styles that will identify the final document 
structure, check the Outline view, and use the Create command found in the Master 
Document area of the Outlining tab to transform each Heading paragraph into a 
subdocument
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

647
After the Heading1 paragraphs have been transformed into Subdocuments, use 
File ➤ Save as command to choose an adequate folder to save the master document. 
Microsoft Word will propose the first document paragraph text (“Master Document”) 
as the file name for the Master document, and when you save it, it will also create 
independent Microsoft Word .docx files to identify each subdocument, naming them 
with their first Heading1 style paragraph text (it will save the Master Document.docx 
file and will also create Chapter1.docx, Chapter2.docx, and Chapter3.docx in same 
folder).
Using Collapsed Subdocuments Mode
To verify where each subdocument was saved, click Collapse Documents to uncheck 
this option to enter Collapsed Subdocuments mode (which will turn into Expand 
Subdocuments) and show each subdocument file path instead (Figure 12-3).
Figure 12-3.  Uncheck the Collapse Subdocuments command found in the Master 
Document area of the Outlining tab to enter the Collapsed Subdocuments view 
and see the path where each subdocument was saved
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

648
If the Outline view is in Collapsed Subdocuments mode and you close the Outline 
view (by clicking the Close Outline View button or selecting another view mode in the 
View tab), Microsoft Word will lock the subdocuments and will not show subdocument 
contents—just the path to them. Microsoft Word will also lock each subdocument, 
avoiding their deletion (Figure 12-4).
To gain access again to all subdocument content, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click Outline view in the View tab.
	 2.	 Click Expand Subdocuments to enter Expanded Subdocuments 
mode.
Whenever you enter again in Expanded Subdocument view, you can gain access 
to each subdocument content and close the Outline view to return to the Print Layout 
mode and work on the text as if it were a single file (Figure 12-5).
Figure 12-4.  Close the Outiline view to return to Print Layout view and note that 
you cannot access or delete the subdocument contents: just the paths to them are 
shown, and they are locked by the Collapse Subdocuments mode
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

649
Figure 12-5.  To gain access to the subdocuments inserted in a Master document, 
you must show the Outline view and click the Expand Subdocuments option to 
enter Expanded Subdocuments mode. Close the Outline view and note how the 
document is now formatted when the Show/Hide tool is checked
Attention  The file Master.zip found inside Chapter12.zip has the Master 
Document.docx, Chapter1.docx, Chapter2.docx, and Chapter3.docx files. Extract 
them to a new folder and open the Master document to try it.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

650
How Are Subdocument Paths Saved in the Master Document?
Figures 12-3 and 12-4 shows that the Master documents holds the path to each 
subdocument inserted in it, using the UNC rules to store file name paths, which hold the 
complete driver and folder structure where each subdocument is stored.
But Microsoft Word doesn’t really use such absolute file paths. If you move the 
Master and all Subdocuments to another folder, whenever you open the Master 
document from this new folder, it will search for the subdocuments in this new path, and 
if it finds them, will update its file path.
For example, Figures 12-3 and 12-4 show that these files were stored in this folder:
C:\Users\Flavio Morgado\Documents\Master
If I close Microsoft Word, copy the \Master folder from the \Documents folder and 
paste it in the C:\ root folder, whenever the C:\Master\Master Document.docx Master 
document is opened, it will search for its subdocuments in this new folder, and if it finds 
them, will automatically update its links—even though the original \Documents\Master 
folder still exists with the same files inside it (Figure 12-6).
Figure 12-6.  If the Master and Subdocuments are moved to a new folder in your 
drive or network, whenever you open the Master document, it will search for its 
subdocuments in the path it resides in, and if it finds them, it will automatically 
update its links
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

651
The lesson here is quite simple: Microsoft Word always stores the subdocuments as 
a relative path to the Master document, expecting that the Master/Subdocuments are 
always stored in the same folder.
Attention  Try not use different folders to store copies of your Master/
Subdocuments files. It may trick you into using an incorrect version of the final, 
updated subdocument files.
Section Breaks Inserted in Master/Subdocuments
Did you notice in Figures 12-2 to 12-5 that after changing Microsoft View from Outline 
to Print Layout and back again to Outline view, many Section Breaks suddenly appear in 
the document?
They were automatically inserted by Microsoft Word to keep the Master document 
page properties, while also keeping each subdocument page’s properties.
It works this way: whenever you select a Heading style and click Create command 
of the Outlining tools tab, Microsoft Word first adds a Section Breaks before the 
Subdocument, to guarantee that it can hold the Master document page formatting.  
It then inserts the subdocument, and inside the Subdocument, adds another section 
break, so the Subdocument can hold its own page properties.
Attention  When you use the Create command found in the Outlining tab, 
every Section Break automatically inserted by Microsoft Word inherits the page 
properties of the Master document.
Look again at Figure 12-5 and realize that there is a first Section Break (Continuous) 
after the “Master Document” text paragraph (inserted in the Master document), right 
before “Chapter 1” text.
Also note that immediately after “Chapter 1” appear two successive Section Break 
(Continuous) characters: the first one inserted inside Chapter1.docx Subdocument.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

652
Attention  The second Section Break was indeed inserted before “Chapter 2” 
text, repeating the same formatting rule for every Subdocument automatically 
created by the Create command.
To confirm where these Section Breaks were inserted, to enter Collapsed 
Subdocument mode (click Collapse Subdocuments), close the Outline view again to 
return to Print Layout mode and, having the Show/Hide tool checked, observe how 
each Subdocument is preceded by a Section Break (Continuous) inserted in the Master 
document (Figure 12-7).
Figure 12-7.  Close again the Outliine view to return to Print Layout view and note 
that the Master document received a Section Break (Continuous) hidden character 
before each Subdocument
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

653
To further realize how each subdocument received a Section Break at its end, 
Ctrl+Click its link in Print Layout view to open it in its own Microsoft Word window 
(Figure 12-8).
Figure 12-8.  Ctrl+Click any Subdocument in Outline view or Print Layout view 
and Collapsed Subdocuments mode to open it in its own Microsoft Word window
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

654
Yes, it is true! By imposing Master/Subdocuments relationships, Microsoft Word 
inserts a lot of Section Breaks that you must manage to not lose control over your final 
document formatting.
There is no problem if you delete any of these Section Breaks, or change their type 
(using the Section Start option found in Layout tab of the Page Setup dialog box).
Attention  Figure 12-5 and 12-7 shows that there is a disagreement between 
the type of Section Break shown by the Outline view in each subdocument 
(Continuous) and the one that appears whenever you Ctrl+Click any subdocument 
to open it in Microsoft Word window (Next Page).
By opening any subdocument in its own Microsoft Word window, you can make any 
changes to the subdocument text and formatting, and whenever you save and close its 
window, these changes will be instantly perceived in the Master document interface.
Double-click the Subdocument icon in Outline view to open any subdocument in its 
own Microsoft Word window.
Inserting Subdocuments in a Master Document
The second way by which you may create Master/Subdocument relationships is by 
inserting Subdocuments in another document—all based on the same Template to avoid 
page formatting problems.
Supposing that you have already defined where the subdocuments are stored on 
your computer or network, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Create a new, empty document based on the same Template that 
all subdocuments are also based on.
	 2.	 Save this document in the same folder where the subdocuments 
are stored, using the “Master” prefix—or name—to identify it.
	 3.	 Check the Outline command found in the Views area of the View 
tab of the Ribbon to show and select the Outlining tab.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

655
	 4.	 Click the Show Document option found in the Master Document 
area of the Outlining tab to show the Outline tools.
	 5.	 Click the Insert tool found in the Master Document area of the 
Outlining tab to show the Insert Subdocument dialog box from 
where you can select and insert the desired subdocument.
	 6.	 Repeat step 5 for every other subdocument that must be inserted 
inside the Master document.
Whenever a Subdocument is inserted in a Master document, Microsoft Word will 
also insert a Section break before it and another Section Break inside—as the Create 
command does.
Note however that if the Master and Subdocuments have different page layouts, 
these many Section Breaks may create a document with different types of page 
formatting. To fix this problem you will need to delete all inserted section breaks and 
insert them again, so they can receive, by inheritance, the same page formatting used by 
the Master document.
Exercise 2
The objective of this exercise is to show how Microsoft Word reacts when you insert 
Subdocuments in a Master document and they have different page formatting options.
Extract MasterSubdocuments.zip file from Chapter12.zip file and extract its contents 
to a new folder. It has the Master.docx, SubDocument1.docx, Subdocument2.docx, and 
Subdocument3.docx documents based on the default Normal.dotm template.
The Master.docx document has a 5×4 page size and the “Master Document” text 
followed by an Odd Page Section Break (Figure 12-9). It also has two empty paragraphs 
in its second, blank page.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

656
Figure 12-9.  The Master.docx file that you can extract from MasterSubdocuments.
zip file is formatted with a 5×4 page. Its first paragraph identifies the document 
and its two pages are separated by an Odd Page Section Break
The Subdocument1.docx, Subdocument2.docx, and Subdocument3.docx have texts 
that identify their contents followed by an empty paragraph, and all three documents 
were formatted with a 5×6 page size (Figure 12-10).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

657
Attention  The Next Page Section Break inserted at the end of any subdocument 
always removes the last paragraph break to avoid inserting a new document page. 
This is why Subdocument1.docx, Subdocument2.docx, and Subdocument3.docx 
have two paragraph breaks on their second pages—the last one will be removed.
Figure 12-10.  The Subdocument1.docx (and Subdocument2.docx) has a 5×4 
page size and two empty paragraph breaks. The last one is always removed (or 
exchanged) by a Section Break when the document is inserted as a subdocument
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

658
Follow these steps to insert its three subdocuments using the Outlining tab:
	 1.	 Open the Master.docx document and note that it has two small 
pages, separated by a Section Break (Odd Page).
	 2.	 Click Outline view command of the View tab to show the 
Outlining tab.
	 3.	 Press Ctrl+End to go to the end of the document.
	 4.	 Click the Show Document to show the Master Document tools.
	 5.	 Use the Insert command found in the Master Document area 
of the Outlining tab to select and insert Subdocument1.docx in 
Master.docx (Figure 12-11).
Figure 12-11.  Use the Insert command of the Outlining tab to select and insert 
Subdocument1.docx as a subdocument of Master.docx Master document
Attention  According to Figure 12-11 Microsoft Word inserted two Section 
Breaks: one in the Master document (Next Page) and other in the Subdocument1.
docx (Continuous).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

659
	 6.	 Double-click the Subdocument1.docx Subdocument icon to 
open Subdocument1.docx in its own Microsoft Word window 
(Figure 12-12) and note that the Continuous Section Break shown 
by Figure 12-11 is indeed a Next Page Section Break.
Figure 12-12.  The Subdocument1.docx exchanges its last paragraph break with a 
Next Page Section Break, which disagrees with what is shown by the Outline view 
of the Master.docx document shown in Figure 12-11
	 7.	 Close Subdocument1.docx to return to Master.docx document in 
Outline view.
	 8.	 Press Ctrl+End to go to the end of Master.docx document and use 
again the Insert command to select and insert Subdocument2.
docx and Subdocument3.docx as subdocuments of Master.docx 
document (Figure 12-13).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

660
Attention  Double-click Subdocument2.docx and Subdocument3.docx icons to 
show each file in its own Microsoft Word window and note that each lost its last 
paragraph break, having now a Next Page Section Break in its place—although the 
Outline view keeps showing that each one has a Continuous Section Break at its end.
Looking to Figure 12-13 status bar you may note that the Master.docx document now 
has nine logical pages (eight physical sheets of paper, because it has an Odd Page Section 
Break on its first page that increases page counting by one, missing logical Page 2).
Figure 12-13.  After inserting the three subdocuments in Master.docx, the final 
Master document will become full of Next Page Section Breaks. The total number 
of pages shown in the Status Bar reflects the page count for the Master and all 
Subdocuments it points to
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

661
Close Outline view mode to return to Print Layout view and note that Master.docx 
document preserves its 4×5 page size for each Next Page Section Break inserted in it, 
while the Next Page Section Break inserted in each subdocument makes it preserve its 
own page size, just as it should (Figure 12-14).
Figure 12-14.  By closing Outline view, you will return to Print Layout view, from 
where you can use the Zoom tool to inspect the Master.docx document. Note that 
it kept its 4×5 page size in each page before the Next Page Section Breaks inserted 
in it, and also kept each Subdocument page size by inserting Next Page Section 
Breaks inside each subdocument
Restoring Master Page Settings in Subdocuments
You can easily restore the Master.docx 5×4 page size in all subdocuments inserted in it by 
manually removing the Next Page Section Break inserted inside each subdocument file, 
leaving the Next Page Section Breaks inserted in the Master.docx document untouched.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

662
After removing them you can change all Master document Section Breaks to 
a desired standard (Odd Page Section Break, for instance), to guarantee that each 
subdocument text will begin on an odd page.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click Outline view command of the View tab to show the 
Outlining tab.
	 2.	 Check the Show Document option to show the rectangle around 
each subdocument (this will allow you to easily select the Section 
Break inserted at its end).
	 3.	 In each subdocument, click the Next Page Section Break at its end 
and press Delete to remove it (Figure 12-15).
Figure 12-15.  Click the Section Break located at the end of each Subdocument 
and press Delete key to remove it
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

663
	 4.	 When all subdocuments no longer have Next Page Section Breaks 
at their ends, close the Outline view to return to Print Layout view 
and the Master.docx document will now have just one page.
	 5.	 Also remove the Next Page Section Break inserted before the first 
subdocument (the one inserted below the Odd Page Section Break 
that already existed in the document).
Attention  In a real situation, to easily move to the end of each subdocument 
text and find the Section Break you want to remove, you may need to select 
Show Level = Level 1 in the Outline Tools area to show only the Heading1 styles, 
collapsing the document text.
Alternatively, you may also double-click each Subdocument icon to show it in its 
own Microsoft Word window, press Ctrl+End to go the subdocument end, and 
remove its last Section Break.
As each subdocument has the Section Break at its end removed, it inherits the 
page properties of the section above it; these properties are stored by the Section Break 
inserted in the Master document. When you finish, the Master.docx document in Outline 
view will be like Figure 12-16, having just the Next Page Section Breaks inserted in the 
Master document, after the end of each subdocument.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

664
Close the Outline view to return to Page Layout view and note that now Master.docx 
Master document has just two pages that uses its default 5×4 size, with all subdocument 
paragraphs printing on its first page (Figure 12-17).
Figure 12-16.  This is how the Master document will look like after all Next Page 
Section Breaks have been removed from inside each subdocument
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

665
Attention  I do not have a decent explanation for why the Master.docx Next Page 
Section breaks were changed to Continuous Section Breaks as the subdocument 
section breaks were removed. It is a very unexpected Microsoft Word behavior…
Making All Subdocuments Begin on an Odd Page
To make all subdocuments begin on an odd page, with all the formatting options 
imposed by the Master.docx document (including header/footer area, if any), just 
change each Section Break type in the Page Setup dialog box.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+A to select the entire Master.docx document (including 
all subdocuments text).
	 2.	 Double-click the ruler to show the Page Layout dialog box.
Figure 12-17.  After all of the subdocument’s Section Breaks were removed, the 
Master.docx Master document recovers its default 5×4 page size for all its pages!
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

666
	 3.	 In the Layout tab, select Section start = Odd Page (Figure 12-18).
	 4.	 Verify if Applies to = Selected Sections and press OK to close the 
Page Setup dialog box.
Now, Master.docx Master document has four physical pages (seven logical pages, 
because some even pages are missing due to each Odd Page Section Break): one for its 
cover, and one to begin each subdocument inserted in it (Figure 12-19).
Figure 12-18.  Press Ctrl+A to select the entire document, use the Selection start 
option to define the type of Section Break, and verify that Apply to = Selected 
sections
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

667
Attention  The MasterSubdocuments (done).zip file, which you can also extract 
from the Chapter12.zip file, has these exercise documents as shown in Figure 12-­18.
Attention  The reader is invited to try the other Master Documents tools, like 
Split (to break a subdocument in two), Merge (to merge two subdocuments into 
one), and Unlink (to break the Master/Subdocument relationship and insert the 
subdocument text in the Master document).

Creating an Index
Index is the name given to the list of words, terms, and topics that is often found in the 
last pages of technical documents, along with the page numbers where they appear in 
the text.
To be correctly built, its terms must capture the essence of the issues they represent 
using keywords that can quickly lead the reader to the desired document part. That is 
why it is made by the “Indexer,” a profession that can be pursued through self-study 
courses taught by experienced indexers, often under the auspices of the American 
Society for Indexing.
Microsoft Word offers the Mark Entry command found in the Index area of the 
Reference tab to create a simple index using up to three levels of indexing, which must 
be made using the entire document text—a task that is quite suited to the Master/
Subdocument approach.
It works this way:
	 1.	 Prepare the Index words in advance.
	 2.	 Create the Master/Subdocument relationships, using the Insert 
command found in the Master Document area of the Outlining 
tab, to insert all chapter files in a master document.
	 3.	 Associate all desired words to the appropriate Index tem using the 
Mark Entry tool.
	 4.	 Generate the Index at the desired place in the document (usually 
in a new subdocument inserted at its end, or at the end of its very 
last chapter).
How to Tag an Index
The first step needed to create an Index is to prepare in advance the words that must be 
tagged in the text, either alone or under a given keyword that represents a set of similar 
words.
Attention  Although Microsoft Word can easily tag the words for you to create an 
index of sorts, it’s practically guaranteed to be substandard.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

669
Knowing in advance that this is a profession, you may take a look of some book 
Indexes to realize how they were prepared, and then try to create your own, which is not 
an obvious or easy task.
The Apress technical team of editors asks for every one of its authors to create such a 
list of terms or words, offering a very well-prepared Index Keyword document which has 
a section called “How to Capture the Information.” Among other things, this document 
states that
•	
Related concepts that should be grouped together, like:
Formatting
        Font
        Paragraph
        Styles
•	
Use no more than two levels of subentries
Formatting
        Font
                Font Dialog box
                principles of use
                Home tab
•	
Information should be indexed under a main noun (or compound 
noun) and not under adjectives. For example, instead of using these 
three Index terms:
Formatting characters
Formatting paragraphs
Formatting styles
	
use instead:
Formatting
        characters
        paragraphs
        styles
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

670
They also offer some general rules to tag entries and subentries:
•	
Main entries begin with capital letter (do not use numbers or 
symbols).
•	
A subentry must be indented and begin with lowercase, unless it is a 
proper noun.
•	
If a keyword has an abbreviation and a long form, use the more 
prevalent one.
Quite simple rules, very well prepared for a good orientation from where to start.
So, before making your index, you should also know in advance that by using 
Microsoft Word and the Master/Subdocuments approach, you can browse all the 
independent chapters of a book, one page at a time, to find and tag the words that may 
compose the book Index.
And once you find them, you can tag the Index entries in two ways:
•	
Manually: using the Mark Index Entry dialog box.
•	
Automatically: creating a concordance table file.
The Mark Index Entry Dialog Box
Whenever you click the Mark Entry command found in the Index area of the Reference 
tab of the Ribbon, Microsoft Word shows the Mark Index Entry dialog box, from where 
you can define how each Index entry must be tagged (Figure 12-20).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

671
The Mark Index Entry dialog box has these options:
•	
Main entry: to type a single Index entry or a noun that will aggregate 
other related terms.
•	
Subentry: to insert the second-level word that will be tagged in the 
text, under the noun that is typed in the Main entry.
Attention  To insert a third-level subentry, type in the Subentry text box the 
subentry text followed by a colon (:) and the third-level subentry text.
•	
Cross reference: to insert an Index entry like “see <word>”.
•	
Current page: to tag the desired entry with its own page number.
•	
Page range: to tag the desired entry associated to a page range.
Figure 12-20.  Use the Mark Entry command found in the Index area of the 
References tab to show the Mark Index Entry dialog box, from where you can tag 
all desired document words as they may appear in the document Index
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

672
•	
Bold, Italic: allow tag the Main entry or its subentry using bold, italic, 
or both.
•	
Mark: mark just this reference in the selected document page.
•	
Mark all: run through all the book text for the desired word and mark 
all references with the same tag.
By pressing Mark or Mark all, you will mark the desired entry in the document, while 
Microsoft Word will automatically check the Show/Hide tool in the Home tab of the 
Ribbon to show the hidden entry fields inserted in the text.
Mark a Single-Level Entry
You can perform this process of tagging a single, main word in the document using two 
different methods:
	 1.	 By typing the desired word in the Main entry, leaving the Subentry 
field blank.
	 2.	 By selecting the desired word in the text and clicking the Main 
entry text box to automatically copy the selected word while also 
clearing the Subentry text box.
Both methods will insert a hidden Microsoft Word field in the document that uses 
this syntax (where <Main word> is the word you typed)
{ XE “<Main word>” }
Mark a Two-Level Entry
To tag a two-level Index entry, using a noun in the Main entry and a term as subentry, 
you need to follow a different approach:
	 1.	 Select the desired word to be tagged in the text.
	 2.	 Click the Main entry text box to automatically copy the selected 
word while also clearing the Subentry text box.
	 3.	 Cut the word from the Main entry text box and paste it into the 
Subentry text box.

	 4.	 Type the desired Noun in the Main entry text box.
	 5.	 Press Mark (to mark a single entry) or Mark all (to mark all 
document entries).
Whenever you do this type of tagging, Microsoft Word will insert a hidden field in the 
document that uses this syntax (where <Main word> is the word you typed in Main word, 
and <subentry> is the word selected in the text, separated by a colon).
{ XE “<Main word>:<subentry>” }
Mark a Three-Level Entry
To tag a third-level Index entry, follow the steps used in previous section to tag a two-­
level entry.
Then press a colon at the end of the Subentry word and type the third-level entry. 
Microsoft Word will insert a hidden field in the document that uses this syntax (where 
<Main word> is the word you typed in Main word, <subentry> is the second-level entry, 
and <sub-subentry> is the word typed for the third-level text), each one separated by a 
colon:
{ XE “<Main word>:<subentry>:<sub-subentry>” }
Tag Index Words
Before you begin to tag words in the document, it is desirable for you to aware that
•	
By pressing Mark all, Microsoft Word will tag all equal words found in 
the document (meaning that some entries may appear with too many 
page references on the Index).
•	
You can always press Ctrl+Z to undo the last Mark entry made.
•	
You can always check the Show/Hide tool in the Home tab of the 
Ribbon to show the Index fields inserted in the text, removing or 
changing its content (which appears between double quotes inside 
the { XE … } hidden field).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

674
Insert the Index
Once the Index fields have been inserted in the document, use the Insert Index 
command found in the Index area of the References tab to show the Index dialog box 
(Figure 12-21).
Figure 12-21.  Use the Insert Index command found in the Index area of the 
References tab to show the Index dialog box. Click OK to create the Index in the 
selected point of the document
Whenever you click OK in the Index dialog box (or click AutoMark button and select 
a concordance file), Microsoft Word will
•	
Alphabetically sort the Index entries.
•	
Reference them by their page numbers.
•	
Find and remove duplicate entries found in the same page 
(considering the current page size).
•	
Display the index in the document.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

675
The Index dialog box has these options:
•	
Type: specify type of the two-level entry to be created:
•	
Indented: insert each Main entry sublevel in its own row.
•	
Run-in: insert all Main entry sublevels in the same row, separated 
by a comma.
•	
Columns: define the number of columns for the Index that will be 
created (default is two columns);
•	
Language: define the language to be applied to the Index entries, 
so the Spelling Checker can verify them (all current installed 
dictionaries will appear on the list).
•	
Right align page numbers: adds a Tab character after each Index 
entry, aligning the page number to the right column border.
•	
Format: choose the desired format for the Index that will be created.
•	
Mark Entry: show the Mark Index Entry dialog box.
•	
AutoMark: select a concordance file, from where Microsoft Word will 
find the words and Index entries you want to use.
•	
Modify: show the Style dialog box, from where you can modify 
Index1 to Index9 styles used to format the Index.
Using a Concordance File
A concordance file is a Microsoft Word file that has just a two-column concordance 
table:
•	
the first column indicates the word to be searched in the text that 
must be tagged as an Index entry (case sensitive).
•	
the second column specifies the Index entry text.
Attention  To specify a second-level Index entry, separate the Main entry and the 
Subentry by a colon; to specify a third-level Index entry, type another colon after 
the Subentry and type Sub-Subentry.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

676
Concordance tables are great to tag the same word as different Index entries. For 
example, the “Font dialog box” term can be tagged as a Main entry or as a Subentry of 
the “Dialog Box” entries.
Figure 12-22 shows a simple concordance table that shows in its first column examples 
for double-tagging the “Font dialog box” text either as a Main entry (Font) or as a Subentry 
(Dialog box:Font), and the “Paragraph dialog box” text either as a Main entry (Paragraph) 
or as a subentry (Dialog box:Paragraph). The last row shows an example of how tag the 
“Page break before” text as a third-level entry (Formatting:Paragraph:Text flow).
Once you have built and saved the concordance table in a given file and folder, use 
the Insert Index command to show the Index dialog box, click the AutoMark button, and 
select the file with the concordance table.
Microsoft Word will tag the text very quickly for you!
Removing Index Field Codes
Once a document is tagged with Index field codes, Microsoft Word offers no simple way 
to remove them and start again, unless you do a Find and Replace operation using the 
Special ➤ Field option (which adds the ^d find code to the Find what text box).
Figure 12-22.  Example of concordance table to automatically tagged Index 
entries. The first column has the word that must be searched in the text (case 
sensitive). The second column has the Index entry text. Use a colon to separate a 
Main entry from a subentry (or a subentry from a sub-subentry)
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

677
Since the Index field codes always begin with { XE, follow these steps to find any 
Index field code and remove it from the document:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+H to show the Find and Replace dialog box with the 
Replace tab selected.
	 2.	 In Find What text box:
•	
Click Special ➤ Field option:
	
Find what: ^d
•	
Type a space character and XE:
	
Find what: ^d XE
	 3.	 Press Find next to find and select the first Index field code.
	 4.	 Keep the Replace with option empty, and use either Replace or 
Replace all to remove the Index entries.
Attention  Since the Index entry is inserted between double quotes, to find an 
specific Index entry, use ^d XE “<WordInitials>”, where <WordInitials> are the 
letters that begin the Index entry. For example, to find all Index fields that tag the 
word “Home”, search for ^d XE “Home”.
Exercise 3
The objective of this exercise is to show how you can use the Mark Index Entry to tag 
words in a text and generate the Index of words at the end of a document.
To perform this exercise, extract the “European Convention of Human Rights 
Headings.docx” document from Chapter12.zip file and open it in Microsoft Word.
Attention  Note that this is not a long or technical document that deserves an 
Index at its end. It is used just as a source for this exercise.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

678
Marking Single-Level Index Entries
Go to the document’s Table of Contents and note that it has basic words formatted with 
Heading2 styles and used as chapter titles that deserve to be tagged as Index entries. 
Following the directions to create an Index, I will propose tagging these words as main 
index entries (the ones that are chapter titles):
•	
Dignity
•	
Freedoms
•	
Equality
•	
Solidarity
•	
Citizens rights
•	
Justice
Follow these steps to mark each of these words in the text as Index entries:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+Home to go to text beginning.
	 2.	 Press Ctrl+F to show the Navigation pane, and click Headings to 
show the Heading styles.
	 3.	 Click Mark Entry command of the Index area of the References tab 
of the Ribbon to show the Mark Index Entry dialog box.
	 4.	 Click “DIGNITY” Heading2 style in the Navigation Pane to select 
this paragraph in the text.
	 5.	 Double-click the word “DIGNITY” to select it in the text and 
click the Main entry text box of the Mark Entry dialog box to 
automatically copy the selected word.
Attention  The Mark all button of the Mark Index Entry text box is just enabled 
when you first select the desired word in the text before clicking the Mark entry 
text box.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

679
	 6.	 Click Mark all command to mark all occurrences of the word 
“DIGNITY” in the text (Figure 12-23).
The “DIGNITY” keyword will be marked with the { XE “DIGNITY” } hidden field right 
next to each occurrence in the text.
Repeat steps 4 to 6 to also select and mark all other chapter title words found in the 
text (FREEDOMS, EQUALITY, SOLIDARITY, CITIZENS RIGHTS, and JUSTICE).
Figure 12-23.  Use the Navigation Pane (Ctrl+F) Headings view to easily select the 
text that must be tagged as an Index entry. Select the desired text, click the Mark 
entry text box to copy it, and use the Mark all command button to mark all its 
ocurrences in the text
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

680
Attention  The same text in the document can receive more than one Index field 
code. It may appear as a Main entry or a Subentry in the Index.
Mark a Two-Level Index Entry
There are some expressions in the “European Convention of Human Rights Headings.
docx” document that may deserve to be grouped under the same noun to produce a two-­
level index entry.
For example, there are a lot of “Right to” entries in the text (Right to life, Right to 
integrity, Right to liberty, etc.), and many other “Freedom of” expressions (Freedom 
of thought, Freedom of expression, Freedom of association, etc.), that express the 
highest standards of ethics for humankind that were so well established in this beautiful 
document, which deserves to be read by and realized for all mankind, and incidentally 
also deserves to receive a two-level index entry.
For example, note that inside the “DIGNITY” chapter, “Article 2” entry has the 
expression “Right to life”, which should be put inside the “Right to” main Index entry 
using “life” as subentry.
Follow these steps to create it:
	 1.	 In the Navigation Pane, select “Article 2” Heading3 style under 
“DIGNITY” Heading2 style.
	 2.	 Double-click the “life” word of the “Right to life” expression to 
select it in the text.
	 3.	 Click the Main entry text box of the Mark Index Entry dialog 
box to automatically copy it and clear the Subentry text box 
(Figure 12-24).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

681
Figure 12-24.  Double-click the entries that you want to group in a two-level Index 
entry and click the Main entry text box of the Mark Index Entry dialog box, to 
automatically copy it and clear the Subentry text box
	 4.	 Select the “life” word in Main entry text box, and press Ctrl+X to 
cut it to Clipboard.
	 5.	 Click Subentry text box and press Ctrl+C to paste it.
	 6.	 In Main entry text box, type the “Right to” expression.
	 7.	 Press Mark all to mark all its occurrences in the document as a 
second-level Index entry (Figure 12-25).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

682
The “life” keyword will be marked as a second-level index entry of the first-level 
“Right to” index entry with the { XE “Right to:life” } hidden field right next to each word 
occurrence in the text.
Repeat the last steps to also mark “Right to integrity”, “Right to life”, “Right to 
marriage”, and all other “Rights” that each human being deserves in his or her time on 
Earth and are so well established in the document.
Figure 12-25.  While the word "life" is still selected in the text, type "Right to" in 
the Main entry text box, "life" in the Subentry text box, and click Mark all to mark 
every ocurrence of "life" as a sublevel under the "Right to" main index entry
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

683
Attention  To mark an entry like “Right to respect”, you must select the entire 
expression “Right to respect” in the document and click the Main entry text box 
to copy it. Then cut just the Respect option of the Main entry and paste it in the 
Subentry text box, producing markup as in the following:
Main entry = Right to
Subentry = respect
By pressing Mark all, all “Right to respect” entries will be tagged in the text  
(the “respect” word alone will not)!
Use the Find what text box of the Navigation page and the Previous and Next 
buttons below it to quickly find what you want to tag in the text. For example, type 
“right to” to select all such expressions in the document.
Inserting the Index
When all Index entries are tagged in the text, it is time to generate the Index by following 
these steps:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+End to go to the end of the file.
	 2.	 Press Ctrl+Break (or use the Layout ➤ Breaks command to insert 
the desired page break), so the Index begins on a new page.
	 3.	 Type “Index” and apply Heading1 style.
	 4.	 Press Enter to insert a paragraph after the “Index” heading.
	 5.	 Use the Insert Index command found in the Index area of the References 
tab of the Ribbon to show the Index dialog box (Figure 12-26).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

684
	 6.	 Press OK to insert the Index at current text position.
Figure 12-27 shows the Index created by the default options shown in Figure 12-24 
for the “European Convention of Human Rights Headings.docx” document, after it had 
been tagged by the proposed Main and Subentries. Note that some entries appear on 
many different page numbers (like “life”, “security”, etc.).
Figure 12-26.  Use the Insert Index command found in the Index area of the 
References tab to show the Index dialog box, from where you can select the format 
of Index to be inserted in the document
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

685
As with the Table of Contents object, you can click any of its Index entries to select it 
(all entries will become grayed) and press F9 function key to update it.
Attention  Note that Microsoft Word enclosed the Index between two Section 
Breaks so it can be printed in a two-column format (the Continuous Section Break 
below the Index holds this column information).
To see that the Index inserted is indeed a Microsoft Word object created by a Field, 
press Alt+F9 to activate the Field code view (Figure 12-28). Press Alt+F9 again to return to 
Field value view and regenerate the Index.
Figure 12-27.  This is the From Template Index format created at the end of the 
“European Convention of Human Rights Headings.docx” document, after it had 
been tagged by the proposed Main and Subentries
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

686
Attention  Extract the “European Convention of Human Rights Headings - Index 
tags.docx” document from Chapter12.zip file for an Index field tagged version of 
this file. Open it in Microsoft Word and check the Show/Hide tool in the Home tab of 
the Ribbon to see its Index field codes. Go to the document’s last page (Ctrl+End) 
and use the Reference tab, Insert Index command to generate the document Index.
Uncheck the Show/Hide tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon to hide the Index 
hidden fields inserted in the text.
Fix Index Field Entries
After an Index is inserted, you must analyze it to see if the Index fields inserted in the text 
lead to the desired final result. There’s a good chance that you will find some defects and 
need to fix some Index field codes inserted in the text to produce a well-formatted Index.
The following are some of the common defects found in an Index:
•	
Duplicate Main entries: Index entries are case sensitive (“Right of” 
and “right of” typed in the main entry will create different Index 
nouns).
•	
Too long Index entries that must be separated.
•	
Too many successive pages for the same Index entry.
•	
Bad word chosen for a Main entry that must be changed.
Figure 12-28.  The Index is indeed a Microsoft Word object created by Field code. 
By pressing Alt+F9 you can alternate to Field code view and see how the Field 
dialog box options were implemented for the Index Field code (press Alt+F9 again 
to regenerate the Index and return to Print Layout view)
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

687
And many other types of Index defects that may need to operated over the Microsoft 
Word fields used to generate the Index.
Look again to Figure 12-27 and note that some of these errors are present in the 
Index created. For example, it has three similar Main entries that can be changed to just 
one (“Right of”, “right to”, and “Right to” can be changed to just “Right to”) and also has 
some overly long entries that could be broken in two (in the “Right to” Main entry you 
find “effective remedy and to a fair trial”, “ Freedom of movement and of residence”, “ 
presumption of innocence and right of defence”).
To fix these Index defects you must
•	
Keep an eye on the Index (you may print it or split Microsoft Word 
window).
•	
Check the Show/Hide tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon so you can 
see the Index fields.
•	
Use the Navigation Panel Find to search for the field that represents 
the Index entry.
•	
Edit the Index entry in the text.
Let’s see how you can do these changes in the Index using just Microsoft Word tools.
Split Microsoft Word to Fix Index Field Code Entries
Since the Index entries have no hyperlinks to the text position that they represent (they 
do not act like the Table of Contents entries for which you can use Ctrl+Click to jump to 
where they are in the document), to change Index field entries you must know the page 
number where the Index field code was inserted.
And the best way to do this is to use the Split command found in the Window area 
of the View tab to split the Microsoft Word document window into two areas: the upper 
area will be used to fix the text, while the bottom area will be used to show the Index.
Figure 12-29 shows the Microsoft Window for the “European Convention of Human 
Rights Headings - Index tags.docx” document in a split Microsoft Word window after 
receiving the Index on its last page: the upper part is at the text beginning (page 1) while 
the bottom part is at the document Index (page 18).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

688
Attention  The Split command changes its name to Remove Split when the 
Microsoft Word document window is split. To return the document window to 
its original single area, double-click the split bar, drag the split bar to the top or 
bottom areas of the document window, or click the Remove Split command.
Figure 12-29.  Use the Split command found in the Window area of the View tab 
to split the Microsoft Word document window in two areas that can show different 
document parts
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

689
After the Microsoft Word window is split into two areas, to find and correct an Index 
field entry, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Scroll to the bottom document area that shows the Index to find 
the page number for the Index field that you want to fix.
	 2.	 Click the upper document area to select it.
	 3.	 Press F5 to show the Go to dialog box.
	 4.	 Type the page number and press Enter to move to that page.
	 5.	 Locate the Index field on the page and change the text inside the 
double quotes of the { EX “…” } Index Field code.
Changing an Index Field Code Entry
Looking one more time to Figure 12-27 you will note that the “Right of” and “right to” 
Main entries have just one Index entry each; they can be changed to a “Right to” entry so 
the Index has just the “Right to” Main entry.
Supposing that the document window is split in two areas, with the bottom area 
showing the Index, and that the Show/Hide command is checked in the Home tab of the 
Ribbon, follow these steps to make this change:
	 1.	 Use the scroll bar of the bottom document area to locate the 
“Right of” index entry page number (page 13, see Figure 12-27).
	 2.	 Click the upper document area to select it.
	 3.	 Press Ctrl+F to show the Navigation Pane.
	 4.	 In the Search text box of the Navigation Pane type “right of:” (the 
colon is important, because it is used in the Index Field code to 
separate the Main entry from the Subentry, Figure 12-30).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

690
	 5.	 Change the { XE “Right of:access to documents” } field code to { 
XE “Right to:access to documents” }
Attention  Whenever a Microsoft Word document window is split, you can apply 
different Zoom factors to each document part.
Figure 12-30.  Use the Navigation Pane Search text box to help you find the Index 
field codes that must be changed. Remember to type a colon for the search string, 
because Main entries always use it to separate it from the Subentry in the Index 
field code
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

691
To change the three occurrences of “right to” in the Index to “Right to” (uppercase), 
follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the upper area of the split document window to select it.
	 2.	 In the Navigation Pane, click the Search type box arrow to expand 
it and select Options to show the Find Options dialog box.
	 3.	 Check Match case option and close the Find Options dialog box.
	 4.	 In the Navigation Pane Search text box type “right to:”.
	 5.	 Microsoft Word will find four occurrences. Use the Previous and 
Next buttons to select each one and change each Index field code 
to “Right to:” (Figure 12-31).
Figure 12-31.  Expand the Navigation Pane Search text box, select Options to show 
the Find Options dialog box, and check Match case option. Close the Find Options 
dialog box and search for "right to:" (note the colon) to find four ocurrences (use 
the Next and Previous buttons to change each Index field code to "Right to:")
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

692
Update the Index
After the changes have been made in the Index field codes, is time to update the Index 
to verify if the changes made in the Index field codes inserted in the text generated the 
desired results.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the Index located in the bottom area of the split document 
window (it will become grayed).
	 2.	 Press F9 to update it.
Now, the document Index will have just one “Right to” main entry index (Figure 12-­32).
Figure 12-32.  To update the Index after making changes to the Index field code 
inserted in the text, click the Index and press F9 function key. This figure shows that 
the "Right of" and "right to" main entries were removed from the Index
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

693
Dividing an Index Field Code Entry
To divide a long Index field code entry (one that deserves to appear as two different 
Index entries), you must
	 1.	 Select the desired Index entry in the text.
	 2.	 Press Ctrl+C to copy it to Clipboard.
	 3.	 Press Ctrl+V to paste a copy of it right next to the same Index  
field code.
	 4.	 Change both Index field codes to reflect the new desired entries.
Let’s see how we can change the Index “Right to” subentry “presumption of 
innocence and right of defence” to these two subentries: “presumption of innocence” 
and “right of defence”. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Click the upper area of the document window.
	 2.	 Click the Navigation pane Search text box and type 
“:presumption” (note the colon that begins the search string, 
which will appear just in the Index entry).
	 3.	 Select the entire Index field code in the text and press Ctrl+C to 
copy it to clipboard.
	 4.	 Press Right arrow to go the end of the Index field code and press 
Ctrl+V to paste a second copy of it.
	 5.	 In the first copy, change the Index field code text to this:
{ XE “Right to:presumption of innocence” }
	 6.	 In the first copy, change the Index field code text to this (Figure 12-33):
{ XE “Right to:right of defence” }
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

694
	 7.	 Click the Index to select it (it will become grayed) and press F9 to 
update it.
Figure 12-34 shows the Index after such a change has been made in the Index field 
code in the text.
Figure 12-33.  To divide an Index entry, duplicate it in the document and change 
both entries to the desired text. This figure shows how the "Right to" subentry, 
"presumption of innocence and right of defence" was changed to two new 
subentries Index field codes: "presumption of innocence" and "right of defence"

Attention  The “European Convention of Human Rights Headings with Index fixed.
docx” document that you can extract from Chapter12.zip file, has the final version 
of the Index, as proposed by previous sections.
Exercise 4 (the Last)
The objective of this exercise—the last in this book—is to show how to use the Outlining 
tools to assemble a long document using Master/Subdocuments relationships and many 
other formatting tips previously discussed in earlier chapters of this book.
It will produce the “Book of Tales” using tales and fables from Aesop, Andersen, and 
the Brothers Grimm, spread in three different Microsoft Word documents formatted with 
the same Fables.dotx Template, based on a 6×9 page size.
You must extract the Tales.zip file from the Chapter12.zip file, and then extract all 
its documents to a single folder of your choice. Table 12-1 details the Microsoft Word 
document you must extract from Tales.zip and its contents.
Table 12-1.  Microsoft Word Document Inside Tales.zip, Its Contents, and the

Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

696
Attention  As explained in the section “Associating a Document with a Template” 
of Chapter 11, if a Microsoft Word document is associated to the Fables.dotx 
template, and this template is found in the same document folder file, the 
Templates and Add-ins dialog box (found in Developer tab, Document Templates 
command) will always show it associated to this local template. In other words, if 
you want to change the appearance of all documents extracted from Tales.zip file, 
you just need to change the Fables.dotx template styles.
Inspect “Fables.dotx” Template
Begin by opening the Fables.dotx template in Microsoft Word, so you can understand 
how it was formatted.
Figure 12-35 shows its first three pages.
Figure 12-35.  The Fables.dotx template, which you can extract from the Fables.
zip file, has six pages to allow you note how it uses Vertical aligment = Center in 
Section 1 to automatically align the cover page, along with the way it formats the 
Title, Subtitle, Heading1, Heading2, and Normal styles and the First, Even and 
Odd page headers
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

697
Considering that you have selected the first document page, double-click the ruler to 
show the Page Setup dialog box and note that it has these formatting options:
•	
Page size tab: Height = 9“; Width = 6”; Multiple pages = Mirror margins.
•	
Layout tab: Vertical alignment = Center (for first page only),
The Mirror margins options allow you to alternate the inside margin from left (to an 
odd page) to right (to an even page), giving space to bind the document correctly. The 
Vertical alignment option = Center applied to Section 1 allows the first document page 
(which will hold the book title, author name, and date of publication) to automatically 
center align on the page.
The Fables.dotx uses a modified version of the Black & White (Classic) style set, 
showing formatting options examples for the Title, Subtitle, Heading1, Heading2 (which 
has the Page Break Before option set), and Normal styles, alternating the alignment of 
the author name (Header) and page number (Footer) on the odd and even pages.
Also note that each document page has a border surrounding it, created by the 
Borders and Shading dialog box (Figure 12-36), which you can show using the Borders 
command found in the Page Background area of the Design tab.
Figure 12-36.  Use the Borders and Shadding dialog box to select an Art that can 
be applied to all pages of the document, the Options command show the Borders 
and Shadding Options dialog box from where you can define the border margins, 
its position (from page borders or pabe margins - Text), and other options
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

698
Attention  Although not deeply approached in this book, the Borders and Shading 
dialog box allows you to define the background paper color and a border to be 
applied not just to text paragraphs, but also to the document page. The reader is 
invited to explore its usage to further improve the appearance of the documents. 
Just remember the basic rule: less formatting is more efficient!
Inspect “The Book of Tales Master.docx”
Open “The Book of Tales Master.docx” document in Microsoft Word and use the 
Document Templates command of the Developer tab to realize that it is attached to the 
Fables.dotx document (which must reside in the same document folder).
Note that it has a different border on the first document page, which already has 
a book title, author names, and dates of publications, all paragraph center aligned on 
the page by using the Vertical align = Center on Section 1 page properties (this effect is 
achieved by using the Borders and Shading dialog box to select the desired border and 
using the Applies to = This Section option, Figure 12-37).

Note that this document also has a “Content” title on page 2, which will receive the 
document’s Table of Contents.
Inspect “Aesops Fables.docx”
Open “The Aesops Fables.docx” document in Microsoft Word and use the Document 
Templates command of the Developer tab to confirm that it is attached to the Fables.
dotx document (which must reside in the same document folder).
The “Aesops fables.docx” document is based on the Fables.dotx document and also 
uses all template formatting page properties (a 6×9 page size with same page borders, 
using Mirror margins and a Section 1 with Vertical align = Center). The book title 
(“Aesop’s Fables”) is shown on the page Header (left aligned on even pages and right 
aligned on odd pages, as page numbers do on the footer, Figure 12-38).
Figure 12-37.  This is "The Book of Tales Master.docx" document, which you 
can extract from Tales.zip file. It is based on the Fables.dotx template but had its 
Section 1 page border changed to create a better effect for the book cover page.  
It also has a second page where the Table of Contents must be inserted

Attention  Explore the “Andersen Fables.docx” and “Grimms Fairy tales.docx” 
documents to realize that they all obey to the same formatting options.
Create the Master/Subdocument Relationships
We will use “The Book of Tales Master.docx” document as the Master document in which 
we will insert “Aesops Fables.docx”, “Andersen Fables.docx”, and “Grimms Fairy tales.
docx” as subdocuments to compose the final book.
Figure 12-38.  This is the “Aesops Fables.docx” document, which you can extract 
from Fables.zip
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

701
Supposing that you have “The Book of Tales Master.docx” document opened in 
Microsoft Word, follow these steps to make it the Master document and insert the 
desired subdocuments:
	 1.	 Check the Show/Hide command in the Home tab of the Ribbon, 
so you can see all Section Breaks.
	 2.	 Check the Outline option in the Views area of the View tab to enter 
Outline view and show the Outlining tab.
	 3.	 Click Show Document to expand the Master Document area of the 
Outlining tab and show its tools.
	 4.	 In the Outlining tab, click the paragraph below the Section Break 
(Odd Page) (inside the Contents heading, Figure 12-39).
Figure 12-39.  Show the Outline view for "The Book of Tales Master.docx" 
document, click the paragraph below the Section Break (Odd Page), and use the 
Insert command to select the "Aesops Fables.docx" document as a subdocument
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

702
	 5.	 Use the Insert command found in the Master Document area of 
the Outlining tool to select the “Aesops Fables.docx” document 
and insert it as a subdocument.
	 6.	 Delete the Section Break (Next Page) that Microsoft Word inserted 
at the end of the subdocument file (Figure 12-40).
	 7.	 Click the paragraph below the rectangle that shows the 
subdocument to position the text cursor for the next subdocument.
	 8.	 Repeat steps 5 to 7 to also add “Andersen Fables.docx” and 
“Grimms Fairy Tales.docx” as subdocuments.
Attention  If Word’s find any disagreement among the Master and Subdocument 
styles, it will show you a dialog box for each style disagreement, asking if you want 
to rename the subdocument style. Whenever this happens, select the No to All 
option, so all subdocument styles are updated by the Master subdocument style 
formatting options (Figure 12-41).
Figure 12-40.  Scroll the outline view down until you see the end of the 
subdocument and delete the Section Break (Odd Page) that Microsoft Word 
inserted in it
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

703
Play with the Outline Tools
After inserting all three subdocuments (“Aesop fables.docx”, “Andersen Fables.docx”, 
and “Grimms Fairy Tales.docx”) in “The Book of Tables Master.docx” Master document, 
try to use Outline Tools commands to limit which paragraphs appear—and how they 
appear—in the Outline view.
Try these exercises:
•	
Use Show Level tool found in the Outline Tools area of the Outlining tab 
to limit the Outline level of the paragraphs shown by the Outline view.
Attention  Since Title style in the Tales.dotx template was changed to Outline 
Level = 1, whenever you select Show Level = 1, just the Title and Heading1 styles 
will show up in the book outline (Figure 12-42).
•	
Set Show Levels = 2 to show Title, Heading1, and Heading2 styles 
(this last one associated to the tales title).
•	
Set Show levels = 3 to show up to Heading3 styles.
•	
Set Show levels = all; keeping the Show First Line Only option 
checked will show the first line of each Normal style paragraph.
Figure 12-41.  Whenever Word’s find disagreements between the Master and 
Subdocument style formatting, it will show this dialog box asking what to do. 
Select the No to All option to apply the Master style formatting options to the 
subdocument
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

704
•	
Select Show Levels = 2 and drag Heading2 styles (tales titles) to a new 
place inside a subdocument (or even between subdocuments) you 
can move entire tales to a new position inside the book.
•	
Uncheck Show Formatting option to show the outline text of each 
paragraph.
•	
Collapse an entire branch of styles (like the title of each 
subdocument, formatted with Title style), and use the Demote tool to 
change all Heading styles affected to the next Outline level.
Attention  You can move Heading2 styles wherever you want, but avoid saving 
the Master document, because it will also change each subdocument, meaning 
that you can inadvertently exchange authors’ tales.
Figure 12-42.  Set Show Level = Level 1 to show just Title and Heading1 styles in 
Outline view (both have the Paragraph, Outline level = 1)
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

705
Close Outline View to See the Final Document
Click Close Outline View to return to Print Layout and press Ctrl+End to go to its last 
page and force Microsoft Word to recount its pages (the “Book of Tales” should now have 
587 pages).
Press Ctrl+Home to return to the document’s beginning and uncheck the Show/Hide 
tool in the Home tab of the Ribbon and note how the Master document seems to be a 
unique, very long document.
Press Ctrl+F to show the Navigation Pane and click Headings to show all its Heading 
styles. Try to expand and collapse the Heading1 styles in the Navigation Pane to see how 
easy it is to quickly select any tale title in such a big document (Figure 12-43).
Figure 12-43.  Close the Outline view to return to Print Layout view, press Ctrl+F 
to show the Navigation Pane, and use the Heading styles to quickly select any 
document tale (try to collapse any Heading1 style to easily show another author’s 
tales)
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

706
Insert the Book’s Table of Contents
Now it is time to insert the book Table of Contents in the Contents section located on 
page 2.
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Use the Navigation Pane to select the CONTENTS Heading and 
click the first empty paragraph of this section to define the place 
where the Table of Contents must be inserted.
	 2.	 Expand the Table of Contents command found in the References 
tab and select the Custom Table of Contents… option to show the 
Table of Contents dialog box.
	 3.	 In the Table of Contents dialog box: Set Show Levels = 2 (to use 
just Title, Heading1, and Heading2 styles, as shown by the Print 
Preview list, Figure 12-44).
Figure 12-44.  In the Table of Contents dialog box, set Show levels = 1 to use just 
the Heading1 and Title paragraphs (the ones that have Outline level = 1)
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

707
	 4.	 Click the Options button to show the Table of Contents Options 
dialog box, scroll the Available Styles list, and clear the Title style 
TOC level text box to tell Microsoft Word that you don’t want to 
include it in the Table of Contents (Figure 12-45).
	 5.	 Close the Table of Contents Options dialog box to return to the 
Table of Contents dialog box and note that the Preview Options 
now show just Heading1 and Heading2 styles.
	 6.	 Click OK button of the Table of Contents dialog box to generate 
the book Table of Contents at the current text cursor position 
(Figure 12-46).
Figure 12-45.  Use the Table of Contents dialog box Options button to show the 
Table of Contents Options dialog box, scroll the Available styles list, and clear the 
Title TOC level column to remove it from the Table of Contents styles
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

708
Shrink the Table of Contents
The “Book of Tales” Table of Contents needs six document pages to print all Heading1 
paragraphs found in the document, spreading itself from page 3 to page 8: too much for a TOC!
Follow these steps to change the Table of Contents formatting options:
	 1.	 Select the entire Table of Contents paragraphs.
	 2.	 In the Home tab of the Ribbon set these options in the Font and 
Paragraph areas:
•	
Font size = 9
•	
Line spacing = 1
Figure 12-46.  The "Book of Tales" Table of Contents is so big that it spreads through 
six document pages. Change the TOC1 style font size and use a two-­column format 
to use fewer pages
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

709
	 3.	 In the Layout tab of the Ribbon set these options in the Paragraph 
area:
•	
Spacing Before = 0
•	
Spacing After = 0
The Table of Contents will be reduced to five pages (Figure 12-47).
Figure 12-47.  Select the entire Table of Contents (it will become dark grayed) 
and change the text formatting options: Font size = 9 pt, Line Spacing = 1, Spacing 
Before = After = 0. This will reduce the Table of Contents to five pages
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

710
Attention  Since the Table of Contents applies the TOC1 and TOC2 styles to 
format each Heading1 and Heading2 style text found in the document, and both 
TOC1 and TOC2 have the Automatically update option set (in the Modify Style 
dialog box), anytime you change any TOC1 or TOC2 paragraph format you will 
indeed change the associated style affecting the entire Table of Contents length.
	 4.	 With the Table of Contents paragraphs still selected, expand the 
Columns command found in the Layout tab of the Ribbon and 
select the More Columns… option to show the Columns dialog 
box, where you must set these options (Figure 12-48):
•	
Number of Columns = 2
•	
Line Between = Checked
Figure 12-48.  In the Layout tab, use the Columns tool, More Columns… option 
to show the Columns dialog box and set Number of columns = 2 and check Line 
between
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

711
When you press Enter, Microsoft Word will format the Table of Contents using a 
two-column format, and the TOC page number will shrink to just two and a half pages 
(Figure 12-49).
Figure 12-49.  By using a two-column format, formatted with Calibri 9 pt, Line 
spacing =1 and Spacing Before = After = 0, the Table of Contents size shrinks to two 
and a half pages!
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

712
Recalculate the Table of Contents
Since the Table of Contents changed its own length, the page numbers it currently shows 
are no longer valid.
To recalculate the Table of Contents page numbers, click any of its entries and press 
the F9 function key to show the Update Table of Contents dialog box. Accept the default 
Update Page Numbers only option and click OK to update it.
It is now correct. Press Ctrl+Home on any of its entries to jump to the desired tale 
and see for yourself!
Use the Save button found in the top left corner of Microsoft Word window to 
save not only “The Book of Tales Master.docx” Master document, but each of its 
subdocuments (watch the status bar saving each subdocument).
Create and Insert an Index
Although a child book like “The Book of Tales and Fables” does not need an Index, it may 
be still desired for didactic reasons, just to teach children of all ages how to use an Index 
to find information—and to also expand your practice of creating an Index!
Looking to the Navigation Pane—and for the very essence of such a lovely book—you 
may note that children may be interested in three main categories: animals, people, and 
places, which should be easily found in the Index by name (like “Fox” in the “F” Index 
letter) and by aggregate (as a subentry of the Animals, Fox, located in the “A” Index letter).
To create such an Index, you may first list what must be tagged in the text—or just 
observe the Navigation Pane titles—use the Navigation Pane Search box to find its first 
occurrence in the text, select the text, and then tag it twice: once as a Main entry index 
and again as a Subentry of the desired aggregation noun.
Let’s see how you can make such double Index entries in practice.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

713
Creating a Concordance Table to Create the Index
Looking to the Navigation Pane Headings found in the Aesop’s Fables (first book inserted 
as subdocument), you will note that the first tale is “The Cock and the Pearl,” which has 
two entries: Cock (which can be tagged twice as Main entry and as an “Animals” subentry) 
and Pearl (which can also be tagged twice as Main entry and as a “Things” subentry).
This is a great time to experience how to use a concordance file to automatically tag 
the document text for all desired words that you want to appear in the Index.
I created the concordance table for the “Book of Tales and Fables” using these steps:
	 1.	 The “Book of Tales Master.docx” document was kept opened in 
Microsoft Word, showing the Navigation Pane Headings view.
	 2.	 A new Microsoft Word document was created, and a single 
column table was inserted in it.
	 3.	 Keeping both windows opened, I searched for each animal, thing, 
or character in the Heading2 paragraphs of the Navigation pane, 
inserting its name in the table (one name for row).
Attention  All beings from the animal word (including reptiles and insects) 
were considering as Animals (like Fly and Serpent). Some nonliving things were 
considered as Characters (like Wind and Sun). Others were considered as Things 
(like Crown).
The “Fables Index Concordance Table1.docx” document, which you can also extract 
from Fables.zip file, has such an initial table, in the order they appear in the Navigation 
Pane (it may have duplicate entries, Figure 12-50).
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

714
Since Microsoft Word will make a case-sensitive search to AutoMark the index entry, 
once this one-column table was created, every one of its items was searched (using 
Options, Match case, and Single word only options checked), fixing their upper- and 
lowercase presentation in the table (it gave me a lot of work to check it…).
Since the concordance table must have two columns (the first column is the 
item to be searched for in the document, and the second column is the Index entry 
to be created), after the words inserted in this single column table were checked and 
corrected, the column content as selected, copied, and pasted at its right to create a two-­
column table with the same content (intended to create Main key Index entries).
The “Fables Index Concordance Table2.docx” document, which you can extract from 
Tales.zip file, has this two-column table ready-made for an Index AutoMark operation 
(Figure 12-51).
Figure 12-50.  This is the "Fables Index Concordance Table1.docx" document, 
which you can extract from Tales.zip file. It has the names of animals, characters, 
and things noted in the tales and fable titles that appear as Heading2 styles in the 
Navigation pane
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

715
And to allow you to double-tag each Index entry as a subentry of “Animals”, 
“Characters”, and “Things”, the “Fables Index Concordance Table2.docx” second column 
was modified by prefixing each of its items by the desired Master key (“Animals:”, 
“Characters:”, and “Things:”). The “Fables Index Concordance Table3.docx” document, 
which you can extract from Tales.zip file, has this concordance table for tab Index sub 
keys (Figure 12-52).
Figure 12-51.  This is the "Fables Index Concordance Table2.docx" document, 
which you can extract from Tales.zip file. It duplicates the first column to create the 
concordance table used by an AutoMark operation for the creation of Main key 
Index entries
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

716
Using AutoMark with Concordance Tables
Now that we have that concordance tables to use AutoMark to tag the document with 
Index field codes (Master and Sub keys), it is important to know that, by an anticipated 
reason, you have to first mark the Main keys and then mark the Sub keys: by changing 
this order, the Main keys will not be marked.
To add all desired Index Main keys from “Fables Index Concordance Table2.docx” 
document, follow these steps:
	 1.	 In the “Book of Fables Master.docx” document, into which 
you have inserted the subdocuments, select the Insert Index 
command found in the Index area of the References tab to show 
the Index dialog box.
	 2.	 Click the AutoMark button to show the Open Index AutoMark File 
dialog box (see Figure 12-21).
Figure 12-52.  This is the "Fables Index Concordance Table2.docx" document, 
which you can extract from Tales.zip file and use to tag Index subkeys. It 
prefixes each second column item by the desired Master key prefix ("Animals:", 
"Characters:", or "Things:")
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

717
Figure 12-53.  Watch Microsoft Word status bar to note the "Word is searching for 
index entries to add page… Press ESC to cancel" message that appears whenever 
you use the AutoMark button of the Index dialog box to select a concordance  
table file
	 3.	 Select the “Fables Index Concordance Table2.docx” document 
and press OK to close the dialog box.
	 4.	 Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to select “Fables Index Concordance Table3.
docx” and press OK to also tag the desired Index sub keys.
Microsoft Word will use the two-column concordance tables to mark the Master key 
and Sub keys Index entries (watch the Status bar, which should say “Word is searching 
for index entries to add page… Press ESC to cancel”, Figure 12-53).
Generate the Index
Once you had used the AutoMark feature to automatically tag the Index field codes in the 
Master document, it is time to generate the Index.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

718
Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Press Ctrl+End to go the end of the Master document (you may 
reach page 587).
	 2.	 Use the Insert Index command found in the Index area of the 
References tab to show the Index dialog box.
	 3.	 Select the desired Index format and press OK to generate the 
Index.
Microsoft Word will run through the text and will create an eight-page Index at the 
end of the document (Figure 12-54).
Figure 12-54.  These are the eight pages needed to generate the Index of "The Book 
of Tales Master.docx" Master document, as proposed by the concordance tables 
found in "Fables Index Concordance Table2.docx" (Master keys) and "Fables Index 
Concordance Table3.docx" (Subkeys) documents
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

719
Inspect and Fix the Index Keys
Go ahead and inspect the Index created. You will notice that it doubled all Index entries 
(they all appear as an individual Master key or under the Animals, Characters, or Things 
master keys, Figure 12-55).
Note that the Index begins with “Androcles” and “Animals” main entries, and then 
begins to show all “Animals” subentries. Also note that some entries have a lot of page 
references (like “bear”). Others, like “king”, “mother”, and “man”, have tenths of page 
number references, which appear in duplicate in their Master and Sub keys.
Now you may begin to understand that although Microsoft Word gave all the tools 
you need to create an Index, this is a very specialized task (indeed, it is a profession unto 
itself), and it needs greater attention to produce a final good result.
To fix this Index entries you can
•	
Remove them from the Index with the Delete key.
•	
Correct the concordance tables, remove the Index entries, remove 
the Index, and insert it again.
The first option is the easiest, as long as the Index isn’t updated again.
Figure 12-55.  The two concordance tables generated double index entries for 
most Index items. Note that it begins with "Androcles" and "Animals" main entries, 
and then begins to show all "Animals" subentries. Also note that some entries (like 
"bear") have a lot of page references.
Chapter 12  Master and Subdocuments 

720
The second option is the most professional one, and needs a more technical 
approach, so let’s see it in more detail.
To correct the index entries you can
•	
Remove them all from the document (use a Find and Replace 
operation to search for ^d XE and replace with nothing), as explained 
in the section “Removing Index Field Codes” earlier in this chapter.
•	
Manually remove just the desired Index entries from the document 
(you will need to search for them using ^d XE “<WordInitials> as the 
search string).
In both cases, you will need to select and delete the Index and then insert it again.
Shrink the Index
The Index created by Microsoft Word use the Index1 to Index9 special styles: all of them 
have the Automatically update option set in the Modify Dialog box.
This means that, by selecting any Index entry and changing its formatting options, 
you will indeed change the associated Index style, automatically changing all Index 
entries that use it. To make an Index shrink its size, you just need to change its styles Font 
size by following these steps:
	 1.	 Select the first index entry (“Androcles” a Master key entry 
formatted with Index1 style).
	 2.	 Use the Font Size tool located in the Font area of the Home tab 
of the Ribbon to format it with a 7 pt or 8 pt size. All Master key 
entries will also be affected.
	 3.	 Repeat Steps 1 and 2 to also format the first “Animals” Sub key 
(“ant”) to a 7 pt or 8 pt size.
At the end of this process, the Index will now use fewer document pages to print itself.
I will leave to the reader the task of fixing and shrinking the Index as a last book exercise!

Conclusion
Microsoft Word Master and Subdocuments are a powerful way to deal with large 
documents, where each chapter belongs to a different document, sometimes written by 
different people all using the same template.
Using the Outline view, you can transform a document into a Master document, 
and insert its links in the subdocuments, using the Master as the text that holds all the 
subdocuments.
With the Master/Subdocument approach you can easily generate the Table of 
Contents, use the Navigation Pane to easily jump to any Heading style, and also tag all 
subdocuments at once with Index field codes to generate the final document Index.
Summary
In this chapter you learned:
•	
How to use the Outline view to create a Master document.
•	
How to produce the Subdocuments from a list of Heading styles.
•	
How to insert Subdocuments in a Master document.
•	
How to deal with the multiple Section Breaks inserted by Microsoft 
Word in the Master and the Subdocuments.
•	
How to create a document Index.
•	
How to manually tag Index words.
•	
How the Index words are tagged with hidden Index field codes.
•	
How to fix, search, and remove these Index field codes using the Find 
and Replace dialog box.
•	
How to produce Concordance Tables to use the AutoMark Index 
features.

Final Words
Now, we have come to the end of this book. In it you had the opportunity to realize that 
Microsoft Word is a sophisticated typographic tool that, to be correctly used, depends on 
having some basic typographic knowledge. Essentially, these chapters have shown that:
•	
There are several hidden characters used to represent nonprinting 
keys or control characters (like Enter and Tab, Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Enter, 
and Section breaks) that can impact the way text flows in and 
between document pages.
•	
Text flow control is very well done as long as certain ground rules  
are met:
•	
Correctly use the Enter, Tab, and Space keys,
•	
Make use of the paragraph alignment controls,
•	
Apply the Line and Page Breaks tab options of the Paragraph 
dialog box.
•	
Make extensive use of Styles—notably the Recommended styles—to 
get the most out of the Microsoft Word tools that are based on them 
(Navigation Pane, Design Tab, Table of Contents, Outline view, Index 
formatting, etc.).
I sincerely hope you have enjoyed the book, and from now on, have most of the 
answers to any problems you may encounter when using Microsoft Word to format any 
type of text document you have created or edited.
