Author‚Äôs Preface
Author‚Äôs Preface
The ‚Äòelectronic book‚Äô is a feature of this early 21st Century. I have been in academic life for several decades, 
and have I hope responded with flexibility to changes over that time. I have been using a word processor 
on a daily basis for twenty years and am deeply conscious of the advantages over even the most advanced 
typewriters. The first time I gave a presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint was in India about six years 
ago. I have with enthusiasm used PowerPoint for every invited talk or conference contribution I have 
given since. Such talks and contributions have been in countries including Australia, Bahrain, Trinidad 
and Tobago, Kuwait and Armenia. 
About a year ago I published, by invitation from Ventus, ‚ÄòAtmospheric Pollution‚Äô. This was my eighth 
book, and my first electronic one. Once it became available I was quite delighted with the result, and sent 
a link to it to friends and professional associates around the world. I used the book as the recommended 
text in an MSc course at Aberdeen and student response was very positive. I hasten to add that I do not 
believe that the positive response was due solely to the fact that the book, unlike a ‚Äòconventional‚Äô book, 
was available free of charge. University students are too shrewd and perceptive to extend their acceptance 
to something simply because it comes for nothing. Even so, the endeavours of Ventus Publishing and 
Boon Books in making quality texts available at no cost deserve support. I was therefore pleased to 
respond in the affirmative to an invitation to write a second book for Ventus. The result is this tome on 
the physical properties of hydrocarbons. 
I expect that this book will be of interest to students and professionals in chemical engineering, fuel 
technology and mechanical engineering. I have myself used bits of it, prior to publication, in the newly 
set up chemical engineering degree course at the University of Aberdeen. I shall be pleased to receive 
feedback from readers.
J.C. Jones
Aberdeen, February 2010. 
In ‚ÄòAtmospheric Pollution‚Äô the author made the following statement in the Preface:
To have acknowledged each and every one of the electronic sources I have drawn on would not only 
have lengthened the book to no real purpose but, more seriously, might even have been a distraction 
to a reader. I am hopeful that this acknowledgement in the preface of such sources will suffice.
The statement applies equally to this volume.

Physical properties of organic liquids
1	 Physical properties of organic 
liquids
1.1	
Introduction
This chapter will provide background on some of the properties of hydrocarbons which are prevalent in 
discussion and in quality control. The respective properties will be discussed for particular hydrocarbon 
products in the subsequent chapters where, as necessary, other properties including density will be 
introduced. 
1.2	
Viscosity
1.2.1	
Definitions, dimensions and units
Viscosity, usually qualitatively described as ‚Äòresistance to flow‚Äô, has dimensions:
M L-1T-1
hence in SI the units are kg m-1 s-1. Now the SI unit of pressure is the Pascal which is:
force/area = kg m s-2/m2 = kg m-1s-2
Hence the units of viscosity are those for pressure multiplied by seconds, so Pa s has become the 
terminology for the SI unit of viscosity, where:
1 Pa s = 1 kg m-1 s-1
The viscosity so expressed is the dynamic viscosity, usual symbol ¬µ, and the following applies:
kinematic viscosity (usual symbol œÖ) = ¬µ/œÅ
where œÅ is the density. The kinematic viscosity therefore has units:
kg m-1 s-1/kg m-3 = m2s-1
and a reader is asked to note the following in relation to kinematic viscosities.

Physical properties of organic liquids
First, the units and dimensions of kinematic viscosity are the same as those of diffusion coefficients and 
of thermal diffusivities. Kinematic viscosities therefore feature in dimensionless groups including the 
widely used Prandtl number (symbol Pr) which is simply:
Pr = œÖ/Œ±
where Œ± is the the thermal diffusivity. The kinematic viscosity also appears in the Lewis number (symbol 
Le). 
Secondly, noting the definition of the kinematic viscosity the numerator changes with temperature much 
more rapidly than does the denominator; that is, the dynamic viscosity of a liquid is a much stronger 
function of the temperature than is the density. The latter can for engineering purposes often be taken 
to be constant over quite a wide temperature range, therefore in the calculation of kinematic viscosities 
at different temperatures only changes in the dynamic viscosity need to be considered. 
1.2.2	
Benzene as a model compound
The above ideas and extensions of them are best examined with reference to a pure organic compound 
and benzene, which is very important in hydrocarbon technology, is the obvious choice. 
The increased mobility of molecules as temperature increases and viscosity decreases involves loss of 
intramolecular forces and is an activated process [1]. The temperature dependence of the dynamic 
viscosity therefore conforms to an expression of the form [1]:
¬µ = Aexp(‚àÜE/RT)
where A is a constant, R the universal gas constant (= 8.314 J K-1mol-1) and T the absolute temperature. 
The constant A is given by [2]:
A = hNo/Vm
where h = Planck‚Äôs constant (= 6.626 √ó 10-34 Js), No the Avogadro number (= 6.02 √ó 1023 mol-1) and Vm 
(m3 mol-1) is the molar volume of the liquid. The units of A are examined in the boxed area below. 
J √ó s √ó mol-1/m3 mol-1 = kg m s-2 m m-3 = kg m-1s-2 = Pa s
‚ÄòA‚Äô needs to have units Pa s for dimensional correctness as the exponential of course has no units.
Now at 20oC (293 K) the density of benzene is 0.879 g cm-3. In the boxed area below this is converted 
to molar volume in SI units.

Physical properties of organic liquids
0.879 g cm-3 ‚â° 879 kg m-3
molar mass of benzene (C6H6) = 0.078 kg
density on a molar basis = 879 kg m-3/0.078 kg mol-1 = œÅm
Vm = 1/ œÅm = 8.87 √ó 10-5 m3 mol-1
Using this and the values for h and No given furnishes a value of 4.5 √ó 10-6 Pa s for A. We lack a value 
for ‚àÜE. The way forward is therefore to use a literature value for the dynamic viscosity and find ‚àÜE. 
This should conform to the general rule [2] that ‚àÜE is 30 to 40% of the heat of vaporisation. At 20oC 
the dynamic viscosity of benzene is:
0.652 cPa s = 0.00652 Pa s
Putting this into:
¬µ = Aexp(‚àÜE/RT)
and solving for ‚àÜE gives:
‚àÜE = 17.7 kJ mol-1
Now the heat of vaporisation of benzene at its boiling point is 44.3 kJ mol-1 and ‚àÜE is precisely 40% of 
this. Reference [2] does in fact give the equation as: 
¬µ = (hNo/Vm)exp(0.4L/RT)
where L (J mol-1) is the heat of vaporisation at an unspecified temperature. Variation of the heat of 
vaporisation with temperature is not a source of major error in this analysis. It is common for example 
not only in such disciplines as fuel technology but also amongst ‚Äòpurist‚Äô physical chemists to integrate the 
Clausius-Clapeyron equation with the enthalpy change for whatever phase transition is being considered 
outside the integral. Only where a very high degree of precision is required would the enthalpy change 
be taken inside the integral, usually as a power series in temperature obtainable from such sources as 
the JANAF1 tables. 
Our equation for the temperature dependence of the viscosity of benzene can easily be used to estimate 
by how much the temperature would need to rise above the reference temperature of 20oC which we 
have used for the viscosity:
a)	 to halve
b)	 to decrease by an order of magnitude.

The interested reader can easily confirm that the answer to (a) is an increase to 324 K (51oC). The answer 
to (b) is an increase to 429K (156oC).

The table below gives values of the dynamic viscosity for a selection of hydrocarbons and oxygenated

Physical properties of organic liquids
Values of L used in the calculations are those at the boiling point rounded to the nearest whole number 
in units kJ mol-1. There is good agreement with the general rule [2] that the heat of vaporisation in 
the exponential is multiplied by a factor of 0.3 to 0.4. Having regard to the fact that the liquids in the 
table range in viscosity by a factor of almost 5000 the treatment can be judged to be remarkably robust. 
To extend this treatment to petroleum fractions, which are of course mixtures of very many organic 
compounds, is a challenge which later parts of the book will address. One difficulty will however at this 
stage be anticipated: such a fraction does not have a single boiling point, only a boiling range. 
In the table below the kinematic viscosities (œÖ) of the respective hydrocarbons are given. They were 
obtained by dividing the dynamic viscosity by the density to give a value for œÖ in m2s-1. Values are also 
given in centistokes (cSt) where:
1 centistoke = 10-6 m2 s-1.

These values are straddled by those for ethylene glycol and ethanol. 
1.2.4	
Further remarks
What has been learnt in this introductory chapter about the viscosities of simple organics will be carried 
forward to subsequent chapters in which crude oil and fractions therefrom will be discussed. The range 
of viscosities in the tables is sufficient for direct comparison with crude oils or any distillate.

Acoustic impedance
1.3.1	
Introduction
The most obvious importance of this topic is its application to exploration. The principles will be given 
in this chapter and examples of application to crude oil in the next. The acoustic impedance is defined:
pressure applied/speed of pressure wave resulting
Hence in SI the quantity has units:
Pa/m s-1 ‚â° Pa s m-1.
1 Pa s m-1 = 1 rayl (so named after Rayleigh).
1.3.2	
Examples of values for organic liquids
Most liquids have acoustic impedances of the order of 1 megarayl (Mrayl). Values for selected liquid 
organic compounds, taken from [3], are given below together with values for water and mercury.

Note that the ratio of the values at room temperature for water and mercury (13.2) is almost exactly the 
ratio of their densities (13.6). In their thermal properties (e.g., Prandtl numbers) liquid metals tend to 
differ widely from organic liquids because of their high thermal conductivities but clearly the very high 
value for the acoustic impedance of mercury is a density effect. 
The unit of rayl breaks down to:
1 rayl = 1 kg m-2s-1
and these are also the units of the product:
density √ó velocity
The significance of this identity will become clearer when applications of the acoustic impedance are 
discussed.

Physical properties of organic liquids
We note the significantly higher value for water than for the organics. Thermal conductivities of organic 
liquids decrease in a linear fashion with temperature though quite weakly. It is seldom if ever necessary 
to incorporate the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature in heat transfer calculations in 
engineering practice. A single value at a suitably representative temperature will suffice. As will be seen 
in subsequent chapters the thermal conductivities of petroleum fractions do not differ hugely from each 
other. 
1.5	
Electrical properties
1.5.1	
Introduction
The electrical properties of any hydrocarbon have direct relevance to fire safety. If in movement or in 
tank filling a hydrocarbon liquid is splashed, static electricity will be generated. No hydrocarbon liquid 
is a ‚Äòconductor‚Äô, but the lower the resistance to conduction of any static so generated the better as such 
static can become an ignition source for vapours. 
The resistivity of pure water at 20oC is 18.6 megaohm cm. The conductivity is the reciprocal of the 
resistivity, units ohm-1 cm-1 or S cm-1 where S denotes the unit Siemen which has replaced the old 
‚Äòreciprocal ohm‚Äô (mho). Hence the conductivity of pure water is:
1/(18.6 √ó 106) S cm-1 = 5.4 √ó 10-8 S cm-1 ‚â° 5.4 √ó 10-6 S m-1
The final figure in the above row can be re-expressed 5.4 ¬µS m-1. As an example of an organic liquid, 
ethylbenzene has a value of 123 pS m-1, many orders of magnitude lower. Even though there are very 
few ions in ‚Äòpure‚Äô water, the polar structure of the molecules provides for some enhancement of electrical 
conductivity. 
Another electrical property of interest in hydrocarbon technology is the capacitance. The capacitance of 
a dielectric is the amount of charge it can hold per unit potential difference across it. The units are thus:
coulomb/ volts = farad
In [5] the capacitances of benzene and n-pentane are given as 120 and 98 picofarads (pF) respectively. 
Capacitance provides a basis for tank level gauging in particular with jet fuel, as will de described in 
Chapter 4. 
1.6	
Optical properties
The refractive index of a medium is of course dependent upon the wavelength of the incident light and 
589.3 nm, corresponding to the sodium D lines, is a common choice. The refractive indices of some 
organic compound on this basis measured at 20oC are given below having been taken from [6].

It is shown in [2] that for non-polar liquids the following approximate relationship applies:
refractive index = (dielectric constant)0.5
and of the liquids in the table above only benzene and toluene are non-polar. The dielectric constant of 
benzene at 20oC is 2.3 [7] giving refractive index 1.517 only 1% higher than the value in the table. The 
dielectric constant of toluene at 20oC is 2.4 giving a refractive index of 1.549. This is a greater discrepancy 
than for benzene (3.5%) but still not a huge one. The correlation above will be re-examined when 
petroleum distillates are considered. (The reader can easily satisfy him/herself of the folly of attempting 
to apply the correlation to polar compounds such as glycerol.)

Physical properties of organic liquids
The quotient:
(n2 ‚Äì 1)/(n2 + 2)
where n is the refractive index is called the refractive index parameter usual symbol I. For water then:
I = [(1.3332 ‚Äì 1)/(1.3332 + 2)] = 0.206
In the correlation of refractive index with other thermodynamic properties this parameter often features. 
For example, Riazi and Roomi [8] determined the dynamic viscosity (¬µ, units centipoise) of n-pentane 
and cyclopentane across a temperature range and the refractive index of each across the same temperature 
range. For each a plot of 1/¬µ against 1/I gave a good straight line. The lines for the two closely similar 
organic compounds were widely separated. 
When a binary liquid is being distilled the composition of distillate can be determined from its refractive 
index provided that the refractive indices of the two liquids when pure are sufficiently spaced. Similarly, 
in complex mixtures of hydrocarbons the refractive index has some diagnostic potential and this will be 
discussed in subsequent chapters.

Concluding remarks
The author has in mind that readers will refer back to this chapter when encountering in the later ones 
the respective properties for hydrocarbon products. Such properties are frequently encountered in the 
most up-to-date research literature on liquid fuels.

Physical properties of crude oils
2	 Physical properties of crude oils
2.1	
Classifications of crude oil by density
Density is an important property in the pricing of a particular crude oil. Lighter crudes are preferred 
because they are richer in the lowest boiling distillate, namely gasoline, which remains the most saleable 
product of oil refining. Consequently the usual index of quality, the API gravity, is defined in such a 
way that it is higher for light crudes and lower for heavy crudes having therefore the reciprocal of the 
density in its definition. The API gravity is given by:
degrees API = 141.5/œÅr ‚Äì 131.5
where œÅr is the density relative to that of water at 60oF (15.6oC). Hence water itself has an API gravity of 
10 degrees. The API2 gravity has been in international use as an indicator of crude oil quality for over a 
century and also applies to fractionated material. The following definitions are widely used:
Light Crude: API gravity higher than 31.1 degrees.
Medium Crude: API gravity between 22.3 and 31.1 degrees.
Heavy Crude: API gravity below 22.3 degrees.
Converting to fundamental units, light crudes are below 870 kg m-3, medium crudes are between 870 
and 920 kg m-3 and heavy crudes are above 920 kg m-3.

In examining the information in the Table we first note that the temperature interval across which the 
kinematic viscosity of the Hungo crude is given enables the values to be examined for conformity to a 
functional form the same as that for pure organic compounds used in the previous chapter. This is in 
the boxed area below, where symbols are as used and defined in the previous chapter.

Physical properties of crude oils
A single value of the heat of vaporisation cannot of course apply to a crude oil, but the value obtained in 
the calculation can at least be compared with values for pure compounds. There is probably little value in 
attempting to comment on the value for L above beyond saying that it is approximately what is expected 
for a single hydrocarbon compound of about C15‚Äì20. One should also note that there is nothing at all 
incorrect about using applying the mole concept to such a substance as crude oil. In the fundamental 
definition of a mole there is no requirement that all components be of the same molecular identity. Quite 
the contrary, for example the mole concept is frequently applied to mixtures of gases including air. So 
a mole of crude oil is simply the amount which contains an Avogadro number of molecules, diverse in 
structure and size though those molecules will be. 
2.2.2	
Viscosity and pumping
The steady flow equation, that is the First Law of Thermodynamics for an open system, can be applied 
to a pump and to a good approximation pressure energy only, to the exclusion of thermal, kinetic and 
potential energies, need be considered. The performance characteristics of a particular pump are then 
‚Äòcapacity‚Äô ‚Äì gallons per minute ‚Äì against head pressure with water as the fluid being pumped. The 
kinematic viscosity of water at 20oC is 1 cSt. If the liquid is more viscous than water ‚Äì as all of the 
crude oils in the above tables are ‚Äì ‚Äòviscous effects‚Äô apply and pump performance is affected. There are 
in the literature and on numerous web sites (e.g. [16,17]) charts, issued by the Hydraulic Institute, for 
correcting pump performance for liquids other than water. Such a graph the interested reader can very 
easily download for him/herself.

Physical properties of crude oils
As an example of application of the charts, in [17] a pump delivering water at 750 gallons per minute 
at a head pressure of 100 feet of water is considered. It is shown that if the pump is used for a liquid of 
viscosity about 200 cSt the capacity drops by about 5%. Two further points can be made. First, it is clear 
from the charts that effects on the capacity of viscosities of less than 10 cSt are likely to be negligible. 
Secondly, some of the most viscous crudes in the tables above would be off-scale, that is outside the scope 
of the charts. In practice such crudes would probably be diluted with a refined material before pumping, 
as is very common with Venezuelan crudes. That would bring the viscosities into a range where pump 
performance could be assessed by charts such as those in [16] and [17]. 
2.2.3	
Viscosity of blended crude oils
Crude oils often are blended. This is partly because very many are ‚Äòout of spec‚Äô in sweetness (absence of 
sulphur) and in lightness (reciprocal density). Blending enables an oil as sold to be controlled in these 
terms, and such a blend will be priced according to how close the sweetness and lightness are to those 
of one of the benchmark crudes such as West Texas Intermediate, Brent or the OPEC basket. 
Application of the Grunberg-Nissan equation for two blended liquids3 to crude oils requires a few 
approximations to be made. The Grunberg-Nissan equation is:
 ln¬µ12 = x1ln¬µ1 + x2ln¬µ2 + x1 x2Œ≥12
where ¬µ denotes dynamic viscosity and x mole fraction, subscripts 1,2 and 12 referring respectively to the 
two components and to the blend. The parameter Œ≥12 is termed the interaction parameter. In applying to 
the blending of crude oil we note the following. First as the two oils being blended are both composed 
of non-polar molecules Œ≥12 can be set to zero. 
Secondly, were an average molecular weight to be assigned to each oil and determined (perhaps by freezing 
point depression of a pure organic liquid) values for the two would not intuitively be expected to differ 
by much. Mole fractions can therefore be replaced by mass fractions. This gives the simplified form:
 ln¬µ12 = œï1ln¬µ1 + œï2ln¬µ2
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

Hydrocarbons
26 
Physical properties of crude oils
where œï denotes mass fraction. A calculation utilising this is in the boxed area below.
Given the approximations made there is nothing to be gained from distinguishing the densities of
the crude oils from each other. This gives:
lnœÅœÖ12 = œï1lnœÅœÖ1 + œï2lnœÅœÖ2
‚áì
lnœÅ+ lnœÖ12 = œï1lnœÅ + œï1lnœÖ1 + œï2lnœÅ + œï2lnœÖ2
lnœÖ12 = œï1lnœÖ1 + œï2lnœÖ2 + lnœÅ(œï1 + œï2)
But (œï1 + œï2) = 1 by definition, therefore:
lnœÖ12 = œï1lnœÖ1 + œï2lnœÖ2
Consider then a 50:50 blend of two crude oils two orders of magnitude apart in 
kinematic viscosity, say 10cSt and 1000 cSt. This has kinematic viscosity:
exp{0.5(ln10 + ln1000)} = 100 cSt
which on a logarithmic scale is mid way between the kinematic viscosities of the two constituent crudes.
2.3	
Coefficient of thermal expansion
The density of any liquid is of course a function of the temperature, there being expansion as the 
temperature rises therefore a reduction in the density. The quantity relevant to this is the coefficient of 
thermal expansion, (symbol Œ≤) defined by:
Œ≤ = ‚àí (1/œÅ) dœÅ/dT	
K-1
Œ≤ is itself a function of temperature but a fairly weak one, and for approximate calculations on an 
unspecified crude oil a single value of around 0.0007 K-1 will suffice. A calculation in which use is made 
of this figure is in the boxed area below.
It is widely held (e.g., [18]) that the oil in a well increases in temperature by 3oC for every 100 m well 
depth. Europe‚Äôs largest onshore oilfield is on the south coast of England, the Wytch farm field.
The deepest wells at the field are 1600 m and the oil is typically 41.2oAPI which converts to a density of 
820 kg m-3 at say 20oC. The temperature at 1600 m will be ‚âà 70oC (343K). Returning to the equation:
Œ≤ = ‚àí (1/œÅ) dœÅ/dT
‚áì
Œ≤(343 ‚Äì 293) = -ln {œÅ(773K)/ œÅ(293K)}
Using Œ≤ = 0.0007 K-1 gives:
œÅ(343 K) = 792 kg m-3

Physical properties of crude oils
Now the speed of sound in a gas (v, units m s-1) is simply:
v = ‚àö(Œ≥P/œÅ)
where Œ≥ is the ratio of principal specific heats, P (N m-2) the pressure and œÅ (kg m-3) the density. Putting:
Z = œÅv
gives:
Z = ‚àö(Œ≥PœÅ) kg m-2s-1 (rayl)
Now for air Œ≥ = 1.4. At 1 bar (105 N m-2) pressure and 20oC the density is easily shown, from the ideal 
gas equation, to be 1.15 kg m-3 giving:
Z = 401 rayl
which compares well with the value of the acoustic impedance of air at 1 bar, 20oC of 412 rayl given in 
[21]. In the boxed area below the value of Z for methane ‚Äì the principal component of natural gas ‚Äì is 
calculated. 
Z = ‚àö(Œ≥PœÅ)
Now for methane Œ≥ = 1.3 and at 1 bar pressure, 20oC its density is 0.64 kg m-3
‚áì
Z = 288 rayl
The above calculations give precise values to the comparison made previously of Z values of solids, 
liquids and gases. 
2.4.2	
Acoustic impedance of crude oils
These have the values expected of liquids of their density range, typically around 1.3 Mrayl. It is not 
however the precise value of the acoustic impedance that is of importance in practical applications. It 
is that where there is an oil-rock interface there will be an acoustic mismatch because of an order of 
magnitude difference in the acoustic impedance at such an interface. By way of illustration:
Zsandstone/Zcrude oil = 10/1.3 = 8 to the nearest whole number.

Physical properties of crude oils
When ultrasound is applied such mismatch is the basis of a diagnostic signal and this approach is used 
in exploration for oil. At the interface of crude oil and associated gas:
Zmethane/Zcrude oil = 288/(1.3 √ó 106) = 2 √ó 10-4
Where non-associated gas is in contact with sandstone the ratio will be 50000 and the degree of acoustic 
mismatch huge. 
2.5	
Thermal conductivity
2.5.1	
Introduction
A reader might wonder why the thermal conductivity of a crude oil is important. The answer is that 
crude oils are frequently heat exchanged on their way into a refinery column. Even if conditions in the 
heat exchanger are such that heat transfer to the oil is primarily by convection the thermal conductivity 
is relevant because heat transfer by conduction across the thermal boundary layer significantly influences 
the convection coefficient. 
2.5.2	
Values for crude oils
Thermal conductivities of crude oils vary with temperature, although not as strongly as their viscosities 
do. At around room temperature values in the approximate range 0.12 to 0.15 W m-1K-1 are expected [22]. 
The variation with temperature is such that in heat transfer calculations where temperature differences 
are up to 100oC or so a single value of the thermal conductivity can be used without significant error. 
Denser crudes tend to have higher thermal conductivities, although the effect is not large. 
2.6	
Electrical conductivities
It was stated in the previous chapters that the electrical conductivity of a hydrocarbon material is relevant 
to safety in that a low conductivity prevents removal of electrical charge generated by splashing. It was 
also shown that one would expect a value of ‚âà 100 pS m-1 for an organic liquid at room temperature. It 
is noted in [23] that when different crudes at the same temperature are compared there can be significant 
differences: West Texas crude is only a third as conducting as crude from the Alaskan North Slope. It 
is intuitively reasonable that if there is a strong temperature dependence there will also be a strong 
composition dependence. 
2.7	
Refractive index
The presence of asphaltenes and waxes in crude oil does not necessarily preclude refractive index 
measurement, and the refractive index can be correlated with other properties including the viscosity 
and the temperature below which solid deposition occurs (‚Äòcloud point‚Äô). However, crude oil alone is 
usually too opaque for a direct measurement to be made. The way round this is to dilute the oil with 
toluene to give a sample sufficiently transmissive for a refractive index measurement to be made.

Physical properties of crude oils
If this is done for various proportions of toluene and oil and the refractive index plotted as a function 
of the composition of the mixture there can be extrapolation to obtain a value for the oil alone in the 
absence of toluene. Recent work [24] of this type has furnished a value of 1.4785 for the refractive index 
of a Russian crude of API gravity 30o. The same piece of work examines 45 crude oils, of density range 
800 kg m-3 (45o API) to 950 kg m-3 (17o API), for a correlation of refractive index with density. Such 
a correlation holds well up to about 880 kg m-3, there being a steady rise in the refractive index from 
1.45 to 1.50 over that density interval. The correlation is sustained at higher densities although there is 
considerable scatter. Similar trends are reported in work by El Ghandoor et al [25]. They report refractive 
indices for seven crudes ranging from 30 to 50 oAPI. A monotonically dropping refractive index, from 
1.50 to just under 1.45, is displayed across the API index range. 
2.8	
Concluding remarks
Crude oil is one of the most important products on world markets and the one which influences the 
economy most strongly. That a scientist or engineer should have a good appreciation of the properties 
of crude oil is therefore important. That crude oils vary widely in their physical properties is clear. An 
attentive reader with a little imagination will in his or her mind link that to the different benchmark 
prices which apply, e.g., Brent, New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the OPEC basket.

Physical properties of crude oils
3	 Physical properties of gasolines
3.1	
Introduction
Gasoline might of course simply be a straight run distillate from crude oil. It might have been blended with 
reformed naphtha as an extender, and it might have had octane enhancers added. Increasingly important 
is FCC ‚Äì fluid catalytic cracked ‚Äì gasoline. This is made from higher boiling material by cracking, which 
is a more vigorous process than reforming. A particular gasoline might not have originated from crude 
oil at all. It might have been made from ‚Äòsyncrude‚Äô from shale oil, or it might have been made from tar 
sands. Another route to gasoline is synthesis gas made from coal or natural gas. 
It is clear then that gasoline comes from very varied sources and that provided certain specifications 
are met the origin will be irrelevant to the final user. It is likely that a motorist driving up the west side 
of the US will whilst in California, Oregon and Washington buy gasoline made from crude oil, but on 
crossing the border into western Canada he/she might well purchase gasoline made from tar sands. 
Quality control of gasoline production in each case will ensure that, so to speak, the car‚Äôs engine will 
totally unaware of differences in origin of fuel it receives. 
The ‚Äògasoline substitutes‚Äô of interest in this chapter are methanol and ethanol.

Physical properties of gasolines
3.2	
Densities and viscosities
3.2.1	
Typical values
Gasolines have densities in the range 710 to 770 kg m-3 (68 to 52oAPI). The density of iso-octane, the 
benchmark hydrocarbon for performance, is 688 kg m-3. Kinematic viscosities are usually in the range 
0.4 to 1 cSt. For example ‚ÄòShell V-Power Gasoline‚Äô, currently the best selling premium gasoline in the US 
having a research octane number of 100, has a kinematic viscosity in the range 0.5 to 0.75 cSt at 40oC 
[1]. Conventional gasolines differ little in their kinematic viscosities and this quantity is not as important 
a factor in quality control as it is for some other petroleum products including lubricating oils. When 
‚Äòunconventional‚Äô sources of fuel for spark ignition engines are being investigated the viscosity might 
well fall outside the range given above. For example [2] with ‚Äòcatalytically upgraded‚Äô pyrolysis oil from 
wood otherwise suitable for substituting for gasoline the viscosities were in the range 25 to 43 cSt. The 
value for iso-octane is 0.74 cSt. 
3.2.2	
Viscosities of blends
Gasoline itself might in fact be a blended material if, as mentioned in the introductory part of this 
chapter, it has been extended with reformed naphtha (frequently called ‚Äòblendstock‚Äô) or FCC gasoline. 
It is however with the blending of gasoline of whatever nature and origin with alcohol fuels that we are 
concerned in this section. 
Methanol-gasoline fuels do exist, but there is not the same degree of use as there is with ethanol-gasoline 
fuels. This is not difficult to understand. The raison d‚Äôetre of ethanol-gasoline fuels is that the ethanol 
component is carbon neutral. Methanol is usually made from coal or natural gas via synthesis gas, in 
which case it is not carbon neutral. 
The ethanol-gasoline blend of lowest ethanol content is E10, which is 10% ethanol balance gasoline. Its 
viscosity amongst other properties is discussed in a recent paper by Kiatkittipong et al. [3]. These workers 
compared a commercial E10 ‚Äògasohol‚Äô with FCC gasoline and with the same FCC gasoline blended with 
alcohol. The kinematic viscosities at room temperature were respectively 0.89 cSt, 0.67 cSt and 0.84 cSt. 
These are all in the range given above for ‚Äògasolines‚Äô generically. There are Flexi Fuel Vehicles (FFV) 
which can use any fuel in the composition range from neat gasoline to E85. Clearly, the viscosity variation 
between the fuels across the range of gasoline-ethanol proportions is not a difficulty in operation. (The 
first E85 forecourt dispenser in the UK came into service at the time this chapter was being written [4].) 
Note that although the simplified form of the Grunberg-Nissan equation used in the previous chapter 
for crude oils would be suitable for application to the blending of straight-run gasoline and reformed 
naphtha it would not be suitable for gasoline-ethanol blends. This is because for gasoline and ethanol 
the approximation Œ≥12 = 0 would not hold. Gasoline-alcohol fuels are further discussed in Chapter 8.

Physical properties of gasolines
3.2.3	
The vehicle fuel pump
Typically an electric fuel pump in a modern car will operate at a pressure of 90 p.s.i. [5] This figure is 
examined in the boxed area below.
90 p.s.i. ‚âà 6 √ó 105 N m-2
By far the major component of the energy will be pressure energy, the kinetic and potential 
energy changes on pumping being relatively very small. This can be expressed:
Pressure energy = P/œÅ where P is the pressure and œÅ is the density. Putting our value 
for the pressure and a mid-range value of 740 kg m-3 for the density:
Pressure energy = 6 √ó 105 N m-2/740 kg m-3
= 810 m2s-2 (‚â° J kg-1)
Now for a vehicle travelling at 40 miles per hour with a fuel consumption of 50 miles per gallon:
Fuel used in 1 hour = 0.8 gallon ‚â° 3 litres or 2.2 kg
Rate of supply of mechanical energy by the pump 
= 810 J kg-1 √ó 2.2 kg/(3600 s) = 0.5 W.
That the pump operates at about half a watt when the car is cruising at 40 m.p.h. is intuitively a very 
sensible result. The variation of viscosities between gasolines is a negligible factor in the performance of 
such a pump which is why, as noted previously, viscosity is not the most important factor in the quality 
control of gasolines. The very high values noted for pyrolysates [2] would probably not preclude their 
use. If the calculation is repeated for the process of transferring gasoline from refinery exit to terminal 
at a a rate of 1 m3 per minute with the same pump head pressure, the power required is 10 kW. 
3.3	
Coefficient of thermal expansion
A generic value of 0.00095 K-1 for gasolines is given in [6]. A point which will be examined subsequently 
in this book is that although the principle of mass balance obviously applies to refining, volume balance 
does not. There is always net increase in the volume. This is the effect of ‚Äòrefinery gain‚Äô and its primary 
origin is a positive volume change (‚àÜV) for the separation of the respective components. It is typically 
6% [4]. Having regard to the fact that crude oil is sold by unit volume ‚Äì the barrel ‚Äì and that distillate 
is sold in litres or gallons ‚Äòrefinery gain‚Äô is of importance when yields of distillate are evaluated. 
It is also clear however that gasoline tapped off at its refining temperature will be at a significantly lower 
density than at room temperature. Consider a gasoline having an API density of 60o at 15oC, corresponding 
to a density of 740 kg m-3. Using a calculation like that for Wytch farm crude in the previous chapter and 
the above value of Œ≤, it is easily shown that at a take-off temperature of 200oC the gasoline will have a 
density as low as 565 kg m-3. The specific volume consequently goes up from 0.00135 to 0.00180 m3 kg-1.

Acoustic impedance, thermal and electrical conductivities
The acoustic impedance of a gasoline is typically 1 Mrayl, of the same order as for crude oils but somewhat 
lower. Acoustic principles can be used in the detection of leaks of distillates such as gasoline. There is 
however another, more interesting, application to gasolines. The octane number of a gasoline can be 
correlated with acoustic impedance. This enables the octane number of a gasoline to be determined whilst 
it is flowing in a pipe at a refinery, a clear improvement over the measurement of the octane number for 
samples by the traditional approach. There have been a number of related patents. 
The thermal conductivity of a gasoline is about the same as for a typical crude oil. A value of 25 pS m-1 
would be typical of the electrical conductivity of gasoline. 
3.5	
Refractive index
The refractive index of iso-octane is 1.39 and intuitively we expect values for gasolines to somewhere 
close to that. One of the primary applications of optics to gasoline is the detection of contaminants 
from the higher boiling ranges. Such contaminants are usually from the kerosene boiling range. If the 
refractive index of a particular gasoline in its unadulterated state is measured, aberrations from that 
value signify contamination and this can be made quantitative. As with the discussion of viscosities of 
crude oils in the previous chapter, our purpose is best served by examining reported information from 
the research literature.

Physical properties of gasolines
S. Roy [8] provides a plot of the refractive index of a gasoline-kerosene mixture with percentage kerosene. 
It rises from just below 1.42 for gasoline alone to just over 1.43 for 50% kerosene. The graph rises most 
steeply at low kerosene concentrations and the resolution is such that 2% or even less of kerosene could 
reliably be detected. This investigator also presented the Beer-Lambert absorbance for gasoline-kerosene 
mixtures across the same concentration range with light at the single wavelength of 630 nm. The pure 
gasoline was totally transparent to this, whereas there was significant absorption at 5% kerosene rising 
approximately linearly over the concentration range, so here again is a powerful tool for inspecting 
gasoline for the presence of heavier hydrocarbons.
Numerous sources give a value of 2 for the dielectric constant of gasoline. Using the expression given 
in Chapter 1:
refractive index = (dielectric constant)0.5
this gives a value of ‚àö2 = 1.414 for the refractive index, in encouraging agreement with the experimental 
values quoted above. 
3.6	
Vapour pressure
3.6.1	
Reid Vapour Pressure (RVP)
There is of course no such thing as ‚Äòthe vapour pressure‚Äô of a gasoline. This is because the observed 
vapour pressure depends upon the volume into which the vapour expands. The standard industry 
measure is the Reid Vapour Pressure, where the volume occupied by the vapour is the same between 
tests, hopefully enabling at least comparative differences between gasolines to be measured. The RVP, 
which is measured at 38oC, is sometimes determined for crude oil and for other petroleum fractions 
including kerosene. A synthesis of selected recent literature appertaining to the RVP of gasolines and 
blends containing gasoline follows in tabular form.

Trends evident from the limited but certainly representative entries in the table are that ethanol raises 
the RVP and ETBE lowers it. ETBE is one of a number of oxygenated additives for gasoline. Methyl 
tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) is another, and it has been observed that this causes a rise in the RVP as 
does methanol when that is blended with gasoline. 
FCC gasoline tends to have somewhat lower values of the RVP than a ‚Äòbase gasoline‚Äô. The vapour pressure 
of iso-octane at 38oC is 14 kPa, suggesting that for vapour pressure purposes iso-octane is not the best 
reference hydrocarbon compound. Cyclopentane has a vapour pressure of 68 kPa at 38oC and is thus a 
good benchmark for ‚Äòwinter gasoline‚Äô. 
3.6.2	
Refinements to the RVP
When the RVP is measured there is air in the confined space which was previously dissolved in the test 
sample. Corrections for this can be made by means of charts [13] and the vapour pressure so determined 
is called the True Vapour Pressure (TVP). Moreover, if the RVP, which is of course always determined 
at 38oC (100oF), is known for a particular hydrocarbon stock its TVP at other temperatures can be 
determined from the chart. The chart itself will not be reproduced as an interested reader can very easily 
download it from web sites including [13].

Physical properties of gasolines
Hatzioannidis et al. [14] found that for a limited number of gasolines experimentally examined the 
following holds:
RVP/kPa = 1.0091(TVP/kPa) + 5.53
from which, for example, a gasoline having a RVP of 50 kPa will have a TVP of 44 kPa. This The present 
author has checked this against the plot in [13] and obtained a value of 46 kPa to the nearest whole number. 
This is reasonable agreement, but it is emphasised that the plot in [13] is intended to be used across a 
wide range of distillate RVP values whereas the correlation above appertains only to those particular 
gasolines (some of which contained additives) examined in [14] so if it is used more widely it must be 
with caution. 
Of course, the so-called true vapour pressure is not the vapour pressure any more than the RVP is. It 
has already been explained that no such vapour pressure exists for a distillate because of the dependence 
of the vapour pressure on the space which the vapour occupies. The TVP is merely the RVP corrected 
for air (and water vapour) in the measurement space.

Thermal conductivity
In [15] the following is given as applying to any petroleum derived liquid:
106k/cal s-1 cm-1 oC-1 = 333 ‚Äì 0.19t
where t is the temperature in oC. So for t = 20oC this gives:
k = 329 √ó 10-6 cal s-1 cm-1 oC-1 ‚â° 0.14 W m-1K-1
and this should be compared with values given in Table 1.4. A value of 0.15 W m-1K-1 for gasoline at 
room temperature is given in [16]. At 200oC, which might be the upper boiling limit depending on the 
width of cut taken in refining, the value according to the above correlation would be 0.12 W m-1K-1. 
3.8	
Concluding remarks
Spark ignition engines have become more and more advanced in their design and operation, to a very 
large extent precluding DIY maintenance. A result has been vehicles which can accept fuels of varied 
composition and this relates to carbon dioxide emission control. These points will be discussed more 
fully in the coverage of alcohol-containing fuels.

Appendix on natural gas condensate
Appendix on natural gas 
condensate
A1	
Introduction
Oil and gas in a deep well are of course significantly higher in temperature than ambient. Natural gas, 
associated or non-associated, on cooling releases hydrocarbon up to about C5 in liquid form and this is 
called natural gas condensate5. Where non-associated gas is high in condensate the field from which it 
comes is known as a condensate field; there are several such in the southern part of the UK sector of the 
North Sea. Condensate from associated gas is usually combined with the liquid stream for piping to a 
terminal. Condensate can be blended with gasoline and this occurs in countries including New Zealand. 
Hence coverage of condensate in this part of the book is appropriate. The same physical properties that 
have been discussed for gasoline will be outlined for condensate in this appendix.
A2	
Physical properties of natural gas condensate
Natural gas condensates vary widely in the balance of the respective constituents, therefore their densities 
also vary widely. Reference [1] gives a range of 620 to 760 kg m-3 (97 to 55 oAPI). The kinematic viscosity 
of a particular condensate [2] at 30oC was measured as 0.7 cSt, making it less viscous than water which 
has a value at 30oC is 0.8 cSt. Its Reid vapour pressure [3] is in excess of 2.5 bar. 
A3	
Concluding remarks
In reporting statistics for oil production, ‚Äòtotals‚Äô incorporate crude oil condensate, shale oil and oil from 
tar sands as well as gas-to-liquid fuels. The highest average for a single day in 2008 on this basis was 
81.73 million barrels per day. For crude oil and condensate without the other sources the highest daily 
average was 72.75 million barrels per day. Crude oil and condensate are often lumped together in such 
accounting, although there is one notable exception. An OPEC country is assigned a production quota 
and must meet it for continued membership. The quota is expressly a quantity of crude oil and a crude 
oil/condensate aggregate figure is not acceptable for this purpose.

Physical properties of kerosenes
4	 Physical properties of kerosenes
4.1	
Introduction
In the distillation of crude oil there is a gap between gasoline and kerosene, the fraction known as 
naphtha. Unprocessed naphtha is unsuitable for blending with gasoline as it lowers the octane number. 
Naphtha is unsuitable for blending with kerosene as, quite apart from any performance considerations, 
it lowers the flash point. We saw in a previous chapter that reformed naphtha is frequently blended with 
gasoline. Naphtha can also be steam reformed to make fuel gas or synthesis gas. Like gasoline, kerosene 
can come from sources other than crude oil including shale and tar sands. 
Kerosene is of course used to power jet aircraft. A jet fuel might be kerosene alone or it might be ‚Äòwide 
cut‚Äô taking in some of the heavier components of the naphtha boiling range additionally to the kerosene. 
In such fuels however kerosene will always be in preponderance. A jet engine is a gas turbine, and 
burning is continuous at a combustion chamber. This is in contrast to a petrol or diesel engine where 
ignition occurs at the required stage in the thermodynamic cycle. Consequently there is no analogue 
for kerosene of the octane number for gasoline.
4.2	
Density
A typical density for a kerosene jet aircraft fuel would be 780 kg m-3 or 50oAPI [1]. Of course, there is 
a large difference between the temperature at which an aircraft on the ground receives fuel and that at 
which the aircraft cruises. At a cruising height of ‚âà 10000 metres the temperature will be about -50oC 
(223 K). The calculation performed in section 2.3 for crude oil is repeated below for kerosene. Symbols 
are as previously and the temperature at which the aircraft is refuelled is taken to be 15oC (288 K). It can 
be seen from the calculation that at cruising altitude the kerosene is 11 degrees lower on the API scale 
than on the ground, that is, its density has significantly increased as a result of ascent. 
Œ≤ = ‚àí (1/œÅ) dœÅ/dT
‚áì
Œ≤(223 ‚Äì 288) = -ln {œÅ(223K)/œÅ(288K)}
Using Œ≤ = 0.00099 K-1 [2] and œÅ(288K) = 780 kg m-3 gives: œÅ(223 K) = 832 kg m-3 (39o API)
These figures are closely matched by a graph of density against temperature for a particular jet fuel [3]. 
The units of density in [3] are lb per US gallon and these have had to be converted to kg m-3 for this 
discussion. The fuel under consideration has a density of 760 kg m-3 at + 20oC and a density of 808 kg 
m-3 at -40oC. The interested reader can easily confirm that this corresponds to a b value of 0.0010 K-1.

Solid deposition
The temperature at which wax appears is an important factor in jet fuel specification. At the cloud point 
wax appears6. Specification for jet fuels take note of this, and a value of -47oC applies in some countries. 
In others (including Russia) jet fuels are commonly used which have a cloud point not above -50oC. 
When an aircraft crashed at Heathrow early in 2008 there were suggestions, subsequently dismissed, that 
the fuel had experienced solid deposition a few hours earlier whilst the aircraft was flying over Siberia 
where the temperature at the altitude of the aircraft was about -75oC [4]. 
The temperature at which a matrix structure within the fuel is formed which precludes flow is called the 
pour point. Often when a fuel initially reaches the pour point only something like 1% of the total mass 
is in the solid state, and the pour point is usually less than 10oC below the cloud point (see section 4.4). 
Below the cloud point the temperature dependence of the viscosity changes and with some fuel systems 
this makes for difficulties. With jet aircraft however it is the pour point which determines the lowest 
operating temperature [5]. In an airliner there is a temperature sensor within the fuel which, if the fuel 
drops to a temperature below that considered safe, sends a signal to the cockpit.

Physical properties of kerosenes
Additives are available by means of which the pour point of a jet fuel can be lowered, known as ‚Äòpour point 
depressants‚Äô. These work analogously to the solute in simple freezing point depression of a single liquid 
compound. They are added in amounts of less than 1%, and many consist of copolymers of ethylene and 
vinyl esters [6]. Urea has been shown to be an effective pour point depressant under certain conditions 
[7]. Ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether [8] have been widely 
used. A jet fuel might also contain a corrosion inhibitor. This can have a side-effect on viscosity and 
solid deposition behaviour as will be explained more fully in the next section.

Viscosity
4.4.1	
Viscosities at flight altitudes
Viscosities at the temperature of flight are relevant to performance, and accordingly review of a study 
of the viscosities of jet fuels at such temperatures [9] will be commence this section. Assigning for the 
purpose of this summary the descriptors Fuel X and Fuel Y to two of the fuels which feature in [9], 
viscosities and supplementary data are given in the table below.

Fuel X was further studied for wax deposition behaviour [9]. At the cloud point temperature of  
-52.6oC the bulk liquid was free of wax, but wax was becoming evident at the interface of the fuel and the 
container wall. On further cooling to the pour point of -58.0oC wax appeared in the bulk liquid after 37.5 
minutes, and the inside container wall was coated with wax. Wax in the bulk liquid had become much 
more abundant after another five minutes and had consolidated in parts of the sample after another five 
minutes. When a proprietary corrosion inhibitor was present the cloud point of Fuel X was found to 
rise to as high as -40oC. This is believed to be due to the provision of nucleation sites for incipient wax 
by the constituents of the additive.

A correlation for variation of viscosity of kerosene with temperature

u = 2.9 cSt
and broad consistency with the values for Fuels X and Y in the above table should be noted. As the 
kerosene being supplied advances within the fuel system its temperature rises because of conduction to 
the pipes from the combustion chamber and it is believed [10] that temperatures of up to 120oC (393K) 
are experienced by the fuel. Putting a value for T of 393 K in the correlation gives:
u = 0.52 cSt
It is clear then that kerosene will drop in viscosity by about an order of magnitude between the 
tank temperature and the warmest part of the fuel lines. At the reference temperature for viscosity 
measurement, which is 60oF (15oC 288 K), the above correlation gives a value of 1.4 cSt which is only 
about 40% higher than the value for water at the same temperature. ‚ÄòGeneral purpose‚Äô values of the 
kinematic viscosity of kerosene at this temperature are often a little higher; as an example [11] gives 2.5 cSt.
4.4.3	
Kerosene as a diluent for lubricating oils
The suitability of a lubricating oil for a particular purpose depends strongly on the viscosity, and a 
lubricating oil can be diluted with kerosene to a required viscosity. An ASTM (American Society for 
Testing and Materials) source gives the following information for oils of various kinematic viscosity after 
blending with kerosene of kinematic viscosity 3 cSt. Blending is 50:50 at 40oC in each case.

Physical properties of kerosenes
The values for the diluted oil can be compared with those from the simplified Grunberg-Nissan equation 
which in Chapter 2 was applied to crude oils. The working is in the boxed area below.
With symbols as in Chapter 2, and assigning subscript 1 to the oil and subscript 2 to the kerosene:
ln¬µ12 = œï1ln¬µ1 + œï2ln¬µ2
Noting that œï1 = œï2 = 0.5 and that œÖ = ¬µœÅ
lnœÖ12œÅ12 = œïln¬µ1œÅ1 + œïlnœÖ2œÅ2
lnœÖ12 = œïlnœÖ1 + œïlnœÖ2 + ln[(œÅ2œÅ1)0.5/œÅ12]
Now the argument of the logarithm containing the densities will be very close to 
unity making the logarithm itself very close to zero and negligible, hence:
lnœÖ12 = 0.5lnœÖ1 + 0.5ln3
œÖ12 = exp{0.5lnœÖ1 + 0.55}

equation does appear to deliver the goods. 
4.5	
Acoustic impedance
Reference [12] gives a value of 1.07 Mrayl for the acoustic impedance of kerosene. Values for gasolines 
and kerosenes are close to each other and both are significantly lower than that for a typical crude oil. 
The acoustic impedance of the fuel is the principle of ultrasonic measurement of levels in aircraft fuel 
tanks. For example, the new model Boeing 777 series will carry such a device [13]. Ultrasonic fuel tank 
gauges are beginning the replace the earlier type which used the capacitance of the fuel as a basis for 
determining the height of the liquid surface. This is discussed more fully below.
4.6	
Capacitance
The capacitance is a measure of the charge which can be held by a dielectric per unit potential difference 
across it. Its units are thus:
coulomb/volt = farad
In a capacitive aircraft fuel gauge a metal electrode is immersed in the fuel and the metal fuel wall forms 
a second electrode. As the level of liquid recedes the capacitance experienced by the electrode pair 
changes. Capacitances in this sort of application are of the order of picofarads (pF).

Electrical conductivities
Kerosene jet fuel typically has 50 pS m-1 conductivity [14]. Often a static dissipator additive (a.k.a. as 
a conductivity improver) is used to increase the electrical conductivity so as to prevent ignition from 
an electrical discharge during aircraft refuelling. Some specifications require a conductivity as high as 
600 pS m-1 in which case the static dissipator additive has to raise the conductivity by up an order of 
magnitude. The limit on the amount of static dissipator additive is 3 milligrams per litre of fuel. This is 
because amounts any higher would interfere with fuel tank level measurements by capacitance. A widely 
used static dissipator additive is Stadis 450, manufactured by Octel, the active ingredient of which is 
dinonylnaphthylsulfonic acid (DINNSA). Pour point depressant additives, being non-ionic, do not affect 
the capacitance. 
4.8	
Refractive index
Tables of values for the refractive indices of liquids give values of typically 1.448 [15] for the refractive 
index of kerosene. We saw in our discussion of the refractive index of gasolines in the previous chapter that 
when a gasoline is contaminated with kerosene the refractive index can provide a measure of the degree 
of contamination. This idea was taken further [16] when gasoline-kerosene blends in the composition 
range pure gasoline to pure kerosene were examined for refractive index. Up to a kerosene content of 
5% balance gasoline, the refractive index is indistinguishable from that for the neat gasoline which is 
1.418. With greater amounts of kerosene there is a rise to 1.425 at 30% kerosene and to 1.440 at 100% 
kerosene. We note in passing that the kinematic viscosity of the blends studied in [16] rises from 1.0 to 
2.2 cSt across the composition range.
4.9	
Vapour pressure
RVP values for kerosenes are much lower than for gasolines as would be expected from their higher 
boiling range. An equation of the form:
P = Aexp(-B/T)
where P is the vapour pressure, T the temperature and A and B are constants has sometimes been applied 
to the vapour pressure of kerosenes. Such an equation applies rigorously only to pure hydrocarbon 
compounds, being an integrated form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. In this case B is the heat 
of vaporisation divided by the gas constant. That complex mixtures of hydrocarbons when examined 
experimentally often conform to such a functional form is well known (e.g., [17]). In reference [18] 
several kerosene jet fuels were examined for temperature dependence of vapour pressure and the results 
fitted to an equation of the form above. One of the fuels was found to fit the equation:
P/kPa = 6905exp(-2196.53/T)

Physical properties of kerosenes
Putting T = 311K which is the temperature of an RVP measurement:
P= 5.9 kPa
A similar fuel was found to conform to:
P/kPa = 2779.43exp(-1773.77/T)
giving a RVP of 9.3 kPa. Work cited in reference [18] gives, for another kerosene jet fuel:
P/kPa = 653436.08exp(-4243.3/T)
giving an RVP of 0.78 kPa (6 mm Hg). That some kerosenes do have RVP values as low as this is well 
known. 
When with results of the type outlined above ln(P/kPa) is plotted against 103K/T the result is a line of 
slope ‚ÄìB (units K). As we have seen, for a pure compound:
B = ‚àÜHvap/R

so a steep slope would signify a high heat of vaporisation. We expect intuitively that the same would apply 
to the kerosenes. In the example equations given above the constant in the exponential varies by a factor 
in excess of two. That the one with the highest value of B is the one with the lowest RVP is significant. 
4.10	
Thermal conductivity
The equation used in the previous chapter for gasoline, viz.:
106k/cal s-1 cm-1 oC-1 = 333 ‚Äì 0.19t
with symbols as defined previously is believed to hold for any petroleum fraction, so the value of 0.14 
W m-1K-1 at 20oC obtained for gasoline is expected to hold for kerosene. Many sources including [19] 
give a value of 0.15 W m-1K-1. At 250oC, which is in the neighbourhood of the upper boiling limit, the 
value calculated from the correlation is 0.12 W m-1K-1. 
4.11	
Concluding remarks
Supply of kerosenes to the huge yet very vulnerable airline industry will continue. ‚ÄòCarbon footprints‚Äô of 
air travel are sometimes offset in financial terms by passengers. It in unlikely that the costs incurred by 
carbon emissions would be a major threat to the economic viability of the industry as such emissions are 
minor, about 2% of the total. The cost of fuel is important, and the last few years (since about the time 
of the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes) have seen unprecedentedly erratic changes in the price of crude oil. 
In some ways there is more flexibility for use of novel fuels with jet engines, since combustion in such a 
device is continuous not intermittent as stated earlier in this chapter there is no analogue of the octane 
number. The flexibility is however restricted by the very large temperature swings a jet fuel experiences in 
flight and effects of this on fuel pumping. There will be a return to this theme in the chapter on biodiesels.

Diesel fuels
5	 Diesel fuels
5.1	
Introduction
Diesel fuels find application in compression ignition engines and in gas turbines. As ‚Äòlight fuel oil‚Äô they 
are also used in heating. The diesel fraction from crude oil is the heaviest of the atmospheric distillates; 
material beyond that is either vacuum distillate or residue. The performance index for a diesel fuel is 
the cetane number, and the benchmark value is 50. Whereas the octane number for a gasoline relates 
to the resistance to unintended compression ignition in advance of the spark the cetane index relates to 
resistance to delay of intended compression ignition. The two are just about opposite conceptually, which 
is why the view that the cetane number is the counterpart for diesel of the octane number for gasoline 
is misleading and better avoided. 
The current research literature on fuels for compression ignition engines is dominated by biodiesels. 
These are becoming increasingly important and have a chapter to themselves later in this text. Mineral 
diesel, that is diesel from crude oil, shale or tar sands will be the subject of this chapter. The important 
difference between biodiesel and mineral diesel is that the former is carbon neutral and the latter is not. 
A typical density for diesel is 850 kg m-3, corresponding to an API gravity of 37 degrees. A coefficient 
of expansion of 0.00083 applies [1]. 
5.2	
Solid deposition
5.2.1	
Background
As we saw in the previous chapter, with kerosene the cloud point is relevant only at the very low 
temperatures experienced by aircraft at altitudes of the order of 10000 metres. With diesel solid deposition 
can occur at higher temperatures. The cloud point and pour point have already been defined in this book. 
With diesel there is a further measured temperature, the cold filter plugging point (CFPP) defined [2] 
as the lowest temperature of a diesel sample at which it will pass through a fine mesh, the spacings of 
which are specified in the ASTM and other standards for CFPP determination. The CFPP is obviously 
between the pour point and the cloud point and is expected to be closer to the former. The following 
information on cloud points and pour points of mineral diesels is from a very recent research paper [3]. 
For the purposes of this discussion they are called fuels A to E.

Diesel fuels
The cloud point and CFFP are seen to be separated by 3 to 5oC across the range of samples. The possibility 
of interference of the functioning of a diesel engine by solids in the fuel is clear from these figures. This 
necessitates pour point additives. By means of a calculation like that in the previous chapter for gasoline 
and using the value for the coefficient of expansion of diesel given above, it is easily shown that Fuel A 
would have a density of 806 kg m-3 at its cloud point.
5.2.2	
Cloud point depressants
Again, our discussion is best taken forward by examination of suitable research literature. The author 
has selected from the information in [4] one data point for cloud point depression by an additive. It was 
pointed out in a previous chapter that the action of such a depressant can be seen as a simple colligative 
property entirely analogous to simple freezing point depression. A related calculation is in the boxed 
area below. 
One data pair from [4] is:
Cloud point depression of 1oC with 5% cloud point depressant. The depressant is 85% 2,6 dimethyl 
octane, molecular weight 142. The minor constituents of the additive are of similar structure, so a 
value of 142 will be used for the molecular weight of the additive. The relevant equation is:
‚àÜ(CP) = kfc
where ‚àÜ(CP) is the cloud point depression (oC), c is the concentration of depressant (mol 
per kg solvent) and kf is the depression constant (oC kg mol-1 ). Now a concentration 
of the additive of 5% corresponds to 0.35 mol per kg of solvent giving:
kf ‚âà 2.8oC kg mol-1
No more than order-of-magnitude correctness for this figure is being claimed. We note however that 
it is exactly half way between the value for water and that for benzene, respectively 1.86 and 5.12 oC 
kg mol-1. The view that the action of the additive is colligative is broadly supported by the result.
A further point can be made. Some cloud point depressants are not simple hydrocarbons as in the above 
calculation but are polymers. These would not be added in amounts as high as 5%. For an additive the 
dominant constituent of which is a C10 hydrocarbon inclusion at 5% level might be possible without 
affecting the cetane number although this would of course have to be considered. In [4] it is reported 
that the additive at 5% level reduces the cetane index by 1.3 units. 
There are additives for lowering the CFPP of a diesel including acetate copolymers [6]. The author has 
examined numerical results from these along the lines of the calculation in the box above, and has found 
that impossibly high values of kf result. The meaning of this is of course fairly clear: the action of such 
additives is not colligative, but involves prevention of nucleation of wax.

Viscosities
A diesel fuel is likely to have a kinematic viscosity at room temperature of up to about 5 cSt. The correlation 
in section 4.4.2 indicates that kerosenes at room temperature have kinematic viscosities between 1 and 
2 cSt and in Chapter 3 it was stated that gasolines have kinematic viscosities in the range 0.4 to 1 cSt. 
The increase in viscosity with refining temperature is clear. This is better understood as increase in 
viscosity ‚Äì ‚Äòresistance to flow‚Äô ‚Äì with increasing size of the hydrocarbon molecules. 
Some of the literature discussed in relation to solid deposition in the previous paragraph also contains 
viscosity information and this is summarised in the table below. There is also information taken from 
an additional reference [7].

Refractive index
The refractive indices of the low-sulphur diesels which feature in the final row of the table at the end 
of the previous section are 1.4595 and 1.4745. Again a mild trend of increase with density is evident, a 
typical value of 1.448 having been noted in Chapter 4 for kerosenes and values of around 1.42 having 
been noted in Chapter 3 for gasolines. The refractive index of n-cetane, the benchmark hydrocarbon 
against which diesels are assessed, is 1.432 [8]. The dielectric constant for diesel fuels varies across 
quite a wide range, from about 2 to about 6, making the correlation used for the lighter fractions for 
calculating the refractive index from the dielectric constant unsuitable for diesels. The meaning of the 
correlation, which even for a pure hydrocarbon compound is only approximate, is not altogether lost 
when diesels are considered. Taking the mean of the two values of the refractive index earlier in this 
paragraph and squaring it gives a value for the dielectric constant of 2.15, which is within the range 
given though certainly at the low end of it. The dielectric constant of n-cetane at 20oC is 2.08 [9], giving 
a value of the refractive index of:
‚àö2.08 = 1.442
which is 0.7 of one per cent higher than the experimental value given above. Further information on 
the refractive indices of diesels is given in calculation form in the boxed area below. 
In the paper by Riazi and Roomi [10 ] which was also drawn on in Chapter 1 the following 
equation is given for petroleum fractions having average molecular weights below 300:
I = 0.328œÖ-0.003œÅ0.915
where I is the refractive index parameter as defined in Chapter 1, œÖ the kinematic viscosity in cSt and œÅ 
the density (water = 1). We saw above that diesels have kinematic viscosities of around 5 cSt and densities 
of around 850 kg m-3 (i.e., œÅ = 0.85). Inserting these numbers into the above equation gives:
I = 0.28 = (n2 ‚Äì 1)/(n2 + 2) where n is the refractive index
‚áì
n = 1.47
which is a result consistent with the values given previously in this section.
A reader utilising the correlation in the box above might well make the judgement that the term  
œÖ-0.003 is so close to unity across the range of values of the kinematic viscosity of diesels that it can be 
omitted without any loss of precision.

Electrical conductivity
A value of the electrical conductivity of about 50 pS m-1 is required for a diesel fuel not to create a static 
discharge when in rapid movement and straight-run diesel might well have a value this high or higher. 
Ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD) has become the norm in many countries since about 2006, and the 
processes involved in removing the sulphur tends to lower the conductivity. Very interesting comparisons 
are made in reference [11], in which a particular ‚Äòpre 2006‚Äô diesel is compared with a ULSD in terms of 
electrical conductivity. The values are respectively 226 and 10 pS m-1 and the latter is clearly unacceptable. 
It is shown in [11] how use of a particular additive can raise the conductivity of ULSD to several hundreds 
of pS m-1, ensuring the safety of the product from the electrostatic discharge point of view. 
5.6	
Lubricity
Lubricity is a measure of the extent to which abrasion caused by the movement of one metal surface 
against another is mitigated by a particular hydrocarbon, and lubricity values for diesel fuels (and their 
carbon neutral alternatives, as will be fully explained in a later chapter) are of some importance. Lubricity 
is determined [12] in an apparatus whereby a steel ball rotates whilst in contact with fixed steel plate, the 
entire assembly being immersed in the fuel of interest. The ‚Äòscar diameter‚Äô on the fixed steel plate after 
such a test, units microns, is termed the lubricity. A fuel with a good degree of lubricity will give rise to 
a small scar diameter. There are standard procedures for this test approved by bodies including ASTM. 
Literature cited previously in this chapter contains lubricity information and this is summarised in the 
table below. Information from a further reference [13] is also given.

A value of 450 ¬µm for a ULSD without a lubricity additive
The ULSD has the highest value (i.e., the poorest lubricity) of the diesels in the table, and it is known 
that the processes involved in making ULSD have an adverse effect on lubricity, as they do on electrical 
conductivity. Toluene is an example of a lubricity enhancing additive. Standards vary from place to place; 
in the US 520 ¬µm is seen as the maximum acceptable value for a diesel fuel.

Diesel fuels
Tests like that for lubricity are fraught with potential irreproducibility even if performed according to 
a recognised and approved procedure. Consequently the view is often taken that when a particular 
hydrocarbon product is examined for lubricity it should be against a standard hydrocarbon so that the 
basis of the test result is comparative. The standard substance and that being examined will be tested in 
the same apparatus without adjustment of conditions between the tests. This approach was taken in the 
work described in reference [14] in which the wear scars were measured in more than one direction and 
averaged. Such values for the ‚Äòhigh lube standard‚Äô and ‚Äòlow lube standard‚Äô at a test temperature of 25oC 
were 320 and 654 mm respectively. A regular diesel having had no desulphurisation gave a value of 413, 
whilst a ULSD without an additive gave 613 mm. The same ULSD with a lubricity additive gave 303 mm.
These results confirm what has been said in this paragraph previously about ULSD and also affirm the 
effectiveness of a suitable lubricity additive. Cetane (a.k.a. hexadecane) gave an averaged value of 412 
¬µm. It was noted in the previous section that cetane is a little aberrant in terms of refractive index but 
from the investigation in [14] it appears to have a lubricity comfortably below the maximum value for 
usage. The actual value is below the maximum figure for the US quoted above but, given that [14] was 
a comparative study, the important observation is that the value is much closer to that of the ‚Äòhigh 
lube standard‚Äô than that of the ‚Äòlow lube standard‚Äô. The equality, to within much less than one per cent, 
of the values for cetane and for the regular diesel is further evidence that cetane is a suitable model 
compound for lubricity as well as for resistance to ignition delay. Of the pure compounds examined in 
[14] 1-dodecene had the poorest lubricity (746 ¬µm) and 1-hexadecene the best (309 ¬µm). With regard 
to the latter it can be deduced that introduction of a double bond into the cetane structure gives it even 
better lubricity. This section has of course been concerned with the lubricity of fuels. Lubricants per se 
will be discussed in a later chapter.

Vapour pressure
Vapour pressures of diesels at room temperature are very low; that discussed in [14] has a vapour pressure 
of 0.4 mm Hg (‚â° 0.053 kPa). That for cetane is less than 1 mm mercury [15], yet another ‚Äòplus‚Äô for cetane.

Diesel fuels
A calculation concerning the vapour pressure of a diesel is in the boxed area below.
Imagine diesel vapour in equilibrium with liquid, the space into which 
the diesel vapour expands also containing air at 1 bar.
Total pressure = 100.053 kPa
Assigning subscripts A to the air and D to the diesel vapour:
PAV = nART                  PDV = nDRT
‚áì
nD/(nA + nD) ‚âà nD/nA = PD/PA
= (0.053/100) √ó 106 parts per million (p.p.m.)
= 530 p.p.m.
We first note that a p.p.m. in the hundreds is certainly likely to exceed the odour threshold and this is 
consistent with common experience in the handling of diesel. No odour threshold appears to have been 
established for cetane. We can cautiously compare diesel with n-dodecane in these terms as this has a 
vapour pressure of 0.3 mm Hg, a value typical of a diesel. Its odour threshold is 5 p.p.m. [16].

The value of 530 p.p.m. can be broadly compared with threshold limit values for pure hydrocarbon 
compounds. The threshold limit value (TLV) for styrene is 20 p.p.m. [17]. That for cyclohexane is 300 
p.p.m. [18]. That for toluene is 50 to 100 p.p.m. [19]. Other examples can be given but enough has been 
said to support the view that the diesel concentration in the calculation is sufficient to be harmful.

Thermal conductivity
The correlation previously applied to gasoline and to kerosene:
106k/cal s-1 cm-1 oC-1 = 333 ‚Äì 0.19t
at 20oC and at distillation temperatures will in our coverage of diesel be applied for negative values 
of t, that is, temperatures below 0oC. At temperatures in the region of the cloud point, say -10oC, the 
prediction of the correlation is:
k = 335 √ó 10-6 cal s-1 cm-1 K-1 ‚â° 0.14 W m-1K-1
so this property is not significantly affected by the low temperature at aircraft cruising altitudes. The 
thermal conductivity is of course relevant even where heat transfer is by convection, as at aircraft speeds it 
is likely to be. This is because in convective heat transfer there is conduction across the thermal boundary 
layer. That is why the thermal conductivity of the fluid appears in the denominator of the Nusselt number, 
the dimensionless form of the heat transfer coefficient which in forced convection depends on the degree 
of turbulence expressible as the Reynolds number. 
5.9	
Concluding remarks
A significant proportion of the vehicles on the highways of the world use diesel engines. A generation 
ago there was some suspicion as to their reliability and, to reduce the discussion to a mildly materialistic 
level, concern that a diesel car purchased new would not a few years later attract a good trade-in price. 
A measure in meeting carbon emission targets is use of biodiesel-diesel blends, or biodiesel alone. 
Biodiesels have a chapter to themselves later in the book.

Heavy fuel oils
6.1.1	
Introduction
The terms ‚Äòheavy fuel oil‚Äô and ‚Äòresidual fuel oil‚Äô are approximately synonymous. By far the main application 
is shipping, where in addition to purely residual oils other oils comprising blends of residue with distillate 
are used. They are both examples of ‚Äòbunker fuel‚Äô and this term might also be applied to distillate oil for 
marine use. Such distillate will be in the diesel boiling range. 
6.1.2	
Density and viscosity of residual oils
Examples of density-viscosity pairs for various bunker fuels are obtainable from the web pages [1] of 
the O.W. Bunker group, one of the world‚Äôs major suppliers of fuel oil for marine use. The information 
in the table below is taken from [1].

The number in the product name is the maximum kinematic viscosity at 50oC is cSt. Bunker fuels are 
always identified in this way. Viscosity is without doubt the most important property of a bunker fuel. 
This is because a modern fuel supply system on a vessel releases fuel to the combustion chamber at a 
particular viscosity, called the viscosity set point. The fuel supply system can adjust the viscosity of the 
influx fuel by temperature regulation only within a limited range, so supply of a fuel very distant from 
the viscosity set point will cause malfunction.

Residual fuel oils can be blended with each other to a target viscosity. A residual material can be blended 
with a distillate to a target viscosity. A distillate for this purpose needs to be a heavy one so that it will 
not cause the flash point of the final blended product to be too low. We should intuitively expect that the 
simplified treatment given in Chapter 2 of this text for viscosity blending would give reasonable results 
if applied to viscosity control of bunker fuel. 
The viscosities in the table ‚Äì up to approaching 103 cSt ‚Äì would not apply to any single hydrocarbon 
compounds which are liquids at room temperature. These will rarely have kinematic viscosities exceeding 
a few tens of cSt. A crude oil has to be seen as a solution of wax (molecular weights 300 to 400) and 
asphaltenes (molecular weights > 1000) in an organic solvent, and such a system cannot be approximated 
by any ‚Äòmodel compound‚Äô. 
6.1.3	
Solid deposition from heavy fuel oils
It would be difficult to assign a pour point to a heavy residual fuel oil. This is because, as already noted, 
it is charged with wax and asphaltenes. Molar weights of the waxes in particular are not far distant from 
those of some of the liquids in which the wax and asphaltenes are dissolved. The distinction between 
dissolution and suspension, required for cloud point determination, could not reliably be made. Pour 
point is however important in the use of residual fuel oils. The oils in the table in section 6.2 all have a 
pour point of 30oC with the exception of RMA 30 which has a pour point of 0oC for winter use and 6oC 
for summer use. This is the least viscous of the oils in the table and has a pour point well below that of 
the others. There are pour point depressants for residual fuel oils (e.g., [2]) and these work similarly to 
CFPP depressants for diesel discussed in the previous chapter, that is, they work by preventing nucleation 
and not according to the principles of freezing point depression. Alternatively [3] residual oils with 
different propensities to solid deposition can be blended to a target pour point. 
6.1.4	
Vapour pressures of residual fuel oils
All of the oils in the table in section 6.2 all have a flash point of 60oC, signifying a vapour pressure at 
that temperature which is not negligible. As already stated, residual fuel oils vary widely in composition. 
Factors affecting the composition include the nature of the parent crude (for example, whether 
predominantly paraffinic or aromatic) and the temperature cut taken in the diesel range. There can also 
be inclusion of distillate material or even unwanted by-products of cracking and these will obviously 
raise the vapour pressure. Shell in specifying a purely residual oil [4] give a vapour pressure of less than 
0.1 kPa (10-3 bar). This particular oil has a kinematic viscosity at 50oC of 700 sCt and a density of 1010 
kg m-3. The pour point is not given, but otherwise the oil appears to conform closely to the one in the 
last entry of the table.

The Shell specifications [4] give a vapour density at 15oC of not exceeding 5, where air on the same scale 
is unity. This provides a means of estimating the composition of the vapour. This follows in the boxed 
area below.
The molecular weight is (5 √ó 28.8) g = 144 g
Using an empirical formula of CH2 this gives a molecular formula of:
C10H20
Now this corresponds fairly closely to decane C10H22. 
The vapour pressure of this compound at 15oC is 5 √ó 10-4 bar.
Consistency with the Shell specification of less than 10-3 bar is therefore evident 
if the vapour is approximated to a single model compound.

Lubricant oil for motor vehicles can be made from residual refinery product. The most important property 
of a lubricant oil is its viscosity. This is explained more fully below.

Viscosities
A single-grade motor oil has a viscosity which varies steeply with temperature, limiting its use to 
conditions where the temperature changes are such that the viscosity remains in the required range. 
The temperature dependence of viscosity can be made much weaker by inclusion of a suitable additive. 
Such additives are polymeric in nature. 
An oil so treated is a multigrade oil. A multigrade oil remains close to its ‚Äòcold start‚Äô viscosity at the highest 
temperature it experiences in circulation by reason of the action of the polymer additives. Although 
single-grade oils might in today‚Äôs world still find application to such devices as lawnmowers, lubricants 
for automotive use are almost always multigrade. Below is a partial coverage of the categorisation of 
multigrade oils by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) [5].

In Chapter 2 when discussing the temperature dependence of viscosity for crude oil an expression of 
the Arrhenius type was used, the coefficient in the exponential being linked to the heat of vaporisation. 
Sometimes a simpler exponential function:
u = uo exp(-bT)
where uo and b is a constants is used, and possibly that is more helpful when lubricant oils are being 
considered. Using the u, T data pairs for 5W-30 to solve for b and uo gives, for that particular oil:
u = 5.6 œÖ 105exp(-0.029T)
In Chapter 2 we considered the Arrhenius approach for a crude oil: 
u(373K) = 2.93 cSt u(293K) = 23.6 cSt
Fitting this to the above equation gives:
u = 4.8 √ó 104exp(-0.026T)

Crude oil (from Chapter 2)

Certain conclusions can reasonably be drawn from these figures. The crude oil the viscosities of which 
are compared with those of the lubricants has a viscosity encompassed by the values for the lubricants. In 
fitting to the exponential function the coefficient ‚Äòb‚Äô varies little between the four lubricants and between 
the lubricant and the crude. The quantity uo is of course the hypothetical ‚Äòkinematic viscosity at absolute 
zero‚Äô, and it is an order of magnitude lower for the crude oil than for the least viscous of the lubricants. 
Across the lubricants it rises by about a factor of 20. The limited evidence then is that the effect of the 
polymer additive has been to affect the viscosity per se rather than its temperature dependence. The 
crude oil, of course, contains no such additive. 
A property related to viscosity is lubricity. This has been discussed for fuels in previous chapters and 
is also a quantity in the characterisation of motor oils. It was stated in Chapter 5 that, in the US, 520 
mm is seen as the maximum acceptable value for a diesel fuel. A reader should recall that this is a scar 
dimension measured after metal surfaces have been in contact under specified conditions in the presence 
of the subject hydrocarbon. One‚Äôs intuition might well be that motor fuels have lubricities lower than 
this, but not by an order of magnitude. Such a view is supported by ‚Äòscar‚Äô data for lubricant oils where 
these are available. For example [6] a proprietary lubricant having a kinematic viscosity at 40oC of 115 
cSt (placing it in those terms 10W-40 and 20W-50 the table of viscosities above) has a ‚Äòscar‚Äô value of 350 
mm. This is exactly one third below the value for diesel quoted above. 
The oil specifications of which [6] are given above is in fact a ‚Äòsemi-synthetic oil‚Äô, that is, it is composed 
partly of petroleum based material and partly of synthetic oil. Synthetic motor oils are made from alpha 
olefins of C20+ and other organic compounds including diesters, so their only relevance in a chapter 
concerned with refinery residue is that they are blended with mineral oil as noted. Alpha olefins are 
made from petroleum distillate by cracking, therefore so-called synthetic oils are actually extensively 
processed petroleum stock. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) terminology for oils [5] applies 
to synthetics and to semi-synthetics as well as to purely mineral oils.

Particle deposition
Pour points of lubricating oils are very low, almost always below -20oC. Particle deposition from 
lubricating oil is not from any process akin to ‚Äòfreezing‚Äô but from breakdown of the oil over a sustained 
period of usage resulting in carbon particle formation. This is of course an example of pyrolysis, which is 
a chemical phenomenon. The propensity of a particular lubricating oil to carbon deposition is determined 
as the carbon residue, which is the percentage by weight of solid remaining after the oil has been totally 
evaporated. Pyrolysis will occur in a small degree concurrently with evaporation in such a test. Carbon 
residues so measured of 1 to 2% are expected for lubricant motor oils. 
6.2.4	
Vapour pressure
This quantity is not a performance criterion in lubricant motor oil performance. That is not to say that 
it is of no interest: information on the variation in vapour pressure of such an oil across the temperature 
range it experiences is required. At 300oC it can be as high as 0.05 bar. Values (in mm Hg) for a lubricant 
oil of kinematic viscosity 82 cSt at 40oC are given in [7] across the temperature range 40 to 290oC. At 
40oC the value is 2.5 √ó 10-7 mm Hg (0.25 torr), and this rises to 7.4 mm Hg at 290oC.

In Chapter 4 of this text an equation of the Clausius-Clapeyron form was applied to a kerosene with 
the express qualification application was on an empirical basis as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation itself 
applies only to a pure chemical substance. In the boxed area below the vapour pressure versus temperature 
data for the lubricating oil under discussion are examined in this way.
The integrated form of the equation is:
ln(P2/P1) = ‚àí(‚àÜHvap/R)[(1/T2) ‚Äì (1/T1)]
where ‚àí‚àÜHvap is the heat of vaporisation. The information above provides two P,T data pairs viz.:
T1 = 313 K, P1 = 2.5 √ó 10-7 mm Hg
T2 = 563 K, P2 = 7.4 mm Hg
Inserting these into the equation gives:
‚àÜHvap = 101 kJ mol-1
A rough calculation performed with reservations can sometimes score a bull‚Äôs-eye, and this is true of 
the above. The value of the heat of vaporisation corresponds exactly [8] to that for eicosane ‚Äì C20H42 ‚Äì a 
straight chain alkane which has itself found application as a lubricant. There is even a blog on eicosane 
as a lubricant [9], in which it has been suggested that its viscosity is on the low side. This point is 
examined below. 
The dynamic viscosity of eicosane at 50oC [10] is:
0.00316 kg m-1s-1
Using a density [8] of ‚âà 750 kg m-3:
u = (0.00316/750) m2 s-1 = 4.2 √ó 10-6 m2s-1 = 4 cSt approx.
which is a low value but not so much so as to preclude lubricant use. A more conventional engine lubricant 
will have a lower viscosity than this in the hottest places where the lubricant is circulated.

Electrical conductivity
The most interesting side to electrical conductivities of lubricating oils is the huge difference between those 
which are simply residual petroleum stock and those which contains esters which, as noted previously 
in this chapter, some lubricating oils do. This effect is shown strikingly in work reported by Harvey 
et al. [11] in which three lubricants from the Shell Vitrea range [12] are compared with Exxon Turbo 
23807 oil. The latter contains esters. The Shell oils studied in [11] have kinematic viscosities at 21oC in 
the range 60 to 600 cSt, and the two examples of the Exxon Turbo 2380 oil examined have values of 35 
and 40 cSt at the same temperature. Electrical conductivities of the Shell oils are in the range 0.4 to 2.1 
pS m-1, whereas the Turbo 2380 samples give values of 1370 and 1410 pS m-1. The effect of the esters has 
therefore been to raise the electrical conductivity by about three orders of magnitude, and this is due 
to the polar nature of the esters which have been incorporated into it. Returning to the discussion in 
section 1.5, water at 20oC has a value of 5.4 mS m-1 or 5.4 √ó 106 pS m-1. Notwithstanding the conductivity 
enhancement, the ester-containing oil is many orders of magnitude short of being an electrolyte.

Petroleum jelly
6.3.1	
Introduction
This has an important place in the history of the oil industry, having been discovered in nineteenth 
century during oil production at Titusville Pa, scene of the celebrated Drake Well [13]. Although there 
has been some debate of the matter, the term petrolatum is usually taken to be a synonym. One also 
encounters the term ‚Äòsoft paraffin‚Äô. 
6.3.2	
Physical properties [14]
Constituents of petroleum jelly are C25+. Being not a single organic compound but containing many such 
compounds, petroleum jelly does not have a melting point but a melting range. The lower limit of this 
range is likely to be between 40 and 60oC. By 100oC there will always be significant amounts of liquid, 
and this will have a kinematic viscosity in the range 5 to 25 cSt. The acoustic impedance impedance of 
petroleum jelly is 3 Mrayl [15].
The petroleum jelly industry is by now far advanced and any reader of this text will have had experience 
of Vaseline or a similar product. A heavier product still is paraffin wax, which contains compounds up 
to C40 or higher. Its discovery in the nineteenth century, when the use of candles for illumination was 
still common, provided an alternative to tallow for the manufacture of candles. Like petroleum jelly, 
paraffin wax can be produced in food grade. The familiar red wrapping around a piece of Edam cheese 
is an example of food grade paraffin wax.

Concluding remarks
This section provides an opportunity for the discussion of ‚Äòvalue adding‚Äô. Residual material not destined 
for fuel oil use has often been used as cheap gasification feedstock or as the basis of the production of 
carburetted water gas from blue water gas. This will continue in some parts of the world especially if, 
as is predicted, there is a swing back to gasification of coal. No value adding to the residual material is 
needed for these applications. However, viscosity adjustment of such materials and attention to other 
properties including pour point transforms them into lubricants, materials of precise specification for 
which there is a colossal market. Such is the potential of value adding.

Introduction
7.1.1	
General background
When a coal decomposes (‚Äòcarbonises‚Äô) there are three classes of product: solid, liquid and gaseous. The 
solid we refer to as coke or as char. The gases include hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The liquid product 
is known as coal tar. Carbonisation of coal on the industrial scale began in the late eighteenth century. 
At that time charcoal was being used to make iron from iron ore, in response to the huge demand for 
iron brought about by industrialisation. Much of the south of England had until that time been heavily 
forested and very conspicuous gaps were created through removal of the trees for charcoal production. 
Over time coke replaced charcoal as a metallurgical reductant. Steel manufacturers naturally tended to 
establish themselves close to coalfields. The conurbation of Sheffield, Rotherham and Barnsley is probably 
the best example of this in Britain. The best example in the US is Pittsburgh.

Coal tars
When coke is made, gas and tar are always by-products. The gas became used in lighting, there being 
gas lamps in London by the 1820s. Later, gas was reticulated to homes; by the end of the nineteenth 
century many homes in the UK had gas ‚Äòlaid on‚Äô, still largely for illumination as an alternative to candles. 
The tar product of coal carbonisation became feedstock for the very earliest organic chemistry industry. 
Germany was the leading nation in this respect. Coal tar as a source of chemicals continued until the 
1920s at which stage it was replaced by cracked hydrocarbon products. The author has made elsewhere 
[1] the comment that the development of cracking technologies and cessation of reliance on coal tar 
revolutionised the organic chemistry industry. From then on the US, especially in the Gulf Coast states, 
became the leader though not to the exclusion of Germany. Many companies including IG Farben, BASF 
and Hoechst were active in this respect in both countries. 
7.1.2	
Comments on coal tars
The term tar generally means the liquid decomposition product of any organic substance, for example 
wood or peat. It is with coal tars specifically that this chapter is concerned. Coals vary very widely in 
nature. The most important determinant in the ‚Äònature‚Äô of a coal is its degree of maturity along the 
coalification series. The least mature coals are lignites a.k.a. brown coals. Scenes of production of these 
include N. Dakota USA and the Latrobe Valley in south eastern Australia. More mature coals include 
bituminous coals, and it is from such coals that coke for use as metallurgical is made. The more mature 
the coal, the smaller the yield of decomposition products including tars. In general, the fate of coal tars 
is simply that they are burnt along with the rest of the coal. When coal is burnt decomposition and 
combustion are concurrent, so tars and gases having been released simply burn alongside the residual 
solid. It is when coal is used for purposes other than direct combustion, that is when it is carbonised 
or gasified, that the tars are of importance. In discussions of liquid products of coal decomposition, a 
distinction is sometimes made between tars and oils, on the basis of solubility in particular solvents. 
The author‚Äôs view is that this is pointless if not confusing and is better avoided. 
Because coals vary so widely, so do coal tars. Even the tar from a particular coal will vary in composition 
depending on the ceiling temperature of carbonisation, the coal particle size and the heating rate. 
Carbonisation of coal is a 19th Century technology by no means obsolete in the 21st. The question of 
comparability of unprocessed coal tars with heavier petroleum fractions has been the subject of much 
debate for a century or more. The term ‚Äòcoal tar fuels‚Äô (CTF) means fuel oil comprising not petroleum 
residue as with such fuels discussed in the previous chapter, but coal-derived liquid. These were once 
widely used in applications including steam raising, interchangeability with petroleum residual fuel oil 
being aimed for. The property most difficult to match is the cloud point, which is higher for CTF. This 
necessitates flushing out with a solvent such as kerosene when petroleum fuel oil is used in plant previously 
used with CTF. The debate on the feasibility of gasoline and diesel substitutes from the distillation of 
coal tar has been going on at least since 1923 [2].

Distillate products from coal tars
The processing of tars remains an important industry in countries including the US (e.g. [3]) and Japan 
(e.g. [4])8. Tar distillate is considerably less of a ‚Äòrag bag‚Äô of organic compounds than petroleum distillates 
are. 
At temperatures up to about 100oC, the distillation product of coal tar is benzole, a.k.a. benzol. This 
consists of benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) in whatever proportions. The kinematic viscosities of 
these compounds singly are all around 1 cSt, the smallest value being that for m-Xylene which is 0.68 cSt 
at 25oC [5]. Separation of BTX from coal tar into its constituent compounds in high purity by further 
distillation is straightforward. The heavier distillate, when cooled to below its cloud point, yields crystals 
of useful compounds including phenol, o-cresol 
7.3	
Coal tar pitch
7.3.1	
Introduction
The residue of distillation of coal tar is pitch. It can be the primary product in tar processing in which 
case the conditions of distillation including the maximum temperature can be controlled to give a pitch 
of desired properties. Pitches vary in nature from semi-solid at room temperature to hard and brittle. 
Most start to melt at temperatures in the region of 100oC and their rheology is of some importance. 
7.3.2	
Viscosities
Clearly solid and liquid will often be in co-existence and the viscosity is a factor in any application. 
This can be determined from the classical [6] penetrometer test. In the test the penetration of a needle 
into a 100 g sample of the subject pitch at 25oC is determined, contact with the needle have been of five 
seconds‚Äô duration. From the results the dynamic viscosity can be calculated according to:
¬µ(poise) = 5.9 √ó 109/(penetration depth)1.93
where the penetration depth is in units decimillimetres:
1 decimillimetre = 10-4 m.
The penetration depth across a range of pitch samples was found in [6] to range from 1.0 to 195 
decimillimetres. These figures are examined in the boxed area below.

Coal tars
Considering first of all the penetration depth value at the high end of the range:
¬µ = 5.9 √ó 109/(195)1.93 poise = 2.2 √ó 105 poise Now 1 poise = 1 g cm-1 s-1 ‚â° 0.1 kg m-1s-1, hence ¬µ
= 2.2 √ó 104 kg m-1s-1.
Now the density of a coal pitch is roughly the same as that of water, so the kinematic viscosity can be estimated as:
œÖ = 2.2 √ó 104 kg m-1s-1/1000 kg m-3 = 22 m2s-1 or to one significant figure 2 √ó 107 cSt.
and this exceeds any value of a kinematic viscosity previously given in this book. For the 
penetration depth value of 1 decimillimetre the kinematic viscosity is 6 √ó 1011 cSt.
That values of the viscosity of coal tar pitch are exceedingly high is confirmed in much more recent work 
than that in [6]. Li and Li [7] present results for dynamic viscosities of pitch, including one of 16000 kg 
m-1s-1 at 200oC. Using the same density as previously, this gives for the kinematic viscosity:
œÖ = 16000 kg m-1s-1/1000 kg m-3 = 16 m2s-1 ‚â° 1.6 √ó 107 cSt
This corresponds quite closely to the value at a much lower temperature for the pitch in [6] having given 
a penetration depth of 195 decimillimetre.

Coal tars
Viscosities of fluids can be determined from the rate of exit of a sample fluid under gravity through 
an orifice. Time of the order of decades is required for a value of the viscosity of a coal tar pitch to be 
obtained in this way. At the University of Queensland in 1930 such an experiment was commenced [8], 
and it is still in progress! The first drop exited in December 1938 and seven further drops between then 
and November 2000. Fitting of the results so far has given a value for the dynamic viscosity:
¬µ = 2 √ó 108 kg m-1K-1
‚áì
œÖ = 2 √ó 1011 cSt
which is of the same order of magnitude as one of the values in [6]. 
7.3.3	
Vapour pressure
When it was first proposed to construct ‚Äòdust-free roads‚Äô by using tar instead of the inorganic materials 
used previously there was concern that the vapour from the tar would harm vegetation. Such fears were 
later shown to be without foundation provided that tars selected for such use did not in pre-use testing 
start to boil below 140oC [9], and there was the obvious health advantage that persons were no longer 
inhaling fine dust from the roads or experiencing eye irritation from it.
Reference [10] gives a generic value for the vapour pressure of coal tar pitch of < 0.01 kPa. In the boxed 
area below is an estimate of what the odour threshold of the materials in the pitch vapour would have 
to be if the vapour were to be detectable by the sense of smell. 
Considering air at room temperature and 1 bar pressure:
PaV = naRT
where subscript ‚Äòa‚Äô denotes air. For the vapour, using subscript ‚Äòv‚Äô:
PvV = nvRT
Combining the two: nv/na = Pv/Pa = (0.01/100) = 10-4 or 100 p.p.m.
Many pure organic substances have odour thresholds much lower than this; that for benzene is 12 p.p.m. 
One would therefore expect that a coal tar pitch having the vapour pressure in the inequality in the 
previous paragraph would be detectable by the olfactory sense, and that inhalation in an unventilated 
area would be harmful. The vapour pressure for newly manufactured pitch will of course drop as the 
pitch loses its lightest constituents on standing.

Fine chemicals from coal tar
When, as described in a previous section, coke became the principal metallurgical reductant for iron 
production the coke ovens used were the ‚Äòbeehive‚Äô type. These are now very few and far between, if 
not totally non-existent, having been replaced by the ‚Äòby-product‚Äô type. In a by-product coke oven 
condensibles are collected, and these become a source of organic compounds. 
Such compounds include BTX and heavier aromatics, which have already been discussed. The condensibles 
can be processed into ‚Äòfine chemicals‚Äô and this practice was becoming prevalent in the US by the mid 20th 
century [11]. Six of the more common of the liquid fine chemicals obtainable from feedstock originating 
at coke ovens are discussed in the table below. Comments follow the table.

In addition to pyridine itself methylated pyridines ‚Äì picolines ‚Äì are manufactured from coal tar. 
Benzaldehyde can be made by direct partial oxidation or, perhaps more commonly, from chlorination 
of toluene and hydrolysis of the product. Benzoic acid, a solid at room temperature, is also made in 
this way. Primary products of the chlorination include benzyl chloride and benzoyl chloride. Of the six 
isomers of xylenol (dimethyl phenol), 2,6 xylenol is commercially the most important being used in the 
manufacture of resins for applications including printed circuit boards. 
Most of the liquids in the table above have kinematic viscosities of the same order of magnitude as that 
for water. The simple correlation linking refractive index with dielectric constant which, in previous 
parts of the book, has been show to apply to many hydrocarbons, does not apply to any of the liquids in 
the table all of which contain an element other than carbon and hydrogen. Equivalently, the presence of 
oxygen, nitrogen or chlorine raises the dielectric constant. The contrast between the values for benzene 
(2.3) and pyridine (12.5) is very convincing proof of this.

Concluding remarks
Uncertainties in world oil supply affects not only fuel availability but also the petrochemical industry. If 
as some experts predict there is a swing back to coal or to coal gasification, matters can be engineered so 
that by-product tars for petrochemical manufacture become available. Indeed, it has long been standard 
practice in parts of the world including Australia for BTX produced at coke ovens to be passed along 
to petrochemicals manufacturers. Additionally coal provides a route to chemicals via synthesis gas as 
noted in a previous chapter. These are issues not to be lost sight of in the very challenging circumstances 
of hydrocarbon supply and demand in these times.

8.1	
Introduction
The two alcohols of most importance in fuel technology are the two most structurally simple: methanol 
and ethanol. Both are good fuels for spark ignition engines, having high octane ratings. Ethanol is made 
from fermentation processes, either from sugar directly or from sugar made by breaking down the 
starch in corn or sorghum. The ‚Äòselling point‚Äô of ethanol is its carbon neutrality by reason of its plant 
origin. With methanol matters are not so straightforward [1]. Methanol made from the decomposition 
of biomass, or from synthesis gas made from biomass, is carbon neutral. Methanol made from natural 
gas or from coal via synthesis gas is not carbon neutral. The carbon neutrality of methanol is therefore 
ambiguous, a point made previously in Chapter 3.
This chapter will review methanol and ethanol and then move on to gasoline-alcohol blends. These are 
being used on a massive scale at the present time.

Methanol
As methanol is a pure chemical compound its physical properties are precise. For example, there is no 
need to talk of the Reid Vapour Pressure (RVP) of methanol as there is no dependence of the vapour 
pressure on the space into which the vapour expands as there is with gasoline. Selected physical properties 
of methanol liquid are given in the table below having been taken from [2] unless otherwise indicated.

We saw in Chapter 1 that:
œÖ(T2)/œÖ(T1) = exp(‚àÜE/RT2)/exp(‚àÜE/RT1)
 and that ‚àÜE is 30 to 40% of the heat of vaporisation. Applying the values of the kinematic viscosity for 
methanol at two temperatures from the table above:
ln[œÖ(T2)/œÖ(T1)] = ‚àÜE/R{(1/T2) ‚Äì (1/T1)}
‚áì
‚àÜE = 11 kJ mol-1
The heat of vaporisation in the temperature range of interest is actually 34 kJ mol-1, and ‚àÜE is 32% of this 
so there is good conformity. There is scope for enhancing the precision of the calculation by avoiding 
the implicit assumption that the density variation over the temperature range is negligible (that is, by 
using the ratio of dynamic viscosities instead of the ratio of kinematic viscosities).

8.4	
Comparisons of methanol and ethanol with gasolines
In the tables of properties of methanol and ethanol the vapour pressure at 38oC has been given as this is 
the temperature at which RVP measurements on gasolines are performed. Returning to the information 
in section 3.6.1 of this book, the value for methanol is lower than any value for a gasoline given there, 
and the value for ethanol much lower. The methanol value might conceivably correspond to the ‚Äòsummer 
RVP‚Äô for a gasoline, but the ethanol value would be most unlikely to. This can be roughly correlated 
with boiling points. Gasoline boiling ranges do of course vary significantly, but 60oC is often given as 
the initial boiling point of a typical gasoline. The boiling point of methanol is close to this, whereas that 
of ethanol is well above it. 
In section 3.2.1 the range 0.5 to 0.75 cSt at 40oC was given for the kinematic viscosities of gasolines, 
and those of either alcohol are comparable to this. The acoustic impedance is also about the same for 
the alcohols as for gasolines. The refractive indices of the alcohols are close to each other, and that of 
methanol is almost indistinguishable from that of water. The alcohol values are somewhat lower than 
those for gasolines given in section 3.5. Thermal conductivities are significantly higher (by almost a factor 
of two in the case of methanol) for the alcohols than for gasoline. The dielectric constants are much 
higher for the alcohols. Those for the alcohols are a third to a half the value for water. The coefficients of 
expansion of the alcohols are only very slightly higher than the generic value of 0.00095 K-1 for gasolines 
given in section 3.3.

Methanol-gasoline blends
These are less common than ethanol-gasoline blends but do find application in countries including China 
where the composition range available is M15 to M80 (15% methanol and 80% methanol respectively, 
balance gasoline in each case). Vapour pressures of gasoline-methanol blends were studied by Pumphrey 
et al. [6], whose experimental work spanned the whole composition range from a pure sample of a 
particular gasoline to pure methanol. Between about 20% methanol and 60% the vapour pressure of 
the blend is about 20 kPa higher than that of the gasoline only. There is then a steep drop, to 20 kPa 
below the vapour pressure of the gasoline for pure methanol, consistently with the statement above that 
methanol alone would at most attain the summer RVP of a gasoline. 
Viscosities of methanol-gasoline blends have been examined in a recent piece of work by Lee [7]. Blends 
of a gasoline of API index 53o and methanol were examined at 20oC. The gasoline alone had a kinematic 
viscosity of 0.51 cSt. A blend comprising 15% of this gasoline balance methanol, that is an example 
of an M85 fuel, had a kinematic viscosity of 0.73 cSt. In section 3.2.1 it was stated that gasolines have 
kinematic viscosities in the range 0.4 to 1 cSt, and the example given for an M85 fuel is comfortably 
within this range.

Ethanol-gasoline blends
8.6.1	
Introduction
These are of major importance as fuels for spark-ignition engines. One often encounters ‚ÄòE85‚Äô and so 
on, signifying a particular percentage of alcohol, balance gasoline. Ethanol-gasoline blends across the 
composition range will be discussed in this section.
8.6.2	
Vapour pressures
The specification EXY, where for E85 X denotes 8 and Y denotes 5, is a nominal one, with the numeral 
representing only approximately the percentage of alcohol. We have seen that the vapour pressure of a 
gasoline is important and that the RVP might require seasonal adjustment. The vapour pressure has to 
be adjusted by means of the ratio of gasoline to alcohol. This is the basis of ASTM classifications of such 
fuels, some examples of which taken from [8] are given below. 
Volatility class

3
% ethanol

70
Vapour pressure at 38oC/kPa
38‚Äì59
48‚Äì65
66‚Äì83
Note that the vapour pressures are all in significant excess of that of ethanol alone at 38oC, indicating 
that the gasoline is raising the vapour pressure. Note the consistency between the vapour pressures in 
the table above and those given in section 3.6.1 for a range of gasolines. 
When E85 fuel is manufactured, it is to target octane rating and target vapour pressure. In order fully 
to specify such a fuel both the nominal proportion of ethanol and the volatility class need to be known. 
This can be more fully understood by reference to a study in 2006 [9] of samples of E85 obtained from 
outlets in ten states of the US9. It is reported in [9] that the E85 samples of volatility class 1 had a median 
alcohol content of 81.6% and a median vapour pressure of 41.7 kPa. 
The ethanol content is just below the nominal one of 85% and just above the value which corresponds 
to the vapour pressure according to the ASTM classification of volatilities in the above table. 
For E85 of volatility class 2, [9] gives the median ethanol content as 77.1%. For ‚Äòvolatility class 3/2‚Äô (not 
defined in the table above) the median ethanol content is 74.6%. Consistently with these figures, reference 
[9] states that E85 has an ethanol content in the range 70 to 85%. Of course, the figures from [9], though 
having their basis in an authoritative study, should not be seen as hard numbers for the variation in 
composition of E85 with vapour pressure but as suitably chosen examples of how the composition of 
E85 can vary.

E60 [17]
RVP of 57.4 kPa
E60 (summer) [18]
RVP of 52.0 kPa
E75 (summer) [18]
RVP of 44 kPa
E85 (summer) [18]
RVP of 32 kPa
E85 (winter) [18]
RVP of 37 kPa
E85 [19]
RVP up to 83 kPa
E88 (summer) [18]
RVP of 29.4 kPa
E92 (summer) [18] 
RVP of 24.9 kPa
To the information given in the first row of the table, taken from reference [10], can be added the 
observation also recorded in [10] that the higher the proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the 
gasoline the smaller the effect of the 5% ethanol on the RVP. The difference is 1kPa if the proportion of 
unsaturated hydrocarbons is 80%, rising to 5 kPa for 20% unsaturated hydrocarbons.

Alcohol-containing fuels
Clearly with blends low in ethanol such as E5 and E10 the chief determinant in the vapour pressure 
will be the RVP of the gasoline. The disproportionate effect of a small amount of ethanol on the vapour 
pressure is presumably due to the replacement of a miscellany of organic compounds with boiling points 
up to 200oC or higher with a single one of boiling point 78.5oC. The effect will be most marked when the 
gasoline with which the alcohol is being blended has a low RVP because it is rich in the higher boilers. 
The figures in the fifth and sixth rows of the above table reveal this effect. The figure in the sixth row 
is for a simulated gasoline as described, this alone having an RVP of 17 kPa. In the work described in 
reference [17] the gasoline alone has a RVP value of 57.6 kPa, which ascends by about 20% in going to 
E30 and E40, returning almost exactly to the ‚ÄòE0‚Äô value for E60. 
All of the ethanol-gasoline blends in reference [18] have an octane number of 95. The ‚ÄòE0 blend‚Äô, that is 
gasoline alone, has a summer value of 58.0 kPa and a winter value of 87.5 kPa. Whereas low amounts 
of ethanol in a blend predominantly gasoline raise the RVP more than proportionately as noted, small 
amounts of gasoline in a blend predominantly ethanol appear, from the results in [18], to do likewise. 
A rise of over 50% in RVP occurs between E100 and E92.

8.6.3	
Further details of E85
E85 is probably the most widely used of the ethanol-gasoline blends at the present time. Conclusion of 
this section with a discussion of some of its properties other than vapour pressure is therefore appropriate.
We saw in Chapter 3 that a value of 25 pS m-1 would be typical of the electrical conductivity of gasoline. 
Ethanol alone for fuel use in Brazil10 has an electrical conductivity specification [20] of 500 ¬µS m-1, a 
factor of 20 million higher than the value given in the previous sentence for gasoline. The conductivity 
of E85 is of the order of ¬µS m-1 the precise value depending on the amount of gasoline since, as we have 
seen, this can be as low as 70%. The high electrical conductivity of E85 does of course make for safety 
in handling, electrical charge generated by movement being readily conducted away before it can form 
an ignition source. 
Reference [7] gives a value for the dynamic viscosity of a particular example of E85 of 1.016 cP which, 
using a density for ethanol only, converts to a kinematic viscosity of 1.3 cSt. This is almost twice the 
value given for an M85 fuel earlier in this chapter and at the high range of value for gasolines. This is 
not an important factor: it was argued in Section 3.2.3 that variations in the kinematic viscosity of the 
fuel, be it gasoline or a blend, do not measurably affect fuel pump performance. 
Lubricities of gasolines or of alcohol-gasoline blends have not previously been discussed. Here it will 
simply be stated that E85, in common with other ethanol-gasoline blends, has a poorer lubricity than 
gasoline alone and that this is a factor in the manufacture of flexi-fuel vehicles (FFV). 
8.7	
Concluding remarks
Ethanol-gasoline blends are of ever increasing importance for two reasons: their ability to stretch gasoline 
quantities and, more importantly, their ability to reduce fossil-fuel derived carbon dioxide emissions. 
The second of these is perhaps the greatest challenge facing the world at this time.

9.1	
Introduction
These are of increasing importance because of their carbon neutrality. Examples include soybean oil, 
sunflower oil, palm oil and rapeseed oil (a.k.a canola oil). Spent cooking oil, an example of which is ‚Äòyellow 
grease‚Äô, has also found application to fuel use. Some such oils can be used as fuels for compression ignition 
engines unprocessed; this is often true of soybean oil. More commonly treatment by esterification will 
be required to give a satisfactory cetane number. Physical properties of biodiesel fuels will be discussed 
in this chapter, starting with viscosity.

biodiesel or diesel-biodiesel blend. Its kinematic viscosity at 40oC is 4.5 cSt [4]. As well as being a model 
compound, methyl oleate is an actual ingredient of many biodiesels as is methyl linoleate which features 
in the section 9.4. Its kinematic viscosity at 40oC is 3.65 cSt.

Refractive index
In the esterification of oil to make biodiesel glycerol initially present in the unprocessed plant oil, being 
denser than the product ester, separates and is taken off at the bottom of the reactor. In [6] refractive 
indices of soybean derived material of various proportions of glycerol were reported. The untreated oil 
had a glycerol content of about 10%, and the totally esterified oil a glycerol content of zero. The refractive 
index of the latter was 1.457 and that of the latter 1.473 and the rise in refractive index with glycerol 
content was linear. The refractive index of methyl oleate is 1.454, very close to the value for the totally 
esterified oil in the work under discussion. 
In [7] biodiesels containing different proportions of methyl oleate and methyl linoleate were investigated 
for refractive index. The molecular formula of the former is C19H36O2 and that of the latter C19H34O2, 
there being one double bond in the carbon structure of methyl oleate and two in the carbon structure 
of methyl linoleate. The biodiesels with a preponderance of the linoleate had lower refractive indices 
than those with a preponderance of the oleate, indicating that unsaturation raises the refractive index.

Single compounds
The esters methyl stearate, methyl oleate, methyl linoleate and methyl linolenate are C18 compounds and 
have respectively no double bonds and one, two and three double bonds11. They occur in biodiesels and 
are used as model compounds in studying the properties of biodiesels. We therefore expect intuitively 
that their freezing points would give an indication of the range of cloud points of biodiesels.
Accordingly the freezing points of three of these compounds are given in the table below. A value for 
methyl linolenate has evaded the author; it is reported as ‚Äònot available‚Äô on safety data sheets and the 
like. The value for methyl palmitate, which is C16, is in the final row of the table.

Both of the values in the first row are encompassed by the values for the pure esters given in the previous 
table. Common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), which features in the second and third rows, is currently 
harvested to make fibre materials and the work on it described in [13] is exploratory. Soybean oil was 
studied for comparison, and in each case the use of ethanol instead of methanol as the esterifying reagent 
raises the cloud point significantly. Babassu oil (final row of the table) is extracted from Babassu palm 
which occurs widely in South America. 
There is a good deal of interest at the present time in use of biodiesel fuels for jet aircraft. We saw in 
section 4.3 of this text that cloud points of the order of -50oC are necessary in jet aircraft use. Cloud 
points of biodiesels are much higher than this. The limited data in the penultimate row of the table 
indicate that biodiesel blends with conventional jet fuel might with suitable development have sufficiently 
low cloud points. Such blends will of course engender carbon credits. There have been test flights using 
biodiesel, but with one engine only receiving such fuel and the remainder receiving conventional fuel.

Vapour pressures
As with some of the other properties considered it is helpful first to examine the vapour pressures of 
pure methyl esters. The normal boiling points, at which by definition the vapour pressure is 1 bar, of 
methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, methyl oleate and methyl linoleate are respectively 338, 352, 349 and 
366oC [16]. Pure methyl esters do of course have a single boiling point: a biodiesel, which will comprise 
several such compounds, has a boiling range. Applications of the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) equation 
to a biodiesel is not fundamentally sound, as the equation is only for a pure chemical compound. There 
is however no difficulty with the suggestion that the temperature dependence of the vapour pressure of 
a biodiesel has the same form as the C-C equation, in which case assignment of a value to the heat of 
vaporisation becomes arbitrary. The C-C equation can of course be rigorously applied to the pure ester 
compounds in which case the heat of vaporisation will have a precise value. 
Vapour pressures of biodiesels of various known compositions across a temperature range have been 
studied by Goodrum [17] and, certainly for a limited number of data points in each case, conformity with 
an equation of the C-C form confirmed. Initial boiling points, that is attainment of a vapour pressure 
of 100 kPa, were observed at 369oC for a particular rapeseed ester and at 348oC for a particular soybean 
methyl ester. These fall comfortably within the range of normal boiling points for the pure esters given 
in [16].

10	 Hydrocarbons existing either as 
cryogens or as liquefied gases
10.1	
Introduction
Referring to the title, the most common of the former is LNG (liquefied natural gas) and the most common 
of the latter is LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), which have primary constituents respectively methane and 
propane. The critical temperature of methane is such that it cannot be made into a liquid by pressure 
application at room temperature, therefore LNG is a cryogen, and liquid at the normal boiling point of 
methane (112K) is in equilibrium with vapour at 1 bar. By contrast propane can be liquefied at room 
temperature, and at 25oC the equilibrium vapour pressure is about 8 bar. It is therefore stored as a liquid 
under its own super-atmospheric vapour pressure. Falling between methane and propane in the alkanes 
homologous series is ethane. Its critical temperature is 32oC. The first part of this chapter will compare 
the physical properties of LNG and LPG. Discussions of other examples of such hydrocarbons will follow. 
10.2	
Vapour pressures
This has in some degree been anticipated in the previous section. Vapour pressures of pure methane 
and pure propane are of course, at a particular temperature, fixed and invariant. In practice LNG will 
contain a few chemical species other than methane including higher hydrocarbons and diluent nitrogen. 
LPG might well be a blend of propane and butane, possibly with the latter in preponderance in which 
case the vapour pressure will be greatly reduced. LNG and LPG are both good fuels for spark ignition 
engines, although the former has not yet come into such use widely. Their vapour pressures are very 
much higher than the Reid Vapour Pressures given for gasolines in an earlier chapter. This is relevant 
to utilisation and to the storage and transportation which precede it. 
10.3.1	
Comparison of properties13
The table below gives properties of liquid methane and of liquid propane. Comments, by way of 
comparison with other liquid fuels considered in this volume, will be made.

In considering the density of liquid propane at the normal boiling point, we recall that LPG is at a much 
higher temperature under a vapour pressure of about 8 bar as noted. A related calculation is in the box 
below.
Œ≤ = ‚àí (1/œÅ) dœÅ/dT K-1
with symbols as defined in a previous chapter. Now from tables the density of liquid propane at 92 K (19oC) 
is 504 kg m-3. This provides a route to calculating Œ≤ for liquid propane. Integrating and rearranging:
Œ≤ = ‚Äì ln(œÅ292/ œÅ231)/(292 ‚Äì 231) = 0.002 K-1
The value of Œ≤ obtained for liquid propane is just twice the generic value for gasolines given in Chapter 3, 
an observation of some interest. Considering methane along similar lines, at the critical temperature 
of 190K liquid at a density of 182 kg m-3 is in phase equilibrium with vapour at 4.5 bar. The interested 
reader can easily confirm that this signifies a value for Œ≤ of 0.01 K-1, half an order of magnitude higher 
that the value for liquid propane and a full order of magnitude higher than the value commonly used for 
gasolines. The calculated values for liquid methane and for liquid propane have been entered in the table.
The kinematic viscosities in the fourth row of the table conform fairly closely to those given at room 
temperature (that is, at temperatures much higher than the normal boiling point either of methane or 
of propane) in Chapter 1 for a number of pure organic compounds. The value for liquid propane at 292 
K is 0.22 cSt which must be seen as the value for LPG composed primarily of propane or with propane 
in a very high preponderance. Values for gasolines are comparable to this as we saw in Chapter 3.

In reviewing the thermal conductivities given in the table, which were taken from [1], we return to the 
correlation given in Section 3.7:
106k/cal s-1 cm-1 oC-1 = 333 ‚Äì 0.19t
with symbols as defined previously. Inserting for methane t = -161oC and converting to SI units:
k = 0.15 W m-1K-1.
The corresponding calculation for propane (t = -42oC) gives a value of 0.14 W m-1K-1. Agreement is 
therefore better for propane. The dielectric constant given in row six of the table for propane is the 
value at 0oC. The equilibrium vapour pressure at this temperature would of course be several bar. In the 
following row are given the refractive indices calculated from:
refractive index = (dielectric constant)0.5
which, in an earlier chapter, was shown to hold well for gasolines. Several sources (e.g. [3]) give a value 
of 1.29 for liquid methane. A closely similar value to this is given in at least one literature source for 
liquid propane. Little variation in the refractive index is observed across the range C1 to C4.

10.3.2	
Consequences of the high pressure in stored liquefied gases
Leakage of propane from an accidentally created orifice in a vessel holding it as a liquefied gas is discussed 
as a calculation in the boxed area below.
The equation which will be applied to leakage of propane through an 
accidentally created orifice in a storage container is:
4 $3
^0J57>J@
JJ`
where Q = mass flow rate of gas (kg s-1), A = discharge area (m2), P = upstream pressure (N m-2),  
M = molecular weight (kg mol-1), R = gas constant = 8.314 J K-1mol-1, T = gas temperature (K) and  
Œ≥ = ratio of principal specific heats.
A reader is encouraged to consult other sources (e.g. Perry‚Äôs Chemical Engineers‚Äô 
Handbook) for background on the equation and conditions for its applicability.
Consider a container of LPG, approximating in composition to pure propane, at 25oC. Its pressure will be  
9 bar (‚â° 9 √ó 105 N m-2) as noted. Imagine that a hole the size of a five pence coin
develops. Such a coin has a diameter of 18mm and an area of:
œÄ √ó 0.0092 m2 = 2.5 √ó 10-4 m2
The value of Œ≥ for propane is 1.136 the molar mass is 0.044 kg mol-1. Putting P = 9 √ó 105 N m-2,  
R = 8.314 J K-1mol-1 and T = 298K gives on substitution:
Q = 0.6 kg s-1
It is possible from this to calculate the mechanical power with which propane exits the orifice. The pressure energy is:
‚àÜP/œÅliq J kg-1
where ‚àÜP is the drop in pressure on orifice exit (= 8 bar) and œÅliq the liquid density (= 493 kg m-3).  
The rate of expenditure of pressure energy is then: (8 √ó 105/493) J kg-1 √ó 0.6 kg s-1 = 975 W ‚â° 1.3 horse power
Now this is about the power at which a fuel dispenser at a filling station operates. Such devices often 
incorporate either a ¬æ h.p. or a 1 h.p. pump14. Our example considers release of LPG through a very 
small hole, and the effect of the pressure is equivalent to there being a standard petrol dispenser to aid 
release. This gives a perspective on the consequences in the event of leakage of the high internal pressures 
associated with liquefied gases.

Ethylene
Ethylene (CH2=CH2) is obtained by cracking petroleum distillate and is an important ‚Äòbuilding block‚Äô 
in petrochemical manufacture. Large quantities of it are transported. Ethylene has a critical temperature 
of 9oC.

At that temperature its vapour pressure is approximately 50 bar. The vapour pressure can be brought 
down by refrigeration and this is the way in which ethylene is usually transported by sea. The vapour 
pressure will be above atmospheric as the temperature will be above the normal boiling point, therefore 
ethylene in such a state is a refrigerated liquefied gas, an expression not encountered previously in this 
volume. This is a preferable term to ‚Äòcryogenic ethylene‚Äô which is often encountered and which would 
only be accurate if the ethylene was cooled all the way down to its normal boiling point of -104oC. 
We saw previously that LPG has a vapour pressure at room temperature of about 8 bar. Ethylene has no 
‚Äòvapour pressure at room temperature‚Äô because of its low critical temperature. If, as sometimes happens, 
a stationary or marine tank for LPG is to be used for ethylene the vapour pressure of the ethylene can 
by refrigeration be brought down to that for which the vessel was designed. Refrigeration down to -50 
to -60oC will be required bring the vapour pressure down to that of an LPG payload without refrigeration. 
The normal boiling point of ethylene (104K) is close to that of methane (112K). That of ethane (184K) 
falls between that methane and that of propane (231K). Some of the properties for methane and propane 
given in the previous table are given for ethylene and ethane in the table below. Comments follow.

The most important source of ethane is natural gas liquids (NGL) or (equivalently) ‚Äòcondensate‚Äô. When 
natural gas cools on removal from a reservoir via a well higher hydrocarbons present in it condense. 
These are up to about C4, and condensate is an important resource. Some of the non-associated gas 
fields of the southern North Sea contain large amounts of C2 to C4 hydrocarbons giving condensate in 
high yield when the gas is taken to a production platform. Such fields are often called ‚Äòcondensate fields‚Äô. 
Methane is important as the primary constituent of natural gas. Propane and butane are important as 
the constituents of LPG. Ethylene is important as the simplest alkene having accordingly a major place 
in petrochemical synthesis. Ethane has no such niche. It can however be used as a refrigerant when it 
is known as R170. This takes us into the next part of the chapter.

Simple hydrocarbons used as refrigerants
Refrigeration cycles per se are outside the scope of this book, but simple hydrocarbons for use as 
refrigerants are comfortably inside it. There has been a move towards hydrocarbons and away from 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as refrigerants because of harm done by the latter to the ozone layer
Additionally to ethane the following simple hydrocarbon compounds find use as refrigerants [4]: propane 
(R290), n-butane (R600), isobutane (R600a) and propylene (R1270). The last three of these have normal 
boiling points respectively 273, 261 and 225 K. The refrigerating effect is expressed as:
Tc(sg ‚Äì sf)
where Tc (K) is the cold enclosure temperature and sg and sf (J kg-1K-1) are the specific entropies of 
respectively refrigerant vapour at liquid at the higher surrounding temperature Th. We expect intuitively, 
working on a ‚ÄòTrouton‚Äôs constant‚Äô basis, that this could be re-written:
Refrigerating effect = ‚àÜhvapTc/Th J kg-1

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

where ‚àÜhvap (J kg-1) is the heat of vaporisation at Th. Imagine then a refrigerating device operating under 
conditions such that Th = 300K. The values of ‚àÜhvap at this temperature for a selection of refrigerants ‚Äì 
hydrocarbons and CFC ‚Äì are given in the table below.

The ratio Tc/Th will never differ hugely from unity and ‚àÜhvap(Th) is a reasonable indicator of the efficacy 
of a refrigerant, a point which has perhaps been given less emphasis in coverages of the subject than it 
might have been. It is clear from the above that simple hydrocarbons can, on this measure, ‚Äòhold their 
own‚Äô against CFCs. 
10.6	
Concluding remarks
Liquefied petroleum gas is a highly important fuel in which there is massive trade as is liquefied natural 
gas. Japan, vulnerable through lack of her own hydrocarbon resources, imports a great deal of both.

Postscript
11	 Postscript
Can a book of 100 pages possibly have a place in an area as vast and as complex as hydrocarbon science 
and technology? I believe that it can. It is an ill-informed judgement of a piece of scholarship which 
equates brevity with superficiality. This book is very focused and is intended to bring out new perspectives 
rather than to reproduce information readily available elsewhere. It is to that, not to any deficiency in 
content, that the book owes its modest length. 
I recently read in an account of the life of a 20th Century scholar in a subject area totally different from my 
own that he ‚Äòseems to fall in love with his material, such is the intensity of his engagement with it‚Äô. Whilst 
that might be seen as fanciful or even as lacking a sense of proportion, I think that most professional 
scholars could relate to it. To have studied a topic closely and deeply is an enriching experience. At this 
career stage I have a strong desire to share such insights as I have with people who have most of their 
professional lives in front of them. That has been my aim in writing this text and I venture to hope that 
others will follow.
