About the Authors
Danny Briere founded TeleChoice, Inc., a telecommunications consulting
company, in 1985 and now serves as CEO of the company. Widely known
throughout the telecommunications and networking industry, Danny has
written more than one thousand articles about telecommunications topics
and has authored or edited ten books, including Internet Telephony For
Dummies, Wireless Home Networking For Dummies (now in its second
edition), Wireless Hacks and Mods for Dummies, Windows XP Media Center
Edition 2004 PC For Dummies, and Home Theater For Dummies. He is fre-
quently quoted by leading publications on telecommunications and technol-
ogy topics and can often be seen on major TV networks, providing analysis
on the latest communications news and breakthroughs. Danny splits his time
between Mansfield Center, Connecticut, and his island home on Great
Diamond Island, Maine, with his wife and four children.
Pat Hurley is Director of Research with TeleChoice, Inc., and specializes in
emerging telecommunications and digital home technologies, particularly in
all the latest consumer electronics, access gear, and home technologies,
including wireless LANs, DSL, cable modems, satellite services, and home-
networking services. Pat frequently consults with the leading telecommunica-
tions carriers, equipment vendors, consumer goods manufacturers, and
other players in the telecommunications and consumer electronics indus-
tries. Pat is the coauthor of Internet Telephony For Dummies, Smart Homes For
Dummies, Wireless Home Networking For Dummies, Wireless Hacks and Mods
for Dummies, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 PC For Dummies, and
Home Theater For Dummies. He lives in San Diego, California, with his wife, a
fiery red-headed toddler named Annabel, and two smelly dogs.


Dedication
I dedicate this book to my wife, Holly, and publicly and officially confess that
she has a better memory and is smarter than I. Plus, she’s usually right. I
thank her dearly for putting up with me while I put in long hours at the office
to finish this book, including the 19 times that I was late for dinner. Okay, so
that’s a low number. Okay, so Holly also doesn’t exaggerate as much as I do.
In any case, I hope that she will continue to let me infiltrate the home with
smart-home techniques (which she secretly likes but won’t say) and at least
once say that she likes ONE thing I’ve installed.
— Danny
I dedicate this book to my wife, Christine, for allowing me to bore her nearly
to death with long, breathless discussions of networking toys that no normal
person wants to spend more than three minutes talking about, and for letting
me scare the living daylights out of the dogs with remote-controlled gizmos.
To thank her more completely, I promise to not bring a robot into the home —
thus avoiding all those dog psychiatrist bills — well, unless it’s a robotic dog
poop picker-upper!
— Pat


Authors’ Acknowledgments
It takes a lot of effort by a lot of people to put a book together. We probably
can’t give proper acknowledgment to everyone who’s given us advice, opin-
ions, and guidance as we’ve worked on this project, but we’d like to try.
For this third edition, we’d like to specifically thank the following folks for
sharing their knowledge and providing their extremely helpful insights into
the world of the smart home. To name just a few, we’d like to thank Ian
Hendler, Grant Sullivan, Marc Ceraculo, Mara White, and Jack Merrow at
Leviton (sorry for leaving you guys at the dinner table during that work
crisis!), Gordon Sell at Gordon Sell PR for Canton, Alex Elliot at NextAlarm,
Joelle Kenealey at Coltrin Associates for Control4, Eric Smith at Control4,
Julie Stern at LEGO Systems, Karl Pawlewicz from Griffin PR for Middle
Atlantic, Michael Cukrow and Mark Tracy at Middle Atlantic Products, Barry
Haaser at Echelon, Ralph Maniscalco at Honeywell, Michelle Laird at SmartLabs,
Brad Kayton at 4HomeMedia, Casey Munck and Frank Sterns at Niles Audio,
Roger Dressler and Jeanne Alford at Dolby Labs, Adam Weissman and Jeff
Talmadge at Denon, Ted White at the Green Glue Company, Joel Sider at
Microsoft, Dave Gilbert at Sound Seal, Steve Muellner and Andrew Corkill at
Meade, and Melanie Jensen and Colleen Logan at iFit. And to all the others we
forgot — thank you too!
For our earlier editions of the book, Sandy Daniels kept us organized, con-
nected, and sane. She prodded us along, set up interviews, found people we
couldn’t find ourselves, and generally acted like a bulldog in breaking through
corporate mazes to find the right people to interview for the book. If you ever
meet her, you’ll wonder how such a nice person can be so effective.
We also have built on the help of literally dozens of vendors during our
research in previous editions of this book. Special thanks go to Keith Smith at
Siemon, David Allred at DirecTV DSL, Jeff Denenholz at X10 Wireless Tech-
nologies, Mike Hernandez at ChannelPlus, Peter Radscliff and Jim Gist at
Monster Cable, Doug Hagan at Netgear, Matt Graves and Sean Ryan at Listen.
com, Nick Smith and Vanessa Tuell at Request, Tom Reed of the HomePlug
Powerline Alliance, Dave Thompson of CopperGate Communication, Brian
McLeod at Harmony, Andrew Liu at Intel, Mel Richardson and his team at
BellSouth, Lawrence Cheng at XM Radio, Tom Lucke, Fred Bargetzi, and Ray
O’Sullivan at Crestron, Paul Cunningham at Cunningham Security in Portland,
Maine, and George Snyder at Home Automated Living. 
Finally, we want to thank the Wiley team who (once again!) bought into our
vision of a smart home, and made sure we crossed our i’s and dotted our t’s
(or something like that). Thanks especially to Susan Pink, our project editor,
and Melody Layne, our acquisitions editor.

Introduction
W
elcome to Smart Homes For Dummies, 3rd Edition. This book is the
first to specifically tell you how to futureproof your home to take
advantage of the present and upcoming gee-whiz things that can make your
home a 21st century castle.
Very few things can prepare you for the massive changes that are taking
place due to the innovations offered by an interconnected world. The
Internet and electronic commerce are changing the way we live, the way we
work, and the way we play. (We hope there’s more of the last one!)
We’re so used to going to stores and buying things. To calling toll-free num-
bers so we can ask questions and order products. To going to school to learn.
To going to the movies to watch the latest Harry Potter release. To going to
the music store to buy the top-of-the-charts CDs.
Now it can all come to us. We can buy things through our TV sets. We can ask
questions and videoconference through our computers. We can attend
classes through computer-based training. We can click our remote controls to
get video-on-demand. We can download new CDs, live, over the Internet.
It’s at our doorstep. The question is, “Can you let it in?” Without a home net-
work, all this might stay outside, or in the TV room, or trapped in that attic
office of yours. A home network opens the world to your entire household,
and now more than ever is the time to plan.
That’s what Smart Homes For Dummies, 3rd Edition, provides — a plan for
your networked future.
If you plan nothing and simply go with the flow, ordering new capabilities
from your cable or telephone company when available, you’ll find that they’ll
start deciding how your home network should be built and operated. This is
dangerous because they will not think about what’s best for your home —
rather, they’ll install whatever gets their technicians in and out of your home
the fastest. These companies are also not looking at your big picture. In this
book, we help you understand how your home can be compatible with what
they want, and still keep your vision of a whole-home network too. Read on!

About This Book
Within these pages, you’ll find a number of technologies and issues relating
to developing digital smart-home technologies. Following are some of the
things you discover:
 What a home network is, and what it takes to build one
 The key points to think about before starting to conceptualize a home-
network design
 What the various home-network devices and services do
 What’s involved in making a home-entertainment center accessible
throughout the house
 What you need to create a home-security network
 Your options for dressing up your home-telephone capabilities
 The best way to design a home-data local area network (LAN)
 The ways to boost your in-home wireless LAN and cell phone signals
 The best way to connect your home to the Internet
 What’s coming down the road and into your home in the future
Some of the networks and issues that we cover in Smart Homes For Dummies
are in the realm of the do-it-yourselfer, so we present the big-picture stuff for
those readers and give high-level instructions. These instructions don’t go
into stuff such as removing your drywall and running cables through your
house. We recommend Home Improvement For Dummies by Gene Hamilton,
Katie Hamilton, and the editors of HouseNet (published by Wiley Publishing,
Inc.) if you need help with that stuff. And if you don’t feel comfortable run-
ning cables through your house, hire a professional!
If you’re renovating a home, building a new home, or trying to figure out how
to connect anything with anything else in your home, you need Smart Homes
For Dummies to make sure you’re getting what you need — not what your
builder happens to be selling.
What You’re Not to Read
Smart Homes For Dummies isn’t a novel. You don’t have to read page 1 before
going to page 2. So that means that you can just flip around through the book
and start wherever you like. You won’t feel lost.

Smart Homes For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

You can use the Table of Contents at the front of the book to find out where to
look for a topic that interests you, whether it’s distributing a DVD signal from
your home-entertainment center to your bedroom, or making your lights go
on and off by themselves. Or you can search the index for a particular term
that interests you. However you find the information, read it and then put the
book back on the shelf. That’s how this book is meant to be used.
Foolish Assumptions
This book is for everyone. Few people don’t have a TV, radio, or some sort of
computing device that would benefit from being networked in the future.
Although it’s easy to say now that computers are only for families in certain
financial brackets, within a few years, many TV sets will start shipping with
Internet connectivity options on-board. So, if you want to make the most of
your home’s electronic systems by networking them, you need to read this
book or one like it.
You’ll get the most out of this book if you’re remodeling or building a home,
because you’re in a position to run wires through your walls. Apartment
dwellers can do some of the stuff that we outline in this book (using wireless
technologies), and they can get cool ideas for when they do buy their homes.
One big assumption that we (and many in the industry) have had to get out
of our heads over the past few years regards wireless technologies. Some
folks have taken the position that today’s wireless technologies (and no-
new-wires technologies that leverage existing phone and power lines) have
eliminated the requirement to put network wiring in your walls. Well, wireless
is great — it can be an invaluable complement to a wired network. If you live
in an apartment or condo and can’t get inside the walls to run new wire, wire-
less may even be good enough to build your entire network around. But if
you live in a typical home, we think you’re going to find that a wired network
is more capable, more reliable, and more flexible. And a wired infrastructure
can be a good investment that pays you back if you sell your home.
How This Book Is Organized
We realize that not everyone is going to want to do everything we discuss in
the book. So we broke the book down into distinct parts, each of which tack-
les a different aspect of building a smart-home infrastructure. Part I is the
high-level, 50,000-foot view — describing why you might want to create a
smart home. Parts II through V look in depth at how to design your home and
home network to take advantage of all the neat things coming down the road
in each of the major zones, and Part VI tells you how to interconnect them all.
3
Introduction

Part I: Future-Perfect Homes
Part I describes where we’re trying to get to: our future-proofed home. We
talk about the different major network zones of your home: your entertain-
ment system, your security system, your phone system, and your computer
system. We talk about all the other things that you might want to link and
why you’d want to do that. And finally, we talk about how you can start think-
ing about the various things you could accomplish with a fully networked
home — your smart home.
Part II: Making Your Home an
Entertainment Center
Part II looks at how to make your home an entertainment center. You find out
about creating not merely a home theater, but a true home-wide entertain-
ment complex. How do you listen to your favorite CD from anywhere in the
house? How do you share a satellite dish among multiple TVs. How do you
watch your napping baby from your living room TV?
We tell you how to sensibly build a media backbone in your home without
breaking your bank account. We help you plan for things such as flat-screen
TVs, intercom systems, whole-home audio systems, gaming consoles, and
satellite systems. We talk about your wiring (and wireless) options for com-
municating with each part of your home-entertainment complex.
Part III: Now We’re Communicating!
Part III delves into the world of telephones. Life used to be simple in this
area. If you wanted a new phone, you could go to the local department store
or Radio Shack and buy one. Now you have all sorts of complications in this
area. You can choose a multiline phone, a 2.4-GHz or 5-GHz cordless, a VoIP
phone, a Skype phone, a screen phone, a combined phone-fax-printer-
scanner, an answering machine, central-office-based voice-mail services, 
and a whole lot more. We help you craft your home-telephone network so
that you can communicate with anyone from anywhere — without all that
scratchy static, we hope.

Smart Homes For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN
Part IV looks at your computer zone. A smart home has a high-bandwidth
backbone connection running throughout the house, so you can tap into your
data autobahn wherever you like. We help you understand how you can play
networked games, share files between computers, print or fax from any com-
puter in the home, or even get the whole family on the Net, at the same time!
We look at the world of DSL, cable modems, HughesNet dishes, wireless
Internet connections, electrical data connections, and more. Wired or wire-
less, we help you plan and design a computer LAN for your home. We guide
you through the maze of wiring options to make sure that if you want to surf
the Net while mowing the lawn, you can.
Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —
Security
Part V takes you through our home-security boot camp and looks at every-
thing you’d want to do to secure and protect your home. We describe not just
fire and burglar alarms, but also video doorbells, closed-circuit TV, driveway
sensors, and ways to watch out for your kids. We help you plan your way to a
more secure and protected home.
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home
Automation and Control
Part VI brings it all together — the ultimate guide to home networking. We
walk you through a whole-home approach to network design. We provide
home-design and home-layout tips and expose you to the various products
on the market for centralized home networking.
Want to fire up that coffee pot while you’re still asleep? Or how about setting
the mood with automated lighting? We look at all the latest trends and gad-
gets governing home automation, including the details about X10, ZigBee, 
Z-Wave, and Insteon.

Introduction

Part VII: The Part of Tens
Part VII is the infamous Part of Tens, where we give you ten common pitfalls
to avoid when automating your smart home and the top ten toys of the
future.
Icons Used in This Book
We use helpful graphical icons to point out items of interest — sort of like
Kodak Picture Spots at Disney World. These icons are meant to encourage
you to pause and take in what we’re saying at that point. Following are the
icons we use.
This is the fun stuff. This icon highlights neat new technical and other
advances that are just arriving or not too far away. It’s like a free pass to the
World’s Fair and a glimpse at the World of the Future.
This is a helpful reminder to do certain things, which translates to “we’ve for-
gotten to do this so often that we put it here just to remind ourselves.”
When you see this icon, you may want to wait to make a decision until the
industry decides which way it wants to go. Remember the Betamax VCR?
A few people in every crowd raise their hands and ask what’s underneath the
hood, so every now and then we stop to point out some of the neat stuff that
makes the technology work. (We say neat because we’re nerdy enough to
enjoy writing about it.)
This icon highlights a shortcut or timesaving secret that we wished someone
had told us before we learned the hard way.
This is never a good icon to see. It means you’re working in a part of the
Internet or your computer that’s dangerous. It’s like knowing the Wicked
Witch of the West is in your neighborhood and you’re wearing the ruby slip-
pers. Be careful.
This icon tells you about a wireless technology that you can use instead of
ripping your walls out.

Future-Perfect
Homes

In this part . . .
I
n the olden days, your home network was basically
comprised of electrical wires and phone lines, with a
smattering of alarm wiring here and there. Now your home
network covers all sorts of wiring and wireless options, to
connect any of a number of different devices — including
your car and your microwave.
You can connect home-entertainment systems, security
systems, computer networks, telephone systems, and
appliances and come up with all sorts of neat applications
to help make your home living simpler and more enjoyable.
In this part, we tell you all about the potential of a home
network. We discuss the major elements of a whole-home
network and describe the advantages of connecting them
together. We also give you some advice on how much
everything will cost, and show you what the finished
product (a networked home) will look like — inside the
walls! By the end of this part, you’ll be more excited than
ever about hooking everything together.

In This Chapter
 Looking at a day in the life of your wired home
 Understanding what goes into a wired home
 Quantifying the benefits of a home network
 Outlining the requirements for a home network
I
f you stop the average person on the street and start talking about home
networks, he or she would probably make references to ABC, CBS, NBC,
and FOX, or mention the Home Shopping Network or some other cable net-
work show. Network, until recently, has meant little else to most people.
But times, they are a changin’. The invasion of telecommunications into all
aspects of life is creating a different meaning of the word network. Most
people have had some contact with a network through their work environ-
ment — computer local area networks (LANs) in the office, control networks
in factories, telephone networks in many mid-sized or larger businesses . . .
heck, the Internet is a huge network.
You can think of networks simply as things that help you do your work. As you
concentrate on printing a document, calling up a database, or checking out the
price of a product online, the network is invisible (that is, until it’s broken).
The network concept has begun to move from the workplace to the home,
and smart home builders and remodelers (and forward-looking owners of
otherwise perfect existing homes) are starting to think in terms of wiring (or
wirelessing) their homes both to make use of a network today and to future-
proof against upcoming requirements.
Before you go any further, do this little exercise (don’t worry, we won’t grade
you): Write down all the things in your house that you think you may want to
network. Be as creative as you can. Think about your lifestyle and the way
your house is set up. When you finish, put the list aside and continue to read
this chapter. Toward the end, we’ll share our list with you.

Living in Your Smart Home
Your smart home can seep into all aspects of your life. It helps you do those
day-to-day tasks that can take up so much time, such as opening the
draperies, dimming the lights, and flipping on the Weather Channel to see
whether the kids have a snow day. How far you go with your smart home
depends on your lifestyle, budget, and tastes.
This section spends a virtual day in a fictitious smart home. Here’s the scenario:
You, the reader, are part of a family of six, plus the requisite pets (we prefer
dogs). You and your spouse both work, and the kids range in age from 8 to 17.
Starting your day
Anyone with kids knows the importance of keeping on a schedule. Your home
network helps you do just that, in style.
At first light, you wake to your home-controlled alarm — a stream of pleasant
classical music coming over your home-audio network into your bedroom.
After a preset length of time, the music fades out and the TV kicks on to your
favorite local station, where you can get the weather and traffic reports and
information about any school closings or delays. Down the hall, the kids
awaken to the music of their choice.
In the kitchen, the coffeemaker starts brewing your morning caffeine require-
ments. Select shades and drapes throughout the house open to let the day’s
light stream in. It’s winter, so the towel warmers and the radiant heat in the
bathrooms’ floors are turned on. The automatic pet door out back opens and
lets the dog out for his morning constitutional.
By this time, you’re already in the kitchen making school lunches. Being the
nice person you are, you take a cup of coffee to your spouse, who is listening
to National Public Radio in the bathroom. As you finish setting out breakfast
for the kids, a glance at the upstairs monitors shows that two of your four
kids are still in bed. Your eldest son is videoconferencing with his girlfriend
on his computer. You punch the intercom and tell them all to get a move on.
As the children cycle into and out of the bathroom, the home-control system
times their showers to make sure no one hogs the bathroom. The shower’s
water temperature is just to their liking, but that’s hardly a surprise — it’s the
same setting they use each day this time of year.
12
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

As you sit down to breakfast, your spouse comes running through, late for
the office. A printout of major headlines and personal stock standings sits
waiting in the printer, having been created and downloaded from the Internet
overnight.
Your spouse works down the street (we did tell you that you work at home,
didn’t we?), and your smart home knows that you both like a warm car when
you get into a 15-degree garage, so the home controller starts the car 15 min-
utes before the scheduled departure time. Before your spouse climbs inside
the toasty car, the home-control system gives a verbal reminder to put the
bottles and cans next to the curb because today is recycling day.
As your spouse leaves the garage, your home-control system talks to your
phone system and redirects all of your spouse’s home-business line calls to
the car phone. Once at work, a simple push of a speed dial button on the
office phone dials in and redirects the calls again to your spouse’s office.
Back at home, you confirm that the kids caught the bus by using the video
monitor in the kitchen, and then you get ready for work. You ask the home
controller to put the house in your personal mode — in terms of tempera-
ture, music, lighting, drape settings, and anything else you may have set.
Getting down to work
You get a second cup of coffee and decide to work for a while in the sunroom.
You tell the home controller where you are, and the controller transfers all
your business calls to the extension near the table. Your laptop is wirelessly
connected to your server and the Internet. You check your various e-mail
accounts and voice mail and make a few conference calls on the multiline
home-telephone system. While you’re on one phone call, you turn on the TV
to access the local online directory and navigate to the ordering page for that
posh take-out shop down the street. Twenty minutes later, the delivery
person arrives at the front door; you take your wireless two-line headset
phone — conference call and all — to the door, where you tip the delivery
person (you paid over the TV set) and retreat back to the sunroom for lunch.
For a midafternoon break, you head for the exercise room to work off some of
that lunch. When you enter, you announce yourself to your voice-activated
home-automation system, and it automatically sets the music and other envi-
ronmental settings to your previously defined preferences. You sit down at
your rowing machine, which has a large monitor that shows real-life settings
of popular rowing locales.
13
Chapter 1: Mi Casa, Cool Casa

Halfway through your workout session, a delivery person shows up at your
door. An announcement that someone is at the door interrupts the music,
and the nearest video display shows a picture of who it is. You don’t want to
stop mid-workout, so you reply that you are busy and ask him to leave the
package inside the door. You prompt for the control system to unlock the
front door, and watch as the front door unlocks itself and the delivery person
places the packages in the foyer. He leaves, and you start rowing again along
Boston’s Charles River.
It’s your turn for a temperature-controlled shower, where you listen to CNN
from the TV set, via moisture-resistant speakers mounted in the bath.
Squeaky clean, you go back to work. At 3:00, you have your first videoconfer-
ence of the day from your office downstairs. While in the basement, you call
up your home-control system and start the roast cooking in the oven.
The kids drift home in the afternoon and spread out across the house. While
you access your corporation’s data network, your kids take advantage of the
computers. The youngest kids — twins — play multiplayer games on the
home’s high-speed Internet connection. Your eldest daughter logs onto the
school’s educational network to do research for the midterm paper due next
week. And your son, when home from football practice, logs onto his school’s
network to collaboratively work with three others on a joint presentation for
the next day. Instant messages, e-mails, and file transfers all flow with ease.
The home controller’s voice enunciator reminds you that the roast should be
done by now, and you head upstairs.
Dinner time
Meanwhile, at work, your spouse glances at the clock and remembers in a
panic that the family needs groceries. A quick dial into the home LAN yields
the grocery list on the computerized message board in the kitchen. On the
way home, a phone call into the home controller redirects calls back to the
car phone in case someone tries to call.
The magnetic driveway sensor tells the home-control system to announce
your spouse’s arrival. As your spouse enters the house from the garage, the
home controller again redirects all calls to the home office, completing the
day’s cycle. As your spouse brings the groceries into the kitchen, you receive
a kiss (sorry, not automated).
Ready to eat, you ask the home controller to set dinner mode in the dining
room. A microphone in the light switch hears the command and dims the
14
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

lights and turns on the gas-driven fireplace. The home-control system selects
some family-oriented music from the MP3 server and plays it over the in-wall
speakers in the dining room.
After dinner, you start cleaning up as your kids race to their rooms to finish
their homework. Later, they watch a TV special in the living room, while you
take in an old Spencer Tracy movie in your bedroom. In the meantime, your
spouse has a late videoconference in the home office downstairs with clients
in Japan. Occasionally, you access the picture-in-picture (PIP) capability on
your TV set to check around the house, making sure that no one is getting into
any trouble. After the movie, you give a simple command to the home con-
troller and the lights are dimmed, the temperature in select zones is lowered,
shades and draperies close, nightlights come on, and the intercom goes into
monitor mode for the youngest kids, in case they’re sick during the night.
(The sound from those monitors plays only in the master bedroom area.)
Peace at last!
With the kids asleep for the night, you decide to take a nice relaxing bath.
You instruct your home-control system to prepare the bathroom — dim the
lights, open the skylight, run the bath at your favorite temperature, turn off
the telephone extensions nearby (route them to voice mail instead), and play
your favorite album on the bathroom speakers.
While lounging in bed watching the wide-screen TV, your spouse tells the
home-entertainment system’s PVR (personal video recorder, a hard-drive-
based system that can record video digitally) to search the shows it has been
archiving every day and play the most recent Enterprise! episode.
Your house is in off-hours mode. The dog is inside, and the doggy door is
secure. All phones have muted ringing volumes; some don’t ring at all. All
drapes are closed. The temperature is lower to save energy when your family
is tucked in tight under the covers. All security systems are now alert, look-
ing for movement outside the house.
After your bath, you climb in bed and read for a while. You finish your elec-
tronic book and decide you want to read the sequel right away. You surf the
Web from your TV set, find the book, buy it, download it to the home LAN
and thus to your electronic book via a wireless connection.
Your dishwasher kicks on at midnight when the rates are low (you loaded it
at dinnertime and turned it on, but the home controller activates it when
rates drop). All night long, your home controller and its various sensors keep
an eye on everything for you. You sleep peacefully.
15
Chapter 1: Mi Casa, Cool Casa

The home-network revolution
What’s brought about this progression of intelligent home networks into
everyday life? One word: computers. And when we say computers, we don’t
mean only the PC sitting on a desk in a spare bedroom in 60 percent of
American homes (although that’s an important part of it). We mean also
those little blobs of silicon that reside in so many things in your house, such
as phones, televisions, refrigerators, and even the car in the garage.
Most of these systems are islands of computing power plugged into the
power outlets of your home. The computer chips have no way of talking to
each other or sharing the information that they gather and control. The net-
work revolution — the home-network revolution — is taking place as these
things begin to talk to each other. Imagine a refrigerator that talks to your
electrical utility and goes into its power-hungry defrost mode when the elec-
tricity rates are lowest. Or suppose after a power outage that all your clocks
reset themselves automatically because they’re set to “network time.”
Home networks aren’t as advanced as the Jetsons’ home, but they will be
soon. And you’ll be missing the boat if you build a new home or remodel your
existing one without taking this kind of future into account. Although you
can’t know today exactly what will be connected to what (and how) tomor-
row, you can design a wiring system for your home that will enable you to do
the most you can today and be ready for tomorrow’s needs.
What’s in a Smart Home?
A smart home is a harmonious home, a conglomeration of devices and capa-
bilities working according to the Zen of Home Networking. At the beginning of
this chapter, we suggested that you make a list of all the things you might
want to network. Following is our list. Notice that practically anything in your
home can be, and ultimately will be, networked. That’s the whole point of
whole-house networking:
 Household items: Drapes and shades, gates, garage doors, door locks,
doorbells, lights, dishwasher, refrigerator, heaters, alarm clocks, washer,
dryer, microwave, coffeemaker, hot water system, air conditioners, cen-
tral vacuum system, water controls (shower, sink, and so on), pool
cover, fireplaces, toys, e-books, lawnmower, cars and other vehicles,
piano, weather station, furniture
16
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

 Audio and video: Receivers, amplifiers, speakers, VCRs, CD players,
DVD players, PVR players, TVs, WebTV devices, Apple TV devices, DSS
dish, radios, remote controls, gaming consoles, cable TV devices, TV
videoconferencing devices
 Security: Baby monitor, video cameras, surveillance monitors, motion
detectors, smoke detectors, occupancy sensors, pressure sensors,
infrared sensors, intercoms, voice enunciators
 Phones: Corded phones, cordless phones, 900-MHz phones, 2.4-GHz
phones, 5.8-GHz phones, fax machine, answering machine, PDAs, screen
phone, video phone, cell phones
 Computers: PCs, Macs, laptops, modems, scanners, printers, home
servers
The key is getting information to and from each of these devices. That takes a
network. Your home network is actually a collection of networks.
Communications in and among different devices travel over various network
layers, such as your home-telephone network, your computing network, your
security network, your electrical communications network (yes, you can talk
over your electrical lines, believe it or not), and so on. These collectively are
what we call your home network, and you mix, match, and jump among these
network layers as you communicate throughout your household.

Chapter 1: Mi Casa, Cool Casa
History of home wiring
Traditionally, homes have been wired for only
two things: power and telephones. Add a few
haphazardly run cable-TV outlets and some
doorbells, and you have the sum of the wiring in
most homes. Some people put in an alarm
system or an intercom system, each with its
own set of wires. The result is a house with an
expensive bunch of wires that don’t talk to each
other and aren’t good for anything else.
Even more important than the quantity of wires
is the quality, especially when it comes to home
automation and high-speed data services.
Wiring systems that are inadequate for the
needs of today’s wired citizens occur not only in
homes wired 50 years ago but also in many new
homes. Older low-voltage wires (telephone 
and cable TV wires, for example) don’t have
adequate capacity for high-speed data use or
for multiple lines. They don’t go to enough
places in the house, and they have no flexibility
of configuration. When your needs change,
you’ll probably have to rewire.
Even electrical power cables may be inade-
quate (and not just because you don’t have
enough outlets) for home-automation and con-
trol systems to do such tasks as turn on lights
and start the coffeemaker. These systems
require a power system that is adequately iso-
lated from interference and line noise, which is
not the case in many homes.
Luckily, overcoming these problems isn’t 
difficult — or even that expensive. All you need
is a little knowledge and a good plan!

Why Network Your Home?
A network allows you to do a bevy of things. For instance, you can
 Access the Internet from anywhere in your house: A home network
lets everyone share in the broadband wealth, so you can stop fighting
over the one computer with the high-speed connection. What’s more, by
having a communications backbone (wiring infrastructure) in your
house, you can let anything — from your TV set to your car — tap in and
make use of that connectivity.
 Remotely control your home: After your home network is connected to
your other networks, such as the Internet, you can suddenly do amazing
things from almost any interconnected spot. The capability to control a
device after it is hooked up to the network is limited only by the open-
ness of the device itself. (In other words, the only limit is the degree of
controllability of the device — your home’s infrastructure won’t hold
you back.) Want to turn off the lights downstairs from the bedroom?
Click your remote control, and out go the lights. Want to check the
babysitter while you’re at your neighbor’s July 4th bash? Just use the

Home servers
Traditionally, you buy a lot of boxes for your
house, such as VCRs, DVD players, and CD play-
ers. As the movement towards digital storage
has blossomed, you find VCRs with hard disks
and CD jukeboxes that can store hundreds of
CDs. We call these boxes servers because they
mimic the role of computer servers in a corpo-
rate environment.
There’s a movement afoot to merge all of these
servers into a home serverthat stores CDs, DVDs,
games, software, and more and “serves” its con-
tent to devices that want to play that information.
These also will access the Internet for easy
access to online content such as iTunes
(www.itunes.com) or YouTube (www.
youtube.com). Gaming consoles such as the
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are trying to become
such central repositories, and Microsoft has
launched a new product called (not surprisingly)
Windows Home Server (in beta at the time of this
writing at (http://connect.microsoft.
com/WindowsHomeServer). You’ll also see
home media centers in PC and standalone stereo
gear that target the same market. Home servers
will range in price from $400 to more than $25,000,
depending on what and how much you are trying
to store.
We think every home should have a home
server of some sort. A home server makes find-
ing things less difficult and creating backups
easier, and certain programs such as iTunes run
better when everything is in one place. Our
approach to home networking in this book
enables you to connect a home server when-
ever you decide to get one.

 Save time: Think about how much time it takes every day to open the
shades, turn on the morning news, let the dog out, and so on. Wouldn’t
you like to do all that (and more) with one command? By programming
these chores into task profiles, you can.
 Save money on electronics: With a true home network, you have to buy
fewer devices to outfit your home. Instead of having a VCR hooked to
every TV set, for instance, you can centralize this functionality and dis-
tribute the signal around the house through remote control as you need
it. The same is true of almost any network-connected device, such as a
DSS satellite receiver, PVR, and cable box.
 Save money on communications costs: By centralizing access to certain
telecommunications services, you can cut monthly service costs. For
instance, with a home-network backbone, both you and your spouse can
connect to the Internet on separate computers while sharing one line and
one account. What’s more, you can share a high-bandwidth option —
such as a cable modem, DSL link, or HughesNet-type satellite service —
with the entire family.
You might be ahead of the pack and already have a single broadband
link to share with everyone at home. But if your connection is like ours,
it can go down a lot. We’re seeing the movement towards homes with
two broadband connections (one as a backup). Being able to have the
kids do homework and mom and dad do their necessary browsing is
starting to become mission-critical. So a home network will help you
share this backup line too!
 Save money on your home expenses: A wired home can turn back
those thermostats when you’re away on vacation or cuddled under your
blankets at night. It can turn lights off automatically, too. Over time, you
may save a surprising amount in heating, cooling, and electricity costs.
 Save money on the future: At different times in your life, you may find
yourself changing the way you use certain rooms — a guest room
becomes a nursery or the garage becomes an office, for example.
Changes like these can be expensive if you try to bring your network
along for the ride. Instead, have a flexible home-network design — one
that’s futureproofed for all sorts of contingencies — and save money
down the road.
 Be more flexible and comfortable with your technological assets: A
home network frees you from being tied to one spot for one activity. For
instance, when working late at night, you might want to move the laptop
to a comfy recliner instead of a damp basement office. And you can with
a distributed means to access the Internet — and therefore your central-
ized e-mail, calendar, and contact database. The latest home networking
technology will route your HDTV signals around your house, freeing
your TV set to be anywhere a wireless signal can reach!

Chapter 1: Mi Casa, Cool Casa

 Lose more fat: A smart home won’t stop you from eating chocolate cake,
but it will spice up the exercise room. You can run Internet access, CNN,
or exercise videos over your home network to help you keep pace and
pass the time on a treadmill or bicycle. And, with Internet access, you
can access many of the neat new software programs that combine with
new exercise equipment to provide passing scenery or live competitors
as you row, row, row your rowing machine!
What Does It Take to 
Network Your Home?
Okay, so you have the big picture: A networked home is a happy home. What
does it take to get there? Surprisingly little, or surprisingly a lot. (Can you tell
we make good consultants?) It depends on whether you do baby steps or go
whole hog.
You can make a home network based on the existing wiring in the walls or
using the airwaves in your house, with wireless options. No cost for infra-
structure there. Is it as powerful as an installed system? No, but for many it
will do the trick.
Alternatively, you can install a whole system from scratch. The cost varies,
just like the cost of building a house. The more you put in, the more it costs.
We’ve used both approaches, wired and wireless. We put investment upfront
into our transport layer — the wiring and connectivity in the walls — and
less on the things we connect to that layer, to give us more flexibility as
things change. For instance, at Danny’s house in Maine, rather than design for
a big 32” TV, he left the living room unfinished because he knew that the price
of flat-screen plasma TVs would plummet. He waited patiently for prices to
drop. He’s still waiting. So is his wife.
Table 1-1 shows you some of the rough costs for getting into a smart home,
with reasonable expectations set forth in this book. These are the costs of
the components and the installation — you’ll have some additional ongoing
costs for services such as Internet and cable TV and for your computing
hardware.

In this book, you’ll go through the following process of thinking smartly:
1. Finding out all you can about your options
2. Putting your thoughts on paper
3. Figuring out the costs of your desired options
4. Refining your thoughts based on cost
5. Getting help where needed
6. Installing the systems in a methodical and somewhat structured process
7. Adding all the cool devices that put your smart home to use
8. Sitting back and enjoying yourself. (We’d like to stress this one, but the
reality is that you’ll enjoy your smart home for a moment and then go
back to the first step and start over, because you’ll want more.)
We provide detailed steps as well as more budgeting information in Chapter 4.

 Finding the perfect rack
A
s you think about your home network, think in terms of the big picture.
Instead of talking about how to link one computer to another, think
about a computer network that extends to every room. Instead of trying to
extend your cable TV signal from one room to another, think about a video-
distribution strategy for the whole house. Instead of discussing your home-
entertainment center, map out a media backbone for your entire home.
In this chapter, you look at networks in a broad, whole-home sense. We tell
you how all the networks in your home fit together physically and how you
can make home networking easier by designing a central location (or two) to
house all of your networking equipment. We also discuss some structured
cabling solutions, which are packages of bundled cabling and distribution
panels that can take care of most home-networking infrastructure needs in
one easy-to-buy-and-install single-vendor system.
All Together Now!
Your home infrastructure may consist of one or more of the following 
networks:
 A phone network
 A data network (often called a local area network, or LAN)

24
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 
 An electrical network
 A security network
 An intercom network (may be part of your phone network)
 An entertainment network
 A home-automation and -control capability that allows your house to do
common tasks on its own
 Access to the Internet and other external programming sources (such as
satellite broadcasts, cable, and telephone services)
Now, you may not want or need all these different types of networks in your
home. However, if you’re at a point in the construction or remodeling of your
home where running cables is easy, consider providing the cables so that you
(or someone who owns your home after you) can add these capabilities later.
We’re not implying that you physically need to wire each of these networks
separately. When we wrote the first edition of this book, lots of vendors of
security, intercom, phone, home-control, and other network gear had their
own proprietary wiring that they required you to install if you didn’t want to
void the warranty on the gear. Well, the market voted with their pocketbooks
and started buying nonproprietary solutions, and the explosion of broadband
and home networking is pushing standards across the whole home — in the
form of Internet protocol, or IP, networking. With applications in the home
converging on IP networking, wiring your home is easier. In fact, for most
applications, you need to use only one type of cabling: twisted-pair cabling.
That solution is so much better than running lots of proprietary cables
around the house. Believe us.
One of the difficulties when thinking about home networking is that different
networks sometimes do the same thing. To simplify, you can think of your
home network in three ways:
 Physical configuration: The cables, connections, and specific pieces of
equipment that make up the physical aspects of your network. This is
where all the detail work comes in.
 Logical configuration: Each network is viewed as a single object (such
as a phone network) or as a model. Most of the networks we discuss in
this book use a star model, in which all the cables meet at a single junc-
tion point, just as the spokes of a wheel meet at the hub.
 Applications: The network’s purpose, or application, and connections.
Your entertainment network, for example, may represent a combination
of different physical components and logical entities aimed at distribut-
ing audio and video around your house. A typical system might include
audio and video devices such as a video switch (often part of your home
theater receiver), gaming consoles and DVD players, a broadcast satel-
lite that runs to receivers that require phone line access, and home-
management software to control the network’s functionality.

Although it’s easiest to discuss the building of home networks by talking
about the cables and connectors (as we do throughout the book), the begin-
ning phases of conceptualizing a home network start from the opposite end.
You usually begin by thinking of what you want to accomplish (the applica-
tions), move on to considering each individual network and its layout (the
logical configuration), and then get to the nitty-gritty of cables, connectors,
and specific hardware components (the physical configuration).
Thinking of networks by application, logically, and physically can reveal ways
to save money, time, and headaches. For example, if you think strictly in
terms of the phone network and data network being logically different net-
works, you could overlook that these networks may be able to transmit over
the same in-wall cables.
As mentioned, we’re getting closer to the time when homeowners will be able
to install an integrated, unified network that carries voice, video, data, audio,
and home-control signals over a single kind of cabling infrastructure. When
that day comes, we’ll write a really short version of Smart Homes For
Dummies and spend more time on the golf course or basketball court.
Unfortunately (for Pat’s jump shot and Danny’s swing), that day is still quite a
ways off. Today’s home network still consists of a number of independent
networks, each doing its own thing over its own set of wires and cables.
That’s not to say that there aren’t places where today’s individual home net-
works come together and work together. A typical house has a whole bunch
of network interconnection points, making these separate networks behave
somewhat like a unified, single network.
Networks can physically interconnect in a home in three ways:
 Networks can share the same media (or cables) to carry different
kinds of signals. For example, telephone wiring might be used to carry
both telephone service and data networking at different frequencies
using a phone-line networking system. Another example: The IP
(Internet Protocol) allows many disparate types of signals — voice, data,
video, and so on — to peacefully coexist in the same data stream run-
ning over common data-networking wiring.
 Specific devices can connect to multiple networks. A DSS satellite
receiver, for example, connects to both video and telephone networks. A
media server such as a PVR could connect to your video network and
your data network.
 Incoming service provider feeds can carry multiple services and con-
nect to different networks in the home. For example, a cable company
might provide television, Internet access, and telephone service over
three different home networks.
25
Chapter 2: Zen and the Art of Whole-Home Networking

Moving Your Network into the Closet
When integrating a home network in your home design or remodeling plans,
the following two points are key:
 Designate an appropriate location for all your network’s central distribu-
tion equipment.
 Make sure that you have an adequate quality and quantity of network
cabling running to each potential network outlet in your home.
Wireless disclaimer: It’s tempting to believe everything you read about how
wireless is going to make wired networks in the home redundant. We wish
this were true. We’re enamored with the promise of meshed high bandwidth
wireless that connects everything in the home under one power of unwired
Zen. Unfortunately, we’re still a long ways away from this, and every time we
think we’re getting close, new applications and requirements come along that
make the wireless options inadequate or unreliable — for example, just as
soon as Wi-Fi got fast enough to support television, high-definition television
came along and blew that proposition out the window. So while we wait for
wireless to fulfill its promise, we recommend an environment that consists of
a wired backbone with wireless endpoints, to provide whole-home wired and
wireless support. You can’t lose in that environment.
In this section, we discuss the first of these points — designing a central loca-
tion for your network components. In the following section, we discuss the
pieces and parts — the cables and connectors that make up the physical 
network.
Talk to your builder or remodeler about designating a space as a central
wiring closet. (For a remodel, it often makes sense to have multiple locations.)
The wiring closet should be out of sight but easily accessible, with plenty of
space and adequate power to run a great deal of equipment.
By designating a central wiring closet, you gain the following benefits:
 Hidden wires: The walls of a truly wired home contain lots of cables:
wires for a phone network, a video network, an audio network, a com-
puter network, a security network, and a remote-control network. Add
the connections to the outside phone lines, cable TV, and satellite feeds,
and it can quickly become a bowl of spaghetti. You don’t want to have to
tuck these wires behind your furniture. In a wiring closet, these cables
are neatly terminated in a series of wiring panels.
26
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

 Hidden hardware: Much of the hardware that facilitates home network-
ing, such as distribution panels and punchdown blocks (these panels and
blocks are special wiring-termination devices that connect all the cables
running to remote locations in your house), is designed for function
rather than form. A central wiring closet puts this hardware out of view.
 Single point of connection: Most networks we describe in this book
connect to the outside world at a single, central location. Why not have
the wires of all these networks terminate in the same area to make it
easier to do things such as connect your Internet line to your computer
network?
 Easy access: When you want to change the capabilities of your networks
or troubleshoot a problem, having everything neatly arranged and easily
accessible can eliminate a source of frustration.
Larger homes might have more than one wiring closet. In the simpler olden
days of smart home yore, the massive expense of components and the lack of
peer-to-peer communications technologies forced a smart home owner to
consolidate things in one place. This situation is beginning to change. With a
strong networking backbone in the home, and the right architecture and
design for that backbone (we’ve got your back here), devices and applica-
tions can hop on and off at will. This allows you to distribute (or cluster)
groups of equipment around the home. Danny, for instance, has a main wiring
closet in his basement where his satellite receiver, cable modem, telephone,
security, and main power connections are consolidated into a Leviton smart
wiring panel. But he also has subpanels set up in the back of his main home
office, where more specialized forms of equipment for networking, e-mail,
wireless connections, backup drives, and such are found, and another in his
third-floor entertainment area, again anchored by another Leviton wiring
panel, where the audio, video, data, telephone, security, and home-automation
equipment is located. All three are interconnected to take advantage of the
functionality in the other places, in a whole-home fashion.
The contents of your wiring closet
Most of the cabling and infrastructure components of a home’s networks
should be installed in the area of your home designated as your wiring closet.
A few items — mainly parts of your home-entertainment network — are
better located in complementary wiring closets elsewhere (we get to the con-
cept of a media center later in this chapter). In addition, a few systems in a
home network are inherently decentralized, such as home-control compo-
nents, security systems, and wireless phone or data network systems. These
27
Chapter 2: Zen and the Art of Whole-Home Networking

devices don’t necessarily have central control units, or they have control
units that should be out in the open and readily accessible, not hidden away
in a wiring closet.
The devices that should go in a central wiring closet include
 The coaxial video-distribution panel (see Chapter 6)
 Patch panels for CAT-5e/6 rated phone and data wiring (see Chapter 11)
 Central controllers (called ATAs) for VoIP telephone systems (see
Chapter 10)
 Cable, satellite, and DSL modems and routers (see Chapter 13)
 Ethernet switches (see Chapter 15)
 Stand-alone home-automation control units (see Chapter 19)
You can also put home servers and some of your central media equipment in
the wiring closet if you don’t need to physically access them frequently and
you need the extra space elsewhere. Some of your wireless (Wi-Fi) capability
may be here as well, depending on its location relative to the structure of
your home. More on these centralized devices later in the chapter.
Some cable and DSL modems utilize a USB instead of an Ethernet interface.
This simplifies connecting one of these modems to a single computer, but it
makes it just about impossible to directly connect it to a centralized LAN
hub. If your service provider leases or sells you one of these modems, it must
be installed next to a server computer in your home office or other location.
Most providers give you the choice of USB or Ethernet, but the offer may not
be advertised. So ask the question upfront, and ask for an Ethernet modem.
If you are building a new house, take a lot of pictures after the wiring is
roughed in. Then, if you need to cut a hole in a wall later on (say, for a new
cabinet), you’ll know what’s behind it.
The location of your wiring closet
In the best-case scenario, you can create a dedicated room for your network-
ing equipment — a central wiring closet just like those in modern offices and
other commercial buildings. If we were starting a home from scratch, we’d
design the wiring closet as follows:
 On the main floor of the house.
 Near an outside wall for easy interconnection to incoming service feeds.
 Above an accessible part of the basement (if we have a basement).
28
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

 With adequate lighting, ventilation, and climate protection (not in the
garage, in other words). Electronic gear generates heat, so if you live
south of the Arctic Circle, it’s a good idea to have air-conditioning vents
in the wiring closet.
 With adequate AC power-line receptacles to power devices such as
video amplifiers, Ethernet hubs, and VoIP phone systems.
Such a closet needn’t be too large — something between a standard coat closet
and a small walk-in closet. A lot of your gear will go in a wall-mounted struc-
tured wiring system — what most manufacturers call the panel. Some, however,
might go on shelving or in a rack. A typical rack has a 2-by-2-foot footprint.
Of course, the vast majority of home builders or remodelers don’t have the
luxury of adding this kind of dedicated space for a network wiring closet. In
these cases, some other part of the house has to do double duty as your
wiring closet. Here are some locations to consider:
 The utility room or laundry room: The biggest disadvantage of this
location is the potential for high humidity, so make sure your clothes
dryer is well ventilated to the outdoors. (And take steps to keep all the
dryer lint from building up on your equipment!)
 A protected garage: The potential for dust and extreme temperatures
may make this location less than optimal for some homes.
 The basement: A basement can be a good location because it’s easy to
run wires through a drop ceiling, but keep in mind that basements can
be both dusty and damp.
 A weather-protected outdoor closet: This location is a last resort, but it
could be acceptable if you live in a mild climate. However, we don’t rec-
ommend putting any active electronics, such as Ethernet hubs or phone
systems, out here.
The natural enemies of electrical and electronic equipment are moisture, dust,
and temperature extremes, so locations that may work for someone in Florida
or California may not make sense for those in North Dakota or Arizona.
Feeding Audio and Video from 
the Media Center
Most network systems in your house — specifically, the data wiring, phone
wiring, and coaxial video-distribution wiring — are best located in a wiring
closet. The parts of your network that provide the audio and video signals that
you send through your house, however, are more appropriately centralized in
the room where you use them the most. We call this area the media center.
29
Chapter 2: Zen and the Art of Whole-Home Networking

For most people, the media center is also their home theater, the place where
the fancy surround-sound audio receiver, the biggest and best TV monitor,
and the handcrafted, wood-veneered, titanium-woofer speakers all live.
The contents of your media center
Chances are, you want to be able to quickly access your CD/DVD player
(unless it’s one of those DVD jukeboxes that holds 200 DVD/CDs or an MP3
home server) and your video source equipment (such as the VCR and DVD
player) to change discs or tapes and for local (in-room) listening and viewing.
So it makes sense to locate your audio network and the source equipment for
your video network in a different place than the rest of your wiring closet. We
like to call this location the media center, but if that sounds a bit too much
like CNN Central in Atlanta, you can call it the “room with all the fun toys.”
What goes into a media center? All your audio and video equipment:
 Video source devices: set-top boxes, VCRs, DVDs, PVRs, and laserdisc play-
ers — and Internet-based devices such as an Apple TV (see Chapter 7)
 Audio source devices: CD players, MP3 players such as iPods, radio
tuners, satellite radio receivers such as XM or Sirius, and turntables (see
Chapter 8)
 Audio amplifiers and controllers for your whole-home audio system (see
Chapter 8)
 Impedance-matching panels for audio amplifiers (see Chapter 8)
 Connecting blocks and emitters from your IR control network or central-
ized controller panels for a CAT-5e/6 audio/video controller system (see
Chapter 19)
Your main video-distribution panel doesn’t go in the media center — just the
source equipment and a modulator or other distribution device that can dis-
tribute signals back over your two-way coaxial or other cabling network (such
as a CAT-5e/6 video distribution system) to the panel in the wiring closet.
In addition to the audio/video equipment that you’re distributing across your
network, you want to have all the stuff needed to do local listening and view-
ing in your media center. In other words, a television or video monitor, speak-
ers, and a surround-sound receiver or a controller/amplifier system should
also be in this room.
30
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

Setting up your media center
Locating all this gear and related wiring discreetly in your media center can be
a bit problematic. This room, unlike a wiring closet, is a public space in your
house, not necessarily a place where you can hide unsightly bundles of wire
and racks of equipment. So your aesthetic requirements will be a bit higher.
The best solution is to design the room with an enclosed equipment-and-
connection area. This is where you would put your whole-home equipment —
the equipment that you don’t need to access to watch a program or listen to
something — such as impedance-matching equipment and modulators. Your
equipment-and-connection area could be a well-ventilated closet. We’ve seen
sophisticated setups with a false wall behind the TV and equipment racks to
allow access to the backs of all of the gear. If you can’t find a separate space for
your whole-home equipment, you can connect all your outgoing speaker wires
and IR or CAT-5e/6 control cables to wall outlets behind your equipment rack,
and then use short cables to connect these outlets to the equipment itself.
If you can’t find an aesthetically pleasing way of getting all this stuff in 
your media center, you might consider putting the audio-amplification and 
impedance-matching equipment in your wiring closet (along with your 
whole-house speaker wire connections). Use the shortest run possible of
high-quality, shielded audio interconnects to connect these amps to the
audio source equipment back in your media center.
31
Chapter 2: Zen and the Art of Whole-Home Networking
Other central hubs
With the explosion of PCs and other computing
gear in the home, you might want to create a
computing epicenter around which you’ll gather
your key centralized computing devices. Your
home server might go here, as well as special-
ized backup gear, switching for local multiple
PCs, special audio gear for these PCs, and
more. For instance, Danny’s attic has four PCs
for multiplayer gaming, and he uses a local hub
to optimize the communications among these
four machines while efficiently linking to the
central hub in the basement as well as to the
Media Center hub. You can create a localized
hub just about anywhere in your home where
you’ll have a big concentration of networked
gear. Most manufacturers of home cabling sys-
tems (discussed in the “Makers of all-in-one
systems” section) offer smaller versions of their
panels and other gear designed for such appli-
cations. Remember, you don’t have to subdivide
your wiring, but if you have specialized needs
(like Danny’s computer lab) you might want to.

Choosing Cables
After electrical wiring, telephone-type wiring (called twisted pair) is the most
common type of wire in home networks. This category of cabling does more
than just carry telephone signals. Twisted-pair cabling is the basis of most
computer LANs and can be used to carry other data, such as audio and video
signals, in your home network. (The wires are twisted inside a sheath — you
can’t see the twisting except to note slight bumps at regular intervals in the
cabling.)
The wiring in modern phone and LAN systems is twisted for a reason
(besides the fact that colored wires woven together look pretty). Through
some magical properties of physics, the interweaving of the wires protects
against electrical interference. No interference means no cross talk, which
occurs when, for example, the fax transmission on line one bleeds through to
the voice call on line two.
You usually find twisted-pair phone and data wiring in a cable jacket that has
no electrical shielding. Those in the know refer to it as UTP, or unshielded
twisted pair.
Older homes were usually wired with quad cable, a flat, untwisted cable that
contains two pairs of wires, sufficient for carrying two phone lines. This type
32
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 
Fiber-optic faux pas?
Perhaps you’ve been skipping around the book,
reading up on the stuff that goes into all the dif-
ferent networks in a home, and you’ve been
scratching your head and wondering why you
can’t find any mention about installing fiber-
optic cabling in the home.
Well . . . we didn’t forget about it. We don’t rec-
ommend installing fiber in the home, mainly
because somewhere around zero applications
for fiber are available among all the thousands
of consumer electronics devices sold today.
The only place that fiber ever comes into play is
for some specialized digital audio intercon-
nects, the kind used to connect CD and DVD
players to external digital-to-analog converters
(such as the ones inside fancy home-theater
receivers).
But isn’t fiber the future — and isn’t this book all
about taking a long-term view? The answers to
those questions are “Yes” and “Yes, but . . .”
Someday, fiber-optic cable may be the most
common cabling for connecting home audio,
video, data, and phone networks.
We do recommend that you give yourself a
head start by designing your home in such a
way that adding new cable types such as fiber
will be easier when the time comes. But for
now, we think that running fiber in a home is a
waste of time and money.

of wiring is much more susceptible to interference and cross talk and is ill-
suited for modern, high-speed communications and networking. If you cur-
rently have quad cable, our advice is to replace it.
Newer homes are generally wired for telephone service with a round cable
(usually in a gray jacket) that contains two twisted pairs of wires (four con-
ductors). This cabling is much less prone to interference problems, and most
types can carry up to two POTS or ISDN phone lines (described in more
detail in Chapter 10) in their native mode. In general, this type of cable is not
adequate for truly high-speed data networks but is perfectly adequate for dis-
tributing telephone and low-speed analog data service throughout your
house. Although these cables are just fine for telephone service, they might
not support the most sophisticated phone systems, such as a VoIP PBX or a
digital key phone system. In these cases, you’ll want to use CAT-5e/6 cabling
(which we discuss in the next section) rather than your old phone wires.
Cable categories
UTP cables are rated by their category, or the measure of the cable’s band-
width capacity, as shown in Table 2-1. Higher-rated cables can handle higher-
speed data networks. Rated cables are usually referred to as CAT-x, where x is
the category rating. For example, Category 5e cable is CAT-5e.
Table 2-1
Category Ratings of UTP Cabling
Cable Rating
Performance Rating
Category 1
No performance criteria
Category 2
Rated to 1 MHz (used for telephone wiring)
Category 3
Rated to 16 MHz (used for Ethernet 10BaseT)
Category 4
Rated to 20 MHz (used for 10BaseT)
Category 5
Rated to 100 MHz (used for 100BaseT, 10BaseT)
Category 5e
Rated to100 MHz (used for 1000 BaseT, 100BaseT,
10BaseT)
Category 6
Rated to100 MHz (used for 1000 BaseT, 100BaseT,
10BaseT)
As a baseline for any “smart home” we recommend that you choose Category
5e (CAT-5e) or Category-6 (CAT-6) UTP data-grade wiring. This wire doesn’t
cost much more than the nonrated variety, and it’s better suited to the high-
speed technologies that your phone lines may carry, such as digital subscriber
33
Chapter 2: Zen and the Art of Whole-Home Networking

line (DSL) data connections (see Chapter 13 for more about DSL). CAT-5e and
CAT-6, the highest-rated UTP cabling systems generally available on the
market as we write, can carry Fast and Gigabit Ethernet networks capable of
data rates of 100 Mbps and 1000 Mbps, respectively. This cable can also
handle anything a lower-rated UTP cable does, such as carrying telephone
signals.
As we write this book, CAT-5e is being supplanted by CAT-6 in the market-
place, but for your typical home applications either one will do. Smart people
use nothing less than CAT-5e/6 in their homes — even if they are only running
a regular phone line. Don’t go cheap and get CAT-3 or another lesser-grade
wiring.
If you peruse the brochures and Web sites of cable manufacturers and
resellers, you may run across someone who is selling UTP cables that appear
to have a higher rating than CAT-5e or CAT-6. Some cable manufacturers are
selling proprietary CAT-7 cabling systems that promise even greater perfor-
mance. These higher-rated cables may indeed be capable of carrying even
higher-speed networks than CAT-6, but right now no standard ensures that
one company’s CAT-7 — or whatever they may call it — will carry the same
amount of data as another company’s.
A final comment: Although your house has other cables, especially the RG-6
cabling we discuss in Chapters 6 and 7, UTP cabling gets most of the attention
because there are so many types and because the trend in home-networking
circles is to use CAT-5e/6 for just about everything. As the Ethernet and IP
protocols continue to penetrate the home, more and more applications will
ride on this CAT-5e/6 backbone. Other forms of cabling have different classes
and performance characteristics but are more application specific. Coaxial
cabling, for instance, is used by many telephone companies to route video
around the home. We discuss these cables in turn in their respective sections
in this book.
While the trend is to use more UTP telephone/data cabling for everything in
your home, we’re still far from that. Here are some ideas about other cabling
you’ll need to complete your home networking layout:
 Coaxial cabling: This is the cabling used for TV antennas, cable TV, and
satellite TV. The two most common types of cabling are RG-6 and RG-59,
with RG-59 being the lesser grade. We recommend RG-6 throughout the
house to maximize your options. RG-59 is typically used for very short
connections, such as from your VCR to your TV.
 Security cabling: Most security (alarm) systems use their own special
cabling to connect sensors back to the alarm panel. We discuss this
cabling in Chapter 18.
 Audio speaker cabling: We’ll get into the specifics of all sorts of audio
cables in Chapter 9, but when you are putting audio cabling in the walls,
look to use at least 16 gauge speaker wires rated for in-wall usage.

Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

Patch me in!
The many cables that run through your house can be a big mess when you
get to the point where you want to hook them up with the telephone com-
pany, the cable company, or something else. Fortunately, you can use a patch
panel (also called a terminal block or punchdown block) to neatly patch
together telephone, data, security and other application lines.
A patch panel is a wall-mounted piece of equipment that serves as a junction
point for lines. Inbound lines from various outside-of-house sources are con-
nected to terminals in the patch panel. For instance, you connect telephone
lines from your NID into one side of the patch panel. Then, all your in-home
distribution lines are connected to another set of terminals. To connect a par-
ticular in-house line to your home telephone line, for instance, you would
“patch” the two terminals with — you guessed it — a patch cable, a process
known as bridging, or cross-connecting.
For video cable wiring (typically RG-6 coaxial cable), the patch panel is usu-
ally called a distribution hub. But the principles are the same: lines in and
lines out. We discuss distribution hubs in detail in Chapter 6.
35
Chapter 2: Zen and the Art of Whole-Home Networking
The NID
When you’re talking telephone cabling, you
might hear someone mention NID (network
interface device), SID (service interface
device), or some other similar term. A network
interface device is a small plastic box that
serves as the point of demarcation between
your home’s telephone networks and your ser-
vice provider’s network. Incoming phone lines
connect to one side of the NID, terminating
within a locked portion of the box (only the
phone company’s techs are allowed in there).
This side of the NID is electrically connected to
the consumer side of the NID, where your inter-
nal phone wiring begins.
The NID is part of a standard telephone-com-
pany line installation. Its demarcation function
makes the NID a significant part of a phone net-
work. Everything on the telephone company’s
side of the NID (all the way back to their central
telephone-switching office) is their responsibil-
ity to maintain and repair. The consumer side of
the NID is your inside wiring, and if something
goes awry, you pay for its repair.
Many local telephone companies offer inex-
pensive inside-wiring-repair policies that they
tack onto your phone bill every month. If some-
thing goes wrong with your inside wiring, the
phone company sends someone out to trouble-
shoot and repair the problem for free. This 
service can be a good deal if you have an older
house.
As cable and telephone companies bundle
more services, this clean demarcation is going
away because they are managing more things
inside the home, such as the cabling for Internet
Protocol TV (IPTV) and wireless/wireline com-
bined products.

Patch panels come in all sorts of styles. If you purchase one of the modular
distribution systems we discuss later in this chapter, you are likely to have an
RJ-11, RJ-45, F-connector or other common cable plug. This makes it easy for
you to cross link your sources with your destinations. Some ports on your
patch panel may support combinations of lines. For instance, if you have four
telephone lines coming into your home, you might have one jack that you 
can plug a patch cable into a jack that combines all four pairs in one eight-
conductor connection. Note that you’ll hear us discuss home runs throughout
the book. This means that the cable is run directly from the remote jack back
to this centrally homed location.
You can get patch panels for lots of varied cables or ones for a specific type of
cable (say for telephone or data applications). Depending on your installer and
how much you want to spend, a patch panel can have the following interfaces:
 Pole and nut terminal interfaces: You unscrew the nut, put the wire in,
and screw the nut back in.
 Port interfaces: You plug the individual runs of phone wire directly into
modular jacks, or screw your F-connector from your coax into a female
F-connector endpoint.
 Punchdown interface: You push the wire into the receptacles by using a
punchdown tool. This tool simultaneously strips the wire of its insulation
and connects the wire electrically to the panel.
Some patch panels could have combinations of the preceding. Figure 2-1
shows a Leviton patch panel with RJ-11, RJ-45, and F-connectors.
CAT-5e/6 cable can be used for many things (such as phones, computer net-
works, and audio/video networks). We — and just about everyone else in the
home-networking world — recommend that you run at least two CAT-5e/6
cables to every significant room in your house (every place but bathrooms
and closets). This setup gives you flexibility because each cable can be
reconnected to different networks back at the patch panel. So a cable that
today provides extra voice outlets in a bedroom can be reconfigured to con-
nect to your data LAN by simply changing the termination of the cable in
your panel from the phone network to the data network.
Unlike the main network UTP cabling, which you buy in bulk and run inside
your walls, patch cables are usually purchased in precut lengths (of a few feet)
with the connectors already attached. If you use a structured prewiring system,
such as those offered by Leviton (www.leviton.com), the patch panels and
distribution panels are housed in the central wiring hub. These wiring hubs are
modular, so you can easily add patch panels or distribution panels as you
expand your network. We talk more about these systems shortly.

Jacks and plugs for everyone
For the past 30 years or so, telephone and coaxial cable wires have been
using standardized connectors — plugs and jacks — to connect equipment to
the wiring infrastructure. For UTP cables, these modular connectors come in
three physical variants, which look basically the same but come in different
widths to accommodate more wires (or positions):
 Four-position jack and plug: Connects handsets to telephones.
 Six-position jack and plug: Handles one, two, or three lines, which
means that two, four, or six wires, respectively, terminate in the jack.
Most of these jacks on our phones have only four wires used in the six
positions, but you can see six positions if you look closely.
 Eight-position jack and plugs: Used for data applications such as
Ethernet and other computer LANs; not normally used for phones.
Businesses sometime use 25-pair jack and plugs as well, but you’re not likely
to need or see these in your house.
We recommend that you use eight-position jacks — not six — throughout
your home so that the jacks can be used for voice or data or whatever. Most
consumer phone equipment, whether it be one-, two-, or three-line capable,
can use RJ-45 outlets for these RJ-11 standard connectors.
Beyond physical size, the communications industry also differentiates jacks
by their configuration (how many wires are connected to them). You may see
documentation referring to jacks and plugs as
 RJ-11: Two wires connected for a single-line connection
 RJ-14: Four wires connected for a two-line connection
 RJ-25: Six wires connected for a three-line connection
 RJ-45: Eight wires connected for data LAN (wider than phone jacks)
The RJ-45 jack/plug is the one you will use for most smart home applications
such as computer networks (LANs), Voice over IP (VoIP) phones, Ethernet-
based audio- and video-distribution systems, and remote-control keypads for
your audio/video system. You can also plug phones (with their smaller RJ-11
or RJ-14 jacks) into an RJ-45 outlet.
Security systems use a special kind of RJ jack called the RJ-31X. We talk about
this jack in Part V, which covers home-security systems.
All of this “RJ-this” and “RJ-that” talk quickly gets confusing. Even the experts
get confused because an RJ-11 can mean different things, depending on whether
you’re following an old Bell Telephone standard, a Telecommunications
38
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

Industry Association (TIA) standard, or something else. We usually refer to six-
position phone jacks as RJ-11s, regardless of how many wires are connected,
and eight-position jacks as RJ-45s. That’s the way most people talk, regardless of
what the standards say.
Like all cable connectors, RJ-connectors come in both male and female vari-
eties. We leave the reasons for naming each variety to your own imagination,
but we will tell you that you find the male version of the connector on the
end of a cable and the female connector on wall outlets or inside equipment
such as your PC.
You’ll also run into some similar video-cable options — there are cable con-
nectors, but far fewer of them, and we discuss those in Chapter 6.
Modular wall outlets
The endpoints of your telephone network are the wall outlets in each room.
These wall plates have holes that are populated with modular connections
corresponding to what you want to terminate — such as a phone, data, or
cable connection.
Although you can find wall plates equipped with RJ-11 modular jacks (and
you can plug any of your old telephone equipment into these), RJ-11 jacks are
not going to be much good if you want to change the use of the outlets. We
recommend that you install RJ-45 outlets everywhere — remember that your
standard RJ-11 modular phone connectors will work fine in them.
39
Chapter 2: Zen and the Art of Whole-Home Networking
Accessorize your phone network
A range of small, useful accessories are handy
with your home-wiring network, including the
following:
 1-to-2 splitter jack: This jack takes a single
RJ-14 or RJ-45 connection (which has two
pairs of wire) and splits it into two single-
pair RJ-11 or RJ-45 connections so that you
can connect two devices.
 2-jack modular adapter: This adapter takes
a single RJ-14 or RJ-45 connection and
splits it into two RJ-14 or RJ-45 connec-
tions, allowing you to have two two-line
phones sharing the same wall jack, for
instance. You can readily find three- and
five-jack versions as well.
 Inline coupler: This accessory connects
two four-wire phone cords, which is great
when you have to run an extra-long dis-
tance across the room. For example, you
can use an inline coupler to connect two
six-foot telephone cords to get one twelve-
foot cord.
These gadgets offer more flexibility when you
find that your wired network doesn’t quite give
you exactly what you want. Grab a handful and
keep them in your toolbox — you’ll need them.

When you’re choosing phone wall outlets for a room, consider what other
home-network outlets you’ll need in the same location. You can find many
modular outlets that take up a double- or triple-gang-sized junction box (a
single gang, which we talk about in Chapter 7, is the size of a standard light
switch or wall outlet) and allow you to connect data and video networks all in
one large outlet.
Investigating All-in-One Wiring Solutions
We believe that most homeowners want to install a home network that can
handle, at a minimum, the three main types of network applications: tele-
phone, data, and video. Most major wiring and network infrastructure ven-
dors believe this, too, and offer all-in-one structured cabling systems. With
these systems, a single vendor supplies (and in many cases, installs) a com-
plete, integrated home-networking infrastructure.
Structured cabling systems
Most structured cabling systems for the home are offshoots of similar (and
more complicated) packages of hardware and wiring that networking system
vendors have been offering their corporate customers for years. The concept
is simple: go to the vendor, tell them your requirements, and get an off-the-
shelf, soup-to-nuts system ready for installation.
For the most part, structured cabling systems are made up of the same parts
that you’d use if you were building separate home networks by yourself.
Specifically, you’ll find that most contain the following components:
 A service center: Combines phone and data patch panels and a video
distribution center in a single unit — making for a neater installation.
Service centers are usually modular, wall-mounted components.
 All-in-one cables: Cabling that combines telephone and data cabling and
coaxial cable for video in a single cable jacket. Some systems even
include fiber-optic cables in the same jacket. (See the “Fiber-optic faux
pas?” sidebar for our opinion on the matter.)
 Customized wall outlet plates: Matched up with the all-in-one cable,
these faceplates provide modular connectors for your phone, data, and
video outlets.
As you can see, nothing about these systems is different than the pieces
you’d install if you were designing your own home networks. They’re simply
put together in one big kit to facilitate buying, designing, and installing your
network infrastructure.
40
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

Where all-in-one systems work 
(and don’t work)
If you read the product literature from most manufacturers (we tell you where
to find it in just a moment), you get the impression that a structured cabling
system can do everything but clean the kitchen sink. However, some of the
capabilities and applications listed for these systems are based on forward-
looking marketing projections rather than on what you can actually do now.
We mention this not to disparage the structured cabling system but to warn
you that installing one may not take care of all your home-networking needs.
For example, the following applications are usually not easily supported by
most structured systems:
 Alarm systems: Although some security features, such as security cam-
eras, can fit in a structured cabling system, a full-featured, monitored,
hardwired security system requires its own wiring — usually installed by
a registered professional installer. Structured wiring systems allow you
to interface the alarm to an outgoing telephone system for monitoring.
 Whole-home multizone hi-fi audio: You can add components to your
structured wiring system to distribute single-zone audio throughout
your home (meaning everyone hears the same thing everywhere), but
many don’t include the speaker wiring and distribution systems to get
hi-fi multizone audio around your home (which allows you to send differ-
ent audio sources to different parts of the house simultaneously).
So, you’re probably thinking, what do these systems support? Quite a lot,
actually. At a bare minimum, a structured cabling system should provide:
 A flexible telephone network using high-quality, unshielded twisted-
pair (UTP) phone cabling and a modular, configurable termination
system at the service center.
 A computer network of CAT-5e/6 UTP cabling for data networking.
 A centrally distributed coaxial cable (usually RG6) network for distrib-
uting video signals.
 An all-in-one modular termination panel to neatly terminate all this
network wiring in your wiring closet.
You’ll find structured systems capable of handling additional applications
such as alarms, hi-fi audio, and infrared networking as standards supporting
such connections become popular.

Hints for Designing a Futureproofed
Home
Here’s a collection of some of our best tips for your home adventure:
 Anticipate your needs: You need to think, think, think when planning
your home network. A smart home is only as good as your design. And it
will cost you a bundle to add something later that you forgot. We know
it’s hard — you never know where you’re going to end up. (Ask Danny,
he has two sets of twins.)
 Read everything: Different publications and books have different per-
spectives and goals, and they each add a different aspect to your plan-
ning. So, read . . . a lot.
 Overdo it: You start working at home and need a home office. So does
your spouse. You have more kids. You need more computers. You add a
wing to the house. Running the bare minimum of wires only to rooms
42
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

that you’re sure will need them is not always enough. We admit that we
overbuilt our houses. There, we said it. We overbuilt. Why? Because we
believe in futureproofing our homes. Can you get by with other options?
Yes. Can you add later? Yes, at more cost. Is it easier to do it up front?
Oh yes! So overdo it. Run that extra wire.
 Leave room for expansion: No matter how much you believe that you’ll
think of everything upfront, you won’t. Plan for expansion. If you have a
choice of two models, and one is slightly larger, go with the larger one.
Will this add cost up front? Absolutely — but it will save you money
down the road.
 Run conduits: Think about access and flexibility for future growth when
you run your wires. You never know when you’re going to have to run
more cable for some reason or another. Run PVC conduits between
floors and in the walls, instead of just running wire, so you can add more
cable in the future if you need to. Be cognizant of elbows in these PVC
runs — cable, especially thicker cable, does not travel well around cor-
ners. Figure 2-2 shows how this might work. Leave pull cords in the con-
duit. (Pull cords are cords that you use to pull cables through that
conduit.) Also be careful about what you run in the same conduit —
some signals running inside cables can interfere with each other. Never
run electrical wiring inside these PVC conduits no matter how much
money it saves you.
If you’re planning on blowing foam insulation into your house, running
conduits is even more critical. Most foam insulation is blown into the
wall space after the wiring is completed, so you don’t get a lot of second
chances if you don’t run PVC.

Chapter 2: Zen and the Art of Whole-Home Networking

 Don’t forget the power: Nothing’s worse than buying the latest and
greatest telephone, bringing it home, plugging the telephone cable in,
and then realizing there’s no electrical outlet anywhere nearby. Argh!
When you renovate your house or build your new home, you need to
talk to your electrician and cabling contractor about the location of elec-
trical outlets. Most electrical outlets are installed every so many feet
along the wall (per electrical regulations) and aren’t coordinated with
your phone lines or other smart devices.
In areas that will have lots of electronic gear, such as the home office or
home theater, have your electrician run dedicated circuits. There’s nothing
worse than finding out — a month after you’ve finished your network —
that plugging the vacuum cleaner into that outlet in the foyer knocks out
the circuit breaker in your home office because the electrician put them on
the same circuit.
 Don’t get fooled by all-in-one, all the time: A big theme in home net-
working, particularly home automation, is to find a single solution that
does everything. True, integration is good and something to look at seri-
ously. But all-in-one solutions are also sometimes the lowest common
denominator. Hard-core stereo buffs tend to go with the best-of-breed
approach. They buy a tuner from one manufacturer, a CD/DVD player
from another, and an amplifier from yet another for a reason: The indi-
vidual elements have enough to offer on their own to make the hassle of
interconnecting them worthwhile. So look at individual options as well
as overall solutions in your buying process.
 Be creative: Planning a smart home is an opportunity to have fun and be
creative. The infrastructure you put in place will enable the fun stuff, but
it won’t create it. Only by hanging neat technologies off the endpoints of
that infrastructure will you see the fruits of your efforts. You’re creating
an investment. When you go to sell your home, its unique attributes will
provide value for the buyer.
Racking It Up
Some things about your smart home you won’t appreciate fully until you use
them over and over. Equipment racks are like that — they sound metallic and
boring, but you will be oh so glad you bought one.
An equipment rack complements your wiring hub. The structured wiring
solutions we discuss in this book give you a means to manage all the wires
coming in to, out of, and around your house. However, wiring panels can
house only a few very small pieces of networking gear, such as routers or
switches — these panels were not made to house a DirecTV receiver or a
home server or other large devices.
44
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

That chore falls to an equipment rack. If you’ve ever seen a computer room
or a high-end home theater, you’ve probably seen a vertical bank of comput-
ers and other gear housed in an equipment rack. The boom of home enter-
tainment has presented an opportunity for equipment rack vendors to enter
the consumer space with racking options for residential use.
As the types of gear become more complex and as new wiring options come
on the market, you’re going to have to access the rear panels of your equip-
ment and move wiring around. Home equipment racks help you store your
equipment, keep it cool, and manage all the wiring behind the gear. Don’t be
fooled by cheap racks. You are going to place a lot of expensive gear in this
rack, and a rack should last you a lifetime.
It used to be that you could stack all your equipment. That was okay until
equipment started having more energy-hogging processors and other compo-
nents that generate a lot of heat. Now if you stack your gear, you will burn out
components, particularly if you put a PC in your cabinet. (DVD players are
especially susceptible to heat damage.) You need to space the equipment and
you need a cooling strategy for your gear. The right rack can solve these
problems.
Get a rack that does the following:
 Slides: Unless you have a special situation where you have rear access
to your rack, say from a side room, changing cables in the back of your
equipment is complicated. You’ll have to pull equipment forward to
reconfigure jacks, and this can disconnect your other lines at the same
time. A sliding rack brings the equipment forward, out of your cabinet,
so you can access the rear panels.
 Rotates: A bonus is if the rack rotates once out of the cabinet, so you
can maintain your connections. Once you’ve owned a rotating rack,
you’ll never go back!
 Cools: Don’t buy a racking system without a built-in cooling system.
Some offer the ability to connect several fans to the rack’s power
system, and automatically turn them on and off based on temperature.
 Powers: Your racking system should have a means to connect to multi-
ple power bars so all your power cables can be nicely managed. The
best power bars have slide-on stabilizing clips that make sure your
power plugs don’t come out of the power bar. Note: These power bars
typically are not surge protectors — they are power-cable-management
devices designed to help you keep all your cables in order. You will still
want to route these into a surge protector at some point. You can buy
high-end rack-mounted power protection that makes sure your power
levels remain constant in your entertainment center.
45
Chapter 2: Zen and the Art of Whole-Home Networking

If you have a small space that’s shared with other things and you need to be
able to move around equipment, consider putting the rack on wheels.
When Danny was outfitting his new home theater, he asked a lot of people
about racking because the market for residential racking systems was still
new. Everyone pointed him to Middle Atlantic Products, Inc. (www.middle
atlantic.com). Danny got a Middle Atlantic ASR-HD-42 system, which can
hold up to 350 pounds of equipment, has adjustable shelves, and rotates 60º
when extended out from the cabinet. (See Figure 2-3.) It has ventilated
shelves, power and cooling management options, and — if you believe
Danny’s raves — is the best-looking, best-made residential equipment rack on
the market (which Pat believes, but never wants to give in so easily to Danny
on such things).
Racks can be pricey — you can spend more than $1000 on a high-end racking
system. But if you go cheap here, you could lose much more than that in
equipment. This is simply one area to invest in for the long haul.

Neat Phone Tricks
When you define a phone in its historical sense — that is, a device with a
handset and a base unit — lots of options are available to the home net-
worker. You can
 Go multiline: Why install a second home-phone line that goes only to
one phone? With the proper wiring, you could access that second line
from any outlet in the house. Two lines not enough? How about three,
four, or more lines?
 Get distinctive: How about giving all the members of the household
their own distinctive ringing tones so that they know who the call is for
when the phone rings? You can use certain phone company features
along with your home-phone network to avoid buying extra phone lines
for your household.
 Get conferenced: Although it may sound corporate, consumer-grade
conferencing systems make sense if the speakerphones of most phones
don’t do the trick.
 Get transferred: With a home-phone system, you can transfer calls
around the house. Know that your spouse is in the garage? Send the call
there.
 Intercom someone: A home-phone system is a great way to get a home-
wide intercom system. You can access different rooms by entering differ-
ent extensions. And you can monitor rooms, too. By tying the system to
your front door, you can have visitors leave a message on your phone
system when you’re not home.
 Answer the door: Use one of the new Doorcom systems to answer the
door when you’re away. These systems have a doorbell, speakerphone,
and microphone — and with a smart home, they can call you where
you’re vacationing to let you speak with the person at the door through
the telephone.
 Get video: With a videophone, you can see who you’re talking to.
(Depending on the time of day, that may or may not be a good thing.)
Some videophones link up with your TV set for even better viewing but
still use regular phone lines.
 Go wireless: A home phone is only as good as the length of its cord, but
cordless phones give you freedom when you need to run all over the
house. That’s not new. But what is new is the convergence of cordless
base stations with cellular or digital mobile phones. These so-called
dual-mode phones allow you to talk all you want for free (at least no 
48
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

airtime charges) when you’re near your base station, but they switch
over to cellular or PCS frequencies when you leave your home. The
phone — and your phone number — goes with you wherever you go.
And lately, with the emergence of a lot of Wi-Fi (wireless computer net-
work system) hot spots around the country and in homes, new multi-
mode phones enable you to make free or low-cost calls over the Wi-Fi
connection (and the Internet) when they’re in range — including at home.
 Control your home network: Some of the leading home-automation sys-
tems use the telephone as the interface to their system, using voice
recognition and tone input to drive things around your house. Imagine
calling your house and telling it to turn on the fire, turn down the lights,
and let your spouse figure out the rest!
 Get some sleep: You can program your home-telephone system to auto-
matically route inbound calls to an answering machine without ringing
any of the phones in the house. Or you can selectively ring only certain
phones in certain places.
With the convergence of the computer and telephone realms, telephones look
and act more like computers, and computers work more like phones. Some
phones can send and receive e-mail as well as send faxes. Screen phones
allow you to do everything from home banking to grocery shopping from the
comfort of your nearest phone outlet. You can make phone calls from your
PC through a microphone and a headset, or watch the called party on your
computer screen. A properly designed home network will let you do what-
ever you want with any of these devices.
Entertainment Everywhere
Your home-entertainment system can cost a lot of money, but when you go 
to your bedroom at night, that stack of electronics equipment in the living
room is pretty much useless. A home network allows you to tap into that
media complex instead of duplicating it in each room. A great home network
will take that showcase of an entertainment center and distribute it around
the house. That makes each room a showcase.
A smart home allows you to
 Roam the house: Want to watch a movie stored on your Media Center
PC in your bedroom or watch CNN while cooking dinner? By running
your home network to these rooms, you can distribute the audio and
video signals to these locations as easily as you route the signal to your
TV set in the living room.
49
Chapter 3: Cool Stuff Home Networks Can Do

 Be flexible: Want to watch the beginning of a DVD in the living room but
watch the end of the movie in the bedroom? No longer are you a slave to
where a particular device (such as a DVD player) is located.
 Be creative: How about using the picture-in-picture capability of your
TV set to monitor the kids in the playroom while you’re watching HBO?
By linking your video-monitoring capability with your television systems,
you can have the best of both worlds.
 Stay sane: Want to listen to holiday music over your intercom system,
instead of blasting the stereo loud enough on the first floor so that you
can hear it in your office on the third floor?
 Focus your investments: By making the most use of the devices you have,
you can focus future investments on only those pieces that enable you to
take maximum advantage of your existing equipment. Already have a DVD
player, Blu-Ray player, DSS receiver, tape deck, CD player, and receiver?
Great. Put your money into a great display or widescreen TV, and let those
other devices drive the new video capabilities over the home network.
Because video is such a critical feature of most households, it makes sense to
make sure that you can maximize your pleasure through an entertainment
network in your home.
Save Energy — and Money Too
When you network devices in your home, you build value. Part of that value
is saving money. Following are some tasks that a smart home can perform
that will save you money over the long term:
 Motorize window coverings: Large picture windows can hike the tem-
perature of your house by several degrees, making the air conditioning
work more often and harder — thus boosting bills. Motorized window
coverings help keep your utility bills under control. Window coverings
also save money by blocking out ultraviolet rays, which fade your 
upholstery and carpeting. You can control your coverings in many 
ways, including handheld remote controls, manual control from wall
switch locations, timer controls, and even weather controls (for exam-
ple, temperature sensors that close the blinds when it’s hot or cold).
 Control thermostats: You can save a significant amount on your 
heating and cooling bills if you better coordinate your heating and air-
conditioning systems. You can set up thermostats so that temperature
settings change based on the time of day and the day of the week. You
can also change settings based on factors such as energy costs, the
weather, and occupancy.
50
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

 Control heaters and water pumps: Hot-water heaters and hot-water cir-
culation pumps are big consumers of power. To save power, turn them
on and off according to a schedule.
 Control gas usage: If you’re like Danny, you forget to turn off your gas
grill, and it runs all night until the tank runs out of gas sometime during
the next few days. Some advanced built-in outdoor grills have sophisti-
cated controls. If the grill has an electric component, it can be con-
trolled. The same is true for gas fireplaces.
 Manage when you’re away: When you go to work, you can tell your
house to go into a user-defined away mode. This can mean closing drapes,
lowering (or raising) temperatures, shutting off lights, and more. If you
go away on vacation, your smart home can turn lights on and off to
better simulate someone being home.
Internet Outlets
For years, getting connected meant that you were having a phone line installed.
Today, it means getting hooked up to the Internet. We probably don’t need to
tell you how important having a connection to the online world has become
to most people. And it’s not just for Web surfing or e-mail these days. Tens of
millions of people use Instant Messaging (IM) programs on a daily basis, mil-
lions more use the Internet for making phone calls, and still millions more use
social networking sites (such as Facebook.com and Myspace.com) for keep-
ing in touch with friends around the world. Communications aren’t the only
thing people are using the Internet for — more and more entertainment con-
tent (such as music, TV, and movies) come into our homes over the Internet
connection as well.
A smart home turns electrical, telephone, cable, and other wired interfaces
into Internet outlets — tunnels through your brick and mortar to the wired
world beyond. And smart homes don’t use just wireline access. They can be
wireless, too.
With a smart home, you can
 Network your computing resources: Why have a printer at each home
workstation when printers are not used that much? Share one printer,
one scanner, and Internet access among multiple devices to save money
and make your overall data LAN simpler.
 Simultaneously access the Internet: Work in your office downstairs,
accessing the corporate internal network (intranet). Your spouse could
be in the living room on the couch ordering groceries from the local 
51
Chapter 3: Cool Stuff Home Networks Can Do

grocery store’s online Web site. Your 12-year-old son could be upstairs
in his bedroom playing Everquest on a multiplayer Internet network.
And your studious 10-year-old daughter might be accessing her school’s
extranet, working on homework with other kids. All this could happen at
the same time, over the same network.
 Make and receive phone calls through the Internet: With the right end-
point equipment, you can send and receive phone calls over the Internet.
You make Internet phone calls with your PC, an adapter for your phone,
an adapter for your fax machine, a videophone, or a special Internet 
telephony appliance (that essentially looks like a phone). Any of these
things will allow you to communicate over the Internet, for free (or
nearly so), with parties conceivably very far away.
The true benefits of Internet connectivity come later, when all sorts of
devices expect Internet connectivity. More on this in Chapter 4.
Remote Control of Almost Everything
Another great thing about a smart home is the control that you have.
Depending on the complexity of your home-automation system, you could
control everything from the drapes to the heating system. A smart home
allows you to add control later by tapping the endpoints, so you can start
modestly.
With a home network, you can
 Control your lights: Simple home-automation systems attach to the
electrical system and allow you to control your electrical devices from a
common computing platform. You can turn lights on and off and check
out the heating levels in different zones.
 Control your remote controls: We hate to admit it, but one of us (we
won’t tell who) has seven remote controls in one room. Extending
remote control over all your components to other rooms in the house
would require a lot of extra remote controls. But with a truly smart
home, you can extend control over those devices to other rooms by
radio frequency or infrared extension units, so that you maintain the
same level of control that you’d have if you were in the same room. We
recommend (at least one of us does) that you get a universal remote
control for those rooms, however.
52
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

 Control your computers: One of the benefits of having connectivity to
your various computers on the same network is that you can do things in
a coordinated way. For instance, suppose you wanted to back up your
computers on a regular basis. You can create a schedule on one computer
and have it access the hard disks of the other computers on the LAN and
create a copy of key files. A truly wired user will store these files off site, in
case of fire or the theft of the machines. You can also coordinate new soft-
ware upgrades as well as virus and junk e-mail protection. Being con-
nected makes a lot of functionality possible in the computer realm.
 Control your life: Some home-management systems have automated
enunciators that can tell you things you ought to know, such as today is
your mother’s birthday or the day to take out the trash. Linked with the
Internet, telephone, or intercom systems, these commands can be sent
to specific locations — such as catching you as you walk out the door.
“I’ve Fallen and I Can’t Get Up!”
You don’t just have to keep a smart home for yourself; you can share it with
others. A smart home has something for everyone and can be tailored to the
needs of special interests, such as the elderly, families with young children,
or family members with specific disabilities. The great thing about having a
strong smart-home foundation is that you can make it flex in many ways
depending on what you want to do. Here are some examples:
 Turn on lights: We joke about “Clap on, clap off,” but we have to give the
nod to the Clapper as one of the early moves toward home automation —
after all, it’s merely an occupancy sensor switch based on sound. The
familiar Clapper has gone high-tech over the years and now includes clap
53
Chapter 3: Cool Stuff Home Networks Can Do
GPS: Where the boys are
Global Positioning System (GPS) is a location-
finding system that can tell you where you are
based on its capability to triangulate signals
from three or more satellites that orbit the Earth.
It can usually spot you within 10 to 100 meters
of your location.
GPS capability is now being built into cars, cell
phones, clothing, and more. GPS equipment and
chips are used in amusement parks to help keep
track of your kids. There are even fun games 
for kids based on GPS; for information about a
treasure hunt game, for example, check out
www.geocaching.com.

indication lights to aid with proper clapping and a sensitivity dial to
increase or decrease the Clapper’s sensitivity to your unique clap. You can
also program it to turn on when it hears any sound at all. This isn’t good
when you’re home, but it’s a great theft deterrent when you’re at work or
on vacation.
 Watch your grandkids: It’s never been easier to have a video chat with
your kids. No more fancy phone lines, special devices, and expensive
software. All you need is a standard broadband connection (you can 
use dial-up lines, but you won’t be satisfied), a $50 to $100 Web camera
(we like www.logitech.com), and free software from any of a range of
players, including Yahoo (messenger.yahoo.com). With Yahoo’s Super
Webcam mode, for instance, you can have great quality pictures.
The video picture frames refresh up to 20 frames a second, and the maxi-
mum resolution is 320 x 240. This is not quite TV-picture resolution, but
it’s getting there.
 Talk to your doctor: One of the leading manufacturers of implanted med-
ical device, Medtronic, Inc. (www.medtronic.com), has developed a ser-
vice that allows doctors to monitor patients at home. At the core of this
offering is the Medtronic Monitor, a small, easy-to-use device that allows
patients to collect information by holding a small “antenna” over their
implanted device. The monitor automatically downloads the data and
sends it through a standard telephone connection from anywhere in the
50 states directly to the secure Medtronic CareLink Network. Clinicians
access their patients’ data by logging onto the clinician Web site and make
decisions at any time and from anywhere through an Internet-connected
computer or laptop. Patients can view information about their devices
and conditions on their own personalized Web site, and family members
or other caregivers also can view this information if granted access by the
patient. The Medtronic CareLink Network is intended to support a wide
range of implanted cardiac devices — including Medtronic pacemakers,
heart failure devices, and monitoring and diagnostic devices — as they
become available following FDA approvals.
 Get help now! Surely you’ve seen the “I’ve fallen and can’t get up!” com-
mercials. This cuts to the heart of a major issue for those who are often
alone at home: What if something happens and no one is around to help?
Various firms (www.seniorsafety.com, for one) have put together a
service that links a waterproof wireless transceiver (worn around your
neck or wrist) with a central unit plugged into your phone jack and elec-
trical outlet. When the button is pushed on the receiver, it contacts the
central unit, which calls a 24-hour monitoring center. In about 40 seconds,
they open a voice-to-voice channel to the central unit, which means they
can speak back and forth with you from basically wherever you are in
your home; you don’t even have to touch the phone. (The central unit
usually has a very loud speaker and supersensitive microphone).
54

 See who’s outside, and then let them in: With a simple wireless camera
and a link to your TV set, you can see who’s knocking at the door, so 
you don’t have to get up. And if you want to let them in without getting
up, combine your intercom or home-phone system (like those sold by
Panasonic, www.panasonic.com) with a door opener contact and just
“buzz” someone in.
55
Chapter 3: Cool Stuff Home Networks Can Do
“Sit, Ubu. Sit!”
Pets are a big part of any family. (If you ask us,
they’re just one of the family.) A smart home
doesn’t care what species you are. Here are
some neat things you can do for your pets. Some
are networked; others are smart on their own:
 Feed your pets when you’re away: From
fish to cats to dogs, you can program auto-
matic pet feeders to dispense food up to
eight times a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a
year. It’s perfect for anyone who is not
always on time to feed Rover, or who sud-
denly needs to take a trip.
 Keep your pet wet: Automatic drinking foun-
tains continuously circulate and filter your
pet’s water, making it more appealing than
standing bowl water. A charcoal filter
absorbs tastes and odors. A pitcher-like
spout stands five inches above the floor, cre-
ating a long waterfall. Other products can
keep your pet’s outdoor water bowl above
freezing — hook the outlet to your tempera-
ture monitor and turn it on when it gets cold.
 Let your pet out: It’s one thing to put a pet
door into your house, but how do you keep
other animals out? Smart pet doors today
sense a magnetic key on your pet’s collar
and unlock to allow your pet to push
through the flap.
 Stop your dog from barking: Is your neigh-
bor’s dog driving you crazy? Systems can
detect dog barking and issue a humane and
effective high-pitched tone that quiets noisy
dogs without inflicting harm or pain. The
tone doesn’t cause pain to animals, but
most dogs don’t like it and will stop need-
less barking.
 Stop those scratches on the doors: Most
dog or cat owners have a lot of scratched
paint by the door, where Fido or Fifi wanted
to be let out. Well, why can’t they just page
you like most normal pets? They can, with a
wireless door chime. When your pet steps
on the paw-shaped pad, it signals a wire-
less chime to the speaker unit.
 Keep your pet in the yard: Some electronic
dog fences have a small low-voltage wire
that you string under the ground along your
yard’s perimeter; others are wireless. A
sensor on your pet’s collar issues a warn-
ing tone when he or she starts straying off
your property. Soon, you’ll have computer
chips in your pet’s collar that can interface
with the Global Positioning System (GPS)
and a wireless phone network so that you
can look on your computer and see where
your pet is.
 Keep your dog warm (or cold): Make your
doghouse a zone on your HVAC system and
keep it automated with the rest of your
house. Put a floor warmer in the doghouse,
and in cold weather, turn up the heat on that
puppy, literally!
You can find smart pet-device sections at
Smarthome, Inc. (www.smarthome.com).

Pool, Anyone?
Pools are great to have, a pain to have, and a worry to have. Pools provide
fun under the sun but have to be maintained. And if you have little kids around,
a pool is a constant worry. A smart home can maximize your enjoyment and
minimize your fears in the following ways:
 Control your watery environment: While a pool seems simple — it’s
just a hole in the ground (or a tank above ground) filled with water — 
it can get quite complex, particularly if you add a spa, a waterfall, house
and garden lighting, and other such amenities. Vendors such as Jandy
(www.jandy.com) offer home-automation kits that can help you control
filter pumps, pool and spa heaters, and many more electrically operated
features with the push of a button. The system also allows for handheld
wireless remote-control access, telephone access, and PC access of all
features driven by its system. It can also interface with any RS-232 “intel-
ligent” home-automation system. (RS-232 is a communications protocol
used by many computers and automation systems. See Chapter 20 for
more information.)
 Monitor water levels: A low water level risks serious damage to your
filter system and pump. Overfilling your pool wastes water and greatly
reduces filter and skimmer effectiveness. A water-level controller main-
tains water at the preset level. You just attach a garden hose, adjust the
float level, and you’re ready to go. Check out www.poolkeeper.com for
one that’s easy to install.
 Use in-pool movement alarms: A range of devices can alert you if 
someone falls in the pool. These protect kids and pets alike. (Pets find 
it difficult to climb out of pools.) Make sure that the alarm solution you
select can be used with a solar blanket on the pool. Check out www.
poolguard.com for its Pool Guard PGRM-2.
 Use gate alarms: All pools should be fenced, but the weakest link in a
fence is the gate. A gate alarm mounts next to any gate that gives easy
access to your swimming pool. The gate alarm has a delay switch that
allows an adult to pass through the gate without the alarm sounding.
 Get some turtles: If you have a child, especially one aged 1 to 4, you
need a turtle for your pool: a Safety Turtle, that is, from Terrapin
Communications (www.safetyturtle.com). Safety Turtle is a 
watchband-like water-sensitive device that transmits a special signal to
its base station when the wearer comes into contact with water for a
duration of time. Fencing and gate alarms aren’t enough. Safety Turtle is
not just for kids. Pet owners buy them for their precious furballs, and
spouses buy them for their elderly in-laws (in Florida, more elderly
people die in pool accidents than kids).
56
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

 Think about automatic pool covers: Automatic pool covers eliminate
water evaporation, seal in heat, and reduce pool equipment use. In fact,
a good cover can act as a giant passive solar collector, and in combina-
tion with its thermal qualities, can raise the pool water temperature 
10 degrees or more in season. This in turn can mean up to a 70 percent
reduction in heating costs, chemical bills, pool pump electrical bills, and
pool water bills. And you can link your pool-cover-control mechanism 
to your home-automation system to make sure that your pool is covered
when it’s not in use. No more Saturday mornings cleaning the pool.
Check out www.sunsystemsinc.com.
The great thing about a lot of the pool safety devices is that they can be inte-
grated into your regular alarm and security system, including their monitor-
ing and alert mechanisms. So if you’re not at home and someone is in your
pool, something can still be done about it. (Sorry, Pat, no more sneaking into
the neighbor’s pool!) Remember, though, that none of these safety products
replaces the need for adult supervision of all people in the pool area.
To Infinity and Beyond!
In the previous sections of this chapter, we describe things you can do today,
to some degree. In this section, we want you to imagine what you’ll be able to
do with a home network in the near future.
Connect your kitchen appliances and more
Being interconnected will make it possible to use common consumer devices
to do seemingly odd tasks. Here are some examples:
 Check your e-mail on your refrigerator: New, thin, touch-screen, flat-
screen computer monitors will fit nicely into your refrigerator door —
which is mostly insulation anyway — without compromising much. Add
the appropriate computer chip and LAN access to the innards, and you
have a heavy computer that also serves ice. Now you’ll have a place to
keep your shopping lists, send and receive e-mails, and maintain all your
phone numbers.
 Surf the Web on your microwave: We have no idea why you’d want to
use this feature, but trial products are on the market that allow you to
surf the Web from your microwave. Waiting three minutes for your lunch
to warm up can be a pain, but that’s probably not enough time to check
a Web site. Still, occupy your lunch-warming time with closing stock
quotes, appointment reminders, weather predictions, school closings,
and so on. Personally, we’d go with the refrigerator.
57
Chapter 3: Cool Stuff Home Networks Can Do

 Tie your sprinkler system to www.weather.com: Never get caught
watering your lawn in the rain again! By tying your sprinkler to the
Internet, you’ll be able to check the weather predictions and let your
sprinkler system decide whether to water the lawn as scheduled. During
periods of high temperatures, the system may decide to water more fre-
quently. And if you’re in a drought area, it can forgo a cycle by monitor-
ing bans on watering lawns.
 Keep your car tuned: Most new cars have computer chips that track the
vehicle’s health. Imagine driving into your garage each night and having
a remote sensor interrogate your automobile about its day — and inter-
act with remote databases and troubleshooting systems at your car’s
manufacturing facility. This system will be able to track your oil change
needs and automatically schedule an appointment with your dealership.
It will also be able to download to your car’s hard disk the latest maps
for your area, your updated calendar, and revised phone contacts for
your car’s cell phone.
 Talk to your TV: New technology coming out of the voice recognition
industry will turn your home into Star Trek’s USS Enterprise. If your
smart home has a microphone in each room, you can say, “Computer,
put the incoming message on the screen,” just like Captain Picard. (By
the way, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, our lives revolve around
Star Trek and Disney World!) For more information on this brave new
technology, check out the sidebar titled “A speech odyssey.”
 Stay healthy: Interconnecting your kitchen with computer resources in
your home and on the Internet will give you great access to all sorts of
nutritional information and online recipe sites. Imagine tracking your
diet on a device in your kitchen, and asking for a suggested dinner based
on what you ate last week and what you have in the pantry right now.
You’ll be able to converse with your virtual chef to refine the menu given
your preferences for the evening.
58
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 
A speech odyssey
HAL2000 software, from Home Automated
Living Company (www.automatedliving.
com), will allow you to operate TVs, DVD play-
ers, CD players, tape players, and other house-
hold components just by ordering them around.
HAL2000 uses its own speech-to-text software
to send commands to designated devices. You
can turn on lights, announce who’s on the phone
all over the house, and check your e-mail. If the
system doesn’t understand you, it prompts you to
be more specific, with questions such as, “Did
you mean a tape from the VCR or a tape from
your audio tape player? . . . Dave? . . . Dave? . . .”

Let your TV show you the Web
Because people without computers are keen on using their familiar television
interface to surf the Internet, manufacturers have been scurrying to bring 
the Web to your TV screen. A smart home allows you to directly access the
Web through your TV set. The current technology works almost like a toggle
switch — you can either view the TV or surf the Internet, but not necessarily
at the same time, except maybe by using picture-in-picture capability. (This is
what Microsoft’s MSN TV2, — what used to be called WebTV — does.)
What’s coming down the pike is a wonderful combination of the two together,
and the sky is truly the limit here. Here are some things you’ll be able to do:
 Click your favorite actor: Ever watch a movie and say, “I know that
actor from somewhere,” and then for the rest of the movie try to figure
out who the guy is? With these emerging TV/Internet technologies, you
click the actor’s image to access his or her resume, complete with prior
roles. Want to go to that actor’s fan site? Click an icon designed for that
purpose. Want to send the actor an e-mail? Click another icon. When
your TV and the Web are connected, they can intertwine shows and
databases to create awesome opportunities.
 Click your favorite product: Imagine watching a 30-second commercial
and wanting to find out more about the advertised product. With con-
verged TV/Internet products, you’ll be able to click the product and 
go to a Web site that lists the product’s features and characteristics.
Click another place and see reviews from leading publications such as
Consumer Reports. Click an icon and see the lowest prices for that prod-
uct. Like the new gadget James Bond is using in his film? Find out where
to buy one by clicking it. The appearance of specific products on TV
shows will change drastically, going well beyond the crass commercial-
ism in The Truman Show.
 Click Grandma: Combine a small video camera and microphone with
your TV monitor, and you create an instant videoconferencing opportu-
nity. Using your smart home’s data backbone, you’ll be able to hop on
the Internet and conference with others. Let Grandma share in your
Christmas by enabling her to watch her grandchildren open their pre-
sents on the screen. Click your siblings, too, and have a family video-
conference. What a great way to show everyone the new baby!
Make phone calls on your computer
You may not realize that your phone calls are really data calls. When you
speak into your telephone, your local phone company most likely digitizes
59
Chapter 3: Cool Stuff Home Networks Can Do

your call and sends it across its massive telephone network to either another
phone locally or another local or long-distance carrier for completion. These
telephone networks are carrying data — bits of your phone conversation.
So when people first started talking about carrying voice calls over data net-
works, many said, “What’s new about that? Businesses have been doing that
for a while.” What is new is consumers having the capability to make calls
from their computers.
The combination of the audio hardware found on almost all new PCs and
broadband Internet connections allow you to easily make VoIP (Voice over
Internet Protocol) phone calls from your computer using software such as
Skype. In fact, you can make VoIP phone calls without even touching your PC
by using a device called an ATA (analog telephone adapter).
With the capability to make calls from your computer and over the Internet,
you can do the following:
 Have a home PBX: A PBX (private branch exchange) or switch, which
most companies use to run their phone networks, is like a mini telephone-
company switch that can transfer calls from one extension to another,
provide voice mail, do call holding, and so on. By running your home
phones on your data network instead of your phone network, you can
provide each handset with sophisticated features that you may not 
otherwise be able to afford. Some of the newest services on the market
enable firms to extend their PBX functionality to employees’ homes
through high-speed local-access connections. You could have one or
more extensions at home that look and operate the same as at work,
including allowing interextension dialing within the corporation.
 Receive faxes on your TV: Just like phone calls, fax transmissions are
beginning to move to the Internet. You can buy equipment or services that
translate faxed documents into digital Internet packets and send them
over the Net. At the receiving end, you can choose to print the fax on a fax
machine or receive the document as an e-mail attachment. When your TV
becomes part of your home’s Internet connection — and that will happen
soon — you’ll be able to preview and read your incoming faxes on your
TV screen. (Later, you can print them over your home-computer network.)
 Shop in Hong Kong: Envision going to a booth at your local mall, having
your body’s dimensions scanned, and then using this information to
shop anywhere in the world. No more too-short shirts! You’ll be able to
surf the Internet on your TV, find the outfits you want, choose the color
and patterns, and then order a custom-fitted garment. You’ll even be
able to use your videoconferencing link or Internet telephony capability
to talk with the tailors about your suit. In addition, many larger firms in
the textile industry cut their garments using computer-driven lasers.
Imagine having your scan feed directly into that!

Although home-automation systems have been around for a long time, they’re
still in their infancy. Most of the systems are either old technology (the inex-
pensive X10 systems) or expensive, custom-built systems. Luckily, a bunch 
of vendors are starting to offer solutions based on new standards such as
ZigBee and Z-Wave (see Chapters 19 and 20 for more information) that com-
bine better performance and reliability with ease-of-use and installation.
We’re starting to see home-control systems that integrate more fully into
your data and telephone networks, enabling them to be controlled remotely.
Traditionally, custom systems have a telephone interface that enables you to
dial in and use the keypad (or even your voice in some instances) to issue
commands to the system controller. The next logical step in this process is 
to provide a Web interface — and many are launching these services now.
Suppose that one of your home’s PCs, using an always-on fast Net connec-
tion, also powers your home-control systems. This home-control software
functions as a Web server to allow you to access your home-control system
from your office desktop, an airport kiosk, or even your Web-enabled hand-
held PC. You simply bring up the URL of your home server, log in, and then
navigate through the home-control Web page to turn on lights, turn up the
heat, or even fire up the hot tub. Pretty cool, huh?
With the newest systems, you don’t need to involve the PC. Your standalone
home controller, like those sold by Control4, www.control4.com, can
handle all your needs without a PC. For example, the Control4 home-control
system connects to your broadband Internet connection and “talks” to
Control4’s Web servers. Without setting up your own in-home Web server,
you can log into my.control4.com and (using a username and password to
authenticate yourself) remotely control your system from any Web browser
anywhere in the world.
Here are just a few of the tasks that this type of interface will be able to 
perform:
 Control your appliances’ usage: More and more, companies will give
you incentives to behave in certain ways. For instance, the power com-
pany may encourage you to run laundry at certain hours of the day. A
smart home-automation system will be able to interact with the power
company’s pricing system to determine the best time of the day to do
certain tasks, and then perform those tasks according to those sched-
ules, if that’s what you want. Power companies in some parts of the
country already have different rate periods.

Chapter 3: Cool Stuff Home Networks Can Do

 See through walls: Your home-network security system will include a
video monitor for the front door, allowing you to see who’s there before
you open the door. By further interconnecting your security system with
Internet access, you can monitor your home remotely, from any Web
interface. Suppose that you’re at work but think that someone sent an
important overnight package to your home office by accident. With this
technology, you’ll be able to call up your smart home’s Web page and
check out the video picture of your front stoop. If your hunch is correct,
you can go home and get the package. You’ll also be able to monitor
your nanny from work, or make sure that the kids aren’t throwing wild
parties while you’re away!
 Turn up the heat: With a good smart-home design, your telephone
system will be interconnected with your heating and cooling systems,
which will allow you to monitor and control those systems remotely.
Going to go up to your smart vacation home for the weekend? With a
remotely controlled home-automation system, you’ll be able to call
ahead and turn the heat on.
 Check who’s home alone: Or have your system dial out to your own
pager number when someone (maybe a burglar) enters the back door.
With an interconnected system, almost anything is possible.

Chapter 4
Timelines and Budgets
In This Chapter
 Determining your network desires
 Thinking about money and budgets
 Getting help along the way
 Scoping your project’s timeline
Your smart-home adventure starts in two places: in your head and in your
wallet. You need to know where you’re going and how much you’re will-
ing to spend to get there. In addition, you need to figure out how much of this
project you’re willing to do yourself. All sorts of consultants, systems integra-
tors, contractors, and others can help ensure smart-home success. This
chapter helps you figure out when to use these folks. You also find out about
budgetary and timeline considerations.
New or Existing Home?
The most important issue when wiring your home is whether you have a 
new home or an existing one. We present all possible options in a home that
you’re wiring from scratch. But we also describe choices that you can pursue
if a whole-home wiring solution isn’t possible in all parts of your home.
Even if you have an existing home, wired solutions aren’t necessarily out of
the question. Contractors can snake cables through walls to install alarms,
intercoms, phone systems, data networks, and automation systems. You may
want to rely more heavily on wireless systems or ones that utilize existing
wires. If you instead decide to run new wires, you should search for an expe-
rienced telephone or alarm installer who can find some creative ways to run
and hide new wires without having to rip open walls.

What Do You Want from 
Your Home Network?
The first step in planning your home network is determining what you want it
to do. Do you want a fully automated home, with lights that turn themselves
on, drapes that open and shut on their own, and a remote-controlled HVAC
(heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) system? Do you want a high-speed
computer network that lets you plug a PC or laptop into a jack anywhere in
the house and get Internet access? Do you want a sophisticated communica-
tions system, with multiple telephone lines, video monitors at the doors, and
intercoms throughout your home?
Going for broke (literally) from the beginning is neither necessary nor wise.
However, it is wise to use any wiring or rewiring opportunities (such as a
newly constructed home or one that you’re ripping apart for remodeling) 
to get enough wires to enough places to enable your home network to grow
with your needs, without the hassle and expense of doing the wiring all over
again.
Whatever you decide to do, it’s best to install a home network all at once in 
a well-thought-out fashion. Home networking in a haphazard way results in,
well, what most ad hoc do-it-yourselfers’ wiring projects look like — a mess.
So before you begin designing a network and wiring plan for your home, think
through how you’re going to use each room in the home. Do so with an eye
toward the future. Suppose that you have a spare bedroom that needs only a
phone jack and a cable TV outlet. That room may be your home office some-
day, in which case you’d need wiring for an extra phone as well as some com-
puter networking capabilities. Or perhaps the room will turn into a nursery,
so you’d want an intercom and maybe a video monitor. And when the kids get
older, they may need a place to hook up a computer or plug in an entertain-
ment system.
As you explore your many home-networking options, aim toward flexibility
for the future.
Deciding How Much to Spend
Prewiring your entire home for every contingency may not be as expensive
as you think. Several well-respected vendors offer all-in-one kits that put 
high-speed data communications, telephony, video, home entertainment, 
and (in some cases) security wiring in place with little or no thinking on your
part. Check out Chapter 2 for more information on all-in-one cable solutions.
64
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

You can also apply the everything-everywhere solution and run high-speed
data cables, coaxial video cables, and speaker cables to several jacks in
every room of your home. Many homeowners follow this route.
Even though you’ll be making choices about what you can do right now, don’t
forget about building a robust, futureproof wiring system into your home. In
fact, running higher-quality, more capable wiring doesn’t cost much more than
running old-fashioned telephone and cable TV wires. And while you’re at it,
install conduits (mentioned in Chapter 2) to make running cables easier in the
future.
One of the great things about building a smart home is that many of the net-
work’s components — wiring panels, cable runs, keypads, switches, and so
on — are already part of the home’s structure, which means that you can
usually finance this cost as part of your mortgage. This option helps you
stretch out the upfront cost of installing these systems.
Going Over the Costs
The cost of a home network varies depending on many factors, such as the
costs in your particular area and how fancy you get. We can, however, pro-
vide general information about how much you can expect to spend. We base
our prices on a typical home: two floors, three bedrooms, two-and-a-half
baths, and a partially finished basement. To cover a larger area, you need to
add the cost of extra wiring runs and some extra endpoints.
Most of the cost of an audio- and video-distribution system is in the audio and
video equipment itself rather than in the networking infrastructure and compo-
nents. Audio and video equipment is usually housed in the home-media center.
(Part II explains this equipment in detail.) Here are some general costs:
 Home theater: A home theater can cost you as little as $1000 if you go
with a moderate-sized TV set and a home-theater-in-a-box surround-
sound audio system. A really great home theater runs $7,000 to $20,000.
Installation costs about 10 percent of your component parts.
 Coaxial distribution panel: Expect to spend about $300 to $400 for a
coaxial distribution panel for your home network.
Other networks in your home involve the following costs:
 Phone system: A phone system costs $50 to $100 per outlet or from $500
to $1500 for a centralized whole-home phone system.
 Data network: Data networks are relatively inexpensive — less than $200
to buy and install the necessary central components and about $50 to
$100 per cable run, including cable, connectors, faceplates, and so on.
65
Chapter 4: Timelines and Budgets

 Home-security system: A home-security system averages about $1200 to
install. You also pay about $25 a month for monitoring fees — about half
of that if you use one of the Internet-based monitoring services we dis-
cuss in Chapter 18.
 Home-automation system: The cost of your home-automation system
can vary widely. The cost to turn some lights on and off with a computer-
controlled timer is much less than the cost to have androids serve
breakfast in bed, for example. The average simple DIY home-automation
project costs around $500 to $1000 (for example, to install a lighting-
control system), and a fancier, centrally controlled whole-home system
(with professional installation and configuration) starts off at around
$5000.
Depending on what you need to do, you may be able to get away with paying
less than these amounts. But we’d rather scare you with big numbers first —
while showing you all the ways that you can step down in price and still have
a great home network — than throw unrealistically low numbers your way
and set the wrong expectations.
Whatever you do, don’t start the process by saying, “I don’t want to spend a
lot of money on this project.” Instead, approach the process with an open
mind: Think about what features you’d like to have, share that information
with some home-networking experts, and see what happens from there.
The Home Team
The people involved in your project vary according to what you’re trying to
accomplish. If you plan install a major home theater — complete with theater
seats, a popcorn and candy stand, and screen curtains — you’ll probably
bring a home-theater consultant into the process. Most people don’t want or
need to go to that level.
The cast of characters for your home-networking project can include the 
following:
 Architect: This person helps you lay out the initial plans for your home
and coordinate with other designers to get their respective visions on
paper. Architects create the plans that guide all the activity in the house,
but they need the contribution of your individual contractors. Many
architects don’t have the level of specialty necessary to finalize your
wiring plans, but the architect’s drawings are key to making sure, for
example, that all your speakers are correctly placed in your home-
entertainment theater.
66
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

 Audio/video consultant: Your audio/video (A/V) consultant helps you
select the right mix of components for your sight and sound systems
and then integrate all those components. Your A/V consultant makes
sure that the appropriate wiring is run to support your installations and
then installs the gear when you’re ready. If you’re installing a dedicated
home theater, expect your A/V consultant to get involved with the archi-
tect early on, too, making recommendations for room sizes, building
materials, and so on. The A/V consultant may also hand you off to a spe-
cialized home-theater consultant if the job is too complex for his or her
comfort. (Home-theater consultants get into additional details such as
soundproofing, seating, lighting, and the room’s shape and construction).
 Contractor/builder: The general contractor/builder’s role is to direct
the other specialty contractors and make sure that they carry out the
intent of the designers. Passing correct information from one contractor
(such as the home-theater consultant) to the people doing the work
(such as the cabinetmaker who builds the home-theater cabinetry) is
crucial. The details are what count here, such as cutting out the right
size cubbyhole for the kitchen media center.
 Computer-systems contractor: If you work at home or have complex
computer-networking needs, bringing in a computer-systems contractor
to network your computer hardware and interface it to the appropriate
systems can be a great timesaver.
 Electrical contractor: The electrical contractor is a staple of any new
home project. Because your smart home may require additional or dif-
ferent electrical wiring (for example, special configurations in your elec-
trical panel to allow home automation over power lines), hiring an
electrical contractor who is experienced with smart homes is a plus.
 Heating/cooling contractor: Having a smart home is not just about
having a home-control system that turns fans on and off. A smart heat-
ing and cooling system has many nuances, such as different zones for
maximum control and specialized controls for specific areas (such as
that wine cellar you were thinking about). Your heating/cooling contrac-
tor can make sure that your system is energy efficient while meeting
your requirements.
 Home-systems integrator: This person integrates all the different elec-
tronic systems in your house but may or may not do the actual installa-
tions; specialists for each subsystem may do part of the work. The
integrator should be able to provide your architect with recommenda-
tions regarding where to put your centralized wiring closet or where to
run the wires for specific applications. The home-systems integrator
also works with the interior designer to address layout and appearance
issues.
67
Chapter 4: Timelines and Budgets

 Interior designer: This person is responsible for making sure that your
home-network technology doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb. Installing
a state-of-the-art home-entertainment center in the living room is one
thing — making it fit with the overall scheme of your home is another.
The interior designer works with your consultants to ensure that what is
visible is pleasing to the eye.
 Kitchen designer: This expert helps you figure out not only a sensible
layout for your kitchen but also your options for integrating the latest
technologies into your smart-home design. This designer should work
closely with the home-systems integrator.
 Lighting consultant: Often an overlooked task on a to-do list, lighting
design has an important effect on the ambiance of your home, so con-
sider specialized lighting in key areas. A lighting consultant works early
on with the home-systems integrator and the architect to define the
lighting-control requirements and to select a system. The actual wiring,
however, is typically handled by the electrical contractor or home-
systems integrator — unless the lighting arrangement is complex, in
which case a specialized lighting contractor may be called in.
 Security consultant: The security consultant and contractor design a
system specifically for your home, and then install it. They make sure
you have the right coverage to meet your security goals and ensure that
the system interfaces with other subsystems, such as with telephone
lines for calling out to the central station if a burglar trips a sensor.
Whew! Did we leave anyone out? Depending on the amount of money you
want to spend, you may indeed have this many people making your smart
home a reality. A more modest project has a more modest number of people
stomping around your house. Also, many of the previously mentioned 
professionals — kitchen designers, for example — include their services
when you purchase their equipment.
Make sure that you choose advisors who share your vision of an ideal smart
home. The people you choose should have experience with smart, networked
homes. Some contractors are conservative and don’t want to overbuild. Others
are liberal and plan for everything under the sun. Find your wired personality
and match it with your contractors, and you’ll have a winning combination.
You might have a hard time finding some of these contractors — it’s not like
the phone book has a section titled “Smart Homes” (at least not yet!). For the
more traditional groups of professionals (such as architects), we tend to rely
on word-of-mouth, recommendations from in-the-know friends, and a thorough
review of the contractor’s references. For contractors who will be installing
your home’s electronics and wiring infrastructure, we do these same 
things, as well as check their credentials. The Custom Electronics Design &
Installation Association, or CEDIA, is one of the best places to start. This
68
Part I: Future-Perfect Homes 

group (www.cedia.net) has a rigorous training and qualification program
for people who do nothing but build and install smart-home systems for a
living.
Starting Down the Smart-Home Path
Your first step in building your whole-home network is to visualize what you
want. Then you need to sit down with your designers and consultants to
refine your vision into a cost-effective reality. The following list is a rough
timeline you can use as you’re planning and building your wired home. Your
timeline, however, may take half as long or twice as long:
 Month 1: Meet and interview various key consultants, and then hire
your choices; visit demonstration rooms; visit libraries and bookstores
for ideas and cappuccino. (By the way, you’ll be doing great if you can
keep this effort to only one month.)
 Month 2: If you’re part of the 1 percent who can afford a custom-
designed home, you’re ready to sit down with your architect and start
brainstorming the design. Plan to spend at least a month or two in this
process. Then the architect or builder creates the plan with your spe-
cific needs in mind. Although it’s early in the process, you may also want
to choose an interior designer.
 Month 3: You make the final refinements to your plans. Typically, the
architect draws up not only floor plans but also electrical wiring plans
for key subsystems. Unfortunately, few architects will read this book
before designing your system, so they may provide a standard plan. 
You need to find a home-networking specialist or work closely with the
architect to describe the needs of each room and the system as a whole.
 Month 4: You request bids and select a builder; you finalize the budget
and plans; you and the builder approve the detailed drawings of wiring
schematics and special construction; and the builder applies for and
receives permits. These things may take more than a month, but we’re
optimists.
 Month 5: The lot is cleared; the foundation is dug; the security team is
on hand to survey the site and external installations; the pipes and
wiring are installed under the foundation; and the foundation is poured.
 Months 6–8: The framing is finished; the windows and roof are installed;
key consultants tour the site for revisions and planning; and plumbing
and heating contractors install their wiring, piping, and conduit. (If your
new house is big or the weather is bad, this phase could take longer
than two months.)
69
Chapter 4: Timelines and Budgets

 Month 9: Both before and after the electrician does the electrical work,
various contractors install data, telephone, security, audio, video, and
other special wiring. The insulation goes in.
 Months 10–12: Sheetrock and plaster are installed; interior wood and
finishing work begins, including any special cabinetry; the A/V contrac-
tor installs any in-wall speakers and intercom systems; the telephone/
data systems team installs the data/telephone systems; the security con-
tractor installs endpoint devices and the control system; the electrical
contractor and lighting designer install lighting and controls; the plumber
installs fixtures; and the home-automation expert coordinates installa-
tion of the home-control system.
 Month 13: Final construction is performed on the interior of the house;
subcontractors finish their installations; testing is performed; and sys-
tems are checked. You’re probably closer to month 18 by now, and you’ve
probably blown your budget. But the important part is to make it through
alive and with your marriage intact.
Don’t forget about the building inspector. The best-laid plans can succumb to
a busy building inspector whose approval is often required to go to the next
stage of your multistage project.
You do need to coordinate what kind of cables will be installed in any special
conduits placed to make running wires easier. For instance, running electrical
wiring in the same conduit as your telephone, data, or A/V wiring is a bad
move because electrical lines create electromagnetic flux that ruins your data
and video throughput, not to mention your phone calls. Installing electrical
cables adjacent to other cables is surprisingly common in many new-home
construction projects, so look out for it.
After all the rough-in work is complete (and wires are all over the place), the
sheetrock and other wall coverings go up. Although some items, such as in-
wall speakers, go in before all the finish work is complete, much of your gear
goes in only after everything else is just about finished. You attach all your
components to their connection points, and install the control panels.
After the rough-in work and wiring is finished but before the sheetrock goes
up, use a video or digital camera to document what wires are running where
(including where the empty conduits start and stop). Some day you might
need to add a cable to a conduit, or fix a wire that a rodent ate through (yes,
they do that; and yes, we’re talking about rats; and yes, depending on where
you live, you can get rats in your house, no matter how often you clean the
kitchen and take out the trash).
Testing can be exhaustive, but you can never test too much before accepting
a house from your collective of contractors. Make sure to hook equipment to
all your outlets and test, test, test.

ace it: The television is a major focus of almost any
home, worldwide. In our business, we’ve traveled all
over the globe. We’ve seen tents in the desert with camels
parked out back, dinner cooking over a fire, and a TV set
inside. People like and want their video. Those enamored
with audio feel just as strongly.
The key is building your home-entertainment system so
that you can enjoy it everywhere you want to — not just
in the confines of a particular room or a particular space.
Your home-entertainment system should be in the whole
home, omnipresent to the point of total flexibility.
In this part, we tell you how to create a home-entertainment
backbone in your house. We discuss the major elements
of a whole-home audio and video network and the advan-
tages of connecting all multimedia elements together. We
talk about the different inputs and outputs required and

your home-entertainment system. We also make sure
you’re up to speed on the latest developments in enter-
tainment equipment and networking, such as HDTV 
and Internet-based content, and on the effect these 
innovations will have on your networking strategy and
requirements.

M
ost homes contain a plethora of entertainment equipment — televisions,
radios, CD players, stereo receivers, and more. (If you’re like us, you
also have an old-fashioned turntable sitting prominently on a shelf some-
place.) People tend to think of home-entertainment gear as stuff that’s used
in a particular room — a stereo in the living room, televisions in the family
room and bedroom, and maybe a radio in the kitchen.
The best home-entertainment system is a network that leverages your invest-
ments in expensive audio and video equipment and lets you enjoy it wherever
you are in the home. You put the bulk of the equipment in a common media
center (such as a home-theater room), and then set up a suitable network
infrastructure (wired or wireless or something else) to distribute the audio
and video. In this chapter, we discuss the components you need to set up a
home-audio and -video network.
TV and Video Systems
This section looks at some of the radical changes that television is 
undergoing — and we’re not talking about programming. Like most other
devices before it, the television is in the midst of a leap from the analog to 

the digital world. Unlike many of those devices, however, TV is making the
leap in a series of agonizingly slow steps. We discuss how this transition
might affect your choices in the video world. We talk also about the various
kinds of TVs you can buy.
The conversion from analog to digital and old-style TV to next-generation TV
comes into play in many places:
 The encoding of the programming signal itself
 The transmission path that the signal takes in getting to your house
 The receiver — internal or external — that receives and decodes the
signal for display
In the progression of standards and technical development, change is taking
place along all three of these paths.
Analog still rules the roost — 
but not for long
The vast majority of television signals coming into homes are still analog.
Analog TV signals reach homes through over-the-air broadcast TV, by tradi-
tional cable TV systems, and by satellite. (We discuss all the different ways
TV signals get into your house later in the chapter.)
In North America, an analog television format known as NTSC (National
Television Standards Committee) has been in place for decades — in fact, it
hasn’t been changed or updated since the advent of color television in the
1960s. Although this standard is capable of producing a surprisingly good
picture under ideal circumstances, its analog nature makes it susceptible to
various kinds of interference and signal degradation. Consequently, the pic-
ture can be downright awful by the time it gets to your television (which is
why the TV world is slowly turning digital).
There’s not much we need to tell you about analog TV — if you’ve turned on
a television in the past fifty years, you’ve seen it.
Just as the NTSC standard is common in North America (and Japan), a couple
of other standards — known as PAL and SECAM — are common in other
parts of the world. Unless you have a special TV designed for the purpose,
you can’t watch PAL with an NTSC TV, and vice versa. This is one reason why
you can’t buy videotapes in many parts of the world and use them at home.
74
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Digital is here!
The move from analog to digital is well afoot. Tens of millions of homes have
some form of digital TV, but the conversion from analog to digital is still an
evolving process. The key concept behind any kind of digital TV is that the
audio and video programming is converted from an analog signal into a series
of digital bits (a whole lot of ones and zeros that make up a video picture).
The primary technology behind any kind of digital TV (at least in the United
States and Canada — other countries have their own variant of digital TV) is
something called MPEG.
Several video and audio compression and digitization standards are based on
MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group). Most are named by adding a number
to the end of the word MPEG. The MPEG-2 standard is by far the most common
in the video world, with MPEG-4 coming on strong.
The digital television that people receive today uses MPEG-2 to carry stan-
dard, analog NTSC TV signals digitally. This is an important fact to repeat:
Much of what you see as “digital TV” is a standard analog TV signal, con-
verted to digital. Digital over digital is our nirvana and is part of the HDTV
world, as we discuss shortly.
When this digitized signal gets to your house (over a digital cable system or a
DBS satellite system), a set-top box converts the signal back to analog NTSC
TV, which your TV understands and can display. This digital signal coming
into your house isn’t inherently different than an analog one, but it usually
looks and sounds better because the digital transmission path is cleaner and
isn’t susceptible to the interference that usually messes up analog signals.
Next-generation digital TV
Much of today’s digital television isn’t all it can be. In the late 1990s, the FCC
(the controlling regulatory authority for broadcasters, cable companies, 
and telephone companies in the United States) brought together a big bunch 
of television industry folks and — after a long, painful, and contentious
process — came up with a new generation of digital TV. This new system,
which goes by the name ATSC (Advanced Television Standards Committee),
had defined a bunch of new, higher-definition television standards.
Specifically, digital video signals (not analog ones) are transmitted using digi-
tal technologies and played on TVs set up to display these digital signals. It’s
digital all the way, baby, as sportscaster Dick Vitale would say. (Did we men-
tion we’re Duke Blue Devils fans, too!)
75
Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck

These new higher-definition television standards are different than the digital
TV discussed in the preceding section. To view them in all their glory (and
we’ve seen enough of high-definition television to tell you that it is indeed
glorious), you need to buy the newer, fancier, better, more expensive TV.
ATSC signals can be divided into different groups, depending on the resolu-
tion and the scanning method (as we discuss in the “What’s different about
ATSC?” sidebar). They are further divided into SDTV, or standard-definition
television (signals that are about the same or a little bit better than NTSC),
and HDTV, or high-definition television (which has truly spectacular, film-like
picture quality). Within the ATSC standard are dozens of SDTV and HDTV
variations, but you’re most likely to see just four, as shown in Table 5-1.
76
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 
What’s different about ATSC?
When we talk about new ATSC-based televi-
sions, we’re talking a whole new ballgame (or
at least a whole new way to watch a ballgame).
It takes only a glance to see the striking differ-
ence between older NTSC displays and the new
ATSC ones.
In general terms, the clarity and crispness of a
television’s display is determined by the resolu-
tion, the scanning refresh rate, and the scan-
ning method.
You may be familiar with the concept of resolu-
tion if you own a PC, because PC displays are
usually rated in terms of their resolution, or
more specifically, the number of pixels (individ-
ual points of light and color in the display) that
you can see. For example, smaller home-PC dis-
plays are set to show 800 pixels across by 600
pixels vertically; larger displays are often set to
show 1024 across by 768 vertically, or more.
Television manufacturers don’t usually mention
the number of pixels across the screen, but
they do list the vertical number — the lines of
resolution, or scan lines. Today’s analog TV sys-
tems usually max out at 480 lines of resolution
(and you don’t even receive all 480 — a few
lines carry other information such as closed
captioning). ATSC systems (HDTV, in other
words) can broadcast at 480, 720, on up to 1080
lines of resolution. When looking at two
screens of the same size and quality, the more
lines of resolution, the better the picture.
The other factor in determining the quality of a
television or video signal is the scanning
method. People generally talk about PC moni-
tors and video systems in terms of their screen
refresh rates — often using a number such as
75 hertz. This figure means that the picture on
your PC’s video screen is updated 75 times
every second. When talking about televisions,
people discuss the scanning method to illus-
trate the same principle.
TV puts an interesting twist on the scan line
refresh rate, however. A TV with a progressive
scan display refreshes all lines of resolution (480
or 720 or 1080) during a cycle. (TVs refresh at a
rate of 60 cycles per second — for comparison,
film movies do so 24 times a second.) Other TVs
offer interlaced scan display, which means that
they refresh half the screen — every other 
line — each cycle, so each line is refreshed only
30 times per second. Theoretically, a progressive
scan system has a better picture than an inter-
laced one, but because both refresh the picture
many times per second, the difference isn’t
immense.

To take advantage of all the benefits of digital TV, you’ll eventually have to
replace your televisions. Today’s televisions don’t have the internal circuitry
to decode digital TV signals, and they generally don’t have screens that can
display high-definition ATSC pictures in all their glory. (And HDTV is the big
deal in this story — we focus our discussion on HDTV rather than SDTV.)
Today’s TVs aren’t even the right shape; the aspect ratio — the ratio of screen
width to height — of HDTV signals is wider than that of NTSC signals. NTSC 
is 4:3; HDTV is 16:9. Figure 5-1 shows the difference in aspect ratios — the
HDTV screen has an aspect ratio like the elongated screens in movie theaters.
(You may have already been exposed to this aspect ratio because many
movie DVDs today allow for this sort of widescreen viewing as an option.)
HDTV-capable TV sets, which became available at the end of 1998, are more
expensive than traditional sets. However, prices have come down signifi-
cantly. When we wrote the first edition of this book, HDTVs were often more
than $6000, but now you can get one for $750 or less.

Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck
What about 1080p?
If you are tuned into the HDTV world, you have
no doubt heard a lot of talk about 1080p. This 
is the highest current resolution in the HDTV
world — it’s simply a progressive scan version
of 1080i, drawing the entire 1920 x 1080 pixels in
each frame, rather than half of them at a time.
Why don’t we have 1080p in Table 5-1? Well, the
simple answer is that 1080p is not going to be
part of any broadcast (over-the-air, cable, or
satellite) TV system anytime soon. Where you
will find 1080p is in source devices that live in
your home, such as Blu-ray and HD-DVD disc
players and in gaming consoles such as Sony’s
PlayStation 3. So 1080p can and probably will
have a place in your home. But it won’t be
coming in over your set-top box or other broad-
cast reception system.

Two types of digital HDTVs are available: HDTV-ready TVs and HDTVs. HDTV-
ready televisions have only a standard NTSC receiver; they have no built-in dig-
ital television receiver. However, you can connect them to an external HDTV
receiver and display high-definition programming. The second type, HDTV, has
a built-in receiver (or at least comes with an HDTV receiver that you hook up
externally), so there’s nothing more to buy to receive over-the-air HDTV.
We think it’s better to buy an HDTV-ready TV — you save a few hundred
bucks, and then you can buy a receiver that works best with the system that
provides HDTV (that is, an over-the-air antenna, digital cable, or satellite).
I want my HDTV!
Where are you going to get your HDTV programming? (And yes, we want our
HDTV!) As we hinted, three possibilities are the same places where you get
NTSC today: over-the-air broadcasters, cable TV systems, and satellite TV
systems.
For broadcast TV, the FCC gave (for free) each broadcast TV station the req-
uisite additional broadcast spectrum for a different channel over which they
could broadcast in ATSC digital format. The deal was this: The TV stations
had to completely transition to digital by 2009 (February 19th of that year to
be precise — after the Super Bowl), and then give the FCC their old channel
so it could be assigned for other uses. In the summer of 2002, the FCC, trying
to push this process along, made a ruling that every TV sold in America must
have a receiver that can get ATSC broadcasts by 2007. Keep in mind, this
doesn’t mean that these TVs will be able to display HDTV (for example, they
may not have a high enough resolution, or they may not be able to display
widescreen content properly), but they will be able to receive it and display 
it at lower resolutions and at a 4:3 aspect ratio. Eventually, when enough of
these TVs are in people’s homes, analog TV as we know it will go away,
replaced by SDTV and HDTV.
So far, there have been no requirements for cable and satellite companies to
offer ATSC signals, but each has begun offering a number of channels of HDTV
to go along with their existing programming. In fact, the biggest competitive

Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

battle between cable and satellite TV providers these days revolves around the
number (and quality) of HDTV channels they offer. You can expect to get 20 or
more HDTV channels from either kind of provider, and both groups are making
major upgrades to their networks to bring you hundreds of channels.
After the switch to digital TV is complete, you won’t have to pitch your old
TVs. Digital TV tuners, like those that the FCC is requiring in new TVs, will
allow you to watch DTV programming on older TVs. Of course, the picture
quality and resolution won’t be as high as it would be with a new digital set,
and you might not have a widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio.
TV types
For a long time, televisions have been pretty much identical, except for differ-
ences in their internal electronics and the quality of their construction. The
advent of technologies from the computer world and the desire of many con-
sumers to build home theaters that use large-screen TVs have dramatically
altered this situation.
79
Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck
A fourth option
Cable, satellite, and broadcast are no longer the
only games in town. IPTV (Internet Protocol TV)
is the newest option, available to a small but sig-
nificant (and growing) number of people. IPTV
uses a combination of broadband connections
to the home (such as DSL) and the Internet
Protocol used for Web surfing, e-mail, and many
phone calls (such as Vonage) to bring you cable
and satellite-style TV over the Internet. The
biggest proponents of IPTV are the phone com-
panies, who are using the technology to com-
pete with cable companies in the realm of what
many call the triple play: high-speed Internet,
voice services, and TV.
In the United States, AT&T has invested heavily
in IPTV and is offering it over a very high-speed
variant of DSL called, appropriately, VDSL —
very high-speed digital subscriber line — and is
offering an IPTV service in dozens of its mar-
kets. Verizon, the other big phone company in
the United States, has its own system for TV
services, called FiOS, which replaces DSL and
copper phone lines entirely and offers services
over lightning-fast fiber-optic cables to the
home. FiOS actually is not an IPTV service (both
use the same technology that cable companies
use, only over fiber instead of coaxial cables),
but we expect that Verizon too will switch to
IPTV eventually.
It’s likely that even cable TV providers will begin
using some IPTV technology because it is 
more spectrally efficient, thus allowing them to
offer more TV channels over the same cable.
Many cable companies are already using some 
elements of IPTV for their video-on-demand 
services.
In the future, it’s possible you’ll hear less about
IPTV (the technology) but see a lot of IPTV as
many TV service providers move towards IPTV
as one of their underlying technologies, while
providing you a service that looks and feels just
like their old-fashioned services.

We’ve already talked a bit about digital TVs and HDTV. Now we’re going to
talk about three different forms of TVs (direct-view, projection, and flat
screen). None of these TV styles are inherently analog or digital — a specific
model within each of these groups can be analog only or HDTV and digital
compatible. Having said that, almost all projection and flat-panel TVs on the
market today are HDTV-ready.
Tubes for all: Direct-view TVs
The traditional television — or a video display of any kind, for that matter —
has always been the direct view, picture tube type. The screen you see is
actually the front of a specially treated glass tube with an electron gun built
into the back of the tube. This system works by shooting electrons through
electronically controlled devices and onto the back of the picture tube’s
screen. When the electrons hit the specially treated glass, it lights up in dif-
ferent colors and intensities (depending on how the electrons are aimed) and
creates your picture.
Tubes are a mature technology — having been on the market in large quanti-
ties for about 50 years — and they work pretty darn well. They do, however,
have a few disadvantages:
 They’re big (in depth) and heavy (ever try to move a 35" television?).
 The technology itself limits screen size (few direct-view televisions are
larger than about 40" measured diagonally).
 Large picture tubes with electron guns sophisticated enough to handle
HDTV’s high resolutions are difficult to build (several makers have such
models on the market, but they don’t offer the full 720 or 1080 lines of
resolution needed for real HDTV).
Tube TVs are essentially a dead-end technology. Most manufacturers have
begun to shut down their picture tube factories and have moved to projec-
tion and flat-panel TVs instead. With a few exceptions, you’ll find that tube
TVs are available only in the smallest sizes and for the cheapest models
(think 13" $75 tube TV for the guest room).
Projection TVs
After you move beyond pretty large big-screen TVs (35" or so) to huge oh-my-
goodness big-screen TVs, the form of the television changes from direct-view
to projection, or PTV. Projection TVs come in two main types, as shown in
Figure 5-2:
 Front-projection models: These high-end models consist of a projector
mounted on the ceiling and a separate screen. Like a movie projector,
these models project the TV video onto the front of the screen.
80
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

 Rear-projection models: The screen and projection systems are in the
same chassis in these all-in-one units. Like a direct-view TV, these
models beam the TV image onto the back of a screen.
The cheapest rear-projection models cost between $1000 and $2000. High-
quality front-projection models cost $3000 on up to $30,000 for the projector
alone (not to mention the cost of the screen and professional installation,
alignment, and focusing).
Traditionally, projection TVs used CRTs, or picture tubes, (like the ones used
in old-fashioned tube TVs) to project the image on a screen. These systems
are what you find in the cheapest rear-projection TVs on the market — and
what people used to think of as a big-screen TV — but like tube TVs, CRT-
based projectors are being slowly but surely phased out. While they offer a
great picture, they are hard to set up (and keep properly aligned, focused,
and calibrated), and they are big, heavy, and bulky.
The projector world has since moved on to microprojector systems, which
use ultra-high-resolution chip-based picture engines instead of tubes. These
microprojector systems are lighter, brighter, and significantly thinner (so
they fit into your home, instead of you having to fit your home around them).
They also offer excellent picture quality and don’t require nearly as much tin-
kering to maintain picture quality.
Three main technologies are used for microprojection systems (for both
front- and rear-projection TVs):
 DLP: An invention of Texas Instruments, DLP (www.dlp.com), or digital
light processor, is a system that uses a chip containing millions of micro-
scopic mirrors to reflect light onto the screen and make up a picture.

Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck

DLP TV systems have very high resolutions (most are now capable of
1080p), have a bright picture, and are excellent at color reproduction.
 LCD: LCD technology is familiar to most people due to the LCDs used for
computer monitors, cell phone displays, and LCD flat-panel TVs (dis-
cussed in the next section). But LCD can also be used for a projection
TV system, using three tiny (about 1" measured diagonally) LCDs
through which a bright light is shined. Each of the LCDs handles a spe-
cific color (red, green, and blue), and the converged images make up a
full-color image on the screen. LCD projection TVs are high resolution
(HDTV). However, many are not capable of the full 1080p resolution and
top out at 720p.
 LCoS: The newest technology for microprojection systems is called
liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS). This technology, familiar to many
through brand names such as Sony’s SXRD, is a new variant of LCD tech-
nology that embeds the LCD crystals on a computer chip. The big func-
tional difference is that LCoS systems reflect the light that makes up the
picture instead of transmitting it through an LCD panel like LCD projec-
tion TV does. This provides a noticeably brighter picture. Like DLP, most
LCoS projection systems are capable of 1080p resolutions.
When compared to the flat-panel TVs we discuss in the following section, pro-
jection TVs are a bit bulkier (at least the rear-projection units are), but they
are cheaper and can offer a bigger picture. We think rear-projection systems
offer the most bang for the buck for many users, while front-projection sys-
tems are the ultimate in big screen systems (think 100" diagonally).
Hang your TV on the wall: Flat-screen TVs
The hot item in the TV world today is the flat-screen TV. Similar to the screen
of a notebook computer stretched to previously unimagined proportions,
these new TVs use computer technologies such as LCD (liquid crystal diode)
and plasma display systems to provide a large-screen television system that
is usually only 4" or 5" deep. Hundreds of different models are on the market.
You can find flat-screen TVs at big home-electronics stores and warehouse
clubs, as well as in more mainstream stores such as Wal-Mart and Target. The
first models were super expensive, often costing $12,000 to $15,000. Since
then there’s been an explosion of manufacturers getting into the flat-panel TV
game and prices have plummeted. Now you can easily find a 50" plasma
HDTV for about $2000, only a few hundred dollars more than microprojection
rear-projection TVs of the same size.
You can also find smaller and cheaper flat-panel TVs for those parts of your
home that don’t need (or can’t fit) a big TV. The market is almost overrun
with inexpensive 20" to 30" LCD TVs that can fit anywhere in your home —
and often double as PC monitors to boot.
82
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

The two technologies in the flat screen world are
 Plasma: These TVs use a special grid of electrodes that excite a gas into a
plasma state, putting off light. Plasma TVs typically start off at 42" (though
some smaller models are on the market), and the sweet spot for plasma
begins at about 50". Most plasma TVs are limited to a 720p resolution,
though the first 1080p plasmas are hitting the market as we write this.
 LCD: The same LCD technology used in projection TVs and computer
monitors has hit the TV market with a vengeance, and hundreds of man-
ufacturers are offering LCD flat-panel TVs of different sizes. For the most
part, the sweet spot in the market for LCD is TVs smaller than 42", but
several manufacturers have begun to offer LCD TVs that compete head-
on with plasma in the 50" and above range. When comparing LCD to
plasma, you will find that you pay a bit more for the same size screen,
but you do get a full 1080p resolution.
83
Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck
Making the plasma versus LCD decision
As folks shop for flat-panel TVs, many are con-
fused about the choice between plasma and
LCD, particularly as LCD TVs get bigger and
bigger and begin to encroach into plasma terri-
tory. (It used to be easy: If you wanted 50" or
more, you got plasma; smaller than 42", you got
LCD.)
Well it is a difficult choice, but the good news is
that you’re choosing between two very good
alternatives. Putting aside the pricing and size
for a moment (though you should consider those
too), let’s look at the differences:
 Plasma TVs (and we’re speaking generally
here) have better color reproduction, better
blacks, a wider viewing angle (meaning you
can sit farther to the side and still see a
good picture) and a smoother picture during
rapidly moving scenes (such as in sports).
On the downside, they tend to be heavier,
run hotter, use more electricity, and are
often limited to 720p resolutions (which isn’t
the end of the world, but more is always
better when it comes to resolution).
 LCD TVs (again speaking generally) have
higher resolutions, use less power and —
most importantly to some folks — are not
susceptible to burn-in (or image retention)
when a static image (such as a video game)
is on the screen for hours on end. Where
LCD TVs fall down is in the viewing angle and
in the response time (the measure of how
quickly the picture changes on screen).
These lines get blurrier every day. For example,
1080p plasmas are now available, and most plas-
mas are pretty much immune to burn-in when
used with just a modicum of care (for example,
not leaving the stock ticker on for three days
straight). And LCDs are being designed with
wider viewing angles and faster response times
to improve their viewing experience.
In the end, we still generally recommend
plasma for really big flat panels (over 60") and
LCD for the relatively smaller ones (37" and
below). In between, we think the decision
comes down to a TV-by-TV comparison rather
than a technology-by-technology one.

If you’re considering buying a flat screen, keep in mind that the same amount
of money could buy a projection TV that’s bigger and (potentially) has a
better picture. However, nothing is cooler than hanging your TV on the wall.
Video source components
Video source components are the magic black boxes that let you record or
watch movies, play games, watch the baby, or even surf the Web on your
home’s televisions. A huge number of video source components are on the
market (and probably already in your home), including the following:
 VCR (videocassette recorders)
 PVR (personal video recorder) such TiVo or a PVR built into a cable or
satellite set-top box, which uses a hard drive to record, store, and play
back video
84
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 
Serving up media
Over the past few years, the world of PCs and
home-video and home-audio entertainment
components have mixed in an exciting way. You
can put a TV-tuner card in your PC and watch
cable on it, or you can plug the PC into your TV
and use its DVD player, online streaming video
player, and MP3 jukebox to play back material on
your audio/video network’s big screen and good
speakers. Perhaps the neatest development of
all, however, is the rise of PC technology-based
media servers that store videos, music, digital
pictures, and other content on a hard drive and
then connect to both your PCs and audio/video
systems. With a media server, you can watch
videos, listen to audio, and look at any digital pic-
tures on any display devices or networked audio
systems in your house.
PCs equipped with Media Center Edition soft-
ware (Windows XP or Vista) are a great example
of the current generation of media players, as
are the multitude of MP3 audio jukebox devices
that can store your CD collection on a computer
hard drive. This initial generation of media
servers sits next to your TV or audio amplifier and
plays back media over that local connection —
much like a DVD player or CD player does today.
Request (www.request.com) uses the TV as
the interface to these media servers and allows
remote servers to synchronize so that you never
have to worry that your favorite song is on the
other server. But like stand-alone players, media
servers can be incorporated in your home-
entertainment network so you can use them any-
where in the house.
Companies such as Apple Computer are also
releasing media server devices, such as the
newly announced Apple TV, which allows you
to connect to your iTunes library on a Mac or PC
to bring audio to your receiver and video to your
TV over a networked connection. You can use
the Apple TV to purchase and download movies
from Apple’s iTunes Store and play them back
on your computer or on your TV whenever and
wherever you want.
You can also build your own media server, using
a fast PC with a big hard drive, the proper audio
and video cards, and some specialized software.
We talk about creating these PCs in Chapter 12.

PVRs are also often called DVRs (or digital video recorders)
 Laserdisc player (rare, but not quite gone yet)
 DVD (digital versatile disc or digital video disc) player — including the
new high-definition variants, Blu-ray and HD-DVD
 In-home video devices such as a doorbell camera or a video baby monitor
 Video game machine
 PC (such as one outfitted with Windows XP or Vista Media Center
Edition software) that can work as a PVR, an Internet content player, a
DVD player, and more
Most folks tend to view these kinds of video source devices as dedicated,
one-room components. If you want to watch a movie on the DVD player, for
example, you go to the room that has the DVD player. In a properly net-
worked home, however, you can connect your video source devices to your
video network and use them from any TV in the house. (We show you how 
in Chapters 6 and 7!)
TV Connections from the Outside World
An important part of television is its capability to bring programming into
your home from the world beyond. Like televisions themselves, these con-
nections to the outside world are undergoing a series of major changes. New
ways of receiving programming are becoming common, and established
methods are revamping themselves for a digital world.
Broadcast TV
In spite of the proliferation of cable and satellite television and compact discs,
old media such as broadcast television and radio are still alive and kicking. In
addition, increasing consumer acceptance of DBS satellite television systems
has resulted in a resurgence of demand for run-of-the-mill television anten-
nas. Why? Unless you live in a big city, these systems might not carry pro-
gramming from the big networks or local stations. If this scenario sounds
familiar, you need to keep some level of cable television service or buy an
antenna to watch local news or the local weather report.
Another factor behind the survival — and resurgence — of the antenna is 
the transition to HDTV and digital broadcasting. Most folks in the United
States can now pick up several free over-the-air HDTV broadcasts and, with
an HDTV with a built-in tuner, get HDTV for the cost of an antenna and some
cabling.
85
Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck

Luckily, television antennas have improved too, so without spending too much
money, you can avoid the nightmare of fine-tuning a set of rabbit ears on top of
your television. The two general categories of television antenna are
 Indoor antennas: These antennas sit on or near your television.
 Outdoor antennas: These antennas mount on your roof or alongside
your DBS satellite dish.
Whether your television antenna is outside or inside, you have to connect it
to the TV. Most modern antennas use the same coaxial cable that cable televi-
sion and DBS satellite systems use. (See Chapter 7 for strategies for wiring
antennas into your video network.)
Choosing the right antenna for your location can be complex. Luckily, an
online resource will do it for you. Just point your Web browser to www.
antennaweb.org and click the button that says Choose an Antenna. The
system asks you a few questions about your location and the type of home
you have (for example, a single story versus multiple story) and then calcu-
lates the type of antenna you need to buy. As a bonus, the system tells you
exactly which digital broadcasts are available in your area, and even gets
down to the level of detail of telling you which way to point your antenna 
(if you need to use a directional antenna to pick up faraway signals). The
Antenna Web system uses a color-coding scheme that matches the color
codes on the boxes of the antennas in the stores (or online), so you can
simply find the color (or colors) you need when shopping.
Cable TV
The prevalence of cable service nationwide makes it an important part of any
home-networking strategy — for both you and future owners of your home.
And with the range of services offered by cable companies, you can get a lot
more than television (Internet access and even telephone service, for example).
The operation of a cable system is straightforward. A central office, or head-
end site (similar to the central equipment office of the telephone company),
receives television signals from various sources (mainly from satellite feeds
as well as local over-the-air broadcasts). Cable companies then assign the 
signals to specific channels and distribute them over a combination of fiber-
optic and coaxial cables (which, coincidentally, make up the final portion of
the network that enters your home). The two types of cable TV systems are
analog systems and digital systems. In most parts of the United States, analog
systems are being phased out in favor of digital systems, but this transition
will take years to complete.
86
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

When your cable system goes totally digital, you will need either a digital set-
top box or a digital cable-ready TV (discussed in the upcoming “Digital cable”
section) to receive TV stations in your home.
Analog cable
The channel system for cable is different than the one for over-the-air broad-
cast television. Therefore, the frequency of, say, Channel 20 on a cable
system is likely different than the frequency of Channel 20 in a broadcast
environment. What this difference means to a you as a homeowner is that
you can’t plug your cable TV feed into the back of any old television and
expect it to work. Instead, you have two options:
 Cable-ready television set or VCR: You select a cable mode and then
use the internal television tuner to decode and display the television sig-
nals. Most TVs made in the last few years are cable-ready, so all you
have to do is plug the coaxial cable into the back of the TV and you’re
set (after you run through the setup routines to set the time, add the
channels, and so forth).
Note: Cable-ready TVs do have a few disadvantages. Most of these sets
can receive only a limited number of channels. Second, these sets prob-
ably can’t take advantage of special services from the cable company, such
as digital cable, premium movie channels, and pay-per-view programs.
 Set-top box (or converter): These devices use a single broadcast 
channel (usually Channel 3 or 4) to feed the cable television signals to
your television. With your television tuned to that single channel, you
channel-surf through the set-top box. For digital cable services, which
we discuss in a moment, you must use a set-top box or a special kind of
cable-ready TV known as DCR, or digital cable ready.
Digital cable
Cable set-top services are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Most cable
providers now offer a digital service, with two-way communications from the
head end to the box and back again. The fancy set-top boxes used with these
services have lots of extra built-in features, such as an onscreen program
guide, reminder timers, VCR timers, and hard drives to store shows online for
later viewing (PVR service, in other words). As an aside, this is an example 
of competition at work: When we wrote the first edition of this book, only
DBS satellite systems offered this kind of neat TV functionality, but the cable 
companies responded to the threat and now match the DBS providers feature
for feature.
Most digital television signals sent over digital cable systems (which aren’t
even all the channels you get — lower numbered channels are still sent in
analog on most systems) are not ATSC, SDTV, or HDTV signals. They’re just
NTSC signals transmitted digitally using a system called QAM (quadrature
87
Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck

amplitude modulation — say that fast three times!). Most cable companies
are sending at least a few HDTV channels to their customers, but the majority
of channels are still old-fashioned NTSC.
To tune into digital cable, you need one of the two following things:
 A digital set-top box: This is the modern-day equivalent of the cable con-
verter, described in the previous section. Digital cable set-top boxes con-
tain the QAM tuner that turns digital cable broadcasts into something
your TV can display and the conditional access system that can unscram-
ble premium channels. The digital set-top also includes an onscreen 
interface that lets you see a channel guide, program the PVR (if one is
included), and select and view Video on Demand (VoD) programming.
 A digital cable-ready (or DCR) TV: A growing number of TVs, particu-
larly HDTVs, include a QAM tuner that lets you plug directly into the
cable TV feed to pick up analog and digital cable signals without a set-
top box — including HDTV signals. A smaller subset of these TVs
include a device known as the CableCARD (see the sidebar titled “What’s
the CableCARD all about?” for more on this), which handles the condi-
tional access tasks so that you can view premium, scrambled channels
without a set-top box.
88
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 
What’s the CableCARD all about?
The CableCARD system is a smart card that you
can rent from your cable company and plug into
a special slot on CableCARD-equipped TVs (and
even other devices, such as TiVo PVRs or — in
the near future — CableCARD-equipped PCs.
The CableCARD lets you decode (unscramble)
premium channels without a set-top box. It
makes for a nice, neat installation, with just a
single coaxial cable running from the wall into
your TV.
Sounds great, huh? Well, there are problems.
First, cable companies prefer to rent you a set-
top box, so support for the CableCARD (although
it is mandated by law) is weak. Second, and
more importantly, the CableCARD is a one-way
system that doesn’t provide communications
back to the cable company. So no onscreen
program guide, no VoD, none of the fun new
stuff that makes digital cable so attractive.
There is good news on this front, however. The
FCC (Federal Communications Commission) 
has mandated that cable companies use the
CableCARD system within their own set-top
boxes by July 2007, so development of a two-
way CableCARD system that supports onscreen
guides and VoD is well under way. We think that
CableCARD, as it exists today, is fine for the bed-
room TV, but not so great for the main home-
theater room. When the 2.0 (two-way) version
becomes available, we think it will be an inter-
esting alternative to a digital cable set-top box.

Satellite TV
Millions of homeowners are cutting the cord to cable TV and installing satel-
lite TV receivers. Satellite TV, especially the new, small-dish varieties, can
provide high-quality video programming — with more channels than all but 
a handful of cable systems — to homes just about anywhere in the world.
Direct broadcast satellite TV
If you look around your neighborhood, you’ve no doubt noticed a profusion of
small (18" to be exact), white or gray satellite dishes popping up on housetops.
These are receiving dishes for direct broadcast satellite (DBS) television.
Here’s what you get when you choose DBS:
 Channels galore: Depending on which service and service level you buy,
you can get hundreds of channels.
HDTV channels are increasingly a big part of what DBS providers are
offering.
 Digital quality: DBS systems use MPEG-2 to transmit channels digitally,
reducing interference. The majority of these channels are NTSC, not
ATSC. Also, as with digital cable, a few of the channels are in HDTV.
Both of the big satellite TV providers — DISH network and DIRECTV —
are moving towards a newer version of MPEG: MPEG-4. This will allow
even more channels (including local channels and hundreds of HDTV
channels) to become available on their systems. If you have an older
satellite receiver and dish, however, you’ll need to upgrade to pick up
the new satellites broadcasting in MPEG-4
 Audio channels: Plug into your stereo or home theater for audio-only
programming.
 Easy-to-use graphical interfaces: Easy-to-view menus, with telephone-
line access to providers for pay-per-view programming.
 Internet access: With a slightly different dish, you can also have high-
speed Internet access, as we discuss in Chapter 13.
As with everything, DBS has some downsides:
 You might not get local programming: In rural parts of the country, you
still need a broadcast antenna or basic cable television service to view
local channels and local news as well as broadcast (FOX, ABC, NBC, and
CBS) programs.
89
Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck

 You need a receiver: The receiver acts like a digital cable converter box
and converts the satellite’s digital television signals to signals that your
television can understand. If you have more than one television, you
may want additional receivers for each TV because, like a cable con-
verter box, the receiver puts out only one channel at a time. (We tell 
you how to share a single receiver with multiple TVs — but keep in mind
that you’ll be watching the same thing on each set.)
 You need an available telephone line: The receiver must be plugged into
a telephone line to communicate with the DBS provider’s headquarters 
for billing and service provisioning. This can be your normal phone line,
because the system typically talks to headquarters in the middle of the
night when most of us are asleep. Digital cable, however, talks back to the
head end over the cable line, so it doesn’t need that extra phone jack.
 You need to be able to “see” the satellite: You may have a hard time
getting a satellite signal if you live in an area far away from the satellite’s
orbit. If you live in upstate Maine, for instance, you may have more prob-
lems getting an EchoStar signal than a DIRECTV signal because of the
satellite’s physical location. (In some cases, the dish has to be aimed so
low towards the horizon that mountains and atmospheric clutter can get
in the way.)
 You have to install the system: The system isn’t hard to install, but
something about getting up on the roof conjures up visions of back
surgery. Of course, you can mount the dish on the side of your house or
put it in the yard. One company even makes nifty fake rocks that cover
the dish and keep your neighbors happy. And a growing number of com-
panies will do the installation for free.
When we wrote the first edition of this book, DBS systems had a huge advan-
tage over cable in terms of features and quality. As we mentioned earlier in this
chapter, cable companies have reacted to this competitive threat, and now 
digital cable systems provide most of the same bells and whistles: digital trans-
mission (of at least some channels), onscreen programming guides, music
channels, and so on. We like both systems. Compare prices and features in
your town before you decide. One new feature is video on demand, which lets
you watch movies (for a fee) like you watch VCR tapes and DVDs — you can
pause, rewind, and fast forward. This feature is more prevalent (for technical
reasons) with digital cable than with DBS, but DBS providers are experimenting
with built-in PVRs to allow a similar service on their networks.
Two competing DBS systems are currently on the market in the United States.
Compare prices and services and choose the one you like best. As we write
this, DIRECTV and EchoStar have agreed to a merger and are just awaiting
regulatory approval. So don’t be surprised if there’s just one “choice” when
you go shopping.
90
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

 DIRECTV: DIRECTV (www.directv.com) uses an 18" dish (bigger for
some locations and for receiving all the new MPEG-4 broadcasts) and
the digital MPEG system to send its audio and video signals. A variety of
companies manufacture the widely available DIRECTV hardware — and
a few TV manufacturers incorporate DIRECTV receivers into their high-
end TVs.
 EchoStar, or the DISH network: EchoStar (www.dishnet.com) is simi-
lar to DIRECTV, using an 18" dish (or, like DIRECTV, bigger for local chan-
nels and MPEG-4) and digital MPEG encoding technology to transmit its
video and audio. EchoStar sells their own receivers.
If you live in Canada, you’re prohibited from getting DIRECTV or EchoStar
service. These are legal prohibitions, not physical ones, because the satellite
signals cover much of Canada. Bell Canada offers a similar system called
ExpressVu (www.expressvu.com).
C Band
The grandfather of today’s DBS satellite television systems is the C Band
satellite system — those huge satellite dishes that used to sprout like mon-
strous mushrooms. At about seven feet across, the average C Band dish is
expensive and difficult to place. Zoning restrictions keep C Band dishes out
of many suburban areas, so you tend to see them only in rural areas. Still, in
the early 1980s, having one of these dishes in your backyard meant that you
could pick up channels from all over the world. Unfortunately, many of the
channels that C Band systems once picked up for free are now encrypted, so
you must subscribe to a service to receive them.
The advent of DBS and almost universal access to cable television has
severely limited the growth of the consumer C Band marketplace. These
days, most C Band users are either satellite hobbyists or businesses, such as
hotels. Many television networks and cable systems also use C Band systems
to distribute programming.
91
Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck
Satellites and your home
If you decide to go with a satellite dish, you may
run into some resistance from homeowner’s
associations, neighborhood covenants, zoning
laws, and the like. Don’t take this lying down —
the FCC ruled in 2001 that these laws can’t be
used to prevent you from installing a small dish
(not a big C-band seven footer!). The only big
exceptions are for safety (for example, you can’t
be too close to a power line) and for homes in
historic districts. Otherwise, no one can keep
you from using a dish if you want to. Know your
rights. Look online at http://www.fcc.
gov/mb/facts/otard.html for the long-
winded bureaucratese text of this ruling.

C Band refers to the chunk of frequency spectrum allocated to these serv-
ices. DBS satellite systems use the Ku band — though only hard-core satellite
techie types call them Ku band systems.
Audio Systems
The other piece of the entertainment puzzle is an audio system — compo-
nents that will play back your own music collection, radio, and the sound
from movies, TV, and audio-only channels on cable and satellite systems.
Today’s audio systems are designed to reproduce audio signals in high
fidelity. In other words, the equipment should recreate the music so that it
sounds like it did in the studio or concert hall where your favorite recordings
were made.
A high-fidelity sound system has several components:
 Source component: This component can be a CD player (or one of the
new SACD or DVD audio players), a cassette deck, a radio tuner, a satel-
lite tuner (such as an XM radio), an MP3 player or jukebox, or the audio
portion of a video source such as a VCR, laser disc, or DVD. The source
component produces a low-level audio signal — called a line-level 
signal — that’s usually transmitted over an RCA cable.
 Preamplifier or control amplifier: This device amplifies (or increases
the power of) the line-level signal and also serves as a switching device
to allow you to select from different source components. The preampli-
fier also contains a volume control, which determines how much the
signal is amplified. The control amplifier connects through another inter-
connect cable (or internal wiring if you’re using an integrated amplifier)
to the next stage in the sound reproduction process.
 Power amplifier: This unit adds more power to the audio signal —
enough power to make your audio signal audible through the speakers.
The preamplifier doesn’t have enough power to drive your speakers. (Yes,
we know it sounds silly to have two amplifiers, but that’s just how it is.)
Note: An integrated amplifier is a preamplifier and a power amplifier inte-
grated into one component. Add a radio tuner to this box, and you have
a receiver.
 Loudspeakers: Connected to the amplifier by speaker cables (what
else?), the speakers use electromagnets to move sound drivers — the
woofer and tweeter — back and forth. This movement, which corre-
sponds with the audio signal coming from the amplifier, pushes the air in
front of the drivers rhythmically, creating the sound waves that you
92
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

hear. Loudspeakers can range from a full surround-sound five- or seven-
speaker home-entertainment center to remote speakers in your kitchen
or dining room to the intercom speakers throughout your house.
As audio systems expand from a single room to multiple rooms, a new breed
of component has come onto the marketplace — the multizone system.
Traditional audio systems have always been single zone, meaning that the
control portion of the preamplifier — the switches that let you select which
audio source you want to listen to — lets you select only one source at a
time. This is fine for a stereo system that you’re using in only one room (you
can’t really listen to more than one thing at once, right?), but this solution
lacks flexibility for multiple rooms.
Newer, multizone systems have control sections that let you select more than
one source component at once. You and your spouse can listen to a Dunne
Roman CD in the living room and your kids can “emo” out to Fall Out Boy in
the basement. As we mentioned, if you want to use a multizone system, you
need additional amplifiers — one for each independent source that you want
to play back at one time.
Intercom Systems
Unlike a stereo system, an intercom system isn’t designed with the highest
audio quality in mind. Its main function is to get your voice from point A to
point B without weakening or incurring interference. Intercoms aren’t cheap
or unsophisticated; they just have a different mission.
Intercoms fall into two main categories:
 Wireless systems: These intercoms use radio transceivers (transmitter
and receiver) to carry voice signals from room to room. Just install a
simple device on your desk, raise the antenna (and do the same with 
the other device), and you’re ready to communicate. Variations on this
theme include fixed wireless intercoms (which you can mount on the
wall), portable baby monitors, and many cordless phones that use a
speakerphone on the base station to create a simple, point-to-point
intercom system.
 Wired systems: As the name implies, these intercoms are wired together
and send your voice as an electrical audio signal between rooms. Wired
intercom systems run the gamut from simple voice systems to advanced
audio systems that can also carry radio and other audio signals. 
Figure 5-3 shows a typical wired intercom system. Some telephone systems
have intercom systems; these are covered in more detail in Chapter 10.
93
Chapter 5: Breaking the Entertainment Bottleneck

Intercoms can be a useful feature (though phone networks can serve a simi-
lar function). Danny finds his intercom useful in his four-story house. The
Fisher Price monitor that he and his wife used with the first set of twins has
been replaced with a simple press of the Monitor button on the Nursery
intercom unit. The babies’ cries can now be heard all over the house. (Wait,
is that good?)
Most decent intercom systems have an audio in source option, too, whereby
you can plug your home-entertainment system into your intercom system. By
tying the two together, you save yourself money.
As you map your wiring runs, keep in mind that many intercom manufactur-
ers void your warranty if you don’t use their proprietary wiring systems.
However, using their wiring is more expensive and goes against the idea of a
uniform backbone over which all communications travel.

Getting Video Where You Want It
In This Chapter
 Choosing between base or broad
 Going the distance
 Getting the most with coaxial cable
 Doing the modulate thing
You can wire gobs of capabilities into a video network — a much greater
variety of choices than is possible in most other networks we discuss
(such as data networks or phone networks). That’s the good news. The bad
news is that we have to hold the number of pages in this book to less than
that of the Encyclopedia Britannica, so we can’t go into all the possible
choices. On second thought, maybe that’s good news, too, because rather
than confusing you with a laundry list of all the different video possibilities
and boring you with technical drivel on this super-video whatsit and that
video-switching doodad, we concentrate on showing you how to wire the
most common video network features. These features include the following:
 Coaxial video outlets in all rooms that may one day contain a television
 In-home video connections in rooms that may contain video sources,
from VCRs to baby-monitor cameras
 Inputs for cable television and a broadcast TV antenna
 Provisions for adding a DBS satellite system to the network
 A central distribution node tying all this good stuff together
These devices, taken together, make up the video backbone in your smart
home. The network we lay out for you uses broadband RF video distribution
(whew!), which means most of your video is being distributed as “channels”
of video that are picked up by TV tuners at various locations in your home.
This type of distribution network takes care of the broadcast, cable, and
satellite TV signals coming into your home and gets them to your TVs.

For in-home sources of video such as surveillance cameras or video sources
that you want to share with other rooms such as DVD players, you can create
your own TV stations that bring those signals from one point to another. The
traditional approach for such in-home TV stations has the use of special
devices called video modulators, which send the signals from video sources
(such as VCRs or security cameras) through the wires in your walls and
broadcast them on TV channels not used by your local or cable TV stations.
Just tune to the right channel — like you tune to Channel 3 for your VCR —
and you can watch these sources anywhere in your house. Unfortunately, for
folks with digital cable or satellite systems, modulators don’t always work
reliably — or at all — because there simply aren’t any empty channels avail-
able to use for your in-home sources. In Chapter 7 we talk about some sys-
tems that use wireless or CAT-5e/6 cabling (the cable used for computer
networks) to get your video around the house.
In this chapter and the next, we take you through the process of wiring a
home-video network backbone.
Distance Counts in Video Signals
You can get video signals from place to place in two basic ways: baseband distri-
bution and broadband distribution. The difference between these two methods
is in the amount of information that the cable carries. A baseband transmission
carries only a single channel of video, so you generally use baseband cable for
the connections between video components such as your DVD player and TV.
Generally, baseband cables are short. Broadband (or RF — radio frequency)
systems (such as coaxial cable used for antennas or cable TV), on the other
hand, are designed to carry many video channels over greater distances.
Cabling between components 
(A/V interconnect cables)
Baseband video is the distribution of a single channel or program over a
cable. The Video Out port on the back of VCRs, cable converters, satellite
receivers, DVD and laserdisc players, and camcorders are baseband video
signals, as are the S-video ports of the same devices (we discuss S-video in
more detail shortly). In general, baseband video distribution is best suited 
for connections over a short distance, such as between components in the
same room. Baseband video uses video patch cables to connect components
in a system and requires audio patch cables to carry the corresponding audio
signals — because you need both sets of cables, we refer to this set of cables
as A/V interconnect cables.
96
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Home systems commonly use three types of analog A/V interconnect video
cables (which we list from least sophisticated to most sophisticated):
 Composite video: This connection system is on all video source devices.
Composite video carries all components of an NTSC video signal over a
single wire and connects devices using standard RCA or phono plugs —
the same type of plugs used to connect stereo components such as CD
players and amplifiers. See Figure 6-1. (For more on NTSC, the standard
U.S. television system, see Chapter 5.)
 S-video: You find S-video on more sophisticated VCRs and on DVD play-
ers, DBS dishes, digital cable boxes, as well as on many camcorders.
This method uses a single cable with multiple conductors to carry the
brightness and color parts of a video signal separately, resulting in a
better picture. See Figure 6-2.
 Component video: The majority of DVD players and most new televi-
sions have component connections, usually in addition to composite
and S-video connections. (You also find component video connections
on some digital TV receivers — it’s one of the most common ways of 
carrying HDTV signals to an HDTV.) Component video breaks down the
video signal into three parts, each carried on a separate cable. This
breakdown lets you avoid much of the internal circuitry in both your
DVD player and your TV, so you get a better picture. At least that’s what
all of the videophiles we know tell us. You can see component video con-
nectors in Figure 6-3.

97
Chapter 6: Getting Video Where You Want It

When more than one of these options is available to you, always choose the
most sophisticated. If your source and TV both have component video, use
that. Most of these source devices also have an RF (antenna cable) output
that works on Channel 3 or 4 of your TV, but you should consider this choice
only as a last resort because the video quality will most likely be lower than
one of the baseband connections.
In the digital video — HDTV — world, some digital video interconnects can
replace the rat’s nest of wires (up to nine of them) connecting digital TV
receivers, DVD players, and other high-definition sources (such as the Sony
Playstation 3 gaming console) to HDTV monitors.
Several competing efforts are underway to standardize connectors and incor-
porate a DRM (digital rights management — or copy protection) system.
Following are the leading candidates in the fight for standardized digital inter-
connection of video equipment:
 DVI, or Digital Video Interconnect: This is a familiar connection to most
PC owners, because DVI has been an option for connecting PCs to moni-
tors for some time. In the TV world, a variant of DVI called DVD-D is
included on many HDTVs and source devices (such as DVD players). 
DVI connections used in the TV world include a copy protection scheme
called HDCP (High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection), which is
designed to keep users from making unauthorized copies of a program.
DVI is being slowly but surely phased out in new home-entertainment
gear in favor of HDMI, discussed next.
 HDMI, or High-Definition Multimedia Interface: HDMI is, for all intents
and purposes, a souped-up, supercharged replacement for DVI. HDMI is
unique among all A/V interconnect technologies we discuss here because it
carries both video and audio signals over a single cable. In addition, HDMI,
unlike the other AV interconnects, can carry the highest quality HDTV sig-
nals (called 1080p). Like DVI, HDMI includes the HDCP copy protection (or
should we say, prevention) system. Figure 6-4 shows an HDMI connector.
 FireWire, or IEEE 1394 (or one of many other brand names): This is a
more open, computer-like interface that isn’t included on most TVs or
video source devices, but a few manufacturers do use FireWire. It’s most
commonly found on PCs and Macs and on video cameras and is used to
connect these devices to each other.

Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Digital video connections such as HDMI are great — they offer both conve-
nience and the utmost in picture quality. But digital video connections have
some gotchas. That’s because content owners — the TV and movie studios —
want tight control over the Digital Rights Management (DRM) aspect of digital
entertainment. Because you can make bit-for-bit perfect copies of digital mater-
ial, they’re pushing their own digital interconnect technologies that incorpo-
rate strong encryption and authentication techniques. These schemes tend to
tie the material to a specific format and device, so they may keep you from
using the media in a different way — such as playing it on your computer or
recording it to watch in the bedroom or your vacation house.
Keep an eye on these standards as you shop for an HDTV. For most folks,
HDMI is the connection of choice for HDTVs, but a few manufacturers are still
pushing FireWire. Within the realm of HDMI, there are some variants — HDMI
Version 1.3 is the latest version as we write in early 2007, and if you have the
choice, it’s the way to go.
Cabling the video-distribution 
network (broadband)
A broadband (or RF) video-distribution system combines many different
video signals — and their corresponding audio signals — onto a single cable
by modulating the signals onto different radio frequencies, or channels. In
simplest terms, this process involves dividing the available bandwidth of a
cable into equal parts (channels), and then placing the information repre-
senting the video program into one of these channels by varying the electri-
cal signal in some standard way (this is the actual modulation). These
frequency divisions correspond to the standard channels on your television,
which has an internal tuner that demodulates the signal and displays it on
the screen. Figure 6-5 shows how program signals are assigned by broadcast-
ers or cable service providers to different frequencies (channels) and sent
over the same cable.
Figure 6-4:
The HDMI

choice.
99
Chapter 6: Getting Video Where You Want It

Broadcast and cable networks modulate multiple channels. (In the case of
broadcast, the modulation doesn’t use up bandwidth on a cable but rather
divides the over-the-air radio frequency spectrum into smaller parts). Just
about all video source devices include a broadband output — usually 
switchable between Channel 3 and Channel 4. An internal modulator con-
verts the baseband video signal into a modulated video signal, and allows
you to connect the source to older televisions that don’t have baseband
video inputs.
Coaxial Video Networks
Although you can create a video network without running cables (as
described in Chapter 7), running cables for your network almost always
increases performance, flexibility, and capacity. Wireless alternatives are 
usually more expensive than their cabled partners, and they do less. 
Bottom line: Anytime you can build a video network by running wires, we 
recommend that you do so.
The wired version of a video network is one that distributes video signals
(separated into different channels) over coaxial cable to each television in
your home. If you’ve had cable TV, you’ve had a network similar to what we
describe, except that traditional cable TV networks have been paltry, one-
way video networks in comparison to the two-way video-distribution system
that we describe.
Cable-modem broadband services run on coaxial cable. Because they 
send data in two directions — as do the new digital cable set-top boxes —
cable modems affect your coaxial video network design. We discuss the
implications of these technologies as we go through building a network in
Chapter 7.

Coaxial cable
Coaxial cable — usually called coax — is a metallic cable most often used for
transmitting radio frequency (RF) signals such as broadband television video
and radio signals. Coaxial cable has two conductors, or axes, that carry data.
A layer of dielectric insulating material surrounds a single center conductor.
The other conductor is a metal shield that goes around the dielectric (insu-
lating) layer. The outermost layer of coax cable is an insulating jacket.
Coaxial cables are rated by their impedance, which is basically the AC ver-
sion of electrical resistance. Different applications require different imped-
ances. In the home, almost all systems that require coaxial cable use 75-ohm
impedance coax, although some computer LAN systems (older ones, not
commonly found in the home) use 50-ohm coax. (Ohm is the unit of measure-
ment for impedance.) Table 6-1 lists the three main type of coaxial cable
found in homes.

101
Chapter 6: Getting Video Where You Want It

You may encounter coaxial cables labeled RG6QS or RG6 Quad Shield, which
means that the cable has four layers of additional shielding beneath the cable
jacket. These layers provide additional protection from external interference.
The difference between RG-59 and RG6QS is similar to the difference between
CAT-3 and CAT-5e/6 UTP cables, which we discuss in Chapters 11 and 15. They
look similar and do similar things, but the higher-rated cable is a bit more
capable of carrying your signals cleanly — and for longer distances. The
price difference is minimal, and we strongly recommend that you choose
RG6QS for your coaxial cabling needs; the small extra cost ensures that your
wiring can handle the future needs of your network. In fact, applications such
as DBS require RG6QS and specifically tell you not to use RG-59.
Coax connectors
Like almost all the networking cable we cover, coaxial cables use standard-
ized connectors. Residential applications use only one type of connector —
the F connector, which is shown in Figure 6-6. If you have cable television,
you’re already familiar with this screw or push-on connector.
Like most connectors, F connectors come in male and female versions. In
general, female connectors are on video equipment and wall outlets, and
male connectors are used to attach the cables to these outlets.
Components
The cable and connectors are the permanent parts of your video-network
infrastructure — the parts that you put in your walls and expect to keep
there for 20 years or so. The other components that your video network

Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

needs, such as distribution panels and modulators, will probably be less per-
manent members of your household electronic family. Over time, your net-
work needs may change and new technologies such as digital television will
become available, precipitating changes in some of your network compo-
nents. These changes will cost money (the price of progress?), but the main
part of your investment — namely the materials and labor used in installing
the coaxial cabling in your walls — will remain intact and useful.
Outlets
If you’re like us, you don’t want coaxial cables and F connectors dangling out
of holes in the wall. Luckily, an assortment of coaxial cable in-wall outlets fit
into standard electrical junction boxes and use standard faceplates. Dozens
of companies manufacture these outlets, which come in many combinations
and sizes. If your budget allows, we recommend running two RG6 cables to
each room. The first coaxial cable allows you to receive video signals from 
an external source such as cable TV. The second lets you send out video 
signals — from devices such as DVD players or baby monitors — to the rest
of the home. You might not want to run two cables to every spot in your
home, but certain areas will require that you do.
A coaxial outlet for this cabling consists of two female F connectors, one
above the other, in a compact, single-gang junction box. Single-gang means
that the Dalton boys don’t ride with Jesse James. Okay, gang simply refers to
the size of the box and cover. For reference, a single-gang junction box is the
same size as a typical two-receptacle electrical outlet or a single light switch.
Many twin coaxial outlets have large faceplate openings and use a standard-
sized faceplate called a Leviton Decora. (These are the same faceplates
accompanying large light switches in many newer homes.)
As you design your home networks, you may find that you want to put sev-
eral different kinds of outlets together on a wall — speaker connections for
an audio network, a phone line or two, and your coaxial outlets, for example.
Consider using a larger double- or triple-gang junction box and installing a
multipurpose outlet that can terminate all these cables in one place. Most
major outlet manufacturers make all sorts of combination outlets.
Low-voltage signals such as coaxial video networks don’t get along with AC
power lines. You should keep at least three feet between the two to avoid
noise and interference. Never try to connect your coaxial lines and power
lines in the same junction box — the result is a mess. If you’re building a
house, make sure that the electrical and communications cables are not
through the same holes in the studs — some contractors do this, thinking
that it’s compact and tidier.

Chapter 6: Getting Video Where You Want It

Distribution panel
The key component in your video network is the distribution panel. This device
is the central node for your video network — all coaxial lines to the various
rooms of your house begin here. A distribution panel has several functions:
 It accepts one or optimally more coaxial, broadband, or video signal
input.
 It combines these input signals into a unified broadband output.
 It splits this output to feed multiple video endpoints (in other words, 
televisions).
 It amplifies the outgoing signals to make them stronger (because split-
ting the signal weakens it).
Figure 6-7 shows a typical video-distribution panel.
When you’re shopping for a video-distribution panel, look for the following:
 Number of inputs: Choose a unit that has at least two (and preferably
more) inputs. Doing so allows you to take a local video source (such as a
DVD player) and distribute its signals throughout your home, instead of
to the nearest TV.
Inputs from modulators

 Number of outputs: Each television that you want to connect to your
video network needs its own output on the distribution panel. These
panels are engineered to maintain the proper signal strength and quality
when used in a “one television per outlet” way. If you try to cheat and
use a coaxial splitter to connect an extra television to a single output,
you’re throwing away the design and engineering expertise that went
into the panel, and you probably won’t be happy with the results. Most
panels have from 5 to 12 outputs, so you should be able to satisfy your
home’s needs without having to install a second panel.
Distribution panels are often described as 3 x 8 or 5 x 12. The first
number is the number of inputs, the second is the number of outputs.
 Amplification: To maintain a signal that’s strong enough to produce a
good television picture, you need to amplify the signal. Most distribution
panels have built-in amplifiers that take care of this for you. Sophisticated
models have different levels of amplification so that some outputs are
optimally amplified for shorter cable runs, and others are optimized for
longer runs.
Why different levels of amplification? Because overamplifying a signal is
almost as bad as underamplifying it. Panels that have different tiers of
amplification typically have several outputs designated for short dis-
tances (0 to 50 feet, for example) and some for longer runs (perhaps for
50 to 150 feet). Models with several outputs (such as the 5-x-12 panel)
may even have a middle tier of distance ranges.
If you’re using a digital cable service, make sure you chose a bidirectional
video-distribution panel. Many older-design distribution panels don’t let sig-
nals flow back through them onto the cable network. Because digital cable
set-top boxes communicate back to the cable network, you need to choose 
a distribution panel that will let them do this! You can also find distribution
panels with a cable-modem bypass that lets you keep your cable modem out
of the loop — further reducing the possibility of your distribution panel’s
amplifier causing interference and slowing down your Web surfing.
More than you ever wanted to know about modulators
After the RG6 cabling and multiple-input distribution panel are in place, you
have the makings of a two-way, whole-home video network. Now you just
need an easy way to select the source you want to watch. That’s where mod-
ulators come in. A modulator translates a source’s baseband video and audio
signals into a standard TV RF channel — just like the ones that broadcast and
cable companies send you. So that they don’t interfere with existing chan-
nels, modulators must be frequency agile. In other words, instead of transmit-
ting on only a single frequency, modulators must be capable of transmitting
over a range of frequencies (or TV channels), so that you can adjust them to
an open channel on your system.
105
Chapter 6: Getting Video Where You Want It

Following is a typical scenario for modulator use. Suppose that you have a
main VCR in the living room, a baby monitor in the nursery, and a PVR and 
a DBS satellite receiver in your home-theater room. You want to be able to view
any of these signals on any TV in the house. No problem. You just need a modu-
lator that can modulate four inputs onto different channels on your coaxial
cable, so that they’re available at each jack in the house. Perhaps Channel 87 is
the baby monitor, Channel 89 is the VCR, Channel 91 is the PVR, and Channel
93 is the satellite receiver. When you want to watch one of these devices some-
where else in the house, you tune to the appropriate TV station. Simple!
You probably have several modulators already: in your VCR, in your DVD
player, in your laserdisc player, or in your DSS receiver. However, these mod-
ulators give you only two choices — Channel 3 or 4. Their sole purpose is to
provide a means of connecting these devices to televisions that lack sepa-
rate, baseband A/V inputs. In most television networks, Channels 3 and 4
aren’t unoccupied, so these modulators make use of an internal switch (the
VCR/TV button on your VCR’s remote) that disconnects the antenna or cable
feed to the TV, preventing interference with existing channels.
Chances are that you won’t be able to use these Channel 3 and 4 modulators
for distributing video throughout the home because your coax will have
existing cable or over-the-air channels. (The VCR/TV switch works for a TV
connected directly to the device but doesn’t work for the whole house.) Even
in the unlikely event that you don’t have existing channels on Channels 3 or
4, building a Channel 3/4 modulator into a source device won’t do much for a
whole-home network because you can add only one source device for the
entire house. You can’t modulate more than one device onto a single TV
channel. And even if Channels 3 and 4 are unoccupied, modulators shouldn’t
be used on adjacent channels.
Think about the following when you’re choosing a modulator:
 Digital or analog: Analog modulators are much cheaper than digital
ones, but they usually aren’t as flexible in the frequencies you can
choose from, so you have to buy a modulator that is factory-set to the
channel you have available. Analog models tend to drift off stations just
like those old dial radios did, requiring frequent readjustment. Digital
models, though more expensive, are more reliable and accurate; you
basically set them once and forget them.
 Single or multichannel: You can buy modulators that translate a single
video source onto a single television channel, or you can buy ones 
that translate up to four separate input sources onto four different
output channels. A multichannel unit may better serve your needs for
two reasons:
• A multichannel unit allows you to distribute the video signals from
several collocated video sources (such as in a home-theater room)
throughout your whole house.
106
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

• With a multichannel modulator, you eliminate the confusion and
complexity of using coaxial splitters to increase the number of
internal video inputs on your distribution panel.
 Mono, stereo, or no audio: Most modulators transmit the audio output
of your source device as monaural audio — no stereo separation, no sur-
round sound, just mono (the same thing out of both speakers). Even if
they have two inputs (for left and right channel audio), they’re probably
mono. You can buy modulators that transmit MTS (the stereo system
that TVs use), but they cost significantly more. If you’re installing a mod-
ulator that will be carrying the video from a surveillance camera, you
can save money by purchasing a modulator that has no sound input.
 Shape and size: Modulators don’t come in a standard shape and size.
You can choose from the following options:
• Black box: These modulators don’t look pretty, but they will fit in
with the rest of the stuff on your A/V equipment shelf.
• Wall outlet size: Much less obtrusive are modulators that fit in 
a standard wall outlet gang box. The same size as a light switch 
(or a coaxial outlet), these miracles of miniaturization make sense
for places where you don’t have a huge rack of video equipment 
in place.
• Distribution panels: You can get modulators out of the room
entirely by purchasing an all-in-one distribution panel that has a
modulator or two built right into the same box. This option limits
you because your source devices must be close to the distribution
panel — that VCR on the third floor is out of luck!
 Loop-through capability: Many modulators offer something called an
A/V loop through. Many source devices — except for some DBS receivers
and DVD players — have only one set of baseband video and audio 
outputs. If you plug these into a modulator, you don’t have any way to
make a baseband A/V connection to the local TV — you have to use the
source’s built-in Channel 3/4 modulator instead. The loop through pro-
vides an extra set of baseband video and audio outputs on the back of
the modulator so you can connect to the local TV directly using compos-
ite or S-video cables, instead of using the modulated signal routed back
through the distribution panel.
When you’re using a modulator system to create your own TV channels in
your home, keep the following points in mind:
 Install a signal amplifier between your antenna and the distribution
panel or modulators: When you create your own TV channel, you’re
doing pretty much the same thing in your house that cable companies
and broadcasters do at their head-end offices and stations. If you’re
using an antenna feed to receive broadcast TV stations, you could end
107
Chapter 6: Getting Video Where You Want It

up sending your video out your antenna and over the airwaves (and 
into your neighbor’s TV perhaps). The FCC doesn’t like this idea, so it
requires you to install a signal amplifier between your antenna and the
distribution panel or modulators. Amplifiers are inherently one-way —
signals don’t pass back through them — and they help pick up those 
distant stations better. Bidirectional amplifiers let signals go both 
ways, but the ones going back upstream to the cable company are low-
frequency signals that won’t interfere with television channels.
 Skip channels between modulated channels: Most modulator manufac-
turers recommend that you skip at least one channel between modu-
lated channels to avoid interference.
 Be aware of signal interference: Channels that your TV can’t pick up
may still be strong enough to interfere with your internal channels —
this is often the case in the higher UHF band for broadcast TV. The same
can apply to cable TV — just because you don’t subscribe to a particu-
lar channel doesn’t mean that its signal isn’t taking up bandwidth space
on your coax. If this problem occurs, adjust the modulator to a different
channel.
 Make sure you have free channel space: Channel space isn’t much of a
problem if you use an antenna — even the most crowded urban areas
have plenty of unused channels. However, cable service providers in
many areas are beginning to saturate their available channels with pro-
gramming. They’re also using TV channels for other services, such as
cable modems and audio services. So if you’re planning on modulating
several channels onto your network, do your homework and make sure
you’ll be able to find open channels. You can do this by physically look-
ing at channels you think are unused on one of your televisions (making
sure a scrambled signal isn’t there) and by checking the complete listing
of channels provided by your cable service provider.

I
n Chapters 5 and 6, we spend a fair amount of time talking about all the
pieces and parts that fit into a video-distribution network. That’s impor-
tant stuff to know — but it doesn’t do you much good if you don’t have every-
thing connected properly. So in this chapter, we tell you about the model to
use in setting up your network. The technical term for this model is topology
or network architecture, but don’t be intimidated. These words just mean a
way of thinking about your network so that you know what to connect where.
We tell you how to get the right cables in the walls (and how to buy the right
infrastructure devices) to create a futureproof, two-way video network.
Maybe you don’t plan to install all the equipment that we describe in
Chapters 5 and 6 right away. No problem. As long as you get your wires in
place, the general network model that we describe in this chapter will serve
you well as your needs change and grow in the future.
Don’t feel like you have to wire a video network (or any network) yourself. If
you’re hesitant about drilling holes and running cables through your walls,
do yourself a favor and hire a professional.
The discussion of video networks and especially that of modulators is prob-
ably the toughest in the book. You might need to reread some sections a few
times. That’s okay. We get confused here too. Stick with it, because video
entertainment is the heart of your smart home.
Another warning to you — and again it’s a warning about modulators. Many
folks have digital cable or satellite TV systems as their main source of “out-
side the home” video programming. These systems make it very difficult, if
not impossible, to use modulators as a technique for distributing “inside the

home” video sources. If you have one of these systems as your TV source, 
we recommend that you look at other alternatives, such as video-over-CAT-5
cabling or wireless, for in-home distribution. We talk about these systems in
the second half of this chapter.
Connecting Your Video Network
The fundamental building block of your video network is the coaxial cable.
We recommend that you build your whole-home video network with two seg-
ments of RG6 coaxial cable connected to each video outlet that you install in
your major rooms — one cable that brings video into the TV and one cable
that allows you to distribute video source devices (such as VCRs) through
the network. Specifically, you should have at each location:
 An external video connection: This connection carries video signals
from your distribution panel to your television. Think of external as 
outbound.
 An internal video connection: This connection carries video signals
from any source devices in the room back to the distribution panel,
where they can be combined with your external video source (cable 
or broadcast TV) and sent back out on the outbound lines. Think of
internal as inbound.
Note: We use the words external and internal in reference to the central hub
of the video network, the video distribution panel. External, or outbound,
means away from the video distribution panel, and internal, or inbound,
means toward the video distribution panel.
Consider running four RG6 cables (two double outlets) to your home office
and your media room or home-theater room. You might need the extra capac-
ity or you might decide you want to rearrange the furniture. (It sure helps 
to have an identical set of outlets on the other side of the room when you
switch the sofa and the TV to opposite walls.)
Running just one outbound coaxial cable allows you to receive signals in that
room and may be sufficient for rooms in which you don’t intend to send any
video sources back through the network. However, it’s hard to predict which
rooms will fall into that category.
Figure 7-1 shows the layout of a typical, centrally connected, coaxial video
network. In the next sections, we walk you through the network, from a single
room back to the distribution panel.

Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

If you use digital cable and also want to use modulated sources, building a
video network can get complicated. Digital cable systems do some funky
things with their signals and use up a lot more of the frequency spectrum. So
you’ll have a hard time even finding a free channel to modulate your source
devices onto. In the “Dealing with digital cable” sidebar, we talk about some
ways to get around this problem.

Chapter 7: Wiring a Video Network

As we discuss in Chapter 6, digital cable set-top boxes and cable modems
need to send data back upstream to your cable company. You might wonder
if internal RG6 cables can carry this data — the answer is no. Cable modem
and digital cable upstream data goes back up the external cable. The key here
is to buy a video distribution panel that is labeled bidirectional and that
allows data to pass back through the amplifier and onto the cable provider’s
network. Look for these words on the manual: a 5 to 42 MHz return path.
112
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 
Dealing with digital cable
Digital cable is a great service. Tons of chan-
nels, a neat on-screen program guide, and
more. Unfortunately, the sheer number of chan-
nels and the different channel structure used by
digitally transmitted channels (typically, the
lower channels are still transmitted in analog)
make it hard to find empty slots in the bandwidth
in which to insert your modulated programming.
Even if you find an empty channel, there’s no
guarantee that it will stay open — cable
providers constantly add channels and reshuf-
fle their lineups. To make things more compli-
cated, the channel numbers you see on your
digital cable set-top box (for example, 200 for
HBO) don’t equate to the channel numbers you
select on your modulator.
If you have digital cable and want to use a two-
way, modulated video network, you can try the
following:
 Talk to your cable company: Ask the
installer or call the technical support line —
see whether they’ll identify some open
channels for you.
 Use a notch filter to block out a chunk of
channels: This isn’t an elegant solution.
Notch filters block multiple channels (often
five to ten), not just one. So you might lose
access to some channels you want. Notch
filters start at around $70 to $80, and the
price goes up rapidly as the width of the
notch (the number of channels being
blocked) gets smaller because blocking
fewer channels is more difficult.
 Separate the digital cable signals onto a
different RG6: This scenario is similar to
how satellite TV signals are incorporated
into a video network (discussed in the
“Special Needs of Satellite Systems” sec-
tion). You’d need a third RG6 cable for loca-
tions using a digital cable set-top box.
Instead of being connected to your distrib-
ution panel, these cables would be patched
together in a physically separate network
(using a splitter from the cable company or
another distribution panel). Modulated
video from in-house sources would then be
distributed over the other two RG6 cables.
 Skip the modulation and use a different
network to distribute internal video
sources: We describe these systems at the
end of the chapter (video over CAT-5e, wire-
less, and phone lines).
We think the last two approaches are the best
ways to go. And using a good installer — some-
one who’s familiar with your local cable com-
pany — can really pay off.

Filling your walls: Running the cables
When wiring a video-distribution network, the first task is to run two RG6
coaxial cables between the distribution panel and each area of the house
where you want video outlets. You’ll probably want to hire a professional
cable installer to run this cable for you. For an attractive appearance, the
cables should connect to wall-mounted female coaxial connectors, as
described in Chapter 6.
To make connection and future system changes easier, label your RG6 cables.
At a minimum, you need to know which room the cable is coming from and
whether it’s the internal or external line. (Nothing inherent about a cable
makes it internal or external — it’s just the logical use you apply to the cable.)
We recommend that you buy RG6 cable in two colors (it usually comes in white
or black); use one color for all internal runs and the other for all external runs.
Tying it together: Making connections 
at the distribution panel
If you do everything right when completing the steps in the preceding section,
you should have a gob of cables running into a central point, which we call the
113
Chapter 7: Wiring a Video Network
Where does HDTV fit in?
High-definition TV (HDTV). The mere words
make us smile. Widescreen TV images with film
quality. Is your video network going to be ready
for it? Or for any of the new digital television
(DTV) variants we discuss in Chapter 5?
In most cases, the answer is yes (aren’t you
glad?). DTV signals are compatible with the
standard RF infrastructure (RG6 cabling) that
carries today’s NTSC signals. The only thing to
keep in mind is that many over-the-air DTV
broadcasts use higher frequencies and have
larger variations in signal strengths than do reg-
ular broadcast and cable TV stations. So to
handle HDTV, you must have a high-quality dis-
tribution panel and amplifiers. The major ven-
dors of these systems — such as Channel Plus
(www.channelplus.com) or Leviton (www.
leviton.com) — offer amplifiers and distri-
bution panels that are HDTV capable, and they
often clearly label them so (using an official DTV
logo authorized by the ATSC — the group that
sets the standards for DTV).
Modulators are a different story. They’re
designed to work with yesterday’s NTSC analog
TV standard. As new video source devices
(such as digital VCRs or high-definition DVDs)
are developed to record or display HDTV/DTV
pictures, your existing modulators won’t be able
to do anything with those signals. In the long-
term, you’ll probably need to replace your mod-
ulators. By then, there will be modulators
designed to deal with HDTV signals.

central wiring closet (see Chapter 2 for more info on the wiring closet). Here’s
how to connect these wires to your distribution panel to complete your 
network:
1. Connect each external RG6 coaxial cable to one of the distribution
panel’s external female connection interfaces.
If your distribution panel comes with multiple levels of amplification,
take the time now to double-check the amplification levels. Each of your
meticulously labeled cables should be connected to outputs with ampli-
fication levels that correspond to the distance of each cable run. (Check
the manufacturer’s recommendations — often each output has a recom-
mended distance label right next to where the cable plugs in.)
2. Connect each internal RG6 cable into one of the modulator inputs
(sometimes labeled local) on your distribution panel.
You may find that you have more internal video cables in your wiring
closet than you have inputs (remember that most panels have five or
fewer inputs). If you don’t have any video sources connected to a particu-
lar cable, you can leave it disconnected — but well labeled — until you
need it.
If you still don’t have enough inputs on your panel, you can use a good
quality splitter/combiner to connect two or more internal cables to a
single panel input. If you choose this option, don’t try to save a few
bucks on a cheap splitter/combiner — the 99-cent specials from your
local discount store are worth exactly what they cost (next to nothing).
Spend $15 or $20 on a high-quality model from a manufacturer such 
as ChannelPlus (www.channelplus.com) or Channel Vision
(www.channelvision.com).
3. Connect the RG6 cable from your antenna or cable TV feed to the
Antenna/CATV input on the distribution panel.
If you’re using modulators and an antenna to pull in local broadcast sta-
tions, you need to install an amplifier between the antenna and the dis-
tribution panel — otherwise you can actually start broadcasting your
internal video over your antenna and out to the world. You probably
don’t want to be doing this (for many reasons), and the FCC wants you
doing this even less. Most manufacturers of distribution panels have
such signal amplifiers for sale, as well — use the amplifier that they rec-
ommend for your specific distribution panel.
You can’t simply plug the output of your DSS satellite system into your
distribution panel’s Antenna/CATV input. Read the “Special Needs of
Satellite Systems” section, later in this chapter, for information on this
unfortunate phenomenon.
114
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Most distribution panels (except those without built-in signal amplifica-
tion) need electrical power to do their job. The majority use a small wall
wart AC/DC power adapter like those used by cordless phones, modems,
and tons of other small electrical appliances. Make sure you install a
nice quad electrical outlet nearby — we always seem to be adding some-
thing in our wiring closets that needs power.
As we mentioned, if all this two-way video sounds like something that you’ll
never, ever want to get involved with, you can build a similar video-distribution
network that forgoes the second RG6 cable to each outlet. Just follow the
same basic architecture guidelines — all outlets individually wired with a
length of RG6 cable running back to your central distribution node — and
skip the second cable run. At the risk of being repetitive, we think this type 
of abbreviated network is a false economy, but it’s a perfectly valid way of
constructing a home-video network. If you set up your network this way, we
strongly recommend that you at least run a second cable to the room con-
taining your home theater or media center. Chances are that’s where you
have all the fun source devices, and a second cable there gives you the
opportunity to share those sources throughout your home later.
Hooking up: Making connections 
in the TV rooms
With the cables run, it’s time to connect the TVs and video source devices in

Chapter 7: Wiring a Video Network

Assuming that you’ve finished making your cable runs between the rooms
and the distribution panel, just follow these steps:
1. Determine the video source devices (such as a VCR, DVD player,
video-capable PC, or camcorder) that you want to distribute to other
areas of the house, and connect them to a modulator, typically using
an RCA or S-video cable.
Modulators allow you to broadcast a device’s video signal around your
house over an unused TV channel. We explain modulators as well as
RCA and S-video cables in detail in Chapter 6.
If you have several video source devices in the same room (such as your
home-theater room with a PVR and a DVD player), you can use a multi-
channel modulator to broadcast multiple audio and video signals onto
unused channels.
2. Run a length of RG6 coaxial cable with male connectors on both ends
from the output jack of your modulator to the internal female coaxial
connector jack in the wall.
A coaxial wall jack is basically a faceplate with a female connector stick-
ing out both sides. Remember that your point of reference for internal is
inbound to the distribution panel. So when you’re standing in the room
with the TV, the internal jack runs out of the room toward the distribu-
tion panel. If you think about it too long, you’ll get a headache.
3. Connect another length of RG6 cable with male connectors between
your TV or cable set-top box and the external connector on your coax-
ial outlet.
If you’re using a VCR or PVR, it should be connected in-line between the
wall outlet and the television or set-top box with an RG6 coaxial cable. Use
another RG6 coaxial cable to connect the output of the VCR or PVR to the
TV. You can also use RCA or S-video cables from the Audio and Video Out
jacks of the VCR or PVR to the Audio and Video In jacks on the TV. 
Figure 7-3 shows the signal path for watching a VCR in another room.
If your VCR or PVR is connected to a modulator that has a loop-through
connection (see Chapter 6), you can use these outlets and RCA cables to
connect your VCR to your TV.
4. Perform Steps 1 through 3 for each room and pair of coaxial cables in
your network. Lather, rinse, and repeat as desired.
You now have a whole-home video network up and running! However, your
work isn’t finished. You still need to program each modulator to an unused
channel. We’re not going to give you step-by-step instructions on this task
because each manufacturer’s model is different. For the most part, though,
digital modulators are easy to tune in — it’s just a matter of pressing a pro-
gram button a few times. Many models even have LCD or LED digital displays
so that you can’t mess up.

Summing Up
The information in this chapter is a lot to grasp in one big gulp, so we thought
we’d step back and give you a quick recap of what goes where in your whole-
house video network:
 In the wiring closet:
• RG6 coaxial cable feeds from your antenna, or cable company, or
both
• A coaxial distribution panel to tie everything together (some ven-
dors call these RF distribution panels)
• An amplifier (may be built into the distribution panel) to boost
antenna signals and to keep modulated signals from being broad-
cast over your antenna (optional for cable TV)
 In each room:
• Two RG6 cables connected to the distribution panel (one to the in
side of the panel, and one to the out side). Optionally, home offices
and media rooms get four RG6 cables for extra flexibility.
• An additional RG6 cable for the satellite receiver (optional).

Chapter 7: Wiring a Video Network

As long as you’ve installed a bidirectional distribution panel and an amplifier,
you should be able to install a cable modem onto any of the external RG6 out-
lets in your house. An even better approach, however, is to get a distribution
panel with a bypass for the cable modem (as we mention in Chapter 6). In
this scenario, you just need to connect one of the RG6 cables running to your
home office (or wherever the cable modem ends up in your house) to this
bypass, instead of to one of the outputs of the distribution panel.
Special Needs of Satellite Systems
DSS (Digital Satellite System) small-dish satellite systems are a great way to
receive TV programming, but they’re sort of a pain to integrate into your
video network. The frequencies that satellite systems use and the way that
coaxial cables carry the signal are different than those for standard TV sig-
nals. You can’t connect your satellite to your video distribution panel’s con-
nector and distribute it through your house. To integrate a satellite into your
network, you have to be a bit devious. In this section, we tell you how.
We provide two methods of running your DSS satellite signal across your video
network. The difference between these methods depends on whether or not
you want a two-way network that can bring video back from various rooms.
Running a one-way satellite network
You may be thinking to yourself, “Heck, I’ve got this dish, so I don’t need
cable.” And we have just the solution. You can build a video network for your
DSS system that will carry the outputs from a DSS dish to multiple receivers
throughout the home by using a multiswitch instead of a distribution panel.
The downside to using a multiswitch is that the satellite network is one way.
You still have to install a distribution panel if you want to share video
sources across the network as we describe in the “Connecting Your Video
Network” section, earlier in this chapter. If you want a two-way network with
a satellite, check out the following section on a hybrid video network.
To run your satellite picture to different receivers around your home, you
need to replace the distribution panel with a special device known as a multi-
switch, or voltage switch. The multiswitch connects to both outputs of a dual
LNB (low noise block) dish and provides coaxial connections for up to four
separate receivers. You simply use RG6 coaxial cable to connect each LNB
output to your multiswitch and then run individual lengths of RG6 to each
receiver location.
118
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Some DSS dishes include integrated multiswitches, so you don’t need to buy
anything extra. Just run RG6 cables from the back of the dish (where the 
multiswitch is located) down to the receiver locations.
In some locations, you can’t get signals from the major broadcasts networks
(such as Fox, NBC, CBS, or ABC) with a satellite. Nor can you get any local
independent channels. You have to hook up an aerial antenna or get the basic
package from your local cable company.
If you’re interested in running an aerial TV antenna to pick up local stations,
buy multiswitches that accept the output from a broadcast TV antenna and
carry it over the same RG6 cables to your DSS receivers and televisions. These
multiswitches include a device called a diplexer (check out the sidebar “What 
if I just want satellite and none of that fancy stuff?”), which lets you integrate
both the satellite and local TV signals onto the same RG6 coaxial cable.
Creating a hybrid satellite/video network
The drawback to using a multiswitch as the hub of your video network (as we
describe in the preceding section) is that it creates a one-way network — from
the satellite dish to the TV. If you want to be able to watch in one room video
that’s sent from a device in another room (whether from a VCR, a DVD player,
or a video camera in your baby’s room), you need to use a separate distribu-
tion panel for the return signal (or use alternate technologies such as CAT-5e,
wireless, or phone line systems — which we describe later in the chapter).
You have a couple of options if you want to get the best of both worlds in a
hybrid two-way satellite/video network:
 Build a separate video network for your satellite. Build a video-
distribution network for your DSS dish, with independent runs of coaxial
RG6 cable from the dish, down through the attic (or from wherever the
dish is mounted), and on to each location that will have a satellite
receiver. With a multiswitch connected to the outputs of your satellite
dish, you can connect up to four separate receivers to a dish. You can
then build a video-distribution network using a distribution panel to
handle the return signals and any signals you receive from cable or
broadcast TV.
The benefit of this system is that it gives you the ability to watch up to
four DSS channels on four TVs simultaneously, while still allowing you
to, say, watch in your bedroom a tape playing in a VCR in the home-
theater room. The drawback of this system is the added expense and
complexity of building a separate network — more cable to run and
more equipment to buy.
119
Chapter 7: Wiring a Video Network

Although most people mount the multiswitch right at the dish, you might
also consider mounting the multiswitch in your wiring closet (vendors
such as Leviton and Siemon make rack-mounted versions you can install
right next to your video-distribution panel). In this scenario, you’d just run
two RG6 cables from the dish to the wiring closet (to connect the two satel-
lite LNBs to the inputs of the multiswitch), and then add another RG6 out
to each room that will have a satellite receiver. In fact, if you’re not using a
modulator in these rooms, you can take the second RG6 from that room
(the internal one) and connect it to the multiswitch instead of the distribu-
tion panel — so you don’t need a third RG6 for satellite in that room.
 Treat your DSS receivers as source devices — just like VCRs or DVD
players. You still need separate RG6 cabling runs from the dish to the
receivers, but you can then use modulators to send the output of these
receivers to every television in the house. Just install receivers in your
two favorite watching areas and modulate them onto different channels
for viewing from other TVs in the house.
This solution has the benefit of adding only moderate cost (you have
extra runs only to the receivers) and limited complexity. The drawback
is that without using a multiswitch or voltage switch, you can watch
only two DSS stations simultaneously (assuming you have a dual-LNB
satellite that allows you to run two coaxial lines from your receiver. With
a single-LNB receiver, you can watch only one station).
As we mention in Chapter 6, DSS systems can carry high-definition TV signals
to your home. To view these signals (assuming you’ve subscribed to them),
you have to jump through a few extra hoops. First, you need to have an
HDTV-ready TV and an HDTV satellite receiver (or an HDTV with a built-in
HDTV receiver). Second, in most cases you need an antenna with a third LNB
(because the HDTV signals come in on a different satellite than normal pro-
gramming). You might not need to run extra cables from the dish to your
receivers, however, because some of these triple LNB dishes include a built-in
multiswitch that combines all three LNB outlets onto single runs of coax. If
the dish isn’t so equipped, you may need to run an extra RG6 cable to the
locations that have the HDTV receivers.
Making satellite connections
After running a satellite network, you should have a satellite input coaxial
connector in each room. Depending on whether you opted for a hybrid
system, you may or may not also have internal and external video jacks for
sharing modulated source video devices.
To complete the installation, use a short RG6 patch cable to connect the
satellite receiver to the jack on the wall. Doing so brings the satellite signal
from the wall to the satellite receiver. After connecting the receiver to your
television, you should see crystal-clear satellite television.
120
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Here are a few more tips on DSS systems that are important to remember:
 You need a phone line in every room that has a DSS receiver. The DSS
service provider uses this phone line to authenticate your box and pro-
vide pay-per-view movies, ACC basketball games, and the like. If your
receivers aren’t connected to phone lines, you won’t be able to get pay-
per-view or certain sports programming, and you’ll have to pay a full
subscription fee for each additional receiver in the house — instead of
an extra $5 per receiver.
 You can use a so-called wireless phone jack to run the phone line
across your electrical cables. They’re not really wireless, because they
use electrical cabling, but they save you from stringing a phone line
across the room like a trip wire. (See Chapter 11 for more on these
devices.)
 You should install special inline amplifiers if the distance between the
dish and a receiver is longer than 100 feet. These amplifiers boost signal
strength for long cable runs and are pretty cheap (between $25 and $100,
depending on the level of amplification). They draw their power over the
coaxial cable from the receiver, so they’re easy to install — just cut the
cable and connect the amplifier between the two cut ends of the cable.
121
Chapter 7: Wiring a Video Network
What if I just want satellite and 
none of that fancy stuff?
If you decide that you don’t need or want a full-
fledged, two-way video network and you’re
going to use only DSS and local channels in
your video network, you need to become famil-
iar with the diplexer. The diplexer looks just like
the splitter/combiner but combines broadcast
or analog cable TV signals with the output of a
DSS dish on a single length of RG6 cabling.
You must use diplexers in pairs — one near your
DSS dish where the antenna/cable feed is com-
bined with the output of your LNB and another
at the far end of your RG6 cabling, immediately
before the cable plugs into your DSS receiver.
The first diplexer combines the two cable feeds
onto a single RG6 cable. The second splits this
signal back into two separate signals — one
connects to your receiver’s LNB input, and the
other connects to the Antenna/CATV input on
the back of the receiver.
If you feed two DSS receivers directly from a
dual LNB dish (without using a multiswitch) and
you want to add your local channels from cable
or antenna, you need four diplexers. If you use
a multiswitch to send the output of your dish 
to more than two receivers, you need to buy a 
multiswitch with a built-in diplexer and then 
use an additional diplexer at each receiver.
Even though diplexers and regular splitter/com-
biners look pretty much the same, they’re two
different devices. Don’t try to save $20 by using
any old splitter in your system: It won’t work.

 You may want to install coaxial surge protectors on the RG6 runs from
your dish. Doing so prevents lightning strikes on your roof from destroy-
ing your DSS receivers. Be careful when you choose a surge protector,
though, because the standard cable TV models available in most elec-
tronics stores don’t pass the entire DSS signal. You need to buy special-
purpose surge protectors that specifically support DSS. Some surge
protector manufacturers (such as Panamax — www.panamax.com) sell
surge protectors that do triple duty — protecting the RG6, the phone
line, and the power cord connected to your receiver.
We don’t tell you in this chapter how to remotely control all this video equip-
ment from other rooms. We haven’t forgotten; we have a long description of
how to remotely control video (and audio) network components in Chapters
19 and 20.
And in This Corner, CAT-5e/6
The backbone of your video network — the primary electrical highway that
carries TV and other video programming around your house — should be con-
structed using RG6 coaxial cable. Bottom line: It’s just the best (and easiest,
and most compatible) way of doing things. But sometimes you need to get
video to and from places where RG6 doesn’t go. And sometimes you just can’t
put any more video on the RG6 cable — for example, if you have a digital cable
service that simply has no “room” for your in-home sources. A smart home has
a great alternative already in the walls — the CAT-5e/6 cabling that’s also used
for phone networks, data networks, and more. (You could use either type —
CAT-5e or CAT-6 — for the applications we discuss in this section.)
CAT-5e/6 is great for distributing locally sourced video (from DVD players,
PVRs, and the like) around the house, but it’s not suited for carrying multi-
channel incoming video from broadcast antennas, cable TV feeds, or satellite
dishes. So don’t mistake what we’re about to discuss as an alternative to an
RG6 network. Instead, it’s a complementary network.
The key to using CAT-5e/6 to carry video lies in the electronic devices attached
to the ends of the CAT-5e/6 network. These electronics make the CAT-5e/6
unusable for other services, such as telephones or data LANs. You can’t just
plug a video device into one of your phone jacks and expect it to work. It won’t,
and neither will the phones until you unplug the video electronics.
But if you read our discussion of a flexible CAT-5e/6 network in Chapter 2,
you might have an inkling of what we’re getting at. (If you don’t, take a break
from this discussion and take a quick peek.) To use CAT-5e/6 for video, you
122
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

need to go into your wiring closet and separate (physically and electrically)
the cable runs you want to use for video from your other networks. These
cable runs then need to be cross-connected together on your main distribu-
tion panel (or on a separate panel set up for your video over CAT-5e/6 net-
work) so that all locations on your CAT-5e/6 video network are wired
together. Some manufacturers, such as Leviton, make a special hub for your
wiring closet to connect together video over CAT-5e/6 systems.
After your CAT-5e/6 cables are connected together in your wiring panel, all
you need to do to enable video over your CAT-5e/6 cables is to install some
endpoint devices designed for the task. These devices can take a few forms:
 Stand-alone sender and receiver units: These are small boxes (smaller
than many video components) that can sit on the rack next to the TV.
The sender device sits in your media room (or wherever you want to
share the video component) and connects to it like a modulator does —
using the RCA composite or S-video connections on the back of the
shared component. The sender is also connected by a CAT-5e/6 patch
cable to the RJ-45 wall jack that you’ve dedicated to video. On the far
end, you do the reverse — plug the receiver into the video-dedicated 
RJ-45 jack, and plug the composite or S-video outputs into your TV or
home-theater receiver. The majority of these CAT-5e/6 video-distribution
systems also carry stereo audio signals coming from your source device,
so they can do double duty as a music distribution source.
 Senders and receivers integrated into wall outlets: These devices are
functionally the same as the stand-alone units but are shrunk to wall out-
lets. The connection between the source components and the remote
TVs stays the same, but instead of connecting an external box to an 
RJ-45 outlet, you replace your RJ-45 outlet with this device.
Note: In some systems, you’ll see a bit of a mix-and-match approach, with a
stand-alone sender and remote wall outlet receivers.
The stand-alone units are the most common and typically have better picture
quality. Eventually, the outlet-sized units will catch up, but right now they’re
better for low-fidelity applications such as babycams.
The majority of the video-over-CAT-5e/6 systems we’re discussing can carry
only one video program at a time — they’re basically like extensions of com-
posite or S-video. You can’t plug a DVD and a PVR, for example, into one of
these devices and carry the signals to different TVs in the house simultane-
ously. Every TV receives the same signal with these systems, and you can’t
put two senders on a single CAT-5e/6. A few high-end, expensive systems,
such as those made by Crestron (see Chapter 20), can be used as a multi-
source video-transmission system.
123
Chapter 7: Wiring a Video Network

Ack! Two warnings in a row — you must think that video-over-CAT-5e/6 is 
bad news. It’s not, but we need to tell you one more thing. Some video-over-
CAT-5e/6 solutions on the market are point-to-point solutions, meaning only
one receiver can go along with the sender — you can send video from one
spot to another but not to several others. If you want multiple receivers,
make sure you buy a system that can handle that demand.
As we write this, video-over-CAT-5e/6 systems are still new and relatively
expensive. We think that they’ll become a better alternative to the distribution
of in-home video sources than the more traditional modulator and RG6
approach — mainly because they’ll be able to carry higher-quality video sig-
nals (such as component video or even HDMI) and fully digital audio signals.
For example, ChannelPlus’s SVC-10 system can carry S-video and Dolby Digital
surround sound to a remote location over CAT-5e/6 (try that with a modula-
tor!). And Gefen (www.gefen.com) has systems such as the HDMI•1000HDS,
which can send HDMI high-definition video over CAT-5e/6 as far as 333 feet. As
these systems mature and become capable of supporting higher-quality video
and audio signals in a truly multipoint way (from one location to several
others), they may make modulators obsolete.
Cut the Cord: Wireless Alternatives 
for Video Distribution
Phones and data networks aren’t the only things in your home that can bene-
fit from advances in wireless networking. A few products that use wireless
technologies work well for your home-entertainment network if all you need
to do is add a device (for example, one TV or one set of speakers) rather than
take care of your entire whole-home-networking needs.
Wireless video-distribution systems accept the video and audio outputs of a
video source — such as a VCR, DSS satellite receiver, or DVD player — and
send them somewhere else in the home using an RF wireless link. These sys-
tems basically consist of two small units, each containing an antenna. The
transmitter unit attaches to your video source through standard RCA-type
audio and video connectors. The receiver unit usually offers both an RCA and
an RF output to connect to the television on the far end. Figure 7-4 shows a
wireless video-distribution network.
If you’re looking into a wireless video system, here’s what you should keep in
mind:
124
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

 What frequency spectrum does it use? Some of these systems use the
900-MHz frequency band; others use the higher 2.4-GHz band. In general,
2.4-GHz systems perform better because higher-frequency RF signals run
cleaner with less interference from other systems and pass through
walls and ceilings better. Additionally, 2.4-GHz systems provide more
available bandwidth to carry the video signals.
 Does the system transmit audio in mono or stereo? If your video source
includes high-quality sound, you probably want to spend a bit more to
get stereo audio.
 Does the system carry IR (infrared) control signals? Some do, and it
sure is handy to be able to do things such as pause, rewind, or change
channels while watching a program in the bedroom without having to
walk to the living room. This feature is a must-have to us, unless you
already have an IR control network built into your home — but if you
have an IR network installed, we’re pretty sure that you want to have a
coaxial video-distribution network as well, so you won’t be needing the
wireless system.
If you live in an older historic home, the type with tin ceilings, know that
these reflect and block signals. Therefore, RF video transmitters may not give
you the quality you’d like.

Chapter 7: Wiring a Video Network

The folks at Ruckus Wireless (www.ruckuswireless.com) have a success-
ful wireless distribution system that uses Wi-Fi wireless networking combined
with some neat antenna tricks that “beam form” your wireless signal to maxi-
mize reach and speed to distribute HDTV over a wireless link. Their system is
primarily available through TV service providers as part of a complete TV
network of set-top boxes and wireless extenders. But consumers can buy a
MediaFlex system for their own in-home video distribution for IP video
sources (such as gaming systems and IP set-top boxes for Internet TV serv-
ices and computers). The MediaFlex system isn’t designed to work with tra-
ditional video sources (such as cable set-top boxes or DVD players), so it’s
really a solution for video sources coming from the Internet and your broad-
band connection. But it works well for those IP sources and can also be used
as your home’s primary Wi-Fi wireless computer network.
Use What You Already Have: Phone Line
Alternatives for Video Distribution
Most of the action in developing home-networking systems that run on exist-
ing phone wires is in the data-networking field, but some companies are look-
ing into ways to use phone lines for home-entertainment systems. Like the
126
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 
Coming soon: HDMI over the air
An alternative to CAT-5e systems for distributing
high-definition video is on its way. Although no
systems are commercially available as we write
in early 2007, several vendors have announced
wireless HDMI systems, which can take the
HDMI output of a source device — a digital set-
top box, an HDTV satellite receiver, a Blu-ray or
HD-DVD player, and so on — and transmit it
wirelessly across the room or across the house.
These systems, at least the early ones that will
be on the market in 2007, are point-to-point, so
they’re not designed to send a signal to every
room in the house. Their primary application will
be within a home theater or media room, getting
HDTV signals to a flat-panel TV mounted on a
wall somewhere in the room without requiring
any wires to be installed in the walls. In the
longer term, however, we expect more of a
whole-home angle to these systems, with multi-
point distribution (one source, multiple TVs) as a
part of follow-on products.
An example of one of these systems is the
WHDI (Wireless High-Definition Interface)
system from Amimom (www.amimon.com).
This system carries a single channel of HDMI
(including its audio) up to 100 feet (or more), at
resolutions of up to 1080i. Amimom and several
other companies are working to build their
receivers right into HDTVs, so all you would
need to “cut the cord” would be a transmitter
that connects to the HDMI output of your
source devices. Pretty cool stuff; we can’t wait
to get our hands on it.

phone line data-networking systems we discuss in Chapter 16, these products
utilize digital signal processing to carry entertainment signals on different fre-
quencies than those used by the telephone service. This means they can be
used simultaneously with telephone equipment connected to the network.
These systems use different frequencies than analog telephone systems use,
but there’s no guarantee that they use different frequencies than the phone
line data-networking systems use. That means interference could be a major
problem if you try to use both systems in your home, so we strongly recom-
mend against it. Single-purpose wiring eliminates this kind of conflict, which
is why we think it’s the best way to go.
You won’t find any phone line video-distribution systems available directly to
you as a consumer. Like the Ruckus wireless system we describe in the sec-
tion “Cut the Cord: Wireless Alternatives for Video Distribution,” phone line
systems are sold as part of a complete package by a TV service provider.
These systems use a technology called HPNA (Home Phoneline Networking
Alliance) — specifically, the latest version of this technology called HPNA 3.0.
HPNA 3.0 provides speeds up to 320 Mbps over regular phone wires, which is
fast enough to carry several channels of HDTV at one time. You’ll find HPNA
integrated into digital set-top boxes for IPTV services from phone companies
and other service providers. For example, if AT&T is your local phone com-
pany, you may be able to get TV services from them (as a replacement for
cable or satellite TV). AT&T’s set-top boxes use HPNA to send video signals
from the main set-top box to satellite set-top boxes in other rooms — and
even use this as part of a multiroom DVR service, which records programs on
one set-top box but allows you to watch them on any other set-top box.

Chapter 8
Bringing You Music
In This Chapter
 Getting the sound around (the house, that is)
 Zoning out
 Untangling cables and components
L
ike the video systems we discuss in the previous two chapters, home-
audio systems are increasingly becoming whole-home-audio systems.
Wiring your home to provide music everywhere and anywhere from a central
set of source components is convenient and a money saver. What’s more, it’s
a great way to tap into some of the music services available over the Internet.
By focusing and centralizing, you make it easier to interface with anything.
When you start looking into a whole-home-audio system, you will find that
you can take two main approaches: a wired system using speaker wires (or
other kinds of wiring, as we discuss throughout this chapter) or a wireless
system (typically using an 802.11 Wi-Fi system like the ones used for wireless
computer networks). Many folks automatically think that the wireless sys-
tems, by virtue of being newfangled and high-tech, are the best way to go. 
We admit to being big fans of these systems, but we also remain strong pro-
ponents of going with wires when you can, simply because they’re inexpen-
sive and work reliably in just about any home (something that can’t always
be said about wireless).
This chapter looks at many of the cabling issues involved in creating a whole-
home-audio network. In Chapter 9, we will dig into those wireless options we
just mentioned.
Zoning Out: Single-Zone versus 
Multizone Systems
In a single-zone audio system, you have only one audio source, which you dis-
tribute across the network at any given time. You can turn various sets of
speakers on or off, but you don’t have the ability to listen to different audio

sources in different parts of your house at the same time. A multizone audio
system, on the other hand, allows one family member to listen to, say, a CD
while another person listens to the audio channel of a VCR.
Single-zone systems have a few advantages:
 Inexpensive: A single zone needs the smallest number of components to
get up and running, and the components themselves are the least expen-
sive to purchase.
 Easy to set up: In the simplest case, a single-zone system can consist of
a single source — such as a CD player or a PC — connected to one
amplifier and then, through an impedance-matching system, to several
sets of speakers. (We discuss impedance matching in the “Matching
impedance” section, later in this chapter).
 Upgradeable: The hardest part about building an audio network is getting
the right wires into the walls in the right places. Once you do that, you can
easily switch from a single-zone system to a multizone system by simply
upgrading a few components and swapping out a few connections.
Multizone systems provide the following benefits:
 Multiple audio sources: Multizone systems allow different members of
your family to listen to different audio sources in different areas at the
same time. For example, you can send the output from your iPod to one
room and the output from your AM/FM radio tuner to another. This fea-
ture tends to increase domestic tranquility, just as our Founding Fathers
recommended.
 Video-network integration: Multizone systems integrate better with 
your video-distribution system. The video-distribution network that we
describe in Chapters 5 and 6 brings audio and video to each television in
your house. With a multizoned audio network, however, you can take
that one step further to send the stereo audio portion of any video pro-
gram to a set of speakers near your remote TVs. This feature is appeal-
ing for two reasons: Stereo video modulators are pretty darn expensive,
and separate speakers usually sound much better than those inside
your TV.
Regardless of whether you choose to install a single-zone or multizone
system, the basic wiring infrastructure is similar (see Chapter 9). So remem-
ber that you can start with something simple (single zone) and upgrade it to
something more sophisticated (multizone) later.
130
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Audio Connections (in the 
Short and Long Run)
The wires that connect the various parts of an audio system can be divided
into two groups: the wires that run between components such as CD players
and amplifiers, and the wires that connect amplifiers to speakers. (A third
group of wires — those that connect control devices such as touchpad panels
from Crestron (www.crestron.com) or Control4 (www.control4.com) — is
covered in Chapter 20.)
We’ll also talk in Chapter 20 about some great wireless systems (such as ZigBee
and Z-Wave) that let you skip that extra set of wires (the control wires). Control
systems are definitely an area where wireless is ready for primetime.
131
Chapter 8: Bringing You Music
The trouble with multichannel audio networks
The stereo audio standard, in which sound is
separated into two channels (one for the left
channel and one for the right), still dominates
music production. With the advent of home thea-
ter, however, music can now be produced using
multiple channels to drive a multitude of speak-
ers. These new audio standards use speakers
in front of you, behind you, and possibly along-
side you to recreate the spatial dynamics of the
concert hall in your home (at least that’s how
fancy magazines describe it). They can simulate
a train passing by on the left, for example, by
having sound come from the front speakers,
then the left speakers, and finally the rear
speakers, with fading at the end.
You can buy an audio system that supports
home-theater standards, such as Dolby Digital or
DTS, or the new SACD (Super Audio Compact
Disc) and DVD-Audio systems, which use a multi-
channel system to create neat sound effects.
Movie soundtracks, multichannel audio discs
(still rare, but becoming more common), and a
few TV shows come through speakers in front of
you, behind you, and beside you. These multi-
channel systems also sometimes support sub-
woofers (which give you really deep bass
sounds), floor-shaking transducers (devices 
that mount in the floor and literally shake it), a
special-effects channel, and other wild-and-
wooly add-ons.
For the average home (read that as a non-
millionaire home), we recommend that you don’t
add multichannel capabilities to your whole-
home-audio network, at least not right now. The
wiring solutions we recommend here will enable
you to add multichannel capabilities in the future.
Although you can build an audio network that
goes beyond the two-channel (stereo) limit
today, the network quickly becomes extremely
complicated and prohibitively expensive.
By all means, go ahead and set up a special
multichannel amplifier, a surround-sound
decoder, and surround-sound speakers, but do
so in your home-theater or home-entertainment
room. When you run your whole-home-audio
network, stick with good old stereo.

Your audio system generally carries audio signals between components in
one of two ways:
 Line-level signals: These are low-power electrical signals that contain an
analog, electrical representation of the musical sound wave but not the
electrical power to move your speaker diaphragms and create sound.
Line-level signals are used by everything in an audio system up to the
power amplifier — the CD player, the tape deck, the audio outputs of a
VCR or DVD player, to name just a few. These are usually short-run con-
nections between components.
Digital equivalents of these line-level signals are used to connect digital
audio sources such as CD players, DVD players, and gaming consoles to
receivers and amplifiers. These are also typically used only for short-
run, inside-the-room connections.
 Speaker-level signals: These are higher-powered signals that come out
of your amplifier (or receiver, if you don’t have separate components)
and drive your speakers — that is, they cause the electromagnets in
your speakers to move, creating the sound you hear. These are gener-
ally the long-haul connections that run through your walls and around
your house.
For most people, running lengths of speaker wire from a central location (in
pairs, for two-channel stereo audio) is the best way to build a whole-home-
audio system. The wire is reliable, inexpensive, and easy to configure in a
variety of different ways.

More about digital audio connections
Most digital audio devices — such as CD, SACD,
and DVD players — let you carry a digital (rather
than analog) signal between the component and
the amplification system. To use such a function,
you need a digital-to-analog converter built into
the amplifier or receiver to convert the digital
signal to an analog signal that can drive your
speakers. (If your amplifier or receiver supports
this function, you should see a Digital In jack 
on the back.) Digital audio connections are
common — pretty much mandatory — in the
home-theater realm, because these cables are
required to carry surround-sound signals from a
DVD player to a home-theater receiver.
Two main types of cables are used for this kind of
connection: fiber-optic cables (called Toslink)
and special coaxial cables with a standard RCA
jack on each end (which one you use depends
on what kind of connections your equipment
manufacturer installed on its equipment —
there’s no single standard). At present, digital
signal transmission is an uncommon method of
distributing audio throughout the home, but we
expect that to change as systems that can use
CAT-5e/6 cabling for digital audio become preva-
lent. (See Chapter 9 for more information on
these CAT-5e/6 systems, and how they can form
an alternative to speaker wiring in your walls.)

Although the simplest, cheapest, and most common way to carry long-haul
connections is to use speaker wire connections, it’s not the only way. A grow-
ing number of manufacturers are offering systems based on a technology
called A-BUS (www.a-bus.com). This technology, developed by an Australian
company called LeisureTech, uses standard CAT-5e/6 cables (which we dis-
cuss throughout the book, and first introduced way back in Chapter 2). A-BUS
systems carry line-level audio signals from a receiver or centralized hub over
CAT-5e/6 cabling to remote modules where you want to listen to music. The
cool thing about A-BUS is that the CAT-5e/6 cabling also carries control sig-
nals and power. The modules have built-in amplifiers and also let you input
your controls (such as volume and change track) — all over one single wire,
with no need for a separate wired or wireless control system and no need for
any electrical power at the remote location. Pretty cool. You can look on the
A-BUS Web site for manufacturers. Several leading vendors, such as Leviton
(www.leviton.com), Harman/Kardon (www.harmankardon.com), and
Onkyo (www.onkyo.com) make A-BUS systems — Harman/Kardon and
Onkyo even incorporate A-BUS right into their home-theater receiver sys-
tems. We talk about A-BUS and other CAT-5e/6 systems in Chapter 9.

Chapter 8: Bringing You Music
Making your music digital
In the old days — say back in the late 1990s
when we all still rode horse-drawn buggies to
work — there weren’t many audio source
devices to connect to your whole-home-audio
network. You had CD players, cassette decks,
radio tuners, and the audio coming out of video
devices such as VCRs and DVD players. That
was about it.
Computers, the Internet, and portable music
players such as the iPod have turned the audio
world upside down. These devices offer you a
convergence of the computer and audio worlds.
Computer-based audio files, such as MP3s (and
WMV files for Windows-based systems and AAC
files for Apple’s iTunes and iPod-based systems),
have taken the music world by storm — tens of
millions of people use MP3 players as their pri-
mary means of storing and listening to music. You
can take advantage of this in a whole-home-
audio system in three ways. You can connect
your computer — with its stored MP3 files,
streaming online music services, and network
connection — to play music through your audio
system. You can use your portable music player
(such as an iPod or a Zune) as a source device
that feeds your whole-home system (the best
way to do this is with a docking system that lets
you not only get the audio out of your portable
player, but also send control signals in from
remote locations. Or, if you’re really serious
about digital music, you can buy special-purpose
devices such as Request’s AudioRequest
(www.request.com) or Escient’s FireBall
Digital 
Music 
Manager 
system 
(www.
escient.com). These devices are a kind of
home media server, as we discuss in Chapter 5.
They use standard audio interconnects (RCA
jacks) and connect to your whole-home-audio
system just like a CD player does. We’ll give you
specific advice on how to integrate these sys-
tems into your whole-home-audio network in
Chapter 9.

Line level (for the short haul)
Cables called line-level interconnects carry line-level signals, the unamplified
signals that move between audio components. Any cable with this type of
jack is generically called an RCA cable (because RCA created it). Interconnect
cables are usually shielded wires and typically come in stereo pairs (two sep-
arate wires bound in a left and right channel configuration).
The rise of multichannel audio in home theaters has led many manufacturers
to create interconnects with an odd number of cables and connectors — five,
for example, to connect the two front, two rear, and single center channels, or
single cables to connect subwoofers to the receiver.
The number of choices you’ll find in the interconnect marketplace can be
bewildering. Go to a stereo store, and you’ll find interconnects ranging from
freebies thrown in with a stereo system to $1000-a-foot cables wired with pre-
cious metals — silver or gold or copper mined by old-world artisans some-
where in Bolivia (or so the typical advertising pitch goes). Whether or not
these super-expensive cables make any difference is a matter of intense
debate among audio aficionados — go check out one of the audio news-
groups on the Internet (such as rec.audio.opinion) if you want to see
some people really slugging it out on the subject.
You probably get what you pay for with really cheap (or free) cables. You
may want to seek out a knowledgeable and trustworthy expert if you haven’t
made up your mind on what to buy. At the same time, we recommend that
you don’t spend a week’s wages on a cable — it will make the system sound
better only because your mind forces you to think it does.
Speaker level (for the long haul)
The wires that connect your speakers to your amplifier are beefier than those
that carry delicate line-level signals. Like interconnects, a huge range of
speaker cable designs are available. In general, all cables consist of two con-
ductors; each conductor is a solid wire or a bunch of smaller wires stranded
together within a common jacket or insulator.
In a whole-home-audio system, you can run speaker wire in two places:
 Through the walls: You use special in-wall speaker cabling to connect
your centrally located amplifier or amplifiers to remote outlets or in-wall
speakers throughout your home. (We talk about what to look for when
you choose in-wall cabling in just a moment.)
134
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

 From the wall to the speaker (patch cabling): This speaker wire con-
nects your stand-alone speakers to speaker outlets installed in your
walls. You can use the same cable you have in your walls if you’d like, or
you can run down to the stereo shop and pick up some shorter lengths
of precut and preconnectorized standard speaker cable for this job.
The only reason not to use the same wire that’s in your walls is aesthet-
ics, really. The wire in your walls is usually covered with lots of silk-
screened writing and labeling that stands out like a sore thumb. You can
buy speaker patch cables that are easier to hide than the in-wall stuff,
and you can even paint some brands to match your walls.
Cables and Components
Like the other networks in your home, a home-audio network can be as
simple or as complicated as you’d like. In this section, you find out about a
few components that are common to just about every home-audio network.
Control systems
A control system is the switching device that allows you to select your audio
sources, such as your CD, tuner, or iPod. The control system matches the
audio source device that you want to listen to with the amplifier that powers
your speakers. (We’re not talking about the remote-control networks that
allow you to control, say, your CD to your tuner from another room. For more
information about remote-control networks, check out Chapter 20.)
The preamplifier or control amplifier installed in your audio system — or the
one built into your integrated amplifier or receiver if you aren’t using sepa-
rate components — performs the source-switching function for a single-zone,
single-amplifier system.
Single-zone control systems
If you’re creating a single-zone distribution system but want to use multiple
amplifiers, you face an obstacle. In general, audio source devices such as CD
players have only one set of line-level outputs, so you can’t just plug one
device into two separate amplifiers. You can choose one of the following
strategies to distribute your audio signal. Each uses a different piece of audio
equipment:
 Multiroom integrated amplifier: This special amplifier accepts the
stereo line-level input from a source device and amplifies the same signal
into several pairs of stereo speaker outputs (these amplifiers usually
feed up to four or six pairs of speakers).
135
Chapter 8: Bringing You Music

Don’t confuse a multiroom amplifier with multichannel amplifiers in 
surround-sound systems for home theaters. In a home theater, each
speaker (the front, center, surround, and subwoofer) receives a different
audio signal — for example, a five-channel amplifier has five separate
line-level inputs from your surround-sound decoder. A multiroom inte-
grated amplifier takes a single stereo pair of line-level inputs and inter-
nally sends this signal to more than one pair of amplifiers.
 Signal-distribution amplifier: This device takes the output of a source
device, splits it into multiple outputs, and then amplifies these outputs
to ensure that your signal is not degraded (if you split the signal without
amplifying it, it would be too weak and would cause distortion that you
would hear as a background noise or hiss). You can then connect these
outputs to individual stereo amplifiers — one for each pair of speakers.
If you’re just splitting the signal from an audio source device to a pair of
amplifiers, you can save money by using a Y-splitter audio cable that splits 
a single pair of stereo audio signals into two pairs — one for each amplifier.
You can buy these cables at Radio Shack and similar retailers. If you’re trying
to send a signal to more than two amplifiers at once, you’re much better off
with one of the solutions we just mentioned.
Multizone control systems
Multizone systems require special control systems that can take the output
of several source devices and route these line-level signals to multiple ampli-
fiers (one for each zone, remember). Two kinds of components can be the
basis of a multizone audio system:
 A high-end preamplifier or receiver with built-in multizone capabilities
(most of these systems are limited to two zones).
 Multizone control systems that can feed any of your audio source com-
ponent’s signals to a specific zone’s amplifiers (these systems allow up
to eight or more zones).
Do not attempt to put in a multizone system unless you have access to an
audio geek. The documentation is awful, and the installation requires adept
handling of a remote-control device.
Because of the increased costs, you may decide not to install a multizone
audio system in your home right away. By following some of our guidelines
throughout this book, however, we feel that you can indeed get a multizone
treatment without breaking your bank account. No matter what decision you
make, you should install the proper wiring infrastructure in your house
ahead of time (and we tell you how in Chapter 9).
136
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Mating your amplifiers and speakers
The basic job of an audio amplifier is to increase the power of an audio signal
enough to let the speaker recreate sound. How loud those speakers get
depends on two factors:
 The power of the amplifier: How many watts of head-banging power the
amplifier pumps out.
 The sensitivity of the speakers: How many decibels of loudness the
speaker produces when a given number of watts comes from the 
amplifier.
Amplifiers are one of the largest issues you confront when putting together a
multiroom home-entertainment system, so be sure to put adequate time into
researching your options. Don’t make the mistake of assuming that you can
just run speaker wire all over the house and then use your present amplifier.
The salesperson at your local stereo store should be able to help you figure
out all your amplifier needs. To get the best help from the stereo-store techie,
we recommend that you draw a picture of the interior of your house and note
where you want each device and speaker to go, along with accurate distances
and likely conduit paths. This way, the salesperson can help you calculate
your needs based on the equipment that store carries. Try a few stores, com-
pare differences in approaches and pricing, and make a decision.
Impedance matters
When making the match between an amplifier and speakers, you need to take
into account the speakers’ impedance. Impedance is the force that the cur-
rent coming from your amplifier pushes against. All you need to know about
impedance is that if it dips too low, you may damage your amplifier! That’s
because lower-impedance speakers may cause an amplifier to overheat,
which is never a good thing for a piece of electrical equipment.
The impedance rating of your speakers and your amplifier must match. Most
speakers are rated at 8 ohms impedance, but some are rated at 4 ohms. Lower-
impedance loudspeakers are more difficult for amplifiers to power. In fact,
many inexpensive amplifiers are incapable of powering 4-ohm speakers and
may overheat or just plain not work if you try to combine them.
Wiring more than one speaker to an individual amplifier channel greatly
decreases the overall impedance that the speakers present to the amplifier.
So even if you have an amp rated for 8-ohm impedance and speakers rated 
at 8 ohms as well, if you wire two speakers to the same output (in different
rooms, for example), you effectively halve the impedance — to 4 ohms. Drat.
Adding more speakers lowers the impedance even more. Double drat. Pretty
soon you’re going to damage your amplifier.
137
Chapter 8: Bringing You Music

Matching impedance
Adding more than two sets of speakers to an amplifier may cause it to mal-
function, because you lower the impedance that your amplifier is “seeing.” If
you’re thinking about installing a multizone system, you can skip this part —
multizone systems are designed with individual amplifiers for each set of
speakers.
You can avoid this impedance problem in one of the following ways:
 Use separate amplifiers for each extra pair of speakers: If you use a
separate amplifier for each set of speakers, you won’t need to worry
about impedance matching. (You still have to make sure that the rated
impedance of your speakers matches that of your amplifiers.) You can
blithely skip this section.
 Use an impedance-matching device: This device lets you connect 
multiple speakers to an individual amplifier channel without causing
impedance problems, but it does decrease the amount of power 
that each speaker receives (and therefore the speaker’s maximum 
loudness).
You may be tempted to hook several speakers up to one central unit, but
overall, the more amplifier power you have, the better. If you can afford addi-
tional amplifiers — they’re relatively inexpensive — get them.
If you decide to go with a single amplifier for your home-audio network, you
need to get some sort of impedance-matching device into your system. You
have a couple of choices:
 A central impedance-matching transformer system: This device is a
small box that accepts a single stereo pair of speaker wire connections
and has several sets of speaker outlets. The internal transformer
matches the impedance, so even if you have several pairs of speakers
simultaneously connected to the amplifier, the amplifier functions cor-
rectly. Many of these transformer boxes also double as speaker selector
switches — on/off switches for your speakers — so you can control
which speakers are playing music and which are blessedly silent.
 An impedance-matching transformer built into an in-wall volume con-
trol: These volume controls, which you place in each room with speak-
ers, perform the same function as a central matching transformer, plus
they let you adjust the volume without using a remote control. Some of
these devices even have built-in on/off switches, so you can disable the
speakers in the room — a nice feature to have in a single-zone system
when you don’t want to be disturbed.
138
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

If your audio network will be limited — feeding only two rooms, for example —
you can probably get away with not using an impedance-matching system. Just
be sure to choose an amplifier or receiver that has two sets of speaker outlets,
and make sure that it can handle the impedance load that your speakers put on
it. After you get beyond two sets of speakers, though, we highly recommend
that you install an impedance-matching system. Skipping this step is not worth
the risk of damaging expensive equipment.
Speaker cable
The backbone of your home-audio network is the speaker cable you install in
your walls. You can’t just pick up any old speaker cable for this job — you need
to use cabling designed for in-wall use. Look for the following when choosing
cable:
 Gauge: The thickness of the conductors in your speaker wire is mea-
sured in units known as AWG (American Wire Gauge). AWG works on an
inverse scale: lower numbers denote thicker cables. Most audio experts
recommend that you choose a minimum of 16-gauge in-wall wiring (a
recommendation with which we agree). Many people go with 14 or even
12 AWG wires — for most folks, 12 AWG is overkill except for runs that
are exceptionally long (100 feet or longer); these heavy gauge cables are
really thick, making them hard to pull through the walls.
 UL listing: Underwriter’s Laboratories (UL) rate in-wall cables for safety
and quality. Look for wires that are rated at least class two (UL CL2) or
class three (UL CL3). The class rating is usually silk-screened on the wire
jacket.
Always check with your electrician or local building inspector to confirm
your town’s cable rating requirement. Although a national electrical code
lays out minimum standards for in-wall wiring, many municipalities have
more stringent requirements. In fact, the array of such requirements is
bewildering, and not meeting them could result in your local building or
electrical inspector making you rip out your wiring and start over.
 Extra features: Some wire manufacturers design their speaker cables
with features such as super-slippery cable jackets that slide through
your wall more easily, length markers silk-screened on the jacket, and
easy-to-remove insulation for terminating the wires — the kind of stuff
that makes installers happy.
Audio connectors
Unlike video cables (and most of the other wires and cables we discuss in the
book), speaker wires have no standard, one-size-fits-all family of connectors.
139
Chapter 8: Bringing You Music

You can terminate speaker wires in many ways, leaving enough options to
make the whole matter confusing. Following are the ways you can connect
speaker wires:
 Bare wire: Many people choose not to get too fancy and just strip off
the insulation and use the bare wire ends to terminate their speaker
wires. We don’t like this method because the exposed copper wiring
tends to corrode. Also, having exposed wire ends increases your
chances of accidentally short-circuiting the wires.
 Pins: Many manufacturers install (or sell for you to install) gold-plated
pins that you can crimp or solder onto the ends of your wires, as shown 
in Figure 8-1. These pins make hookup much simpler, and they look neater,
too (in case your neighbors are snooping around the back of your speak-
ers). Hardcore audiophiles tend not to prefer this method of terminating
speaker wires, but we think it’s a good, reliable, and flexible choice.
 Banana plugs: No fruit is harmed in the manufacture of these speaker
terminations — they’re so named because these cylindrically shaped
pins bend outward in the middle and roughly approximate the shape of
a portly banana. Banana connectors come in both single and double
varieties. In other words, you can have a single banana on both the posi-
tive and negative conductors of your speaker wire, or you can connect
both wires to a double banana. The double bananas are spaced apart by
a standardized distance, so they fit correctly into the banana connectors
on your amplifier, speaker, or speaker outlet. We really like banana plugs
because they’re so easy to plug in and the outward bend in the middle of
the plug ensures a nice, tight connection.
 Spades: Hard-core audiophiles (the people who live and breathe audio
equipment and have a stack of dog-eared stereo magazines next to the
bed) believe that these connectors offer the most secure, airtight con-
nections. Spade connectors are U-shaped and fit over standard, screw-
type binding posts — allowing you to get in there with a wrench or
strong pair of fingers and tighten things down. We agree with the audio
types — spades are the best connection method if your equipment has
binding posts.
Figure 8-1:

right, a pin

plug, and

140
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Any of the last three speaker wire terminations is better than using bare wire
ends. Which one you choose will probably be driven by the kinds of connec-
tions available on your amplifiers and speakers.
You find the following connectors on typical amplifiers, speakers, and wall
outlets:
 Spring-loaded clips: These are simple connectors with a spring-loaded
clip that you push down to accept a thin, bare wire or pin connector.
When you release the spring, it holds the wire or pin in place. You find
these on most older audio systems and on less-expensive current models.
 Banana-plug receptacles: Some speakers and amplifiers accept only
banana plugs. Be sure to check that your banana receptacles are
designed to accept double bananas before you terminate your speaker
wires. (Double bananas do have a standard, but some brands of audio
equipment — mainly from Europe — are not built to this standard and
require you to use two single bananas on your speaker wire.)
 Five-way binding posts: This speaker connector is the most flexible
because it can accept single and double bananas, bare wire, pins, and
spades. Five-way binding post connectors consist of a pair of metal
posts with a couple of holes — one running parallel to the length of the
posts to accept bananas and one running through the posts at a 90-
degree angle to accept bare wires or pins. See Figure 8-2. Spade connec-
tors simply slide over the posts, like a well-thrown horseshoe wrapping
around a metal pole. Five-way binding posts also have plastic, screw-
down caps on the posts, which you use to tighten the connection on
bare wire, pins, or spades.
Speaker outlets
A whole-home-audio system uses speaker wire connections to distribute
music — that is to say, you run speaker wires through your walls to each
room that’s part of your network.
Figure 8-2:

141
Chapter 8: Bringing You Music

If you don’t want speaker wires dangling out of holes in your walls, you’ll
need finished outlets for ending runs of in-wall speaker cable. Like the video
outlets we discuss in Chapter 6, these outlets are designed to fit into stan-
dard single-, double-, or triple-gang electrical junction boxes, and they 
come in all sorts of neat combinations. For example, you can buy a double-
gang-sized outlet that contains two RG6 video-cable outlets and a pair of five-
way speaker binding posts, which allows you to make your audio and video
connections right next to each other. You’ll find a host of speaker outlets in
any good home-electronics store or catalog.
When you purchase speaker outlets, do yourself a favor and skip any that
have those spring-loaded, clip-style connections and go right for the banana
or five-way binding post types. The spring-loaded clips won’t accept expen-
sive speaker cables with the huge, gold-plated spade connectors. Besides, the
clips are pretty flimsy.
142
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 
And now for something completely different
Traditional speaker wire systems are not the
only way to get audio around your home, but for
most people they’re the best and easiest
method. As computer networks and audio net-
works converge in more ways, however, it’s
possible to skip the traditional speaker wire net-
work and get your music by alternate means.
We describe in detail some alternatives for
audio networks in Chapter 9, but thought we’d
mention a few cool options right now.
 You can use CAT-5e/6 cabling (the same
kind used for computer networks) to dis-
tribute line-level audio signals around the
house. You’ll need some special devices on
the ends of these cables to make this work
(described in Chapter 9), but these new
devices are becoming cheaper by the day.
Audio over CAT-5e/6 networks is still new
and rare, but that will change as more
people wire their homes with CAT-5e/6.
 You can converge (or combine) your audio
and computer networks and use PCs and
computer-based PC peripherals to store and
play your music. You still need speakers and
amplifiers to play the music, but you can use
the CD player inside your PC to play CDs, or
you can store your music as MP3 files on the
PC (or on a special music server, such as an
AudioRequest). Music can then be carried
over your home’s computer LAN to remote
locations for playback. Computer-based
audio systems also give you the option of
getting your music from online music ser-
vices offered by many broadband ISPs such
as DIRECTV DSL and Road Runner.
Some of these computer-like audio systems are
sophisticated. For example, Request’s ARQ
Zone system syncs with a central AudioRequest
to provide multizone audio in your home. You
can even sync these devices remotely.

In-wall speakers
When you’re considering a whole-home-audio system, you need to know
about a subcategory of speakers: those that can be flush mounted in your
walls or ceiling. (See Chapter 5 for information on woofers and tweeters and
that kind of stuff.)
In-wall speakers are appealing to many homeowners because they greatly
increase the neatness of your installation, and give you that cool, custom
look. Just imagine — no outlets, no exposed wires, no ungainly speakers to
put on stands or bookshelves. Definitely a great way to go!
In-wall speakers, like conventional models, come in all sizes and shapes, but
you should look for a few specifics:
 Listen to them: Unlike standard models, in-wall speakers require a com-
mitment — namely a big hole in your wall. Always listen to your speak-
ers in a reputable stereo store before you take the leap. You’ll be glad
you did.
 Check the speaker size: Make sure that whatever speakers you choose
are going to fit in your walls without major modifications. Most of the
common, rectangular wall models are designed to fit between standard
stud spacing (16 inches), but all the same, go ahead and check your
walls ahead of time.
 Check the speaker depth: You probably don’t want your in-wall speak-
ers sticking out a few inches. Again, most in-wall designs take into
account the average depth of your wall, but double-check before you
start cutting holes.
 Think upward: The walls aren’t the only place to stick a speaker — ceil-
ings are appropriate locations as well, especially in locations where your
audio system serves primarily as background music. In those situations,
you won’t be quite as concerned about having some geometrically per-
fect speaker arrangement that allows you every nuance of the stereo
music experience. If keeping your sound out of sight is a priority, you
can even find round, in-ceiling speakers that look just like light fixtures.
 Check out the speaker grill’s design: Many models have paintable grills,
so you can make them match the walls around them — or make them
stand out if you like that kind of design statement. Most speaker grills
are innocuous (some even claim to be invisible when installed), and we
won’t fault you if looks are just as important as sound quality.
If you really want to hide your speakers, check out the speakers sold by
Gekko (www.artgekko.com). These very thin speakers hang on the wall, like
a picture. You can even outfit them with printed artwork!

n Chapter 8, we describe the various pieces and parts that fit into a whole-

these pieces together. As you probably guessed if you read Chapter 8 first,
you do have to begin this process with a decision. Do you want to run a cen-
trally powered (amplified) audio system that uses speaker wires to carry
music to remote locations, or do you want to use a system that carries unam-
plified signals around the house (using CAT-5e cabling — the cables used in a
computer LAN — or Wi-Fi wireless technology)?
That’s a decision that we can’t make for you, but we’ll begin with a quick dis-
cussion of the pros and cons of each approach.
Then we’ll get into speaker wire systems, with a description of the simplest
whole-home audio network: a single-zone system that provides a single audio
source simultaneously to each room. Then we move on to a brief description
of more sophisticated, multizone audio systems, which let you listen to differ-
ent audio programs in different parts of the house. Hot on the heels of this
discussion is a description of those systems that distribute audio using 
CAT-5e/6 cabling. We don’t stop there — we also discuss wireless alternatives
to a home-audio network.

Making the Big Choice
As we said in the introduction, building a whole-home audio system requires
you to make a few fundamental choices up front. The first and biggest choice
to make is whether you want to go for a more traditional, centrally amplified
audio system or one of the newer distributed systems. A centrally amplified
audio network consists of a big multichannel amplifier in the middle (the vir-
tual middle, it can be located anywhere in your home), and a series of speaker
wires (and control wires, as we discuss in Chapter 20) running out to each
room or location where you want sound.
The distributed systems, on the other hand, move the amplification to each
location where you want to have speakers. Your sources may be in a central
location (though they don’t always have to be — some distributed systems
let you plug in an audio source anywhere you want), but the amplifiers that
run your speakers are located in the room with those speakers.
Tables 9-1 examines each of these systems for their pros and cons:

We find that most people today (it’s early 2007 as we are writing) still choose
the centrally amplified (speaker wire) solution. It’s a proven technology that
almost all installers know how to handle easily. It does, however, have a bit
less flexibility — for example, if you want to dock an iPod in the bedroom and
play it on a whole-house system, that doesn’t always work with a speaker
146
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

wire solution. And while it is usually cheaper to go with speaker wires, once
you start layering control networks and fancy multizone controllers on top of
your speaker wires, you can easily spend more.
Our advice is to look at the capabilities and prices of the solutions out there —
and in this chapter we’ll name several companies that are leaders in these
products — and do a comparison based on your own needs. Over time,
advances in things such as Class D Digital Amplification (used in the remote
amplifiers in distributed systems) and better wireless (like the emerging
802.11n standard we discuss in Chapter 16) will make distributed systems
better and cheaper.
If you want to futureproof your home’s audio system during new construction
or during a remodel, we suggest that you do the following: to each location
where you might want audio (and think hard, it might be everywhere!) run two
lengths of CAT-5e/6 cabling (have them end up where you’d like to have a
keypad or controller device) and a stereo pair of 16- or 14-gauge speaker wire.
Bring them all back to a central location (your wiring closet or home theater/
media room). And then you’ll be able to hook them up and use them for either
kind of system. Remember, cables are cheap, and it won’t hurt to have too
many.
This wiring advice is also useful when you consider that many manufacturers
are developing systems that are a hybrid between centrally amplified and 
distributed systems. Some manufacturers (such as Niles Audio’s ICS system,
for example, at www.nilesaudio.com) use a central amplifier and then use
CAT-5e/6 cabling for control and data purposes (like sending a list of songs 
on a music server to your touchscreen). You can also expect to see that 
CAT-5e/6 cable being used to feed remote audio sources (like that iPod dock
in your bedroom) back into the central amplifier. And other manufacturers,
like Control4 (www.control4.com) have both centrally amplified audio sys-
tems and CAT-5e/6 or Wi-Fi systems that can be mixed together and controlled
as a single unified system.
Reaching for a Star
The speaker-wire audio network that we recommend is similar to the video
network (and most of the other networks we talk about): a centrally distrib-
uted star configuration. All audio sources, amplification, and control systems
are in one place, and speaker cables are distributed in a star fashion, with
individual runs going to each speaker location. As is the case with your video
network (but not with the other networks we describe), you probably want 
to use your home-theater room (or media room) as the central distribution
point for your audio network. We describe the media room in Chapter 2.
147
Chapter 9: Running Audio Here, There, and Everywhere

The speaker wire audio network is different than the other networks in one
major way — it’s a one-way network. All audio source devices are located at
the central distribution point. This type of network doesn’t lend itself to a
two-way architecture, in which remote source devices can send signals back
to the central distribution point.
You can distribute an audio source located in a room other than your media
room, but the process is difficult. Connect a long run of line-level component
cable (the type of cable that typically connects components such a CD player
and a receiver) from the remote audio source to your central amplifier con-
trol point. We don’t address this option in our basic network architecture, so
consult with a knowledgeable installer if you want to do this, or consider one
of the distributed systems that will let you do this over CAT-5e/6 cabling.
If you’re not using a CAT-5e/6 system, but want a remote audio source, the best
way to distribute line-level audio signals over long distances is to use some-
thing called a balanced line-level cable. The pros use it in recording studios. 
The problem with trying to set up this kind of audio distribution on a consumer
level is that only a small percentage of home-audio equipment is outfitted with
these kinds of connectors (only the expensive stuff, for the most part). Many
audio manufacturers have decided that these traditional balanced audio sys-
tems are not practical for the residential market, hence the alternative: using
CAT-5e/6 UTP cabling to carry line-level signals around the house. We discuss
this in detail in the “Catching up with CAT-5e/6” section, later in this chapter.
Single-Zone Simplicity
The simplest and most inexpensive way to move into whole-home audio is to
build a single-zone audio network, which is a network that allows you to send
an audio source to speakers in different rooms (although you can’t listen to
different audio sources in different rooms). We tell you about the functions of
the individual components of such a network in Chapter 8; in this section, we
tell you how to hook up this network.
Even simple, single-zone audio networks have a ton of variations. Your per-
sonal preferences, budget, and existing audio components play a big role in
shaping your network. For example, you can choose between an all-in-one
receiver and an integrated amp to handle the control and amplification roles,
or you can use separate components. You can decide to use a single amplifier
with impedance-matching devices, or you can set up separate amplifiers in
your media room for each pair of speakers. You can choose in-wall speakers
or conventional models.
Regardless of what you decide, the basic network architecture remains the
same: pairs of speaker cables run in a star-wiring configuration from a central
amplification point to each speaker location in the house.
148
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

Installing a single-zone, 
single-amplifier system
Here’s a general layout for a single-zone, single-amplifier system:
1. Using pairs of line-level audio interconnect cables, connect your source
devices to the inputs of your preamplifier, or control amplifier.
2. Use a pair of RCA cables to connect your amplifier to your power
amplifier.
If you’re using a receiver (or an integrated amplifier) instead of separate
components, you can skip this step. Instead, connect your audio source
components directly to the receiver.
3. Choose an impedance-matching system and do one of the following:
a. If you’re using multiple impedance-matching transformer/
volume controls in each room, connect the main speaker outputs
from your amplifier or receiver to a parallel connecting block
with a short length of speaker wire.
The parallel connecting block splits a single audio output into mul-
tiple audio outputs — like an audio cloning device.
b. If you’re using a single impedance-matching/speaker-selector
device that resides in the media room, connect the impedance-
matching device to your amplifier’s speaker output with a short
length of speaker wire.
The impedance-matching/speaker-selector device both matches
impedance and acts as a central selector for turning speakers on
or off.
4. Connect the speaker outputs of your connecting block (Step 3a) or
speaker-selector device (Step 3b) to individual runs of speaker wire
for distribution throughout the house.
5. Run pairs (left and right speaker) of speaker wire through your walls
to the desired locations.
6. If you’re going with multiple impedance-matching volume control
units in each room, connect the speaker wires to the inputs of the
wall-mounted, impedance-matching volume control.
The impedance-matching volume control units usually fit in a standard,
single-gang junction box, which can be mounted just like a light switch
in a convenient spot on the wall. (We explain junction-box sizes in
Chapter 7.)
149
Chapter 9: Running Audio Here, There, and Everywhere

If you’re using a central impedance-matching/speaker-selector switch
instead, just blithely ignore this step and continue to Step 7.
7. Terminate your speaker-wire runs (or a shorter run of speaker wire
leading from the impedance-matching volume control’s outputs, if you
went that route) in one of two places:
a. If you decide to use external, stand-alone speakers in this room,
connect the ends of your speaker wires to a speaker-connector
wall plate.
We prefer the kind with banana jacks or five-way binding posts.
b. If you’re installing in-wall speakers, connect the ends of the
speaker wires to each speaker’s inputs.
8. For each set of speakers in your home, repeat Steps 4 through 7.
A wiring layout for a single-zone audio system is shown in Figure 9-1.
Put on your favorite CD, pour your favorite beverage, and sit back for a listen-
ing break.
You may decide to start small, with speakers in only a few rooms. That’s a
fine way of setting up this kind of network, but go ahead and install runs of
speaker cabling to other rooms now — while you have the walls open — in
case you want to expand your audio network later. You can put a blank cover
on the outlet box so that you don’t have wires hanging out of your walls.

Implementing a single-zone, 
multi-amplifier system
A single-zone, multi-amplifier system uses separate amplifiers in the media
room for each set of speakers in the audio network. This network eliminates
the need for an impedance-matching system and provides more power to
each set of speakers.
The process for installing a single-zone, multi-amplifier network is similar to
the one we delineated in the preceding section. The two main differences are
 You don’t need the impedance-matching system because each speaker is
powered by its own amplifier.
 You need to split the audio signals from your source components — a
single stereo pair of outputs — to several pairs of amplifier channels.
Doing so can be a bit of a sticking point. You have three options:
• If you’re installing speakers in only two locations, you can proba-
bly use a Y-connector cable, which takes a single pair of line-level
outputs and splits the signal into two pairs of connectors.
• You can buy a distribution amplifier that accepts the line-level input
and provides multiple pairs of outputs (sort of an audio cloning
device). This device also amplifies the signal (which gets weaker 
151
Chapter 9: Running Audio Here, There, and Everywhere
Phase matters
When you’re working with speaker wires, you
need to keep in mind the concept of phase. All
speaker-level inputs and outputs are color-
coded, usually with a red and black connector.
It’s important to make sure that you maintain
consistency when you connect speaker wires,
so that both speakers in a stereo pair have their
wires connected to the amplifier in the same
way. If you cross a pair of wires (red to red and
black to black on one speaker, but red to black
and black to red on the other speaker, for exam-
ple), you won’t blow up anything or start a
nuclear meltdown at your local power plant. You
will, however, have degraded sound, with
decreased bass and a totally messed up stereo
image.
Most speaker wires are well marked, with dif-
ferent colors of wire in the pair or with markings
on one of the conductors. If you really can’t tell
or remember what’s connected to what, use a
test CD that puts your system through its paces
to make sure you’ve hooked it up correctly. Pat
has one for Stereophile magazine (www.
stereophile.com) that features “Ralph the
barking dog,” who woofs from both speakers
in and out of phase so that you can hear the 
difference.

as it’s reproduced) so that each power amplifier has the signal
strength it needs.
• You can buy an integrated amplifier specifically designed for a
multi-room system. This amp internally splits your source device
signals amongst its amplifier channels. Companies like Niles Audio
and Russound (www.russound.com) are the big manufacturers of
these devices.
Mega-Multizoning
The basic steps for installing a multizone audio system (which is capable of
sending different music sources to different rooms in your house simultane-
ously) in your home are similar to those needed to install a single-zone
system. At least they are in a high-level overview.
As long as you get the right wires in the wall, you can change from a single-
zone system to a multizone system later, by changing the components of
your audio system and how some wires are connected in your media room.
The devil is in the details when you start setting up one of these systems,
especially when you set up the control system. (We talk about how to
remotely control audio systems in Chapter 20.) Figuring out the routing of the
audio signals isn’t too difficult, but equipment variations keep us from giving
many details.
152
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 
How do your audio and video 
systems work together?
How your audio and video systems complement
each other is a confusing subject, no doubt.
After all, your video network (by the very nature
of the programming it carries) also distributes
audio signals around the house. So why have
two networks?
The coaxial network that carries TV signals
around your home isn’t suited to carrying the
audio signals from other sources such as CD
players, and the audio network is similarly
unable to carry video signals. In the future,
when all audio and video signals that run
between components are fully digital, you’ll
probably be able to use a single network to
carry both. For now, if you want both audio and
video, you need two networks.
If you’re using CAT-5e/6 to carry your audio (as
we discuss later in the chapter), you may find
that the system you choose can carry both the
audio and video signals over a single cable. This
isn’t the case with all systems, but some sys-
tems will do this for you.

Multizone audio systems can become nightmarishly complicated. Not only
does the setup depend on marrying components from different manufactur-
ers that may have strange quirks and weird setup routines, but also, when
you get to controlling the zone audio with your remote control, it gets deadly.
The goal is to be able to accomplish certain things regardless of which zone
you’re in (such as select and play a CD) but to accomplish other things only
in your current zone (such as turn up the volume or select the VCR audio as
the input source). Whether you can do something from all zones or only the
current zone depends on how you hook up the wires from the control net-
work and how you set up the multizone amplifier. Believe us, getting all this
stuff to work seamlessly is a major hassle that increases as you add zones.
Many home-audio servers — the devices that store your music on a hard disk
drive — are being upgraded to allow multizone audio over a computer net-
work. Because these devices (available now from Request and Escient) are
basically computers, they include built-in Web servers that let you stream
music around your house — just like music Web sites do. With these systems,
you’ll be able to stream different music programs to different parts of your
home over your computer network.
If you’re going to jump right into multizone audio and you’re not a gearhead,
let a professional installer do the job.
Following is the basic layout of a multizone system:
1. Use standard RCA cables to connect your source devices to the multi-
zone controller.
The multizone controller contains all the electronics to switch each
incoming source to different amps and zones.
2. If the controller doesn’t have built-in amplification, use interconnect
cables to connect the controller’s outputs (one stereo pair per zone) to
a multichannel amplifier.
3. Connect the amplifier outputs to pairs of speaker wire (one pair per
zone).
4. Run the speaker wires through your walls to each speaker outlet or in-
wall speaker location, as shown in Figure 9-2.
It sounds simple, doesn’t it? And it is, from our 40,000-foot perch here. But
getting the pieces together and working in sync can be a bit of a pain. That’s
why we recommend professional help (otherwise, you may end up seeking
professional help of another sort).

Chapter 9: Running Audio Here, There, and Everywhere

Other Ways to Send Audio
As we stated in the introduction to this chapter, a speaker-wire-based audio
system isn’t your only choice for a whole-home audio network. A bunch of
vendors have begun selling systems that use CAT-5e/6 cabling or wireless
systems like Wi-Fi as an alternative. Such systems tend to be a more expen-
sive than the tried-and-true speaker wire, mainly because of the cost of the
intelligent electronics involved and the expense of building independent
amplifier systems for each remote location, but that costs comes with some
benefits. Namely:
 These systems are more flexible. You can easily use a drop of CAT-5e/6
cable and add audio to any room. Wireless systems don’t even need 
that — just a power outlet.
 These systems can be customized to the room. If you’re installing a dis-
tributed system in a big room, you can choose a bigger amplifier and
bigger speakers, or if its someplace that’s not so big, you can choose a
smaller system.
 You don’t need a separate control system (with separate wires or
cables) like you do for a speaker wire system. All the music, control
commands, and even data about the music (metadata) can be carried
over a single CAT-5e/6 cable or over the wireless link.

CATching up with CAT-5e/6 systems
As you skip around this book and look at the various networks we describe,
you might note a recurring theme: CAT-5e (and its companion CAT-6, which is
just a slightly upgraded version of the same thing) cabling is versatile stuff.
CAT-5e/6 not only is the standard cabling for computer LANs and phone net-
works but can also be used to carry an increasing amount of other data around
the house. In Chapter 7, for example, we talk about using CAT-5e/6 cabling to
transport video signals around the home, and in Chapter 20, we discuss using
this cable for carrying remote control signals (IR signals). There’s almost noth-
ing (networking-wise, at least) that you can’t do with CAT-5e/6.
Audio is no exception. Line-level audio signals can be successfully carried
over CAT-5e/6 cables in your walls using systems from a variety of manufac-
turers. These systems range from inexpensive ones that convert the left 
and right line-level outputs of an audio device into a balanced signal to full-
fledged, expensive audio (and video!) distribution systems that provide true
multizone audio over CAT-5e/6.
When you use CAT-5e/6 to carry audio, you can’t use those same wires for your
computer LAN or phone network. It’s an either-or situation, and you need to
use a separate network of CAT-5e/6 cables for each leg of the audio network.
You might be able to use the same CAT-5e/6 cables to carry both audio and
video signals — it depends on which CAT-5e/6 audio system vendor you use.
Yep, two warnings in a row. No, don’t go run and hide. CAT-5e/6 audio sys-
tems are still relatively new to the market, and many of the companies that
sell them use proprietary technologies. It’s best to stick to one brand — 
don’t try to mix and match.
A few of the most common ways of sending audio over CAT-5e/6 are dis-
cussed in the following sections.
Balun-ce your life
A balun is named for its function in the network — it converts a signal back
and forth from balanced cable systems (such as CAT-5e/6 cables) and unbal-
anced cable systems (such as audio RCA cables). As we discussed, a bal-
anced line-level signal is capable of going a long distance — up to 1000 feet in
some cases. A balun isn’t much to look at. It’s not a big fancy box with shiny
lights. Instead, it’s just a little passive device (meaning it doesn’t need any
external power) about the size of a deck of cards, with receptacles on both
sides (an RJ-45 on one side and two or more RCA jacks on the other).
Baluns are deployed in pairs, so you’re not going to build a whole-home
audio network with them. They fit into your network when you just want to
get audio from one place to another (a point-to-point network).
155
Chapter 9: Running Audio Here, There, and Everywhere

One balun is associated with the source device (such as a CD player or the
Audio Out ports of a receiver) and connects, through an RCA patch cable, to
the left and right Audio Out channels. This balun is then plugged into the 
CAT-5e/6 cable using a CAT-5e/6 patch cable. At the other end of the network —
down another leg of your home’s CAT-5e/6 that you’ve dedicated to audio —
the process is reversed. The second balun plugs into the RJ-45 outlet on your
wall (again using a patch cable), and then plugs into the left and right Audio In
jacks of the remote amplifier or receiver that you’re feeding the signal to.
We’re talking about transporting line-level signals, not speaker-level signals.
You can’t just plug the output of the remote balun into a pair of speakers and
expect music. There is one exception to this: If you have powered loudspeak-
ers (that is, with built-in amplifiers), you don’t need an intermediate amp or
receiver.
Audio baluns use one pair of the conductors in a CAT-5e/6 cable for each of
the left and right stereo audio channels. Remember that typical CAT-5e/6
cables have eight conductors — so you have four left. Some balun manufac-
turers, such as MuxLab (www.muxlab.com) and Intelix (www.intelix.com)
build baluns that use these four extra wires to carry composite or S-video 
signals (see Chapter 6 if you’ve missed what these are), so you can carry
audio and video over the same CAT-5e/6. This is a great solution if you just
need to share a source device such as a DVD player in one remote location —
because DVD players also play CDs, you can carry video, audio, or both
easily and cheaply using a couple of spare lengths of CAT-5e/6 in your walls.
(This is an example of why we’ve said — probably a million times — that it’s
a great idea to put plenty of CAT-5e/6 in your walls, even in places where you
don’t think you’ll use it for computers or phones. It will seem like a ridiculous
amount of cable, but you’ll use it.)
Getting on the A-BUS
Baluns are a great (and cheap — you can pick up a pair for just over $100)
way to use CAT-5e/6 to move audio around your home, but they aren’t going
to cut it if you have a multiroom, multizone system in mind. Systems based
on the A-BUS standard (which we mention in Chapter 8), however, will do the
trick for you.
A-BUS (www.a-bus.com) is a CAT-5e/6 distributed audio system supported
by more than a dozen vendors (there’s a list on the A-BUS Web site). The 
cool thing about A-BUS is that each location requires only a single CAT-5e/6
to bring all the audio, power (for the amplifiers and keypads/controllers), 
and control signals you need. So you won’t need to worry about running big
heavy speaker wires and extra cables for the control system.
156
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

A-BUS systems range from single-input, single-zone systems (that take a
single audio source and pipe it to multiple locations) to more complex multi-
input, multizone systems. Because all of these systems use a single CAT-5e/6
cable, you can start off simple and upgrade by just changing out or adding
components. Nice and simple, just the way we like it.
To make an A-BUS system, you need the following components (in addition to
the runs of CAT-5e/6 cabling):
 An audio source (or sources) at the central point of the network.
 Speakers at each location where you want sound. (The speakers can be
conventional or in-wall.)
 A hub, which is the central control and input point for your A-BUS
system. The hub distributes your analog audio input(s) over the CAT-
5e/6 cables. The hub requires AC power (which it then distributes to the
rest of the network using CAT-5e/6).
 Power modules, which are the endpoints of your A-BUS system, provid-
ing control and amplification for your speakers. They’re single-gang
boxes, so they fit into your wall in the same space taken up by a single
light switch.
To make it all work, you simply connect the CAT-5e/6 cables, plug in your
source device, and connect your speakers to the power modules. One neat
feature of the A-BUS power modules is their ability to connect to a local audio
source, so you can use the same speakers and amplifier for both your whole-
home system and a local audio device.
Vendors of A-BUS products include Russound and Leviton (www.leviton.
com), as a part of their Leviton Architectural Edition powered by JBL system,
which includes a range of components and speakers. You can also find A-BUS
built into home-theater receivers by Onkyo (www.onkyo.com), in their high-
end Integra line, and by Harman/Kardon (www.harmankardon.com) — the
Harman/Kardon receiver is sold as part of the Leviton system.
Going with proprietary solutions
Although a number of vendors are using A-BUS, it’s not the only game in town
when it comes to whole-home audio over CAT-5e/6. Several vendors have cre-
ated their own systems, using different methods towards the same aim —
audio over CAT-5e/6. A few examples follow:
 Control4: Control4 (www.control4.com) is best known for its home
automation and control systems, but the company also makes a range of
inexpensive audio and video-networking products. Control4 makes tradi-
tional speaker wire-distributed whole-home audio systems, but they also
have a neat series of Speaker Point products that use CAT-5e/6 to bring
157
Chapter 9: Running Audio Here, There, and Everywhere

audio to remote locations. The Control4 Ethernet Speaker Point con-
nects back to their Media Controller device over CAT-5e/6 and includes 
a built-in 50 watt per channel stereo amplifier. There’s even a Wi-Fi
speaker point for rooms where you’ve run out of CAT-5e/6 cable.
 The ZON system: ZON Audio (www.zonaudio.com) is a manufacturer
with a sole focus on CAT-5e/6 audio distribution. The ZON platform is
perhaps the most distributed of all the currently available CAT-5e/6
music systems. At the hub of the system is the ZON ZR-98 router, which
can accept inputs from up to eight ZIM-4 input modules. These input
modules can be anywhere in your home (as long as there’s CAT-5e/6),
and they can accept an analog stereo audio input, a digital coaxial input,
and a digital optical (Toslink) input. They also have an IR output so you
can run an IR cable to the front of the gear you’re controlling. The last
piece of the puzzle is the ZAC-60 audio controller/amplifier, which have 
a neat jog controller (think iPod and you’ll understand it).
Two cool things about the ZON follow:
• You can put anything, anywhere. You don’t have to have all your
sources in one location. Just run a CAT-5e/6 cable and put an input
module in any room of the house that has audio source devices —
and those sources can then be controlled and listened to from any
remote location with a ZAC-60.
• It’s all digital. All the audio carried over the ZON system is high-
quality (24-bit) digital audio, so you can preserve the quality of
your audio sources even over long distances.
Wireless systems
Now all these speaker wire and CAT-5e/6 systems are great if you have the
walls open and can run the cables. But what if you can’t (or don’t want to!)
tear open the walls? Well, like many other systems in the home, wires are no
longer required for whole-home audio. That’s right: You can go wireless!
Wi-Fi? Why not?
We suspect that you’re probably at least passingly familiar with Wi-Fi, the
wireless technology embedded in more than 95% of the laptops sold today
(and used for a myriad of devices including PCs, printers, cell phones, game
consoles, PDAs, and, well, you name it). If you’re not, run on over to Chapter
16 and give yourself a primer!
Wi-Fi is the centerpiece of a new generation of whole-home audio systems
that dispense with in-wall cables and simply beam your music around the
house over the airwaves.
158
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

These Wi-Fi systems are, so far — and we think this will change — designed
to handle digital music files stored on a hard disk drive. They’re not currently
designed to take a whole bunch of different audio inputs (such as CD players
and AM/FM tuners) and distribute them. But if you’re part of the iPod genera-
tion (like a few tens of millions of people), this isn’t going to be a major issue
for you. We suspect that over time, Wi-Fi systems will expand to be more like
wired systems, with multiple inputs for a range of sources. But as more and
more people rip their CDs to hard drives or acquire their music online, this
limitation won’t be much of a limitation after all.
All Wi-Fi music systems we know of also include Ethernet ports that can plug
into a whole-home computer LAN (described in Chapters 14 and 15). This is
handy if you run into a situation where a room is out of Wi-Fi range. The key
thing to remember here is that these devices can plug right into the Ethernet
network you use for your computers — they don’t need to be on a separate
CAT-5e/6 cable like the systems we discussed in the preceding section.
The Sonos Music System
The Sonos Music System (www.sonos.com) is probably the most famous
whole-home Wi-Fi music system. The Sonos system uses the 802.11g Wi-Fi
system with a special “Sonos super secret sauce” that makes each Sonos
device act as a mesh network which repeats the signal from other Sonos
devices to improve wireless coverage. Sonos plays music stored on PCs 
and can also connect to hundreds of Internet radio stations and to many of
the leading Internet subscription music services, such as Rhapsody (www.
rhapsody.com) and Yahoo! Music. There are two main components to the
Sonos system:
 The Zone Player: This is the guts of the system, and includes the com-
puter hardware to make it all run, the wireless radio transceiver, and the
audio hardware. Sonos has two models: the ZP100 ($499), which includes
a 50 watt per channel stereo amplifier (so you just need to plug in a pair
of speakers), and the ZP80 ($349), which doesn’t (so it works with an
existing amplifier and speaker system).
 The Sonos Controller: This is a wireless handheld controller that lets
you control the system (like most controllers do) and “see” your music.
The controller (which costs $399) has a color LCD display and a jog
wheel (we’re detecting an iPod-like theme here in this chapter) that lets
you quickly browse through your music, set up playlists, and more.
 We lied. You need a third component, but it doesn’t come from Sonos.
You need a PC or a Mac to plug into one of the Zone Players. The com-
puter holds your digitized music — Sonos just distributes it for you.
Your music can be in the common MP3, AAC (iTunes), or WMV (Windows
Media) formats, as well as in some more exotic formats such as Ogg
Vorbis or FLAC. The Sonos system will even play downloaded music
from several online music stores.
159
Chapter 9: Running Audio Here, There, and Everywhere

Unfortunately, iTunes Store downloads are not supported, but any other
music you have in iTunes (that you’ve ripped yourself) is supported.
Figure 9-3 shows the Sonos system.
Yamaha’s MusicCAST
Another leading Wi-Fi whole-home music solution comes from Yamaha — the
big Japanese company that makes everything from motorcycles to pianos.
The Yamaha MusicCAST systems (you can find it at www.yamaha.com) is a
hard-drive-based Wi-Fi system that can store and distribute all your digital
music.
The center of a MusicCAST system is the $2000 MCX-2000 digital music
server. This device includes a CD drive (which can read your CDs to rip
music to the hard drive and also burn CD-R/RW discs that you can take with
you), a 160 GB hard drive (which can store 2000 hours of music when
recorded at 160 Kbps), and all the wireless and computer hardware to make
the system work. You can place the MCX-2000 in your home theater or media
room, and then plug it directly into your home-theater receiver for local lis-
tening and also use it to feed music around your home using the 802.11g Wi-Fi
standard.

Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

For remote locations, Yamaha offers several options, including the $600 MCX-
A10 MusicCAST client. This device includes the Wi-Fi receiver, a remote con-
trol, an LCD display, and a built-in stereo amplifier that you can hook up to
your own speakers. For locations with a wired Ethernet computer LAN con-
nection, you can choose Yamaha’s $600 MCX-C15P in-wall client/controller/
amplifier. This device fits in a standard double-gang box in your wall (the
same size as a double light switch) and includes the MusicCAST client, a
remote control, an LCD display, and an amplifier that can power two speakers.
161
Chapter 9: Running Audio Here, There, and Everywhere
Making the iPod the center of your audio network
A lot of people keep all their music on an iPod.
Pat has three iPods in his house, and only two
people old enough to listen to one, and don’t
even ask about Danny’s house, with four
tweener/teen kids. Apple and its partners have
made a lot of money selling a range of iPod
accessories, ranging from car adapters to boom
boxes, so it’s no surprise that some enterprising
companies have begun to build systems that
make the iPod the center of a whole-home
audio network.
A new company called EOS Wireless (www.
eoswireless.com) had developed an iPod
wireless system (called the EOS) that provides a
cheap and easy way of making a whole-home
iPod network. The EOS system uses a propri-
etary radio technology (which operates in the
same 2.4 GHz frequency band as Wi-Fi but
doesn’t interfere) to transmit your iPod’s audio
up to 150 feet from the base station. There are
two components: the base station ($200), which
includes an iPod dock and an auxiliary input for
other audio sources, and the remote satellite
speaker unit ($150) which receives the audio
beamed out from the base station and plays it
back using stereo speaker drivers and a sub-
woofer. You can connect up to four remote
satellites to the base station, and any iPod
except the tiny Shuffle and the first-generation
model is supported.
Another way of integrating an iPod to your
whole-home audio system (whether it be a
speaker wire, CAT-5e/6, or Wi-Fi system) is to use
an iPod Dock connected to the main audio
system. Many audio receivers (from companies
such as Denon, Onkyo, Yamaha and Harman/
Kardon) offer accessory iPod docks that plug
into the back of the receiver. Connect the dock,
drop your iPod into the docking station and —
voila! — you have complete access to, and con-
trol of, your iPod from any spot in the house that
can control the receiver. This is a cheap and
easy way of iPod integration, because the docks
usually cost less than $150 (on top of the price of
the receiver, of course).
Finally, a few manufacturers are making in-wall
iPod docks. An example of this is the iPort
(http://www.iportmusic.com/). The
iPort installs in a standard electrical box and
lets you simply dock the iPod in the wall and
play it back on local or remote speakers. The
iPort uses a CAT-5e/6 cable to carry music, con-
trol signals, power, and metadata (song infor-
mation) to remote amplifiers, speakers, and
control systems. You can use the system for a
single room (connecting to an audio system) or,
with a longer run of CAT-5e/6, connect back to a
whole-home audio system.

Keeping it simple with wireless media adapters
As you may have noticed, whole-home Wi-Fi audio systems aren’t cheap. You
can expect to pay $1500 or more to get a multiroom system set up with a
Sonos or MusicCAST system. Perhaps your budget is a bit more limited, or
your needs are less complex (maybe you only need to bring your music to
one other location).
A cheap way of extending audio — in particular, computer-based audio — is
to use a digital media adapter, or DMA. These devices are Wi-Fi-based net-
working devices that distribute digital audio from a PC or music server to a
remote location in your home. (Like the whole-home Wi-Fi systems, digital
media adapters also include Ethernet for CAT-5e/6 data networks.)
Note the word media in the name, and not music. Most DMAs will also trans-
mit pictures and, in many cases, video from your computer network to your
entertainment systems. For the most part, they don’t work all that well for
TV-quality video, but that will change as Wi-Fi improves.
DMAs are adapters, not players. They convert digital music to a signal that
can be played by a receiver/amplifier and speakers, but have neither them-
selves. So you’ll connect the DMA to the audio inputs of a local audio system
to actually hear music.
Pretty much every manufacturer of home wireless-networking gear (Linksys,
D-Link, NETGEAR, Buffalo, and Belkin, for example) has at least one DMA. A
few companies specialize in DMAs, and we think they do the best job of build-
ing these devices:
 Roku Labs (www.rokulabs.com): The SoundBridge (there are two
models, at $200 and $400) is a tubular-shaped, stylish metal-and-black
plastic DMA with a big and super-bright fluorescent display. The display
on the top model is a whopping 12 inches across, making it easy to read
across the room. The SoundBridge models support Mac and Windows
computers and can play back WMV, AAC, and MP3 audio files. They also
support Internet radio stations, and you can install more than one unit
in your home (up to ten, in fact).
 Slim Devices (www.slimdevices.com): If you ask any high-end audio nut
what the best DMA is, you’ll hear one answer consistently: SlimDevices.
They have two models:
• The $300 Squeezebox is the entry-level model (though entry-level
is a relative term here). It supports 802.11g Wi-Fi networks and can
play back a dizzying array of digital music file types, including all
lossless formats (which audiophiles prefer). Like the SoundBridge,
the Squeezebox has a nice big fluorescent display that’s easy to
read from a distance.
162
Part II: Making Your Home an Entertainment Center 

• The $2000 Transporter is the high-end model. And by high-end, we
really mean high end. For your two grand, the Transporter gives
you the kinds of internal electronics and circuitry you get in the
fanciest audio equipment, with special designs to reduce things
such as jitter (timing errors in digital audio) that give you that last
degree of audio purity.
Speaking out with wireless speakers
The cheapest way to extend audio from one room to another is to use a
simple RF wireless system. These come in two main flavors:
 Wireless speaker systems connect to the line-level outputs of a source
device or preamplifier and send the signal over a 900-MHz or 2.4-GHz
channel to a pair of self-amplified stereo speakers.
 Wireless line-level distribution systems hook up to your source compo-
nents in the same fashion but send their signal to a receiver that hooks
into your own amplifier and speakers on the far end.
One major potential difficulty with this sort of wireless system is that it uses
a line-level input — and most source devices have only one. So you may run
into trouble hooking up a CD player, for example, to both a receiver (or amp)
for local listening and to one of these devices for remote listening. Luckily,
many of these units also accept the output of your receiver or amp’s head-
phone jack, so you can avoid this problem if you have a headphone jack
available. (Alternately, you can use a simple Y-splitter audio cable, which has
one set of stereo RCA plugs on one end and two on the other.) Prices for
these wireless systems range from about $75 to $200. Major manufacturers
include
 Sony (www.sony.com)
 Acoustic Research (www.araccessories.com)
 RCA (www.rca.com)
 Audiovox/Terk (www.audiovox.com)
The advent of Wi-Fi-based audio systems and DMAs has made this category
of product somewhat obsolete. For the most part, you can still find wireless
speakers, but wireless line-level distribution systems are being phased out.

In this part . . .
T
he key to a great home-phone system is the flexibility
to have many different types of endpoints hanging out
of a good, solid base infrastructure. By the pool, you may
want waterproof phones; in the office, a good conference
capability; in the kitchen, a cordless option. You may also
need to be able to transfer calls, talk within the home on
an intercom, use caller ID, and more, wherever you are in
your smart home.
In this part, we tell you how to create a telephony back-
bone in your house. We discuss the major elements of a
whole-home telephone network and describe the advan-
tages of connecting all the telephone pieces and parts. We
also tell you about some cool wireless-phone systems that
have all the functionality of wired phones but require only
a limited amount of telephone wiring in the walls. Finally,
we talk about the different communications equipment
and services available — including the latest and greatest
services that use the Internet and broadband connections
for phone calls.

M
ost people take their telephone service for granted. Plug your phone
into the wall jack, pay your monthly bill to your area’s telephone
monopoly, and, as Donnie Brasco might say, fuggitaboudit. As life becomes
increasingly wired, however, you may want to do things that require a more
sophisticated phone system than the trusty AT&T model you bought back in
the ’70s when you switched over to Touch-Tone. For example, you may want
to send faxes, transfer calls within your home, or use your phone system as
an intercom.
Not only are our telephone needs more complicated than in the past, but
we’re also beginning to face a plethora of choices in how we get phone ser-
vice delivered to our homes. Thanks to deregulation by Congress and the
Federal Communications Commission, a whole host of companies — some
familiar, some not — are offering competitive local phone services to residen-
tial customers. Many of these companies are offering phone service over
your broadband Internet connection — providing cheap (or even free) calls
around the world. As if this were not enough, more and more people are
using their cell phone as their home phone — finding that having both a local
line and a cell phone line is redundant.
Your phone network in your home is important not only because you can
place your voice calls over these lines but also because you may need your
phone network for your alarm system, your Internet access, to access pay-
per-view on your satellite TV service, and to do many other smart-home
tasks. A phone line is a critical backbone element to your smart home.
In this chapter, we tell you about all the various pieces that make up a phone
network and give you some advice in making choices for your phone net-
working needs.

Selecting Equipment for 
Your Phone Network
When you’re considering any home-network system, one of the big questions
you need to ask yourself is, what will plug into it? After all, why build a high-
way if it doesn’t go anywhere?
You may be surprised at the number of choices you have about what you 
can plug into your home-phone network — much more than just phones. We
don’t even consider computer modems and network appliances here, just
standard telephony equipment that lets you talk and otherwise communicate
with the outside world.
Plug and play the old-fashioned way
The most common category of telephone equipment in a home network is
analog, POTS-compatible (POTS is a telephone industry term meaning Plain
Old Telephone Service) devices. Often called wireline phones because they
are corded, these devices plug into your network of wall jacks, using stan-
dard a modular phone plug (called an RJ-11 connector, which we describe in
Chapter 11) or the four-prong plugs or hardwired environments (meaning
they’re wired directly into the wall) in old homes.
Note: The RJ-11 connector family has several variations based on the number
of telephone lines wired to an individual jack. For simplicity’s sake, we use
the term RJ-11 generically to describe the one-, two-, and three-line versions
of these connectors.
The most basic and common analog telephone device is the standard corded
telephone. This is the trusty old telephone we’ve known and loved for decades
and decades. Little has changed in corded phones for quite some time,
although many features have been added over the years — such as hold and
speed-dialer buttons, speakers for hands-free talking, and liquid crystal dis-
play (LCD) screens.
Besides cool new features, the biggest difference among various corded tele-
phones is their capacity to connect to multiple phone lines. Although most
telephones are still single-line phones, a growing number can be simultane-
ously connected to two or three telephone lines at the same time. As more
people install multiple phone lines for home offices, teen lines, and other uses,
multiple-line telephones are becoming increasingly common — and necessary.

Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

169
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System
Features, features, and more features
The basic design and functionality of corded
telephones hasn’t changed much over the
years. With the exception of the transition from
pulse to touch-tone dialing 15 or 20 years ago,
the way corded telephones work has remained
remarkably constant for generations.
What has changed is the number of features in
low-cost consumer telephones — a result of
the decreasing cost (and increasing power) of
computer chips. For example, you can now buy
telephones that include
 Speed dialing: This feature allows you do
press one button to dial a preprogrammed
number that you call often.
 Voice-activated dialing: This feature allows
you to talk to your phone to have it dial (for
example, “Call Holly at work”). Some of the
more advanced models allow you to inter-
face between the phone and the PC so that
you can access your PC contact databases,
such as Microsoft Outlook.
 LCD displays: These displays tell you the
number you called and how long you’ve
been on the call.
 Built-in phone directories: These directo-
ries can store hundreds of names and num-
bers and display them on an LCD screen.
 Speakerphones: These phones, which let
you talk hands-free, come in two types:
half-duplex models, which let you either talk
or listen (but not both) at one time, and more
sophisticated full-duplex models that let you
do both at once. Full-duplex phones are
immeasurably better, in our opinion,
because you can carry on a hands-free
conversation naturally, without choppiness
or lost words. Few are half duplex today
(only the cheapest models). Speakerphones
are typically part of the base station of a
phone but can be found in more expensive
cordless phone units as well.
 Voice mail: You hear a lot of different terms
for the answering machine capability of 
a telephone, such as digital answering
machine, tapeless answering machine, or
voice mail. For the most part, that’s seman-
tics. Many phones offer an inherent function
that allows you to have one or more voice
mail boxes in which you can store inbound
messages. These can be checked remotely,
as well as from your house.
 Conference calling: Three-way, four-way,
and even five-way calling is available on
phones so that you can conference differ-
ent parties. If you’re doing this through your
system, however, remember that you need
to have a telephone line for each party you
want to conference — if you want to con-
ference two other people for a three-way
conference, you need two telephone lines.
Later in the chapter, we talk about confer-
ence services, which avoid this telephone
line expense.
 Caller ID displays: This feature shows you
the phone number and, in some cases, the
name of the person who is calling you.
Caller ID requires both the hardware on
your end — either built into the phone or a
stand-alone display unit — and a subscrip-
tion to caller ID service from your local tele-
phone company. Some caller ID services
also include (for a bit more money every
month) call waiting caller ID, which tells you
who is calling when you’re already on the
phone with a different person.

If your telephone needs run to several lines, you may want to consider a tele-
phone system that gives you more control over your lines and enables you to
do things such as transfer calls between phones within your home. To take
advantage of these features, you need something beyond a standard phone.
Later in the chapter (in the “Fancy phone systems” section), we go into more
detail about the key telephone system unit (KSU) and sophisticated KSU-less
multiline phone systems.
Cordless phones
Wireline phones are great, but sometimes you just don’t want to get up from
the couch to answer the phone. So it should be no surprise that cordless
phones are now found in nearly 90 percent of all homes in the United States.
These phones consist of two main components:
 A base station, consisting of a battery charger and a radio transceiver,
which plugs into an RJ-11 phone jack just like a wireline phone
 The cordless handset that communicates with the base station and car-
ries your phone conversation over radio waves
You can choose from seven main types of cordless phones (which, like wire-
line phones, are available in both single- and multiple-line versions):
 46- and 49-MHz phones: These are the traditional cordless phones that
have been widely available for many years. They send your phone signals
over 46- and 49-MHz radio channels in an analog form. These phones are
the cheapest available and generally have the shortest range.
 900-MHz analog phones: These cordless phones are similar to 46- and
49-MHz phones, except they use a higher-frequency radio channel to
carry your phone signals. These higher-frequency radio waves have a
longer range and are a little less susceptible to interference. Because
these phones are analog, they’re susceptible to being monitored by
radio scanners.
 900-MHz digital phones: A step up in price from the analog models,
these phones convert your phone signal into a digital format before
sending it over the airwaves. These digital signals are less likely to suffer
from interference and signal degradation, so you should end up with a
clearer phone conversation with less static and noise.
 900-MHz digital spread-spectrum phones: The most sophisticated —
and expensive — cordless phones, these models take the digital radio
signal and send it over a large number of different radio frequencies in
rapid succession. This frequency hopping decreases the likelihood that
you pick up unwanted radio signals — such as your neighbor’s cordless
170
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

telephone — and also increases security (because it’s much more diffi-
cult for someone with a radio scanner to tune into very much of your
conversation as you switch frequencies).
 2.4-GHz digital spread-spectrum phones: The 2.4-GHz frequency is less
crowded than the 900-MHz spectrum, so you’re likely to get less interfer-
ence, but it is used by many Wi-Fi wireless computer networks.
 5.8-GHz digital spread-spectrum phones: The newest product entries
are in this spectrum, which up to now had been used largely for com-
mercial wireless broadband applications.
 DECT phones: DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) is a
European digital cordless phone standard that was approved for use in the
U.S in late 2006. DECT uses frequencies in the 1.9-GHz frequency range.
You read all sorts of claims about distance comparisons between 900-MHz,
2.4-GHz, and 5.8-GHz phones. We’d love to give you a hard-and-fast rule about
which is best, but it depends on the phone and the implementation. Many
factors — not just the frequency spectrum that the handset uses — go into
your ability to hear well when you’re 150 feet from your base station.
In ads and on Web sites, you’ll see references to expandable cordless phones.
These systems are expandable because you can add more handsets to the
system without buying extra base stations (traditional cordless phones have a
limit of one handset per base station). You need to plug only the one base sta-
tion into an RJ-11 or RJ-45 phone jack. The additional handsets require only a
battery charger station — which plugs into your electrical power lines — so
you don’t need a separate phone jack for each additional phone. You can gen-
erally add up to twelve handsets on a given system, but some allow for as few
as four, so check the feature listing.
Expandable cordless phone systems can dramatically change the way you use
phones in your house. Before, when you wanted a cordless phone in a particu-
lar spot, you needed a power outlet and a phone outlet. Now you’re free to
place these phones where there’s just power. This means you have the freedom
to locate your cordless phones anywhere in the kitchen, for instance. Of
course, it’s that many more phones to lose in the couch too! We like expand-
able cordless phone systems that have pager or intercom functions, so that
we can ping the phones and find them.
An example of these multiline, multistation cordless phones comes from
Panasonic (www.panasonic.com). We’ve been using their cordless systems
for years. The KX-TG4500B 4-Line Multi-Handset Cordless Phone System uses
5.8-GHz frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) transmission to offer
four lines and up to eight extensions. The core of the system is a corded base
station, and there’s one handset and charger. Out of the box, you get private
171
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System

voice-mail boxes, intercom, auto attendant, conferencing, and most of the
usual features such as hold, transfer, and caller ID. The Panasonic system is
about $500 for the main unit and $100 per handset — a great price if you’ve
ever shopped for a system as packed as this one. Other vendors of similar
systems include VTECH (www.vtechphones), Siemens (www.siemens.
com), and Philips (www.philips.com).
Soon you’ll start seeing multimode wireless phones. The handsets of these
phones have both cordless phone and cellular (or PCS) phone circuitry built
in. When you’re within range of your home base station, phone calls are carried
over your standard telephone lines or over the Internet. If you take the handset
outside your home, the phone automatically switches to its cellular mode, and
phone calls are carried over the cellular phone network. Some manufacturers
are starting to ship multimode Wi-Fi wireless and cellular phones, to allow you
to make calls over your home’s wireless data infrastructure.
A growing number of cordless phones have headset jacks on their handsets, so
you can walk around without having to hold the phone to your ear. Most of
these phones also have belt clips so you can clip the phone on and have both
hands free. Cordless phones are designed to use headsets with 2.5mm plugs
and won’t accept headsets with modular plugs, which are commonly used with
office phones. Some of the more advanced headsets are phones unto them-
selves with clip-on dial pads and remote handset lifters that take your desktop
phone off the hook so you can dial — from several rooms away. Check out
www.hellodirect.com and www.plantronics.com for more on headsets.
And for people who like the convenience of a cordless phone but the solid
look and feel of a traditional handset station, some manufacturers offer cord-
less desk phones (with wired handsets). These look like a typical business
phone, with an antenna to sync up with other cordless phones.
Although we love cordless phones and use them constantly, you need to be
aware of a couple of drawbacks associated with them:
 Quality: No matter how expensive — and no matter what the ads may
try to tell you — the quality of your phone signal on a cordless phone
isn’t as good as a wireline phone.
 Security: Your phone conversation is less secure and confidential on 
a cordless phone than it is on a wireline telephone. Although digital
phones — especially spread-spectrum models — do offer increased
security, any phone conversation that you have on a wireless system is
susceptible to interception by unscrupulous folks with radio scanners.
Some cordless phone manufacturers offer phones with an encrypted
mode to lessen this hazard.
172

Fancy phone systems
We travel a lot internationally, and it’s amazing the places we’ll go to and see
three or four phones on someone’s desk, because the person needs three or
four different phone lines. We saw seven in one office in Africa.
Lucky for us, we live in a country where technology has developed to meet
the needs of the multiline user. A broad range of options is available for
someone who wants to be able to have more of a phone system in the house.
Generally, you will find phones that can handle one, two, three, four, or more
lines today. A four-line phone system is great for many homes because you
can allocate two lines to the business/home office (you need two for confer-
encing, we suggest), one for personal use, and one vacant for your future (or
present) teen phone line.
Much of the functionality for multiline phone systems was developed as part
of key phone systems for corporate applications. A key system generally con-
sists of a central unit, called the key system unit, or KSU, that handles the
intelligence of the phone system and coordinates access to the outbound
telephone lines connected to it.
Because they deal with both analog and digital phone capabilities, the key
systems being produced for home and small offices these days are often
called hybrid phone systems. The term hybrid is also used to describe systems
that have both wired and wireless capabilities.
With a key or hybrid phone system, you can
 Make a call on a free line while other lines are in use
 Transfer calls from one extension to another
 Connect several lines for a conference call
 Use your phones as an intercom system, paging between rooms or using
the phones’ speaker systems for hands-free intercom use
 Dedicate a specific extension for all fax or modem calls and let the key
system automatically route incoming calls
 Pipe in music for people who are on hold (we find that old Spike Jones
hits are conversation starters)
If you wanted to install a telephone network in your house in the past, you
had to install a KSU-based business phone system in the home, complete
with 25-pair wiring and bulky handsets.
173
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System

Well no more. Installing a telephone network in your home can be as simple
as plugging in an AC adapter and plugging a telephone cord into a central
unit. The rest can be wireless. Throughout most of the book, we pitch wired
as the far preferred mode of networking. However, the benefits of wireless
phone networking are so immense that it has distinct advantages that should
be seriously considered. If it weren’t for the problems inherent with signal
fade as you go throughout the house, we’d say always do wireless. If you
have a larger home, lots of concrete and brick walls, or just a lot of interfer-
ence in the neighborhood, wireline options (or systems that are hybrids of
wireless and wireline) are still your best bet.
Key phone systems fall into two major categories:
 Multiline key telephone system units (KSU/hybrid phone systems):
These systems are based on a central control unit (the KSU), which per-
forms all transferring, paging, and other functions. Each telephone
extension is wired (or connected wirelessly) to the KSU.
 Multiline KSU-less phone systems: In a KSU-less system, the intelligence
of the central control unit is built into the extension phones themselves.
There is no central unit — just independent, intelligent phones that com-
municate with each other rather than with a separate control device.
In practice, consumer applications — four telephone lines or less — have
moved to a largely KSU-less environment. If there is a KSU, you probably don’t
notice it much because it’s embedded in the master base station phone. If
you need a more high-powered phone system at home — because you have
many more rooms or need more inbound lines — you’ll probably be better 
off with a centrally driven KSU/hybrid system.
KSU phone systems
A KSU or hybrid telephone system consists of a central control unit (the KSU)
and a series of extension phones that the central control system controls.
Your incoming telephone company phone lines connect to the KSU, which in
turn connects to each individual extension phone by a single phone line or
wireless connection. Every phone connected to the KSU system has access to
all the external phone lines — usually by simply pressing a line button on the
phone, such as Line 1 or Line 2.
A KSU system has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages
include the following:
 The greatest capacity: Most residential KSU or hybrid phone systems
can handle 3 or 4 CO (central office — the lines coming into your home)
lines out of the box, and most systems can be expanded to handle as
many as 8 lines.
174
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

 More extensions: KSU or hybrid systems can often connect 16 or more
extension phones — so if you have a large house with many rooms, you
don’t have to worry about limitations on the number of phones you
install. You can see the benefit for businesses that grow from a few
employees to hundreds.
 More features: Although KSU and KSU-less systems share many features
(such as call transfer, paging, and intercom), typical KSU systems let you
add additional features such as automatic routing of fax calls to the cor-
rect extension, sophisticated hold functions (such as foisting your musi-
cal tastes on people you put on hold), doorbell monitors and openers,
and even high-capacity multiple-mailbox voice-mail systems.
The disadvantages to a KSU system include the following:
 A higher price tag: Base-model KSU systems start near $600, and the
price can skyrocket as you add lines, extensions, and additional features.
 More complicated installation: Although KSU-less systems are more or
less plug and play, a KSU system requires a more involved installation
and setup procedure (but it’s still pretty easy).
 Special phone equipment: Some KSU systems require you to buy a spe-
cial key telephone for each extension, which can be an expensive propo-
sition. A few systems even have specific requirements regarding the kind
of telephone wiring you need to connect extensions to the central unit.
Even systems that let you use “regular” phones will not provide the full
range of features for these phones — you’ll need to use special phones
designed to be part of the system to access the full range of features.
An example of a hybrid phone system that’s popular in the residential market
is Panasonic’s KX-TA824 systems (www.panasonic.com, price is determined
by dealers). The base model supports 3 CO lines and 8 extensions in the
home and can be expanded to as many as 8 CO lines and 24 extensions. The
KX-TA824 supports features such as room-to-room intercom, a room monitor
(so you can keep an “ear” on the kids), call conferencing, PC programming of
the system (including offsite programming through a built-in modem, so your
dealer can configure the system for your remotely), and background music
support. The KX-TA824 supports CO-based voice mail (the voice mail service
provided by your phone provider, in other words) or can be configured as an
in-house voice mail system with an optional card. You can even configure the
system with a card that lets you talk to folks at the front door from any loca-
tion in the house and remotely unlock the door (sort of like buzzing someone
in a high-rise apartment).
There are a lot of manufacturers of fancy and capable KSU and hybrid phone
systems with a focus on business use. We mention this Panasonic model
(there’s also the KX-TAW824, which includes built-in cordless phone support)
because Panasonic is just about the only game in town at the sub-$1000 con-
sumer price point.
175
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System

KSU/hybrid systems and the KSU-less phone systems we discuss in the follow-
ing section use different frequencies than those used by POTS phone services
to send calls between extensions in the home. This trick enables them to use a
single phone line for both phone calls and intercom calls. Unfortunately, these
different (higher) frequencies are also used by DSL high-speed Internet ser-
vices. Most DSL installations use microfilter devices to isolate these higher fre-
quencies from your phones (if they didn’t, you’d hear high-pitched squawking
sounds like the ones you hear when a fax machine is connecting). The DSL
microfilters will therefore block your intercom features. In Chapter 11, we dis-
cuss some ways to get around this issue if you’re using a KSU/hybrid unit or a
KSU-less phone system.
KSU-less phone systems
A KSU system requires a rather large, upfront expenditure, but a KSU-less
phone system provides many of the same features for less money. KSU-less sys-
tems, which are usually designed for three or four phone lines, connect to a
standard RJ-11 or RJ-45 phone jack that you already use for your stand-alone
phone systems and a nearby electrical outlet. Cordless KSU-less systems just
plug into any nearby electrical outlet. They differ from standard phones in their
internal intelligence. Built into each of these phones is an electronic brain that
performs many of the same functions that are found in a central KSU system.
Choosing a KSU-less phone system over a KSU/hybrid system offers some
advantages, including the following:
 The price tag is initially lower: These systems usually cost from $100 to
$200 per phone.
 You can start off small: All you need to get started are two KSU-less
phones — you can add more as needed.
 Installation is simpler: Basically, all you need to do is plug the phone
into one or more RJ-11 wall jacks, and you’re up and running. Some sys-
tems require that you set some small switches to assign an extension
number to each phone.
 Wiring requirements are less stringent: KSU-less phone systems work in
just about any kind of telephone wiring architecture, unlike KSU/hybrid
systems, which can require a specific wiring topology. We explain all
about topologies, architectures, and other important-sounding words
dealing with phone systems in Chapter 11.
KSU-less systems have their share of disadvantages as well, including the 
following:
 Less system capacity: Most KSU-less systems don’t handle more than
four phone lines and more than twelve extensions. If your needs go
beyond these limits, you should opt for a full-fledged KSU system.
176
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

 Fewer features: Compared to KSU systems, KSU-less systems typically
have fewer features. Additionally, although most KSU systems are modu-
lar (meaning that you can add additional functionality to the system by
plugging in cards to the KSU), KSU-less systems have all the functionality
in the handsets, so you have to replace all of them to upgrade.
As we mentioned at the beginning of this section, we think the multi-extension,
multiline cordless and corded KSU-less (whew!) systems are exactly what most
homes need and are the most flexible. Be prepared to go wired and KSU if your
performance or feature requirements dictate.
Panasonic (www.panasonic.com) and AT&T (telephones.att.com) offer
a range of systems for single-line and multiline KSU and KSU-less systems, 
as do more business-oriented (and expensive) companies such as Nortel
(www.nortel.com).
Fax machines
Although traditionally an office device, fax (facsimile) machines are becom-
ing increasingly common in the home. Fax machines scan printed material
and transmit the scanned data over a standard phone line to a remote fax
machine, which then prints the material on the far end. Fax machines fall into
two main types:
 Thermal paper fax: Increasingly hard to find, these models use long
rolls of thermal paper to print incoming faxes. The quality of the incom-
ing fax is low, the paper tends to curl up, and the image deteriorates
over time. However, these machines are fine for occasional use.
 Plain paper fax: Most fax machines these days print incoming faxes on
plain paper, using a mechanism similar to that found in an inkjet or laser
computer printer. These models offer significantly higher print quality
and your faxes don’t end up in a tightly wound scroll on your desk. We
recommend that you splurge for the plain paper fax machine.
Many fax manufacturers — and computer printer makers, as well — combine
fax machines, printers, telephones, and even copiers into a single all-in-one
home-office machine, sometimes referred to as a multifunctional device (MFD).
These devices can be handy and are usually less expensive than buying all
the components separately (and they take up less desk space in your home
office). The latest ones sport telephone base stations, so you can get a 
900-MHz or 2.4-GHz cordless phone system as well. Whew, that’s like a whole
telephone closet in one package!
177
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System

Multifunction devices usually provide lower-quality output than separately
purchased components. Generally, getting a great deal of functionality into
one box at a reasonable price dictates compromises in the quality of the 
components.
Color multifunction machines can be expensive for ordinary black-and-white
faxing. Look for machines that have separate color and black ink cartridges,
so that you don’t have to replace your expensive color cartridges when you
print only black-and-white faxes all the time.
If you operate a home office, you may want a dedicated number that rings to
your fax machine. Should you get a fax machine if you don’t receive many fax
messages? For the most part, a fax machine is just a scanner and a printer —
and your computer setup probably has both of those — you might try a 
free service such as eFax.com (www.efax.com), which gives you your own
telephone number for receiving faxes — and forwards any inbound fax you
receive to your e-mail. From your e-mail, you can print the fax on your printer.
This saves you from having to dedicate a local phone line (which can be expen-
sive) to your fax machine. For outbound faxes, you can use your scanner to
scan the document into your computer, and then either send that as an e-mail
attachment or sign up for the for-fee eFax Plus, which accepts your e-mail (with
attachment) and sends that as a fax message anywhere in the world.
Answering machines
Remember The Rockford Files? The title sequence of that show featured the
lead character’s answering machine taking an incoming call — a rare event
back then (in the 1970s) when answering machines were huge, ungainly, and
expensive. The computer revolution has touched on these devices in the
intervening decades, and now answering machines are compact, inexpensive,
and — as you no doubt already know — everywhere.
The least expensive answering machines you can find are those based on the
same technology found in that old Rockford machine. A cassette tape — or in
most cases, a smaller microcassette tape — records your outgoing greeting
message and incoming messages. A bit clunky, but these machines usually
work pretty well and typically cost next to nothing.
Newer answering machines use digital technology to record your voice and
that of incoming callers as digital data stored on a computer memory chip.
These tapeless answering machines have a higher voice quality and —
because they don’t have a tape or moving parts to wear out — aren’t as sus-
ceptible to catastrophic mechanical failures.
178
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

The most expensive digital answering machines often behave like voice-mail
systems found in businesses, offering features such as multiple mailboxes (so
incoming messages can be directed to specific individuals in the household),
multiple-line capabilities, and remote operation (which allows you to check
your messages when you’re away from home).
Many answering machines are not stand-alone devices. Instead, they often
include a corded or cordless phone as part of the same device or are part of 
a multifunction printer/copier/scanner/fax device.
Although answering machines have become increasingly sophisticated and
capable, we’ve become proponents of the voice-mail services offered by most
local telephone companies. These services offer you an answering machine in
the telephone network, where that answering machine is really a giant com-
puter that many subscribers share. You typically find out that you have a mes-
sage when you pick up your phone and hear a stutter dial tone; small light
attachments also blink when you have a message. These services have become
inexpensive and convenient. Before you spend a bundle on a fancy digital
answering machine, we recommend that you explore the voice-mail service
available in your area and see how the features and price stack up. Note a dif-
ference between the telephone company voice-mail services and your own
device — if your phone line is busy, the answering machine can’t pick up.
Because we blab a lot on the phone, we use the telephone company’s service.
If you have multiple phone lines in your house, you need to think about how
you integrate these lines with your answering system. If you want to have one
answering device for two lines, you’ll need to get a two-line answering machine
or tell the telephone company that “Line 1 rolls over to Line 2, on busy/no
answer.” (That is, if Line 1 is busy or there is no answer, send the call to Line 2,
where the answering device will pick up if no one answers that line as well).
If you also have a cell phone that has voice mail, consider sending all calls
from your home phone line on busy/no answer to your cell phone voice-mail
system. That way, you won’t have to check multiple voice-mail boxes all the
time.
External ringers/lights
If you’ve ever hung around an auto repair shop (Pat likes to do that — don’t
ask why because he couldn’t possibly explain), you may have noticed that
when the phone rings in the main office, bells and whistles seem to sound
everywhere. Those are external ringers — stand-alone devices that alert you
to incoming calls when you’re not near the phone.
179
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System

You don’t need to be an automotive technician to appreciate one of these
devices. You may just have a big, noisy house (if you read our bios, you 
know that Danny has four preteen/teenaged children!) or spend time in the
backyard far from the phone. Many hearing-impaired telephone users have
attached to their telephone networks special visual indicators that light up
when the phone rings. Such external indicators are inexpensive and easy to
install; just plug them into an RJ-11 jack and — in some cases — AC power.
You can find external ringers that let you choose what the ring sounds like,
ringers that ring differently for different phone lines, and even ringers that
give you a silent, visual indication of a telephone call.
TDD devices
A TDD, or Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, is a text device that
enables hearing-impaired folks to communicate over telephone lines.
Consisting of a display screen and a keyboard, it works like a computer chat
system — without the computer.
Many telephone companies offer a service that lets non-TDD users connect
with folks who are on a TDD. In these cases, an operator from the phone com-
pany gets in the middle of the conversation and types to the person with the
TDD and speaks to the one without.
Choosing a Fixed Phone Service
In the old days, you had no choice when it came to ordering phone service for
your home. If you wanted phone service, you had to go to the phone company,
and you took the service that the company had to offer. In this section, we talk
about the growing number of phone options to consider — both in terms of
which company you buy service from and what kind of service you receive.
Changes in regulations in the United States are allowing other companies to
go after your local phone business — everyone from cable television compa-
nies to mobile operators. Despite the entry of these new competitors, how-
ever, the majority of homes in the United States still receive phone service
from the traditional local monopoly.
You can get landline (that is, non-wireless) phone service into your home in
two primary ways:
 Analog telephone service: Usually called POTS (for Plain Old Telephone
Service — no, we didn’t make that up). This is the service we all know
and love.
180
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

 VoIP (often called digital) phone service: VoIP (Voice over IP) phone
services are carried over a broadband connection (such as DSL or cable
modem) and use the Internet Protocol (IP, hence the name) to carry
your voice just as Web pages, e-mail, and instant messages are carried).
Just about everyone these days has a mobile phone — which we discuss in
the “Cutting the Cord: Going Mobile” section. A growing number of people are
indeed “cutting the cord” and using their mobile phones as their primary
home phone — skipping the entire landline network. Although wireless ser-
vice can be a replacement for the single phone line to your home for your
voice calls, it may not be a replacement for your smart home’s phone net-
work backbone. You may still need phone lines running in your house, and
you are going to need access to a phone network for various things, such as
your DIRECTV or DISH Network dish calling in the movies you’ve purchased
or your alarm system calling in to say “HELPPPPPP!” As with all technologies,
cellular services have a role to play in a smart home, but it’s not the role.
Eventually, we believe that many of these services will run over your always-
on broadband Internet connection, instead of over a standard phone line. But
even in that case we think it makes sense to have at least one regular phone
line as a backup — and for emergency services such as 911. Analog phone
service is cheap, and although we may complain about the phone companies
sometimes, they do an amazing job at making their phone lines reliable and
available.
POTS
The common denominator in telephone services is the analog voice connec-
tion (provided over copper wires) known as POTS. When you call the tele-
phone company and ask the service folks to install a telephone line to your
home, you usually get a POTS line. In this section, we briefly describe how
the telephone network connects to your home.
With POTS service, an analog, copper phone line connects your house to the
telephone network. The local telco (telephone company) has a huge network
of local central offices — each serving individual towns or even neighbor-
hoods, as shown in Figure 10-1. These central offices contain digital switches
(usually) that connect phone calls onto the public telephone network. A call
travels through the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network, the tele-
phone network we’re all connected to) to another telephone somewhere.
The gauge and the number of wires running to your house varies from telco
to telco and installation to installation (depending on when your phone ser-
vice was first set up). Generally, you find what’s called a quad wire, consisting
of two separate pairs of copper wire in a single sheath. POTS telephone ser-
vice requires only a single pair of wires, so most people find that they already
have adequate wiring for two phone lines connected to their homes.
181
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System

The telephone companies are working with manufacturers to find the right
combination of technologies to make mass deployment of fiber-optic lines to
the home economically viable. Many towns and new subdivisions are being
outfitted with fiber optics in a series of ongoing and expanding fiber deploy-
ments (we discuss these in Chapter 13. Fiber optics will carry voice traffic for
sure, but the promise of being able to carry substantially more video and
data traffic is attractive to the telcos.
Connecting in new ways
Traditional telephone service and cellular phones have traditionally been the
only real options when it comes to getting telephone service. That’s changed
over the past few years as companies that have had nothing to do with local
telephone service have taken advantage of FCC deregulation and the explosion
of broadband Internet services and entered the local telephone marketplace.
The cable squawk box
Coming soon (if it’s not already there!) is local telephone competition from
your cable company — and you’re going to like this. The cable industry calls
it the triple play: voice, data, and video in one cost-effective package. You’ll
get local and long-distance phone service, cable-modem Internet service, and
cable TV over the local cable system.
When this service becomes available in your neighborhood, you won’t have
to worry about figuring out how to plug your telephones into the cable
outlet. Instead, cable telephony systems will typically include a small device

called a splitter. This small black box will be installed right at the point where
your cable connection enters the home and will separate the telephone sig-
nals from the rest of the cable signals (television, audio, and cable modem).
The telephone signals will then be connected to your home’s standard tele-
phone wiring (in place of the connection you now have with the local tele-
phone company), and the rest of the cable signals will be carried over your
home’s cable network. Figure 10-2 shows such an arrangement.
183
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System
Videoconferencing: I get the picture
The ability to see the person to whom you are
speaking has been a topic of discussion since
the phone was invented. AT&T tantalized and
teased folks with its launch of its Picturephone
at the 1964 World’s Fair in New York, but the lim-
ited availability (three cities) and expense ($16 to
$27 for the first three minutes) made sure that the
service never went anywhere. AT&T tried again
to launch a consumer videoconferencing prod-
uct in 1992 with the ill-fated Videophone, which
cost $1500 and offered only slow frame rates and
jerky pictures.
Videoconferencing has been common in the
business world for years and has required 
digital lines. Luckily, most people don’t need
business-class videoconferencing — their
needs are much more restrained. Consumer-
grade products are classified into a few areas:
 Stand-alone analog devices: These are
phones with video capabilities that use your
regular phone lines to deliver video signals
in addition to the voice signals traveling
over the same line. For example, Vialta
(www.vialta.com) has a Beamer prod-
uct line.
 TV-mounted broadband devices: These
devices use your broadband connection and
connect a camera mounted on top of a tele-
vision to send pictures to someone else’s
television. For example, D-Link’s (www.
d-link.com) DVC-1000 broadband video
phone uses a small set-top camera/confer-
encing unit to videoconference to another
DVC-1000 using regular phone lines.
 Stand-alone broadband devices: You can
also find video phones that use your broad-
band connection but don’t rely on your TV.
Instead, these devices are fully integrated
video phones, with their own built-in cam-
eras and screens. An example of this type
of device is D-Link’s DVC-2000 i2eye broad-
band video phone.
 PC-connected devices: These devices
enable you to use the power of your com-
puter and its network connections to send
video pictures to other similar devices else-
where. We talk more about PC-based video-
conferencing options in Chapter 12.
You generally find that only one kind can com-
municate with another of its kind. In other
words, you won’t find a TV-connected device
that can communicate with a PC-connected
device. They are usually paired offerings, where
you need the same capability on each end.
As the PC and entertainment center become
more linked, and as displays for TVs become
more like computer displays, consumer video-
conferencing over the Internet and your 
broadband connections will likely become
commonplace.

Cable companies offer cable telephony in two ways:
 Circuit-switched: This is essentially POTS using a different wire. Circuit-
switched cable telephony service looks and feels just like POTS because,
for all intents and purposes, it’s POTS using some different equipment
on both ends of the call to facilitate the use of the cable system. Although
millions of people are using this, all new build-outs of cable telephony
are switching to VoIP, discussed next.
 VoIP: This service, as we discuss earlier in detail in the following sec-
tion, uses the broadband cable-modem connection to carry voice calls
as data using Internet protocols.
There’s no functional difference to the user between circuit-switched and
VoIP cable telephony — the big difference is within the cable company’s own
network, where VoIP saves them money. Regardless of which technology your
cable company uses, you’ll have a similar experience and the diagram shown
in Figure 10-2 will still apply.
In late 2006, there were nearly five million customers of cable telephony in
the U.S. This number is expected to grow tremendously in the future and
drive down prices for local phone service. What’s important to you is that
the home-phone network you build today will still work if you shift your ser-
vice to the cable company.

Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

Several cable companies (such as Time Warner and Comcast) have teamed up
with Sprint to offer a quadruple play service that adds mobile voice and data
services to the cable triple play. The primary advantage of such a service is
simply lower prices and a single bill for all your services, but over time we
expect to see service enhancements that take advantage of all four services —
things like integrated voice mail between your landline and mobile phone or
the ability to transfer video between your cable DVR, your broadband con-
nected PCs, and your mobile phone or smartphone/PDA. Pursuing a similar
strategy are the big phone companies, especially Verizon and AT&T (the two
biggest), who each own their own mobile phone networks (the two biggest:
Cingular — soon to be called AT&T Wireless — and Verizon Wireless).
Voice over IP
People have gone crazy over voice-over IP (as in Internet Protocol, the lan-
guage of the Net). Your home’s data network runs on IP. The Internet runs on
IP. The traditional, voice telephone network does not. However, the telephone
companies are in the process of migrating a lot of their traffic to IP, in the
belief that it’s a more efficient way to transport your calls.
As a result, a lot of focus is being placed on the IP-ization of telephone calls.
And that’s leading to voice-over IP (VoIP) services, which pick up your calls
originating from IP devices and deliver them to other IP devices or to regular
phones anywhere in the world.
Voice-over IP services use your Internet connection to place and receive phone
calls. This was the domain of hobbyists for a long time (heck, we even wrote
our first For Dummies book on the topic more than a decade ago); they used a
PC, special software, microphones, and headsets to make calls. Voice-over IP
has become a little more mainstream as more user-friendly devices, such as
phones and video phones that can connect over IP, have come on the market.
In the voice-over-IP scenario, your Internet access provider (that is, your
cable, DSL, or dial-up access provider) carries your telephone calls as bits
and bytes of IP data traffic through your Internet connection. That means you
can make calls through your PC, home-phone network, or even through the
set-top box on your TV. The VoIP providers will install a voice-over-IP gate-
way that will allow your calls to be carried from the Internet to regular
phones on the POTS telephone network.
Understanding VoIP services
The initial reason most people gravitate towards VoIP service is because it
costs less (often a whole lot less) than traditional phone services. You can
expect to pay no more than $25 a month for a full-featured VoIP service with
unlimited nationwide calling, voice mail, call waiting, and all the goodies.
185
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System

International calls are also typically much cheaper than they are with tradi-
tional phone services.
But other reasons to like VoIP are the features that you can’t get from regular
POTS services — mainly you get control. What that means is that you can
access your VoIP service through a Web page and take charge of your
phones. You can activate call blocking, call forwarding, do not disturb modes,
and so on — all on a Web site. In many cases you can customize those fea-
tures (for example, certain calling numbers go right to your phone but others
go right to voice mail). You can also use the Web to create phonebooks (for
one-touch dialing), view your call logs (without waiting for the bill to come at
the end of the month), or even use a “locate me” service, which automatically
tries a number of phones (your mobile, your office, your parents, whatever
you choose) and transfers incoming calls to you when you’re not home.
Two main types of VoIP service are available (at least as we categorize them —
there’s some overlap):
 Landline replacement services: These services, from companies such as
Vonage (www.vonage.com), SunRocket (www.sunrocket.com), Lingo
(www.lingo.com), and Packet8 (www.packet8.com), are designed to
replace your existing landline and even use your existing phone number
but carry all your calls over your broadband Internet connection.
We’d categorize the cable company VoIP offerings among this group, as
well as offerings from the phone companies themselves (!), such as AT&T’s
CallVantage service (http://www.usa.att.com/callvantage).
 Supplementary, PC-based VoIP services: These services are primarily
marketed for use with a computer, rather than a regular phone, as the 
tool for making and receiving calls and are usually free for computer-to-
computer calls. Examples of this type of VoIP service include Skype (www.
skype.com) and Gizmo (www.gizmoproject.com). These services are
built around an assumption that you use a landline (or cell phone) for a
number of your calls — particularly local calls — and that the VoIP ser-
vice will be primarily used for long-distance (or international) calls.
The biggest difference between landline replacement and the PC-based VoIP
services is that the landline replacement services are designed to meet E-911
requirements. That means if you dial 911 from a Vonage or Lingo phone ser-
vice, your call will be directed to your local 911 operator and information
about you (such as your address and name) will appear on their screens.
Services such as Vonage and Gizmo can make phone calls just like Vonage
and Lingo, but they don’t meet any 911 requirements and shouldn’t be relied
on in such circumstances.
186
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

For 911 to work on a VoIP service, you need to configure your phone equip-
ment. We can’t tell you how because the process differs by provider, but
essentially, you use a PC to access your VoIP phone equipment and provide
information that will let the VoIP service provider properly route your 911
calls. Don’t forget this step if you’re getting rid of all of your POTS services.
Also remember that VoIP systems, unlike POTS systems, tend to stop working
when your power goes out. If you’re going VoIP only, we recommend that you
either maintain a basic service landline or connect your VoIP phone equip-
ment and your broadband modem to a UPS (uninterruptible power supply).
Understanding VoIP phones and hardware
You can’t just plug any regular phone into “the Internet” and make VoIP calls;
you need to have some sort of hardware that converts your voice (or the sig-
nals coming out of an analog phone) into VoIP signals. You have three options:
 A VoIP phone adapter: This device, often called an analog telephone
adapter (ATA), is designed to sit between your POTS phone and your
Internet connection. All of your calls are routed through this device,
187
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System
Converging fixed and mobile
The next big trend in VoIP is called fixed mobile
convergence (FMC), or unlicensed mobile
access (UMA). FMC is a service that uses your
mobile phone handset as both a mobile phone
and a Wi-Fi VoIP phone. With such a service,
you use your mobile carrier for phone calls
when you’re away from home but switch to VoIP
carried over your broadband Internet connec-
tion when you get within range of your Wi-Fi
access point.
For FMC to operate in your home, you need to
work with your cellular service provider, who
will provide you with a Wi-Fi-enabled handset
and a Wi-Fi access point (if you don’t have one).
The intelligence for this system lies within your
phone (and the service provider’s network) —
essentially your phone will look for the strongest
signal and connect to it. FMC systems seam-
lessly roam between Wi-Fi and cellular — so
you can leave the house while talking on a 
Wi-Fi call and not lose your connection as the
call is transitioned to the mobile network.
The best thing about FMC is that it saves 
money — for both the user (calls on your Wi-Fi
network are usually free or subject to a small
monthly fee and don’t count against your plan
minutes) and the mobile service provider (they
reduce traffic on their cell towers and save
money by not having to build as many). You also
get better coverage at home, because you’re
connecting to a nearby Wi-Fi access point, and
not to a distant cell tower.
The first example of an FMC service in the U.S.
comes from T-Mobile (www.t-mobile.com),
who launched a pilot service called Hot Spot 
@ Home in Seattle. For more information on 
this service, check out www.theonlyphone
youneed.com/.

which converts POTS to VoIP. VoIP phone adapters are often incorpo-
rated in a home-networking router (we discuss these in Chapter 14) and
may even include a Wi-Fi access point (Chapter 16). Although you can
buy a phone adapter from a number of retailers (basically anywhere you
can buy home-networking gear), most folks get them directly from their
VoIP service provider — we prefer the latter approach because it
ensures that the phone adapter is properly configured for your service.
Phone adapters are most often used with landline replacement VoIP ser-
vices but are available for most VoIP services.
 A VoIP phone: Another category of VoIP devices are VoIP phones. These
devices look just like regular phones, but instead of connecting to your
home’s phone wiring and network, they connect to your computer net-
work or LAN (see Chapters 14, 15, and 16). Essentially, the components
of an ATA are built right into the VoIP phone. You can find both wired
and wireless VoIP phones. The wired phones look just like office desk
phones, but instead of plugging into a phone network with an RJ-45 jack,
they plug into your Ethernet network with an RJ-45 plug. The wireless
phones connect to your home’s Wi-Fi wireless network.
You can often take a Wi-Fi wireless VoIP phone with you when you travel,
and use a public Wi-Fi hot spot (or the Wi-Fi in your hotel room) to make
calls. The cool thing about this is that these calls will be coming from
your home phone number, and you’ll be able to receive incoming calls to
that number as well, as long as you’re connected to the Wi-Fi network
and the Internet.
 A PC as a phone: Many VoIP services can use your PC (laptop or desktop,
Mac or Windows) as the VoIP adapter, using special software called soft-
phone software. The PC-based VoIP services are obviously softphones, but
you can often get softphone software from your landline replacement VoIP
service provider as well (for example, Vonage offers such a service) for
use while you’re on the road. The key to using your PC as a phone is to get
a good headset (preferably a USB-based headset with noise cancellation,
like those offered by Plantronics, www.plantronics.com); this will pro-
vide the best voice quality — using the speakers and microphone built
into your computer usually sounds awful.
Keep in mind that using a PC as a phone isn’t a whole-home solution, but it is
a good way of integrating VoIP as a supplement to your traditional landline
service. Many folks make use of services like Skype for their low international
dialing costs but keep using traditional phone services for the rest of their
phone needs.
If you don’t like wearing a geeky-looking headset when you’re making calls,
buy a USB handset for your PC and softphone — the handset looks like a 
traditional corded phone handset. Even USB-powered speakerphones are
available.

Cutting the Cord: Going Mobile
After television and radio broadcasts, cellular phones are probably the most
common wireless communications systems found in people’s homes (and
cars, and purses, and shirt pockets).
In North America, all sorts of cellular systems are in use by the various cellu-
lar providers. A few of these are analog; most are now digital. Analog wireless
systems are susceptible to interference and distortion, and they make it
easier for unscrupulous individuals to eavesdrop on your conversation. Their
biggest flaw, however, is that they use the limited bandwidth allocated to cel-
lular systems by the FCC inefficiently. This inefficiency limits the number of
calls the systems can handle at any one time and makes services more expen-
sive than digital systems (meaning you pay more).
By 2003, 85 percent of Americans were using digital signals and most carriers
were changing plans to encourage customers to convert from analog to digital,
so it’s doubtful you’ll want an analog phone. (Most analog phones are emer-
gency phones sitting in people’s glove compartments.) The FCC has ruled that
cellular providers can get rid of their analog signals by February of 2008.
The Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (CTIA) Web site
(www.ctia.org) has a lot of great information for consumers who want to
know more about how the cellular industry works. Here’s what happens
when a call is made: Your message is transmitted by low-energy radio signals
to the nearest antenna site, which connects with the local phone network.
From there, your call is delivered by the normal phone network to the office
or home you dialed or by radio signals to another wireless phone.
Wireless technology uses individual radio frequencies over and over again by
dividing a service area into separate geographic zones called cells — hence
the name cellular. Cells can be as small as an individual building (such as an
airport or arena) or as big as 20 miles across, or any size in between. Each
cell is equipped with its own radio transmitter/receiver antenna. (If you have
poor service, and you recall that a bunch of people in your neighborhood
fought the construction of a new tower in your area, now you know why you
can’t complete a call. No tower, no signal.)
When a customer using a cellular phone approaches the boundary of one
cell, the wireless network senses that the signal is becoming weak and auto-
matically hands off the call to the antenna in the next cell into which the
caller is traveling.
189
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System

When subscribers travel beyond their home geographical area, they can still
make wireless calls. The wireless carrier in the area where they are traveling
provides the service. This is called roaming. The terms home area and roam-
ing area designate these boundaries, which are important because different
rates are usually assigned to calling in each area.
Each cellular antenna is linked to a wireless carrier’s own mobile switching
center (MSC) — the wireless industry’s equivalent of the telco central office —
which connects your wireless call to the local wired telephone network.
Too many cell plans, cell phones, and different approaches to the technolo-
gies particular to your specific operating area are available to adequately
cover all your options here. And the topic is beyond the scope of this book,
because these phones are mostly about your phone calling outside your smart
home; though we do provide some tips in this chapter and in Chapter 11
about how to extend your wireless signal throughout the home using Wi-Fi.
See the sidebar titled “Converging fixed and mobile” in this chapter, and see
the information on using cellular signal boosters in Chapter 11.
That having been said, here are some thoughts about buying cell service:
 Think about how you’ll use the phone: For the most part, you buy a
cell phone that’s compatible with your usage area. If you travel a lot
locally, the carrier that has the best coverage area and best pricing for
you locally is likely your best answer. If you travel a lot, check out roam-
ing fees for where you travel or some of the national calling plans.
 Think about hands-free use at home, not just in your car: You can get
desktop chargers for your cell phone that are also speakerphones,
enabling you to have hands-free discussions in your home office, just
like with a regular phone. Most manufacturers have some sort of charg-
ing station with this option.
190
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 
Wireless technologies are not all the same
Not all cell phones are alike, and understanding
the technology behind the offerings is a good
start to choosing the right service. The CTIA (go
to the “Wireless 101” section of the CTIA Web
site) represents a wide range of cell phone com-
panies and equipment vendors in the United
States. They offer some good background on the
technologies and have a great consumer FAQ
(frequently asked questions) document that
explains the ins and outs of mobile phones better
than we ever could. Check it out at http://
www.ctia.org/wireless_resources/
index.cfm/AID/205/.

 Think about family plans: If you have multiple phones in your house-
hold, call your provider and ask about family plans, where you can share
a single bulk amount of minutes across the phones. This allows you to
get some phones for your kids without having to worry about paying
hefty fees every month to keep the phones active.
 Think about getting your kids a prepaid phone account: With a prepaid
phone, you buy a certain amount of minutes and the phone stops making
calls after that allotted amount (until you replenish the phone by buying
more cell time). In this way, you can give your kids enough minutes to
call home and ask for help but not enough to yak with friends.
Above all, accept the fact that your phone is something that is provider specific.
That is, with some notable exceptions, your phone is likely tuned and specifi-
cally featured by your provider; if you switch providers, you’ll have to change
your phone number and your phone (including all the expensive accessories
you bought, which is a pain). So as the knight guarding the Grail in Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade says, “You must choose . . . but choose wisely.”
191
Chapter 10: Planning a Phone System
Stand by for docking
Tired of carrying your cell phone from room to
room? Are you missing calls because your cell
phone was turned off? Wish you could use a
more comfortable handset with your wireless
service? Wish you could use your cell phone as
a second line in your home, for your office, or
for your kids? Want to take advantage of the
great free nights and weekends calling plans?
For those who want to use their cell phone as
their primary connection to the world — and
have their home network connected to that line,
just as if it were the landline — a number of cel-
lular docking stations are available to bridge the
two domains. Some docking stations look like
chargers; others look like full-fledged phones.
But the setup is the same: You plug your phone
into the docking station, run a regular telephone
cord from the docking unit to a telephone jack
on the wall, and plug in the AC adapter. Any
phone plugged into your telephone wiring can
receive and make calls using the cell phone ser-
vice, through the docking station. When a call
comes in, the unit rings your stationary analog
phones with a special pattern so you know that
the call is of cellular origin.
An upside of this approach is that many of the
stations have an external antenna hookup, so if
your signal reception is marginal at home, you
can attach a Yagi antenna (a kind of super-
sensitive antenna) and boost the signal. We talk
more about cell phone signal boosters in
Chapter 11. A downside is that if your power
goes out, you have what remains of your battery
power until you lose your phone service. But the
docking station doubles as a recharging unit, so
you’ll probably have at least a full charge.
An interesting example of a cell phone docking
station is PhoneLabs’ Dock-N-Talk ($160), which
incorporates a universal cell phone dock with a
cordless phone system. You can even buy a
Bluetooth module to use your phone’s Bluetooth
connection instead of physically docking it to
the cordless phone base station. Pretty cool
stuff, check it out at www.phonelabs.com.

The good news is that most wireless providers will give you a month or so to
try out the service on a money-back guarantee. If you don’t like it, cancel 
the service.
192
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 
VoIP on your mobile phone
VoIP companies such as Skype are starting to
create softphone software that runs on smart-
phones and PDAs (such as Palm Treos and
Windows Mobile phones). With this software
you’ll be able to use your phone and its 3G data
connection (see Chapter 13 for more on 3G) to
place and receive VoIP phone calls. With such
a system, you can make calls anywhere in the
world at low rates (a few cents per minute)
instead of paying the typical sky-high mobile
phone service provider rates. All you need is an
account with Skype and a data plan on your
mobile phone (we’d go for an unlimited data
plan if we were using this). We expect to see
more VoIP providers offer such services, and
you may even see the cell phone companies
offering this. (VoIP is more efficient with band-
width, so it can save them money as well.)

A
s we tell you in Chapter 10, a ton of stuff fits into a home-phone network.
A plethora of phone devices and a multiplicity of lines can add up to a big
headache if you don’t outfit your house properly for phone service. This chap-
ter tells you how to avoid such headaches, as well as other headaches that
may come up if you have your house wired and connected wirelessly in ways
that don’t allow you to take advantage of tomorrow’s technologies. For exam-
ple, although the cables that telephone companies run throughout your house
are fine for most of today’s uses, tomorrow you may be talking over a data net-
works such as the Internet. By running data-grade cabling to all your telephone
and data outlets, you can futureproof your home.
With futureproofing your phone system firmly in mind, we tell you what kind
of wiring to buy for your phone network and then discuss how to lay out your
network. We concentrate primarily on how to create a phone network that
relies on wires, which is the way that most people’s phone systems work. But
we talk also about some good whole-home wireless options that are widely
available and not much more expensive than wired systems. We describe
some of these options toward the end of the chapter.
What to Run Where
A good way to start planning a phone network is to make a list of places
where you may need phone outlets. The phone network we describe here has
the capacity to support up to four lines at each outlet station; you should be
able to handle several devices at each outlet without any capacity problems.

There’s a nuance we need to explain: the difference between the number of
physical wires you run to each outlet box and the number of jacks at the outlet
box that you enable. For instance, you could run a single four-pair cable to an
outlet that has four modular jacks, and one pair would go to each jack. This
would give you four telephone lines. However, as we state in Chapter 2, those
lines would not be well futureproofed for data and other applications because
Ethernet computer networks require eight conductors to work fully. So our rec-
ommendation is that wherever you have a jack, you should run a full CAT-5e/6
UTP telephone cable to that jack; a four-jack outlet would have four lines run-
ning to it. Sounds excessive? Well, in the years since we wrote the first edition
of this book, almost everyone in the industry has gone towards that recom-
mendation. In this chapter, we tell you how you can use something less than
one line per jack, because some of you will simply want to make do with what’s
in the walls already or need to keep budgets under control. But remember that
we recommend one line per jack.
Now back to the planning. You need to determine each room’s minimum
phone communications requirements:
 Living room: Depending on your home layout and your plans regarding
an entertainment center and home theater, your living room can be
simple or complex. We recommend that you put a single telephone
outlet next to your favorite seat and another multiline outlet where you
plan to have your television entertainment area.
 Dining room: A single outlet should suffice in your dining room.
However, if you work at home, your dining room may double as your
conference room. In that case, think about adding both phone and data
access to this room. If you intend to use the dining-room table as the
place to put your gear, consider a floor mount in the middle of the room
(but recognize that to do so you have to cut a hole in your floor cover-
ing, which can be rough on Oriental rugs).
 Family room: Again, your phone requirements here depend on where
your main entertainment equipment resides. Because these rooms can be
big, we usually recommend that you put one outlet on each of two facing
walls. Otherwise, you may have to run 20-foot-long patch cables — which,
trust us, kids and dogs have a knack for getting wrapped up in — to your
telephone across the room.
 Kitchen: Most people spend a good deal of time in the kitchen, so at
least one outlet is in order here. Many people base their answering
machine or cordless phone in this room, so make sure that your phone
outlet is also near a power outlet. Try to create a nook for your phone
and related equipment — you don’t want to spill honey on that stuff.
 Bedrooms: Plan for at least one multiline outlet in each bedroom. Your
master bedroom may require an additional outlet on the wall opposite
your bed for your cable, DSL, or satellite set-top box access. Any bed-
room that you may eventually convert to a home office may also require
a second outlet.
194
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

 Home theater: A phone jack behind your A/V component shelves gives
your DSS receiver or PVR the capability to show you the movies you want
to see (DSS receivers need a phone line to order pay-per-view movies, and
PVRs need the phone to download programming information). You may
also want to include a phone jack near the seating area if you plan to have
a regular telephone in this room.
 Home office: Your home office is probably a communications hub, most
likely using all your phone lines. We recommend that you install at least
two multiline jacks on opposite walls to give you a bit of flexibility. If you
have an assistant, you may need to add extra jacks in this room.
Don’t just think about one home office per house; you might need two.
They might be at separate ends of the house (which we recommend for
marital reasons), or they might be in the same room, to share devices
such as a printer, fax machine, and photocopier. The same is true of
kids’ computers. They need a space where they can concentrate to do
their homework and to play. Consider a computer room, where they
each have their own spot and you get the advantages of having a lot of
gear in one place.
 Other places: Don’t overlook other parts of your home when you’re
planning phone outlets. We recommend that you include phones in the
garage, the bathroom, the basement, and the exercise room. Note: If you
want your phone system to double as an intercom, you need to run out-
lets to the places you’d like to intercom as well.
Throughout this book, we show you home-network functionality in every
room. Much of this functionality depends on the telephone. Don’t short-
change yourself for a few dollars, counting on wireless options down the
road. A wired infrastructure has many advantages. Almost any habitable
room should have phone access.
Building the architecture
In Chapter 2, we mention that your phone network will include CAT-5e or CAT-6
cabling, RJ-45 connectors, patch panels, patch cables, and more. Now it’s time
to discuss how it all fits together — the architecture of it all. Think Greek!
In the past, if you wanted two lines at an outlet, you took two pair from the
same wire and created two two-conductor RJ-11 outlets. If you wanted three
lines, you might have a three- or four-pair line, or two two-pair lines, and split
them off that way. We’re not recommending that. If you’re building a house,
we recommend one full CAT-5e/CAT-6 line per jack. (If you have two jacks at a
faceplate, two lines are running there.) This is so you can have a full RJ-45
CAT-5e/CAT-6 data-capable line at each outlet. This gives you maximum flexi-
bility in the future and melds the phone network and the data network — at
the physical level. If you have existing wiring, read on and we’ll make do with
what you have.
195
Chapter 11: Making the Phone Connection

The architecture of a network refers to the logical model on which it’s based. If
you’ve ever seen one of those AT&T commercials where they show the com-
pany’s switching network as red lines connecting big red dots and showing
telephone calls boogying across those lines and dots, you’ve seen a model.
The not-so-good daisy chain
If you have an older home or are building a new one and let the electrician or
telephone company wire your home for phones without any specific instruc-
tions, chances are you have a daisy-chained telephone network.
In this type of network model, a telephone cable (typically a quad cable — four
conductors, capable of supporting two telephone lines) is connected to the
telephone company’s NID (network interface device). This cable runs through-
out the home, from jack to jack, until it reaches the final, most-distant jack.
Phone companies and electricians often choose this method because it’s
easy and cheap. Unfortunately, many problems come with a daisy-chain
system, such as the following:
 You lose your connection when more people pick up the line to take part
in a conversation.
 You’re limited to having the same outside line on each jack in the house —
you won’t be able to reconfigure a jack to connect to an extra phone line
that you might purchase from the phone company.
Don’t wire your telephone network in a daisy-chain configuration if you’re
starting from scratch. The star architecture that we describe in the following
section is much more flexible and capable than the daisy-chain architecture.
Reach for a star
In the star architecture, each jack runs to a wiring hub that acts as a central
connection point. If you draw this system on paper, it looks like a star (or
maybe a wagon wheel with the spokes connecting at the hub).
The star architecture provides many advantages over the daisy-chain archi-
tecture we describe in the preceding section. Here are a few advantages:
 Reliability: If you use a daisy-chain architecture, any physical or electri-
cal problems in your phone cable affect all the phones farther along on
that cabling system. In a star network, only the phones at the end of the
individual affected cable are out of order.
 Greater capacity: Daisy-chained telephone networks are useful for only
the number of lines that start out from the wiring hub, whereas a star
network lets you handle as many lines as each home run carries.
196
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

 Flexibility: In a daisy-chained network, each telephone jack station is
stuck with whatever phone lines its cable is connected to back at the
NID. In a star network, all the cables go back to a central point, which
you can patch to different incoming lines with a minimum of fuss. If you
decide to convert a spare bedroom into a home office, for example, you
simply reconfigure your connections — to connect those remote phone
jacks to your incoming fax line, for example — at the network’s hub.
Starting from the telephone company’s incoming service feed, you build a
typical star-wired telephone network as follows:
1. The telephone company installs an incoming line or lines (called a
feed) from the local central office (or a remote unit such as a digital
loop carrier, or DLC).
Depending on a host of factors — when your telephone company’s con-
nection was installed, which company did it, how many lines you have —
the telephone cable may consist of two, three, or four pairs of copper
wire. The wire may or may not be twisted (most older installations aren’t).
For the most part, many recent telephone-company installations use four-
pair, UTP cable. The telephone company connects the incoming feed to
the NID outside your home.
If you’re using an alternative phone system (such as a cable telephony
solution from your cable service provider, or a VoIP solution from a 
company such as Vonage), your demarcation point (where the phone
provider’s network ends and yours begins) will probably move from 
the NID on the side of your home to a separate, broadband-connected
device within your home. So in those cases, we ask you to mentally sub-
stitute cable telephony gateway or VoIP telephony adapter for NID here.
2. Connect a UTP cable from the consumer side of the NID to the patch
panel in your home’s wiring center.
This line is the central feed between the outside world and your home-
phone network. Attach each conductor wire within the line to the patch
panel. (For information about choosing a location for your home’s wiring
center, beam yourself to Chapter 2.)
3. Connect a UTP cable onto the terminal block.
This cable — commonly known as a drop — provides telephone service
to an individual phone outlet.
If you’re planning to use RJ-11 jacks (not our recommended RJ-45, shame,
shame) and four-pair UTP cabling, and your phone network is starting
off with less than four lines used at a particular jack, no problem. You
can leave some of the pairs of wires in your UTP cabling unterminated
to start off. Just make sure that you label your cables so that you know
which room each drop serves. Leave the unused cables coiled up out of
the way at each end (in other words, behind your future wall outlet and
197
Chapter 11: Making the Phone Connection

near the patch panel). And in the future, if you add additional lines, you
can simply connect additional feed and drop lines to the patch panel
(and to your modular outlets at the endpoints of your network). Quick
and easy reconfiguring is one of the biggest advantages of a star-wired
phone network that uses four-pair cables.
4. Run a UTP drop cable from your wiring center through the walls to a
modular outlet in a room where you want to use a phone device.
Again, the entire cable should be allocated to its own RJ-45 jack. If you’re
going to use RJ-11 jacks, you have a fair amount of flexibility. You can
connect your UTP cabling to two separate two-line outlets, four one-line
outlets, or some combination thereof. The kind of phones and phone
equipment you’ll be connecting to the outlets drives your cable choice.
5. Connect end devices — all the neat stuff we discuss in Chapter 10,
such as phones, faxes, and modems — to the wall outlets by using
simple telephone patch cables.
6. Repeat Steps 3 – 5 for each outlet in your phone network.
Figure 11-1 shows the finished product — a star-wired telephone network.
Hybrid networks
If you discover the need for an additional outlet someplace in your home that
you didn’t wire with a star run, you can use a modified version of the daisy-
chained wiring scheme. Running a daisy chain from a new outlet from the
nearest star outlet is easy and acceptable when necessary.

Ideally, you should avoid this kind of hybrid network, but adding an outlet or
two to a star network by daisy chaining won’t mess things up. Remember,
however, that these new outlets lose the flexibility of runs back to a central
point. They have to be connected to the same phone lines as the star-wired
outlet they’re connected to, so you can’t use them for different phone lines.
Some great alternatives using wireless and electrical technologies are avail-
able, as we discuss later in this chapter and in Chapter 16.
Plugging into a KSU
The phone network described in the preceding section gets you up and run-
ning. It gives you multiline phone service available throughout the home,
which is worth a good deal all on its own. However, you may decide that you
want more. For example, you may want to transfer calls from one phone to
another or use your phone as an intercom. You may even want to have some
music available when you put that telemarketer on hold (ahhhh, sweet
revenge). In that case, you need a KSU, or key telephone system unit (often
also called a hybrid phone system — we discuss these in Chapter 10), to con-
trol your phone lines.
The KSU serves as your phone system’s intelligence. The phone lines plug
into the KSU, which is usually located in the same place as your punchdown
block (discussed in Chapter 2). The in-home drops (the star-wired phone
cables connected to each of your home’s phone outlets) connect into the
other side of the KSU, which allows the KSU to conference calls together,
transfer calls, and ring any extension at any time.
The marketplace offers a huge variety of key systems, each with its own wiring
and equipment requirements. Because the vast majority of these systems
require exactly what you already have installed — a star-network architecture
and UTP cabling — integrating a KSU into your phone network is simple. In
shopping for key systems, you hear terms such as 6 x 16 (pronounced “six by
sixteen”), which means that the system supports up to 6 lines and 16 exten-
sions off those lines.
Here are a few things to keep in mind:
 The central control unit — the KSU — installs in your wiring center
between the incoming service feeds and the patch panel. Incoming
feeds use modular RJ-11 jacks to connect to the system’s input side, and
then additional patch cables connect the individual extension outputs to
your service drops for each room.
 Most KSU systems require just a single pair of UTP wiring to each
extension, though a scant few require two or even three pairs. Those
requiring two or three pairs are either heavy-duty systems or are provid-
ing extra services, such as ISDN capabilities, to the extensions. You can
cover all your bases by installing four-pair UTP at the outset.
199
Chapter 11: Making the Phone Connection

 Many KSUs have additional inputs and outputs. The additional inputs
and outputs are designed for things such as door phones, music inputs,
and even a printer interface for printing call detail reports, which itemize
phone numbers and times that calls are made from each extension.
Using KSU-less phone systems
In Chapter 10, we discuss KSU-less phone systems — sophisticated, multiline
telephones that have a degree of networking intelligence built into each
phone (as opposed to putting all the control functionality into a central unit).
KSU-less phone systems have a price advantage over KSUs. However, the
handsets themselves can be expensive, and if you’re planning to install sev-
eral KSU-less phones in your home, dropping the money on a KSU system up
front may be financially advantageous. You have to shop around.
KSU-less phone systems aren’t nearly as picky about network architecture as
a KSU system. Most KSU systems require the star-wiring configuration we
describe earlier in this chapter, but many KSU-less systems work in either a
star or a daisy-chained wiring architecture. So you can utilize your existing
phone wiring and still get many of the intercom, call transfer, and conference
call features that KSUs provide.
Connecting Alternatively
You also have non-wireline options for distributing phone service throughout
your home. These methods don’t give you the same ultimate capacity as a
wireline phone network (they’re limited to three or four lines at most), but
you can get much of the same functionality with some of these alternatives.
For wireless phones to work, you have to have some kind of phone connec-
tion into your house, even if it’s a 1937 Ma Bell wiring job.
Taking the wireless route
The simplest way to expand an existing phone network is to use wireless
phones and phone systems. You most likely have a cordless phone of some
sort, so you’re already using this technology in a limited way.
Conventional cordless phones (typically available in one- and two-line models)
expand your network by adding a degree of mobility to your telephone
devices. What they don’t do, however, is offer more sophisticated call-control
200
Part III: Now We’re Communicating! 

features such as call transfer and an intercom (except between the handset
and the base station). They also don’t provide connectivity for other tele-
phony devices such as fax machines and analog modems. All they do is give
you another telephone handset, sans cord. Some new cordless phone sys-
tems, however, let you do much more.
Multiline, multistation cordless phone systems
An easy way to extend (or build) your home phone network without worrying
too much about wiring is to go cordless using a multiline and/or multistation
cordless phone system. These systems differ from conventional cordless
phones in that they use a single base station (plugged into a single phone
outlet — or several outlets for the multiline models) and then use wireless
technologies to reach handsets throughout the home. With these systems,
your phone network can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be
without the need for CAT-5e/6 cables running into every room of the house
(save those cables for other purposes such as data networks and entertain-
ment networks).
Remember that cordless phones require power to operate. If the lights go
out, so do your phones. It’s a good practice to keep at least one old-fashioned
analog wired phone connected somewhere in your house for emergencies.
What’s neat about many of these systems is that you can intermix corded and
cordless units, including accessories such as door intercoms. You can buy
regular phone sets, with an antenna on them, so you can carry them to the
conference room for lunch (no more transferred calls). And wireless confer-
encing systems can fit into your network as well. Homeowners today are
lucky to have such choices.
Going with cordless VoIP
Cordless systems are also becoming the most popular way to add VoIP ser-
vices such as Skype or Vonage to your home’s telephone network. Because
many folks don’t entirely cut the cord with their phone company, but rather
use VoIP as a supplement (mainly for long-distance calling), they find it
makes sense to use a dedicated cordless system for VoIP while maintaining
the rest of the conventional phone network.
There are two approaches to getting cordless VoIP in your home:
 If your VoIP service includes a telephony adapter (discussed in Chap-
ter 10), which has one or more standard POTS outlets, you can simply
plug any cordless phone right into the adapter. For a simple cordless
connection, any old cordless phone would do; for a whole-home system,
you probably want to choose one of the multistation models described
in the preceding section.
201
Chapter 11: Making the Phone Connection

 Use dedicated VoIP phones that connect directly to your PC or that con-
nect via Ethernet or Wi-Fi to your home’s data network and broadband
connection. All VoIP-to-analog conversion is handled in the phone, so
you dial them like a regular phone (or use a built-in address) book, and
the phone becomes a client on your network and does the work of
making and receiving calls.
An interesting example of the second type of cordless VoIP system comes
from the folks at Philips Electronics (www.philips.com). The VOIP3211G/37
Internet DECT Phone with Skype Control (phew, that’s a long name!) is both a
standard cordless POTS phone and a Skype phone, all in one sleek unit. Plug
the base station into any phone outlet and also into the back of your PC
(using the supplied USB cord), and you’re set to go. You can look up your
Skype contact list on the phone’s screen, place SkypeOut calls (to regular
phone numbers), or simply use your landline to make local calls. All for only
$89. What we like about this phone is that it uses the new-to-the-U.S. DECT
protocol for its cordless connection. DECT is a European standard for cord-
less phones that was approved for use in America in late 2006, and we’ve
found that DECT phones have significantly greater range and better sound
quality than most traditional cordless phone systems.
Adding a jack on the cheap, without wires
If you have only basic telephone needs and don’t want to spend a pile of
money, you may not want to go for an all-out phone system or expensive
wireless solution. Suppose you need only a phone jack for your DSS receiver,
and you don’t have one anywhere near the TV location? Or perhaps you need
a telephone in that unfinished attic that’s now becoming a finished attic?
In that case, you may want to try one of the wireless phone jacks available
from Radio Shack (www.radioshack.com). These devices use your home’s
power lines to carry phone signals — they’re not really wireless; they lever-
age your existing wiring. The most basic configuration consists of a pair of
small devices. The master unit plugs into an existing single-line phone jack
and also into an AC outlet. The extension unit plugs into any of your home’s
AC outlets and has a standard RJ-11 receptacle for connecting a phone device.
You can buy these remote units separately and add more extension units if
you need extra outlets. A pair runs about $69.
These jacks aren’t the end-all in sophistication — they handle only one line,
and they won’t work on modems faster than 14.4 Kbps — but they do allow
you to plug in a DSS dish or add a phone or fax in some location that you
never anticipated.

In this part . . .
A
home-data network used to be a rarity. Today, you
may have a second, third, or fourth computer at
home, and the fights over the printer, the scanner, or
more likely, the high-speed Internet access link may be
causing you some grief. A home-data network is no longer
a luxury; it’s a necessity, if only to bring peace to the
household.
Putting together a home network is getting easier and
easier, particularly with the ubiquity of wireless networks
and networks that use your existing electrical or telephone
wiring. With proper planning, you can pretty much access
your home-data network from anywhere in the house.
In this part, we show you how to create a data backbone
in your home. We discuss all the major elements of a
whole-home data network and how this data network
interfaces with your home-telephone and audio/video 
networks — the three have a lot in common, as more and
more of our phone calls and entertainment content move
onto the broadband Internet connection. We also tell you
about the different types of data-networking equipment
and services available and provide some advice for ensur-
ing the success of your home-data network.

 Perusing a plethora of peripherals
T
hree quarters of homes in North America have a PC, and that number is
going nowhere but up. A growing number have more than one — and
many have three or more! Computers become cheaper and more powerful by
the minute, and every year you find new ways of using your computer.
Home offices, Web surfing, e-mail, videoconferencing, computer banking —
you name it, and people are doing it on their PCs right now. Even more impor-
tantly, they’re doing it over a network, connecting to the Internet using (in
most cases) a broadband connection over fiber-optic cables, phone wires
(DSL), or cable TV systems (cable modems) — even wireless. Broadband
makes up about three quarters of Internet connections in the U.S. (and that
number too is growing). More importantly, broadband connections are per-
fect for sharing amongst multiple computers and other devices in the home.
In this chapter, we tell you about the equipment that fits into a home-computer
network — everything from PCs to printers to peripherals. We also discuss
some devices that aren’t PCs but fit into a computer network and make use of
your home’s Internet connection — devices such as telephone systems and
gaming consoles.
An important note upfront: You probably have a vision of a computer as a
particular type of device — you know, that tan-colored box with a big moni-
tor and keyboard and all those wires. You need to throw that constrained
vision of a computer out the window. Although we do describe that form of
computer, we also talk about how the computer is becoming distributed
throughout the home and how many, many devices can (or will soon) con-
nect to your computer network. So knowing the pieces is important, and
that’s where we’ll start.

Another important note: You’re putting together a computer network in your
house for two reasons. The first is for the things you know you want to con-
nect, such as connecting your PCs to each other. The second is for all the
things you don’t know you want to connect but which require a computer
network to work. This includes all the home-entertainment devices and other
home-automation devices that need to send messages all over the house and
all over the Internet. If you’re part of the 25 percent of people in the U.S. who
don’t yet have a PC at home, don’t skip this section because you think you
might never need a computer network. You will — we guarantee it — even if
you never purchase a computer.
Considering Computers of All Kinds
If you have at least one PC in your home, it makes sense to think about your
computer networking needs as part of your total home-networking needs.
Your present network may consist of only a modem that connects your PC 
to the outside world or perhaps a simple A/B switch that lets two computers
share a single printer. But the plummeting cost of PCs, combined with the
increasing speed of Internet connection methods and greater use of the PC in
a whole-home environment, makes it worthwhile to install a more sophisti-
cated home-computer network.
In the environment of an office or a school, computers are routinely networked
to take full advantage of their capabilities, and we think the possibilities are
numerous enough to justify your thinking that way at home.
Choosing traditional PCs
We use the term traditional PC to differentiate the types of PCs most families
have from some of the emerging forms that computers are starting to take
(such as Web-enabled TVs). We’re definitely not disparaging your Core 2 Duo
3 GigaHertz new PC with the killer 3-D graphics card as an obsolete clunker
(even though by the time you read this it might be).
When we talk about PCs (whether they be desktop or laptop models), we’re
basically talking about one of two things:
 Windows-based PCs: These PCs have Intel CPUs (or similar CPUs from
companies such as AMD) and use a Microsoft Windows operating
system (OS). Some people call these Wintel machines — people like us,
for example.
 Macintoshes: These are Apple computers that run the Mac OS.
206
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

More advanced readers may be using other types of computers — such as 
a Linux-based computer — but if you’re advanced enough to survive in the
Linux environment, you don’t need us to explain what a PC is. Actually, Linux
has become a lot more user friendly over the years, with systems such as
Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.com) using graphical user interfaces and familiar soft-
ware (such as Mozilla’s Firefox Web browser). Unfortunately there are just
too many variants of Linux for us to get into it here. You can assume that any-
thing we discuss concerning Windows and Mac will apply to Linux too, but
you must also assume that you might need to do a bit of tweaking or deal
with certain hardware and software incompatibilities that you probably won’t
run into on a commercial operating system.
For the most part, both Wintel and Macintosh computers fit into a home net-
work the same way — other than a few minor differences in the connectors
for peripherals. Which kind of PC you use is a matter of preference (we both
have one or more of each in our homes).
Looking at laptops, desktops, and more
You need to consider the physical form of the computers you will be adding
to your home network. For instance, you can choose between the following
types of computers:
 Desktop computer: Traditionally, desktop computers were full-sized —
and full-featured — computers that were portable only in the sense that
a strong person could move them across the room without needing a
quick dose of oxygen. The advent of small desktop PCs such as the Mac
Mini have changed that equation, but desktops are still designed to sit
on a desk, not on your lap. Desktops aren’t as mobile as laptops, but
dollar for dollar, they are more powerful, have larger displays, and can
be more easily expanded and upgraded than laptop computers.
 Media-center or home-theater PCs: A number of vendors have begun
offering desktop-style PCs with a twist — media-center or home-theater
PCs are designed to look (and operate) more like a bit of consumer elec-
tronics gear (such as a DVD player or DVR). These PCs can reside in
your home theater or media room, fit right on the rack with your other
gear, and use your TV as a primary display.
 Laptop computer: Laptops can be taken with you from room to room or
town to town. The first generations of laptop computers were inferior to
desktops in just about every way — except, of course, in terms of porta-
bility — but current models have enough power and functionality to do
just about everything the average user needs. However, they cost a bit
more than an equivalent desktop computer. Most laptops have docking
station options that allow you to plug your laptop into a system that has
a large monitor and regular-sized keyboard attached to it. This makes it
easy to have desktop-style computing with the option of portability.
207
Chapter 12: A Cornucopia of Computers

Which of these computers you choose for your home network is a personal
decision based on your own computing needs, but it’s important to make
sure that the system you choose has the capability to connect to your home
network. In Chapters 15 and 16, we tell you about the various kinds of home
LANs that you can install in your home, but regardless of which network type
you choose, your PCs will require some sort of network interface card, or
NIC. A NIC is the physical interface between your PC’s internal systems and
the outside network.
For desktop computers, the NIC — if it doesn’t come preinstalled in the 
computer — generally fits into one of the internal PCI (personal computer
interface) card slots in the PC. (The ones that look like they take a fat credit
card.) Other slots in your computer can also accept NIC cards, but we prefer
to use PCI NICs because they’re a heck of a lot easier to set up. Laptop and
palmtop computer NICs are often built in but can also use an expansion
device known as a PC Card. Any PC built within the past three or four years
has these expansion slots built right in — the only real concern is whether
you have one free to install the NIC.
NICs are required for both wired (Ethernet) and wireless (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth)
networks, as we discuss in Chapters 13 and 14.

The tablet computer — don’t 
wander your home without it
The increasing integration of computer parts,
the greater availability of wireless connectivity,
and the desire to roam the home have all con-
spired to create a new class of computers with
a touch-sensitive screen that lets users inter-
face with the computer with a pen-like device,
just as they would write on a tablet of paper
with a real pen. This class of device is called,
not surprisingly, a tablet computer. Some of
these devices are tablet-only (meaning there’s
no keyboard); others are laptop computers that
can be switched (usually by folding the screen
out and hiding the keyboard) to tablet mode
when the mood strikes.
Tablet computers (which mainly operate using
the Windows operating system) use handwrit-
ing recognition and capture technologies, so
you can simply write on the screen with the pen
and operate the computer. So if you like to
cuddle with an e-book next to the fire, consult
your e-recipe book in the kitchen, or work on
your e-mail in bed, you might want to check out
tablet computers. To date, most tablet comput-
ers have been focused on the business market,
where they’re often used for specialized pur-
poses in a business.

Serving up files with a home server
In the computer-networking world (and we’re talking at a high conceptual
level here — there are layers of nuance that we don’t want to confuse our-
selves or you with), computers can be broken down into two categories:
servers and clients. For the most part, the computers you work with on a
day-to-day basis are clients, at least in the networking sense. You use clients
to connect to networks such as the Internet or a work network.
Servers are on the other end of that connection. When you get your e-mail,
you connect to an e-mail server somewhere. When you read a Web page, you
get the HTML files that make up that page from a Web server somewhere.
Servers tend to be computers that share their data with many other comput-
ers. Until recently, most servers were outside the home, and you connected
to them through an ISP.
That’s changed with the introduction of home server devices that offer the
same sort of functionality that big companies get with their own server sys-
tems. With a home server, you can do things such as the following:
 Back up all your other computers to one central location
 Have a central storage point for music, movies, and photos that you
want to access on your TV, audio system, or other computers
 Have a centralized printer server that allows any PC in the home to print
without a local printer
 Remotely access your files while you’re away from home using your
broadband Internet connection
Several approaches are leading the way in the home server market, including
the following:
 NAS: At their simplest, NAS (network attached storage) devices are like
the external hard disk drives that so many folks use to back up their PCs
or store files that take up too much room on the internal hard drive. The
difference is that whereas external hard drives are dumb devices con-
nected locally to one computer (using USB cables, typically), NAS devices
are full-fledged computers (usually running a specialized version of Linux)
that connect to your network so that any computer in the home can
access them. NAS devices offer a lot of benefits over an external hard
drive, including the following:
• More storage space: Most NAS systems have room for two or 
more hard drives, so you can expand them as your needs grow
209
Chapter 12: A Cornucopia of Computers

• Redundancy: Most NAS systems can use RAID (redundant array of
inexpensive drives), which distributes your data amongst the drives
in the NAS itself. With RAID, you can survive a hard disk drive failure
(which are more common than you might think). If a drive fails, your
data is safe — just replace the failed drive and go. Note that using
RAID decreases your total capacity because the data you save on
the NAS devices is physically stored on more than one place on the
drive. We don’t think this is a huge problem because hard disk
drives are getting bigger and cheaper at an incredible rate.
• Remote access: Part of the Linux software in most NAS drives is a
remote access feature that lets you use a Web interface to connect
into your drive while you’re away from home. Forget a file while
you’re on the road? No problem. Just fire up your Web browser and
go get it!
• Additional features: Many NAS devices include things such as print
servers, automated backup software systems, and ports for con-
nections to external hard drives (to back up your backup!).
Sometimes it’s all about the features.
Figure 12-1 shows a NAS device from Buffalo Technologies (www.
buffalotech.com), one of the leading vendors in this area.
 Microsoft’s forthcoming Windows Home Server: This one isn’t widely
available yet, but at the Consumer Electronics show in January of 2007,
Bill Gates announced the new Windows Home Server software and hard-
ware system. Microsoft won’t be building the servers themselves
(they’ve partnered with folks such as HP, www.hp.com, with their forth-
coming MediaSmart Server). A home server built using Microsoft’s
Windows Home Server system will in many ways be similar to a NAS
device but will have user-friendly Windows software and be tightly inte-
grated into the Windows Vista environment. As we write this, all the
details are not in, but expect these devices to have lots of storage, sup-
port for remote access, and support for print servers, automated
backup, and external drives — all wrapped up in a way that makes nice
with your Windows Vista PCs.
 Media Center servers: The Media Center PCs we mentioned in the pre-
ceding section are themselves essentially home servers with a focus on
(you guessed it) media files. PCs running the Windows XP or Vista ver-
sion of Microsoft’s Media Center Edition software are designed to be a
central storage spot for music files, downloaded videos, digital photos,
and even recorded television programming. Using other Windows com-
puters or extender devices (such as Microsoft’s Xbox 360 gaming con-
sole), you can access this media over your home network.
210
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

Some folks (those we categorize as being technically adept — a.k.a. geeks) build
their own NAS servers. You might want to do so yourself if you have an old
desktop PC that has room for at least a couple of hard disk drives. Mix together
the PC, a fast networking NIC, some big hard drives, and a software system
such as FreeNAS (www.freenas.org, a Linux-based NAS software package).
Note that this isn’t for the faint-of-heart or for first-time Linux users, because
things can get complicated when you start trying to throw RAID controllers
and the like into the mix. For us, a NAS device such as one of the Buffalo
Technologies TeraStation Live models does the trick.
PDAs, PDQ: Interfacing with 
Handheld Computers
PDAs (personal digital assistants) are a step down in computing power from
traditional PCs but a step up in portability. These devices range in functional-
ity from simple electronic address books to powerful handheld computers
that can send e-mail, browse the Web, and do basic word processing and
spreadsheet tasks. You see business people in airports with these little
devices, looking up phone numbers or checking calendars.
Figure 12-1:

211
Chapter 12: A Cornucopia of Computers

PDAs come in two broad categories:
 Smartphones, from companies such as Palm, Motorola, Nokia, and HTC.
These PDAs are the whole package in one small container — cell phone
and PDA/handheld computer functionality is wrapped into one device.
For the most part, you buy smartphones directly from a cell phone
provider such as AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon.
 Pure PDAs, without the cell phone component. These PDAs are available
from companies such as Palm, as well as PC manufacturers such as Dell
and HP.
Within each of these two groups, the functionality of PDAs differs greatly, but
they are all capable of networking by connecting either directly to your PC to
exchange data or through a network connection to other data networks such
as the Internet. Many have an infrared (IR) device that allows you to print to
a printer (or update internal databases) by aiming the device at a printer (or
computer) — nifty, huh? Figure 12-2 shows how a PDA can network with a PC
using infrared networking.

Now that’s handy — a PDA remote control
With a combination of IR, Bluetooth, and perhaps
even Wi-Fi networking connections and an oper-
ating system capable of operating third-party
software, the PDA has all the components
needed to do double duty as a remote control in
your home. At the simplest level, you can use the
IR port on your PDA (along with software such
as PDAWin.com’s TV remote controller software,
http://www.pdawin.com/tvremote.
html) to create a universal remote control for
your TV and home theater.
If you want to get more sophisticated, you’re in
luck. If you have a handheld PDA running the
Windows Pocket PC or Windows Mobile oper-
ating system (and equipped with Wi-Fi), you’ll
find that many home-automation controller sys-
tems include software that lets you control just
about everything in your home using a graphi-
cal interface on the PDA. Read Chapters 19 and
20 for more on this.

Most infrared equipment uses a common industry standard for networking
called IrDA (which stands for Infrared Data Association, the group that cre-
ated the standard).
Beyond infrared networking (and cable connections such as USB), most PDAs
now include Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (or both) wireless networking capabilities.
(We talk about Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in Chapter 16.) With a Bluetooth connec-
tion, you can connect to your Bluetooth-equipped PC to synchronize data on
the PDA/smartphone, and in many cases use this connection to piggyback on
the Internet connection of another device (such as a networked PC or an
Internet-enabled cell phone) for Web browsing and e-mail.
PDAs and smartphones equipped with a Wi-Fi NIC are even more capable and
can be full clients on your home network, sharing your broadband Internet
connection and connecting to other resources on your network. You can also,
of course, use the Wi-Fi connection outside your home, connecting to Wi-Fi net-
works at your office, hotels, and public Wi-Fi access points (called hotspots).
Finally, don’t forget that smartphones have a cellular radio system built right
in, so you can use them to connect to the mobile network anywhere you have
coverage. Most current smartphones include 3G cellular radios for connect-
ing to mobile network at speeds nearly as fast as most home broadband
Internet connections.
213
Chapter 12: A Cornucopia of Computers
Why Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are better than IR
When it comes to making connections with your
PDA, wireless is where it’s at. Although IR con-
nections are wireless too, we’re talking about
radio-based (not visual-light-based) networks —
such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. We describe these
two networking standards in detail in Chapter 16,
but for now we’ll tell you why they’re so cool
compared to IR.
IR has a limited range (just a few feet at most)
and must be within the direct line of sight of the
target device you’re beaming data to and from.
RF signals, on the other hand, can pass through
walls, doors, people, dogs, and everything, and
they can go a lot farther too — so you can sit on
the living room couch with your PDA and “talk”
to your PC in the bedroom. In the case of Wi-Fi
(the more powerful of these two wireless sys-
tems), you can find public access points in
schools, airports, hotels, and coffee shops, so
you can connect your PDA to the Internet even
when you’re far from home and a phone line.
In the past, PDAs were a localized device,
slaved to a particular PC through a docking
cradle and connection cable. With wireless net-
working included in many new PDAs, however,
this connection is now more whole home, so
PDAs can be updated anywhere in the home
where they can log onto the network through its
radio or infrared frequencies.

Monitors
Computer monitors are constantly evolving. It’s one area where people tend
to want the latest and greatest because it’s what they look at all the time. We
talk in Chapter 5 about the changes in TV displays, and it’s not surprising
that the same changes have been flowing through to computers as well.
Unless you’re shopping at the very bottom end of the market, all computers
you find today will likely have flat-screen PC monitors, like the flat-screen
TVs. It’s just a matter of increasing volume driving production efficiencies,
resulting in lower prices. And now the prices are low enough that you can
have monitors in the headrests of cars, under the cabinets in the kitchen, and
hanging on the wall in your home office.
Some key terms that you’ll hear discussed in computer publications follow:
 CRT: Like the conventional direct view televisions described in Chapter 5,
CRT monitors are based on cathode ray tubes — the traditional picture
tube found in televisions since the 1940s. Although CRTs are bulky, they
are cheap to make, can be very large (for a bit more money), and can
have excellent picture quality. For most people, CRT isn’t even a choice
any more (flat screens are preferred), but surprisingly, for the really
high-end monitor market (the type used by visual artists and photogra-
phy professionals), CRT is still preferred for its more accurate color
reproduction.
 LCD: We bet that you’re already familiar with LCD screens — they’re stan-
dard in every laptop or PDA on the market. LCDs used to be expensive 
to manufacture, but since the mid-1990s the technology has improved
immensely, and dozens of LCD factories have been built around the world.
As a result, LCD prices have dropped a ton, and most PC vendors now
offer LCD screens as standard with their new PCs. The advantages of LCDs
are many, but we think the biggest one is that they’re much more space
efficient than clunky old CRT monitors, so they can fit in a lot more places
in your home. The biggest downside to LCD monitors is that the larger
ones (starting at about 22 inches, measured diagonally) are expensive.
 Plasma: Also discussed in Chapter 5, plasma screens are the most
common technology used for big, flat-panel, hang-on-the-wall TVs.
Plasma screens aren’t used much as PC monitors, mainly because LCD
screens are cheaper and tend to have a better picture in the sizes typi-
cally used for PC applications. But like every other new computer-
related technology, plasma displays are experiencing improved quality
and reduced price. You find plasma as a PC monitor (in the home — in
the commercial world they’re common for big displays at airports and
hotels) in a home-theater PC environment.

Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

Just about any HDTV, whether it be a plasma, an LCD, or a projection
system, can be hooked up to a PC. Many are explicitly designed for such
uses, featuring connections such as VGA (the standard PC monitor con-
nection), and the HDMI connection found on almost all HDTVs today can
be easily adapted to connect to the DVI output found on many PCs. (See
Chapter 6 for more on these connections.)
 Touchscreen: This type of monitor can be constructed based on CRT,
plasma, or LCD displays. Electrical sensors are built into the face of a
touchscreen monitor, enabling a user to simply point and touch with his
or her finger to perform actions on the computer — instead of using a
mouse or other pointing device. Touchscreens aren’t as flexible as tradi-
tional pointing devices but can be useful in applications in which you
want to use a more limited set of functions with your computer — such
as controlling lights, TVs, or AC settings.
Keyboards
There have been a lot of funky attempts to reinvent the keyboard over the
years, and nothing has caught the fancy of the mass market. (The only thing
Danny has added to his keyboard is a big red panic button).
However, we did want to make three comments about keyboards. First, you can
buy remote keyboards that have an infrared connection to a set-top box or
other device. We think that RF, not infrared, is the way to go for these connec-
tions because infrared communications can be slow and unreliable if you type
fast or move around a lot. To us, no better devices are available for keyboards
and computer mice than those made by Logitech (www.logitech.com). As
Bluetooth technology becomes more widespread, we believe it will become
the most prevalent way of connecting wireless keyboards. Indeed, Bluetooth
is popular today, but many wireless keyboard systems use their own propri-
etary radio connections, which can’t be re-used for other wireless periph-
erals like Bluetooth can be. (We mention Bluetooth earlier in this chapter 
and discuss it in more detail in Chapter 16.)
Second, if you have kids, you might be tempted to buy a kid’s keyboard. All
sorts are available with large buttons and color coding, designed for very
young kids. We advise against these because kids learn really fast, and they
should learn on a real keyboard. Danny tried a lot of these kiddie keyboards
on his kids, and in a week junked them all for regular keyboards. (His four-
year-olds were beating him at Ages of Empire in no time flat.)
And finally, keyboard functionality will be used more and more around the
house, so the interfaces might change from application to application. In
some instances, you’ll need a waterproof keyboard (so you can type in the
215
Chapter 12: A Cornucopia of Computers

hot tub, on the boat, while washing the dog, and so on). In other instances,
you might find that you’re using a remote control as your keyboard interface.
And in yet other examples, such as with refrigerators, touchscreen is the way
to go. If you find that your keyboard just doesn’t look right with a particular
application or use, go hunting around for other options.
Eeek, There’s a Mouse on My Desk
Mice share much of the same development attention as keyboards, with a
range of options on the market. We think no one should have a wired mouse,
having used Logitech wireless mice since they were invented. And there are
different styles of wireless mice — for example, a simple, three-button, hand-
held wireless mouse for office presentation applications is great in the exer-
cise room of your house, where you might have a remote monitor for Web
surfing while you walk or ride the fat away.
If you’ve never used an optical mouse — the kind that use a small light and
sensor instead of a moving mouse ball — you haven’t really lived. (Even
better are the mice that use lasers as their light source, because they pick up
even more minute movements than conventional optical mice.) We think that
the difference in functionality is amazing, and you never have to clean out the
gunk that builds up inside your mouse. We’ve had some mice-cleaning gizmos
over the years, and boy, were we glad to be able to finally throw those away
(and usually we like gizmos). On the other hand, if your desk is as messy as
ours, the old roller mouse is great because it works on top of the mess!
The neatest innovation in the mouse world revolves around mice that don’t
need to be sitting on a desk to work. The air mouse uses gyroscopes or other
related technologies to track your motions in free space. These mice (the pri-
mary manufacturer is a company called Gyration, www.gyration.com) can
be simply held in your hand and moved, and your motions are reflected on
the screen. And they’re not limited to left/right and up/down motions like a
conventional mouse; they detect your motions in three dimensions. Pretty
neat stuff. These air mice are especially handy for controlling a home-theater
PC (when you don’t have a desk in front of you to mouse upon), or for doing
presentations (it’s nice to be able to flip through your PowerPoint slides just
by flicking your wrist).
Plugging in Printers and Such
Although a computer, monitor, keyboard, and mouse are all that you need to
get up and running, no computer fulfills its potential without being hooked
up to all sorts of neat peripheral devices — and indeed to other computers.
216
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

The number of things you can plug into a computer is almost limitless these
days. Here are a few examples:
 Printers for getting your text and pictures on paper. New printers for
your color photographs are surprisingly inexpensive — although beware
the costs of ink refills!
 Scanners for getting text and pictures onto your hard drive and into
e-mails. There are scanners for business cards and photographs as 
well as all-purpose scanners. We love the scanners from Visioneer
(www.visioneer.com).
 Modems, including analog telephone, ISDN, xDSL, wireless, and cable
modems — all of which we explain in Chapter 13.
 Digital still cameras that can capture still pictures and save them to
your hard drive.
217
Chapter 12: A Cornucopia of Computers
Using a PC as a video phone
As we discuss in Chapter 10, the video phone has
been almost the Holy Grail of the telephone
industry — something they’ve been searching
for a way to do for nearly 40 years. The two big
issues with telephone-based video phones are
that the phones themselves are expensive, and
the analog telephone lines that the majority of
phones are connected to are too slow to carry a
decent video signal. But while stand-alone video
phones remain rare, videoconferencing on the
PC has become almost commonplace. The PC
has a few big advantages over a telephone
system when it comes to videoconferencing:
 The CPU and video card of the PC 
can be leveraged to do the video signal 
processing — in modern computers, these
devices are so powerful that you don’t need
a lot of pricey add-ons to handle video. This
functionality, by the way, is one of the things
that makes video telephones so expensive.
 Fast peripheral connection methods, such
as USB and FireWire, can handle the sig-
nals from video cameras at full speed, so
there’s no longer a need for a special card
inside the computer to attach a camera.
 Video cameras for PCs have become inex-
pensive. USB Web cams can cost as little
as $40 and are available just about any-
where you buy PC accessories.
 Most importantly, PCs tend to be connected
to high-speed broadband networks such as
DSL or cable modems. These broadband
connections, unlike analog telephone lines,
have enough bandwidth to carry color video
at frame rates fast enough to make the
video look like video, instead of just a
slideshow of still images.
Videoconferencing programs for the PC aren’t
just cheap — oftentimes they’re free. Instant
messaging programs such as AOL Instant
Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, and Apple’s
iChat include videoconferencing capabilities.
So buy a cheap camera and get videoconfer-
encing. If you have kids, one great use for these
video phone programs is to use them to connect
to the grandparents. Why wait until the next hol-
iday for the kids to say “Hi!” face-to-face?

 Digital video cameras that let you videoconference or record movies to
your hard drive.
You can also use PC Web cams for security and monitoring — something
we discuss in Chapter 18.
 Telephone management devices that display, for example, caller ID
information on your screen or even open your contact management soft-
ware and tell you exactly who is calling.
 Docking stations for a range of portable devices, including cell phones,
cordless phones, PDAs, and wireless headsets.
You can connect peripherals to a computer in two ways:
 Connect peripherals directly to a single computer using that com-
puter’s parallel, serial, SCSI, Universal Serial Bus (USB), FireWire,
infrared, Bluetooth, or other port. These peripheral devices are called
locally connected. If you want to know more about setting up your PC,
check out PCs For Dummies, 11th Edition, by Dan Gookin (published by
Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
 Connect peripherals to a computer local area network (LAN) so that
you can share the peripherals among several computers. This type of
peripheral is often called a LAN-capable or networkable peripheral. Many
devices today sport a wireless connection to the network, making them
LAN capable.
Many computer peripherals have either local connections or network con-
nections (usually the LAN-capable type costs a bit more). Some peripherals,
such as many laser printers, may come equipped with both types of connec-
tions. In an ideal world, you’d probably want to choose only peripherals that
are networkable, but this standard isn’t always practical.
Keep in mind that many devices that connect to a single computer may still
be used remotely by other computers on that network. For example, an inkjet
printer that isn’t configured to plug directly into the LAN may be accessible
to other computers on the network if the computer that it is plugged into is
properly configured as a print server.
Now, this description is a little techie, and the purpose of this book is not to
teach a lesson in computer hardware. Some great For Dummies books do that
perfectly. But the message is this: In buying hardware or trying to make use
of hand-me-downs, you need to consider whether the equipment itself is net-
workable. Your local hardware dealer can help you determine that. So can
that neighbor kid who knows everything. In other chapters, we talk about
many more issues that you need to know about, so don’t try to decipher
everything now.

Beyond the PC — Next-Generation
Computers
The pieces and parts that make up a PC get smaller, faster, and cheaper every
year. They also get used in more and more places — so you find, for example,
computer hard drives in PVRs and MP3 players and computer graphics chips
and processors in video game machines. Dozens of items in your home have
most of the functionality of a personal computer — but few tie all that func-
tionality together in a way that allows you to move seamlessly among them
to read e-mail or surf the Web.
We think this is probably okay — PCs are very good at what they do, and 
PC-like devices are good at what they do. So we probably wouldn’t want to
throw out our PC in favor of a TV set-top box that we can use to surf the Web.
Having said that, sometimes we might want to do PC stuff on our TVs or else-
where in the home. Following are some good example of times when PC on
the TV makes sense to us:
 PC-powered TV: In Chapter 7, we talk about PVR functionality and how a
PC with a video connection can drive your viewing habits. Indeed, with
PC remote controls that work from your living room, your dumb TV can
do a lot more.
 Context-based TV Web browsing: This mouthful of terms refers to the
times when you see something on TV (in an advertisement or during one
of those PBS documentaries that we’re nerdy enough to watch) and
think, “Wouldn’t it be nice to click a button on my remote control to dis-
play a Web page related to whatever’s on the screen of my TV show?”
 Quick checks of your messages: Eventually, unified messaging will hit
the market (it’s been promised by telephone companies for years). UM
(that’s the insider’s acronym) puts all your disparate voice-mail, e-mail,
and fax accounts into one uber in-box that you can access from any-
where. The long-term vision is that you’ll be able to read text conver-
sions of your voice mail on a screen or listen to a computer read your
e-mail to you on your phone. Why run back into the home office to
check e-mail when you’re sitting in front of the TV screen?
 T-commerce: The T stands for television. With the proper computer-like
set-top box plugged into your TV, you can do online shopping or order a
pizza from your comfy chair in front of the tube. Several telephone and
cable companies in the United States and Canada let you do this today.
The common thread to these devices is that they take advantage of the com-
puter power already built into set-top boxes and gaming machines, and elimi-
nate the need for one of the most expensive parts of any computer — the
display screen — by using your TV screen.
219
Chapter 12: A Cornucopia of Computers

As technology makes small, LCD, flat-panel screens less expensive, we expect
to see some next-generation computers that do have their own screens. A
fridge with a computer screen is available today, but it costs about five times
as much as a regular fridge.
Analog TVs aren’t well suited for Web surfing or e-mail reading — the screens
aren’t sharp enough to display text clearly. But the advent of digital television
(discussed in Chapter 5) is having a big effect on the integration of TVs and
PCs as well. As higher-resolution digital TVs become more commonplace, the
capability to do PC tasks on a TV increases. In fact, many HDTV-capable TVs
are more like huge computer monitors than regular TVs, with the higher reso-
lution and picture quality you expect from something that can display tiny
letters on the screen in a readable form.
Game consoles on the Net!
The most popular alternative computing devices for the TV are gaming 
consoles — stand-alone gaming machines from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.
When you include both the hardware to play the games on and the software —
the games themselves — the gaming industry is larger overall than the
Hollywood movie industry! Gaming is not only big business; it’s also big 
technology. Current generations of gaming consoles are basically high-end
graphics computers, with lots of RAM, hard drives, fast CPUs, and killer
graphics chips that may very well put your PC to shame.
The primary purpose of gaming consoles is — you guessed it — playing
video games. But because these boxes are really high-powered, special-
purpose computers, there’s more to them than just gaming. Sony (with their
PlayStation 2 and newer Playstation 3), Microsoft (with the Xbox and Xbox
360), and Nintendo (with the Wii console), have all created gaming boxes that
are capable of storing and playing music files, storing files on their hard
drives, and even surfing the Web.
The newest consoles (the Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360) include Web browsers for
connecting to the Internet, and the PS3 and Xbox 360 can easily connect to
your home network to find media on your PCs. Sony has even shipped a
Linux-based kit (designed more for software developers than regular people)
for the Playstation 2 console that lets the programmatically inclined do all
sorts of neat PC stuff such as Web browsing on that older platform — so far,
this hasn’t arrived for the PS3, but here’s hoping.
These Web and media browsing capabilities are cool, but they’re not all you
can do with a networked game console. The real reason for putting networking
capabilities inside gaming consoles is to allow owners to use them for multi-
player, online gaming. All of the current gaming consoles from Sony, Nintendo
220
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

and Microsoft include Ethernet (and optionally, Wi-Fi) capabilities for connect-
ing to your home network. Using these Ethernet connections, you’ll be able to
connect your game consoles to your home network, so you can play multi-
player games with other consoles in the house or use your Internet connection
to play against others around the world. Imagine having that car race against
someone 5000 miles away! First one to Monte Carlo wins!
Web-enabled TV — is it for me?
Another far less popular alternative computing device is the Microsoft MSN TV
2 Internet & Media Player (the descendent of the WebTV box that made a big
splash a few years ago) — a small, proprietary Net computer that attaches 
to your television screen. Although it isn’t designed to replace a full-fledged
computer, the MSN TV 2 is a useful tool that allows you to do some neat stuff,
such as
 Surf the Web
 Send and receive e-mail
 Access media such as digital music and photographs
 Print e-mail or Web pages
 Simultaneously view Web pages and TV programs using a picture-in-
picture (PIP) system
 Access TV program listings and automatically program your VCR
If you don’t need to do traditional PC tasks such as word processing, Web-
enabled TV is an inexpensive and easy-to-use alternative to a PC. The low
price of the MSN TV 2 (less than $200 for the top-of-the-line model) makes it
affordable enough for the living room even if you have a PC in the house (so
the kids can stay online but off your PC while you’re trying to work at home,
for example).
MSN TV 2 is not the only option for using a TV as an Internet terminal. Other
options include the following:
 Gaming consoles, with built-in Web browsers. The Xbox 360, Playstation
3, and Wii all include some sort of Web browsing functionality. The Wii
even lets you use its neat Wiimote to browse news and other Web con-
tent by just waving the remote.
 Cable TV (and in a few regions, DSL) set-top boxes that have enough
computer power for surfing the Web and sending e-mail and can convert
digital television signals to a format your TV can display.
221
Chapter 12: A Cornucopia of Computers

For several years, the big set-top box vendors, such as Scientific Atlanta and
Motorola, have been shipping devices that already contain enough power to
perform PC functions. They’ve seen that the future is in supporting a seam-
less marriage of PCs and TVs. Most service providers (who control the soft-
ware and functionality of the set-top box) haven’t launched services that take
advantage of all this horsepower yet. They will . . . don’t ask us when, but
they will.

All Roads Lead to the Net
In This Chapter
 Marveling at the cool things the Internet can do
 Getting connected by wire, cable, wave, and even extension cord
M
ost people think about the Internet in terms of the neat (and not-so-
neat) things it allows them to do, such as send and receive e-mail, surf
Web pages, and watch video clips on YouTube.com. If you think of the
Internet in this way, give yourself a gold star, because this way of thinking
allows you to get the most out of your time on the Internet.
Before you do all this cool stuff on the Internet, however, you have to get con-
nected to it. In this chapter, we tell you about the pros and cons of the many
ways you can make that connection.
A World of IP Devices
Today, devices that communicate on the Internet — or on private networks
using IP (Internet Protocol, the common language “spoken” by all devices on the
Internet) — are basically all the same thing: computers. Personal computers,
microcomputers, handheld computers, network computers, mainframe comput-
ers, and any other type of computer that you can think of (except, of course,
that old Radio Shack TRS-80 that you now use as a doorstop). In fact, hundreds
of millions (maybe billions) of computers in the world are somehow, sometimes
connected to the Internet. And many more will be connected in the future.
Here are a few ways that the Internet may now (or soon) be a bigger part in
your daily life:
 Telephone companies and Internet service providers are realizing that
using the Internet is a much more efficient (and inexpensive) way to
carry voice telephone traffic than the old-fashioned circuit-switched
method. There are phone services explicitly marketed as Internet phone,
such as Vonage (www.vonage.com) and Skype (www.skype.com), but
the Internet is also being used to route regular phone calls too.

224
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 
 Musicians and record labels are finding that using the Net is a great way
to get music sent to people around the world. Online music stores such
as Apple’s iTunes Store have sold billions of songs over the Internet and
are now branching out into TV shows and movies. All you need to jump
into the world of online music (and video) is a fast Internet connection
and a PC or Mac.
 Thousands of companies, big and small, are finding that electronic com-
merce (e-commerce) — using the Net to buy and sell stuff — is much
cheaper and more convenient than traditional methods. You’ve probably
already used Amazon.com or checked your bank balance online, and in
the future you’ll be able to do a lot more than this online.
 Manufacturers of home-automation and -control systems (which we dis-
cuss in Chapters 20 through 22) are turning to the Internet to allow
users to remotely monitor and control all sorts of systems in their
homes. Want to see the front door camera? Log into your home’s Web
site. Turn on the lights and fire up the spa before you get home? Turn to
the Internet.
 Appliance and electronics manufacturers have decided that using the
Internet is a great way to let future generations of smart products talk to
each other and to service centers. Imagine a dishwasher that knows when
it needs maintenance and can automatically notify the manufacturer —
and even tell the technician which parts to bring for the service call.
All the wonders of the Internet and devices that speak its IP language aren’t
going to do you a darn bit of good if you’re not connected. Getting connected
to the Net is — in our opinion — as important as getting telephone service
into your home and is probably a higher priority for most of us than stuff
such as television. (TV watching has never been the same since Seinfeld went
off the air.)
Traditionally, access to the Net was provided the old-fashioned way —
through an analog telephone modem. Some folks are still stuck with this
option, but it’s going away quickly as faster and better broadband Internet ser-
vices become mainstream. If you’re on the Internet for anything more than the
most basic purposes, you should go for a broadband connection — broad-
band isn’t much more expensive than dial-up these days, it’s hundreds of
times faster, and it has the benefit of being always on (so you’re always con-
nected). If you’re building a smart home, we think broadband is mandatory.
Analog Modems
We hope that you’re lucky enough to live someplace where you can get a
broadband Internet connection and service. If not, the primary connection
between your computer — or computer network — and other computers

(like all those millions of computers on the Internet) is most likely an analog
modem. On a personal note, we both have high-speed connections — Pat has
both a cable modem and a DSL modem in his house (he likes the belt-and-
suspenders approach), and Danny has a cable modem in his house in
Connecticut — so we tend to gloat and say “nyah, nyah” to our friends who
are still using analog modems.
Okay, we’ll cease and desist the gloating and get back to analog modems.
These devices get their name from their function — which is to modulate and
demodulate the digital data coming to and from your computer into analog
signals that can be carried over the standard analog telephone system.
Figure 13-1 shows the route that information takes between an analog modem
and the Internet. Your phone line goes to the telephone company’s central
office and then to your ISP, which has a group of modems that answer several
phone lines. From there, you can use some of the bandwidth of your local
ISP’s connection.
Analog modems come in different speeds, but the following two are what
you’ll run into while modem shopping:
 V.92 56-Kbps modems: The latest and greatest technology, V.92 is the
standard modem technology that you can buy today. V.92 is the name of
the international standard that allows these modems to talk to each
other, regardless of who sells them. The 56-Kbps name is a slight mis-
nomer, because FCC regulations force manufacturers to make these
modems operate at a slightly lower ultimate speed (about 53 Kbps). V.92
modems have a few benefits that the older V.90 models lack:
• Internet call waiting: This feature works with your phone com-
pany’s call waiting feature and lets you suspend your Internet con-
nection when the phone rings. When you hang up, things pick up
where they were, without you having to redial your ISP.

Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 

• Quick connect: The way the modem connects to your ISP (called
the handshake) is improved because the modem remembers how it
worked the last time you dialed up — so you can connect up to 50
percent faster.
• V.PCM: Yet another super-secret industry code name, V.PCM gives
you a faster upstream speed (up to 43 Kbps).
Because modem technology is in many ways a dead end, many Internet
service providers have never upgraded to V.92 modems in their part of
the network, so the upstream part of your connection (from your home
to the Internet) won’t reach the maximum speed of 53 Kbps. V.92
modems are backwards-compatible with V.90. Therefore, if your ISP still
uses V.90, things will work, but the special features are enabled only if
the modem on the other end of your connection is also V.92.
Unfortunately, few ISPs have adopted V.92.
 V.90 56-Kbps modems: These modems are the most common and are
standard equipment in just about any computer these days. V.90
modems reach their maximum speed only in one direction — the down-
stream flow from your Internet service provider (ISP) to you. The
upstream speed — from your computer to the Internet — is limited to
33.6 Kbps, the same as standard 33.6-Kbps modems.
Besides speed, modems can also be differentiated by their form factor — what
they look like and how they connect to your PC. Analog modems come in
three basic forms:
 External modems: These are freestanding devices that connect to your
computer’s modem serial port (often called the COM port) or USB port.
 Internal modems: These devices plug into an internal slot inside your
PC. It used to be common for all new PCs to have a built-in modem, but
the rise of broadband has relegated modems to second fiddle status,
and a growing number of new PCs no longer include an analog modem.
 PC Card modems: Roughly credit-card-sized, these modems (which
adhere to the PC Card, or PCMCIA — personal computer modular card
interface adapter — standard) slide into the corresponding PC Card slot
found on most notebook computers and some handheld computer
devices.
You may also encounter modems that expand upon the basic computer-to-
computer data communications function and add extra features. For exam-
ple, many modems also contain circuitry that enables them — with some
corresponding software on your PC — to act as fax machines. With a fax
modem, you can send just about any document on your PC’s hard drive to
remote fax machines, and you can receive incoming fax messages, which you
can view on your screen or print.
226
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

Other additional features often found on analog modems include the following:
 Speakerphone: A few modems come with speakerphone software that
lets you use your PC (with microphone and speakers) as a hands-free
phone.
 Voice mail: Using your PC’s hard drive to store messages, modems with
voice-mail software can handle any calls that come in when you’re away
(or just don’t feel like answering the phone).
As good as analog modems have become — we remember the days of 2400-
baud modems, which were agonizingly slow — we think that today’s broadband
Internet access technologies are so much better that we’d never go back to dial-
up. We won’t try to sell you on the upgrade based on the Web surfing and file
downloading benefits (as good as they are), but rather on this point: Broadband
technologies are always on, not dialed up. When you connect not just your com-
puter but an entire house full of devices, all of which can potentially connect to
the Internet, a constant and persistent connection makes all the difference. In
fact, as we mention earlier in the chapter, it’s almost downright required.
DSL
Digital subscriber line, or DSL, is the phone company’s broadband method of
sending data over existing copper telephone lines. Several DSL technologies
have been widely developed, which is why we sometimes refer to DSL tech-
nologies as xDSL, with the x representing a range of other letters, such as A
for asymmetrical. In this section we describe the most common types of xDSL
available today — there are also HDSL and SDSL variants of xDSL which are
not commonly offered as residential services — phone companies use them
to provide T1 data circuits to businesses.
Digital subscriber lines — ADSL in particular — were developed as a way for
telephone companies to compete with cable television providers — the high
downstream speed is capable of carrying lots of digital television program-
ming. In fact, in the mid-1990s, most major telephone companies had large
divisions and joint ventures in place to jump into the cable TV market. This
plan never worked out, though — the trials of such services weren’t such
great successes that cable TV seemed like a profitable direction for these
companies to move in.
But then the Internet became popular, and there was finally a new need for pro-
viding this kind of bandwidth to the home. (Times have surely changed, how-
ever, as most DSL providers are moving rapidly back into the TV business —
see the sidebar titled “Going V-ery fast with VDSL” for more on this).
227
Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 

DSL modems use the same single copper-wire pair that POTS (Plain Old
Telephone Service — in other words, regular phone service) does, but their
sophisticated digital signal processors (DSPs) can make use of a lot more of
the frequency spectrum, giving them greater bandwidth capabilities. The fre-
quencies that DSL devices use are generally much higher than those used for
carrying POTS phone calls, so there’s no interference between the two. You
can literally pick up the phone in the middle of a DSL connection and make a
phone call without a problem.
When we wrote an earlier edition of this book, we spent a considerable
amount of time discussing something called ISDN (or integrated services digi-
tal network). ISDN is a phone company technology that allows — among
other things @ phone lines and special ISDN modems to connect to the
Internet at about 128 Kbps. ISDN is still out there in some places (especially
outside the U.S.), but for the most part it’s been superseded by DSL and other
forms of broadband connectivity. That’s because ISDN isn’t fast enough for
future (or even current) high-speed Internet connection requirements.
Table 13-1 shows some of the many flavors of DSL. Note that downstream
speed is the speed at which data is sent to you from your service provider,
and upstream speed measures the data heading back the other way.

Different service providers offer DSL services using just about all of the tech-
nologies shown in Table 13-1, but for the residential market, ADSL and ADSL
2/2+ is by far the most common technology. Keep in mind that the table lists
the maximum speeds. When you get ADSL service, it will probably be a bit
slower, but it’s so far above analog modems that the difference doesn’t
matter.
Services driven by ADSL technology have the disadvantage of being asymmet-
ric, which means that the upstream and downstream speeds are different.
The problem with asymmetric bandwidth is that some symmetric applica-
tions that send large quantities of data both ways, such as videoconferencing
(you want to see them as much as they see you!), can’t take advantage of the
maximum speeds available. If you have 1.5 Mbps downstream but only 64
Kbps upstream, symmetric applications run at 64 Kbps down and 64 Kbps up.
228
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

Fortunately, most applications for the Internet are asymmetric — your
request to view a page is very small, typically just the address of the page on
the Web, but the page downloaded is usually packed with data. Most home
users are incredibly happy with even 356-Kbps upstream speeds (about eight
times faster than analog modems), and the majority of home users tend to
utilize much more downstream bandwidth anyway (for things such as Web
browsing and file downloading).
Regardless of which DSL variant your service provider offers, the interface is
similar. The DSL service enters your home through a standard copper tele-
phone line that carries your POTS traffic. To extract the high-speed DSL data,
you need a DSL modem. Generally, you’ll find two variants of these:
 External DSL modem: This device looks and acts just like a souped-up
version of the analog modem that you’re probably familiar with, but it
doesn’t plug into the modem serial port (the COM port) on the back of
your computer. Those modem serial ports are just too darned slow to
handle the kind of speed that xDSL gives you. Instead, a DSL modem typ-
ically has an Ethernet (10/100BaseT) connection running to your com-
puter and an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) inside your
computer. Some modems also use a USB (universal serial bus) connec-
tor to hook up to your computer or have both Ethernet and USB.
229
Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 
Going V-ery fast with VDSL
One of the DSL variants in Table 13-1 probably
stood out as being the one you’d want in your
smart home. VDSL, or very high speed DSL, is
like a super tricked-out, twin-turbo V8 com-
pared to ADSL’s economical 4-cylinder speeds.
VDSL (and its faster variant, VDSL2) is fast
enough to let phone companies do all sorts of
neat services, including multiple channels of TV,
HDTV, voice, and high-speed Internet, all on the
same phone line. The downside is that VDSL is
very short range (about 6000 feet max) com-
pared to ADSL (18,000 feet; some variants go
even farther). So VDSL works well only if you
put the VDSL equipment (called a DSLAM) right
out in the neighborhood, near the houses.
Putting all the equipment near the house is a
great thing for performance, but not necessar-
ily a great thing for phone companies trying to
trim expenses. VDSL is also completely differ-
ent than ADSL, so phone companies who want
to deploy it would need to abandon their invest-
ment in ADSL (and they’ve spent billions).
VDSL isn’t a new technology (it’s been around
since the late 1990s), but it’s still relatively rare.
That’s changing, however, as big phone compa-
nies decide they absolutely must offer TV ser-
vices to compete with their cable competitors.
In the United States, the biggest phone com-
pany, AT&T, has begun rolling out something
called Project Lightspeed, which is bringing
VDSL2 to millions of customers, along with a full
IPTV service (see Chapter 5 for more on IPTV).
So if you are an AT&T local phone customer,
keep your eyes peeled for this service — the
brand name for it is U-verse.

 Internal DSL modem: Just like an internal analog modem, this one plugs
into a slot inside your PC — an ISA or PCI bus slot for desktop comput-
ers or a PC card for laptops. Because these internal buses are much
faster than the serial port that connects standard modems, you don’t
need an Ethernet interface.
If your provider gives you a choice, choose a DSL modem with an Ethernet
interface. The other kind of DSL modem is great if you’re looking to hook up a
single computer but makes it more difficult to connect to your home network
(because almost all networking equipment connects using the Ethernet stan-
dard). You shouldn’t have a hard time convincing your DSL provider to do
this for you because Ethernet modems are the most common.
If you want to get DSL, you need to choose a provider. Unfortunately, the
number of companies offering DSL has been greatly reduced over the past
few years due to some prominent failures in the telecommunications market.
Two types of companies can offer DSL: incumbent telephone companies
(your local telco) and competitive telephone companies, who lease lines and
facilities from the incumbent. During the Internet boom years of the late
1990s, dozens of companies entered the competitive telephone company
market and began offering DSL services — too many, in fact. Because of the
intense competition (among other factors), a lot of these companies ended
up going out of business. Today, residential DSL service is offered primarily
by the incumbent telco and usually one of the remaining large competitive
providers:
 Verizon: Serves the northeastern U.S. and a few markets elsewhere in the
U.S. — areas where GTE used to be the phone company (www.verizon.
com).
 BellSouth: Serves the southeastern U.S. (www.bellsouth.com). In early
2007, BellSouth merged with AT&T and eventually their name will be
changed to AT&T.
 AT&T: Serves much of the central and southwestern U.S. (www.sbc.com).
 Qwest: Serves the northwestern and mountain region of the U.S.
(www.qwest.com).
 Covad: The last remaining big competitive provider, serves nationwide
(www.covad.com).
When you choose a DSL provider — such as Covad or your local telco — you
usually have a choice of which ISP you want to use. The DSL provider gives
you the connection, and the ISP provides Internet services such as e-mail,
Web site hosting, and music services. Most DSL providers offer their own ISP
service, but you can also choose from both local ISPs (in most cases) and big
230
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

national ISPs. Some of the bigger ISPs who focus on DSL services include the
following:
 EarthLink (www.earthlink.net)
 Speakeasy (www.speakeasy.net)
 AOL (www.aol.com)
Which to choose? We recommend that you look at the options and prices and
find the ISP that offers the services that best fit your needs. This isn’t earth-
shattering advice, but each of these ISPs has their own specialties and ser-
vices. We like to choose ISPs that explicitly support home networks. Many
will often provide you with networking hardware, extra e-mail boxes (one for
everyone in the house) and other neat Internet features such as fixed IP
addresses (helpful if you want to use applications such as videoconferencing)
and firewall services (to keep the bad guys out of your computer).
When it comes to planning your home network, DSL services will play a
major role down the road for the telcos and therefore should have a major
influence on your planning. DSL services will bring a lot of bandwidth into
your home, bandwidth that is likely to be shared by a lot of applications. If
your spouse is watching TV in the living room, you are working in your office
in the basement, and the kids are playing online games in their rooms, you all
may be using the same DSL link.
231
Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 
Filtering out noise
We mentioned that DSL — particularly the
ADSL technology used in residential DSL —
uses different frequencies on the phone lines
than your voice telephone service does.
Unfortunately, electronic systems don’t always
work so neatly in the real world, so even though
your phone (on the lower frequencies) and your
ADSL modem (on the higher frequencies) are
not supposed to interfere with each other, a little
bit of overlap can occur.
Early DSL modem installations used a device
called a POTS splitter to keep your voice and
the DSL modem on different segments of phone
wiring in your house. This brute-force approach
of keeping things separate solved the interfer-
ence problem but came with a price: A phone
technician had to come to your house to install
this splitter, which took time and cost money,
and only one phone outlet in the house could
accept your DSL modem.
The current solution is more elegant. When a
DSL modem is installed, you simply plug some
small filters into your wall outlets — between
the phone and the outlet. These filters (known
as low-pass filters because they let only the
lower frequencies pass through) correct any
interference problems and let you plug the DSL
modem into any phone outlet in the house. They
also let you do the installation yourself, which
saves you both time and money.

One of the neat things about DSL is that you’re always connected to the net-
work, 24 hours a day. If you leave your computer on the entire time, all sorts
of things are possible. For instance, you can receive automatic software
downloads while you’re asleep. Or you can receive phone calls on your PC
through Internet telephony. Or you can have all the major newspapers down-
loaded to your PC for when you wake up. A DSL line turns a historically reac-
tive relationship with the telecommunications networks into an active one.
If you want to find out even more about DSL, check out Broadband Reports
(www.broadbandreports.com).
Lighting the Way with Fiber
When it comes to fast Internet connections, the copper wires that phone
companies use have some serious shortcomings. It takes a lot of engineering
wizardry to send 20 or 50 or 100 Mbps of data down the same set of wires
232
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 
Getting your IP fixed
When you connect to a broadband service
provider, your computer or home networking
router (if you’re using one) is assigned an IP
address. You can think of the IP address as the
Internet equivalent to your home’s street
address — it’s a universally understood address
that lets other computers find yours, just as a
street address lets other people find your
house. Most broadband service providers (and
all dial-up Internet providers) give you a
dynamic IP address that changes on a regular
basis. This is fine for regular Web browsing and
e-mailing and the like but just won’t do for appli-
cations such as videoconferencing or hosting a
Web server on your own computer. For these
kinds of applications, you need an IP address
that never changes — a fixed IP address. Most
broadband providers will give you one for an
extra $10 or $15 a month; a few, such as
Speakeasy, include a fixed IP address in the
base price. Think you’ll never videoconference
or have your own Web site, so you don’t need
this? Think again — many applications require
or would benefit from a fixed IP address, such
as a home-automation system that has a built-in
Web interface so you can adjust things
remotely through a Web browser.
If you can’t get a fixed IP address (or if your
provider charges too much for such a service),
you can utilize a dynamic DNS service. These
services (many of which are free — just search
Google for dynamic DNS to see dozens of them)
let you create a host name for your Internet
connection’s IP address. The service then maps
your changing IP address to a fixed hostname
(which would look something like yourhost-
name.dyndns.org if you were using
DynDNS’s service — www.dyndns.com). A
fixed IP address is a more foolproof solution, but
dynamic DNS services work really well, and you
can’t beat the price!

that get maxed out at 56 Kbps with an analog modem (to put that in perspec-
tive, 56 Kbps is .056 Mbps). While the folks who design DSL systems keep
improving the breed, each new improvement is a bit harder to implement
than the one before it. And although the speeds of today’s fastest DSL sys-
tems seem pretty high, they run into a couple of problems:
 In the real world, speeds to a home (your home, perhaps) are a lot less
than the maximum speed. Vagaries in the condition of phone wiring and
distances between the DSL modem and the DSLAM (where DSL connec-
tions are terminated and concentrated onto faster network connections)
can bring the real world speeds down by 50 percent or more from the
theoretical maximums.
 Even if the maximums were reached, they might not be enough in the
longer term. As phone companies begin to throw Internet service, IP
phone services, and IPTV over the same wire, the bandwidth gets used
up pretty darn fast. HDTV is the biggest concern here, because an HDTV
channel can use up to 20 Mbps of bandwidth all by itself. In a world
where HDTVs cost less than $500 and homes have an average of more
than three TVs, it’s easy to see how even a 50 Mbps connection could
get overwhelmed.
Therefore, many phone companies are at least exploring the use of fiber-optic
systems, which use light waves, instead of electrical signals, to bring mind-
bogglingly fast Internet and TV connections to homes. Two main types of
fiber connections are used to connect homes and businesses to the Internet:
 Active system: In these networks, an individual fiber-optic cable links
the home and the telephone company central office (or side-of-the road
equipment pedestal). This approach offers the most speed, but it is
expensive to implement and is mainly used for very-high-speed and very
expensive connections to businesses.
 Passive system: In a passive system (which is what is commonly found
in the residential word), a fiber connection is passively split (hence the
name — it means that the light waves are split off without the use of
electronics) between a number of homes (typically 16 to 32 homes per
connection). Each home gets an individual fiber-optic cable connection,
but this connection is shared back at the central office among 16 or 32
homes. These passive networks are usually called PONs (passive optical
networks).
PON connections are a lot cheaper to implement because expensive compo-
nents can be divided among multiple homes. That said, the biggest expense
in deploying a fiber network to someone’s house is running the fiber-optic
cabling. It costs $1000 or so to send out a team of folks to dig trenches and
run and bury the cables that lead up to the side of a home. Multiply this
expense by the tens of millions of homes that each big telephone company
serves and you see that this starts to become an expensive proposition.
233
Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 

Luckily for (some of) us, some phone companies realize that fiber is the future.
Well, they all realize that fiber is the future, and most of the core of their net-
works (the parts that run between central offices and from remotely located
gear to the central offices) is already fiber. Not every phone company has yet
been convinced that spending tens of billions of dollars on bringing fiber to the
“last mile” (to the home, in other words) is worth it. But some have.
In particular, in the United States, Verizon (the second largest phone com-
pany) is in the midst of a multiyear, tens of billions of dollar project called
FiOS. FiOS brings a complete telecommunications and television service to
the home using a PON system. With FiOS, users can get a full standard and
high-definition cable TV type of package (with all the bells and whistles such
as video on demand), multiple lines of phone service, and a super high-speed
Internet service. FiOS customers can get services as fast as 50 Mbps (on the
downstream side) for not much more than they would pay for DSL services
that max out at 5 or 6 Mbps.
By the way, in case you are interested, FiOS stands for fiber optic service or
is an Irish word meaning knowledge. Our Irish is a bit rusty (okay, nonexis-
tent) so we can’t verify that, but Verizon has used both definitions!
To learn more about FiOS, and to see if you can get it (you lucky dog you!), go
to www.verizonfios.com.
Phone companies in Europe and Asia (particularly in Japan and Korea) are
also jumping on the fiber bandwagon, as are smaller groups. For example,
some towns and cities in the United States are building their own fiber net-
works. And many big developers are including fiber as part of the amenities
when they build new communities — part of the package includes not just
the house and the community swimming pool but also high-speed Internet!
Cable Modems
Cable television providers are in a frenzy to provide additional services
beyond television. Foremost among these services, for most cable compa-
nies, is cable-modem Internet access. A cable modem is basically a very fast
modem that connects to the cable company. It can transmit at up to 30 Mbps
and connect to your computer through an Ethernet connection. Like the DSL
modems we talk about in the preceding section, cable modems are usually
rented as part of the service. Monthly service is typically priced in the $40 or
so range.
234
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

Although many independent cable television companies are going it alone
and working to offer their own versions of cable-modem services, big nation-
wide cable companies (often called MSOs, or multiservice operators) pre-
dominate. The biggest ones include the following:
 Comcast: www.comcast.com.
 Cox Communications: www.cox.com.
 Charter Communications: www.chartercom.com.
 Road Runner: Time-Warner, one of the largest cable television providers,
as well as one of the biggest content producers in the world (movies,
television, music, magazines, books, you name it), merged with AOL (the
world’s biggest ISP) in the 1990s. The combined company, AOL Time-
Warner, runs its cable-modem operations under the Road Runner brand.
Moving forward, many Time-Warner cable areas will also allow you to
use AOL as your ISP, so you’ll have a choice of Road Runner or AOL (and
usually another, unaffiliated ISP such as Earthlink). You can find out
whether Road Runner is available in your area at www.rr.com or check
for AOL broadband at www.aol.com.
235
Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 
Why are cable modems so hot?
Cable companies are well positioned to offer
cable modems, the leading-edge Internet ser-
vice, for several reasons:
 They get it. By this we mean that the cable
industry, as a whole, has committed itself to
broadband and has invested both money
and brainpower (through an industry group
called CableLabs, which helps develop stan-
dards for cable systems and which approves
equipment to be interoperable within cable
networks) to creating full-service broadband
networks. Cable providers want to give you
every data service you’d ever need (with the
possible exception of mobile wireless ser-
vices), and they’ve spent billions creating an
infrastructure to do so.
 They already have a high-speed network.
Most cable television networks consist of
super-high-capacity fiber-optic cable running
from the central offices to local distribution
points and — even more importantly — coax-
ial cable running from these distribution
points to your home. Coaxial cable can carry
a lot of data — a heck of a lot more, in most
cases, than the copper wiring that connects
telephone companies to your home.
 They have an important booster. That
booster is Microsoft, which has invested
billions of dollars into the industry in an
effort to move things along. In addition to
Microsoft itself, Paul Allen, one of the co-
founders of Microsoft, has spent a few bil-
lion dollars of his own nest egg to buy some
cable companies and turn them into
providers of Net access and other
advanced services.

If you live in Canada, cable-modem service is available from the following big
providers:
 Rogers: www.rogers.com.
 Shaw: www.shaw.ca.
 Videotron: www.videotron.com/portail_en/index.htm. This is the
English version of the page, but they have a French one as well because
they’re based in Montreal.
Most of the time, the company that provides your cable television service
and your cable modem is also the company that provides your ISP service. In
other words, if Cox is your cable company, you’ll get your cable modem from
them, and your e-mail address will be something like smarthomesfordum-
miesreader@cox.net. As something called open access becomes more
common, however, the cable world is becoming a bit more like the DSL world.
With open access, other ISPs, such as Earthlink or AOL, are allowed to sell
services to cable-modem customers. If you have open access, you’ll still get
your cable TV service from your MSO, and your cable modem will be con-
nected to them as well, but you’ll get all your Internet services from someone
else. This is happening across the country, but it’s most likely to be found
wherever AOL Time-Warner owns the local cable company — that’s because
the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) required AOL Time-Warner to open up
their cable systems to other ISPs as a condition of the merger.
Regardless of your service provider or ISP, cable modems fit into one of two
categories:
 Telco-return modem: This type of modem is used in less sophisticated
cable systems and is generally much less desirable. The one-way modem
receives data at high speeds over your cable system’s coaxial cable, but
any upstream (outgoing) data uses a standard analog telephone modem —
so you send data as slowly as you would with a conventional analog
modem (plus you tie up your telephone line whenever you’re online).
These modems are okay for e-mail and surfing Web sites, but their asym-
metric nature makes them less than perfect for all the neat new things you
can do on the Net, such as videoconferencing, Internet telephony, and
online gaming. Luckily, telco-return cable modems are gradually disappear-
ing as cable providers complete the updates of their systems to full two-
way networks.
Telephone-return cable-modem services are going the way of the dodo
bird and becoming extinct. We mention them simply because a few
places are still stuck with this option.
236
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

 Two-way modem: This is the modem you hope your service provider
uses (and the big ones, such as Cox, AT&T and Road Runner, typically
do). Two-way modems both send and receive data over the coaxial cable
and typically offer high speed both ways (although the reception is often
still faster than the upstream data rate — the upstream is usually limited
to about 500 Kbps, and the downstream ranges between 2 and 10 Mbps).
A few cable modems are internal devices (which plug into an ISA or PCI bus
slot in your PC), but most that we’ve seen are external, stand-alone boxes.
The cable system’s coaxial cable connects to the modem, and the modem
connects to your computer (or your computer LAN) through a standard
Ethernet 10BaseT connection (which we talk about in more detail in Chapter
15). If you don’t have an Ethernet card in your PC already, don’t worry — the
cards are cheap, and many cable-modem service providers give you one as
part of the service package. In Figure 13-2, you can see how a cable modem
connects to the Internet.
Cable-modem networks are usually (not always, but most of the time) built
using a standard called DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface
Specification — say that ten times fast). Developed by the folks at CableLabs,
DOCSIS is a standard that tells cable-modem equipment manufacturers how
to make their gear and how to make it interoperable. This means DOCSIS gear
from vendor A should work with gear from vendor B.
Because of DOCSIS, you can buy a cable modem off the shelf at Fry’s or
Circuit City and bring it home to plug it in yourself. In the DSL world, you still
need to get the DSL modem from your phone company or ISP.

Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 

More than one version of DOCSIS is available, as the technology matures and
improves:
 DOCSIS 1.0, the first version, allowed speeds of up to 38 Mbps down-
stream and 10 Mbps upstream (remember that this is shared among sev-
eral users, so no one home will see this speed).
 DOCSIS 2.0, the current version, keeps the same downstream maximum
but bumps the upstream to 30 Mbps.
 DOCSIS 3.0, the “coming soon” version, can use multiple channels (cable
modem systems essentially “steal” a TV channel to provide Internet
access) and can reach speeds of up to 160 Mbps downstream and 120
Mbps upstream.
The connection speed that you as an individual user get depends on which
variant of DOCSIS your cable company uses (most use 2.0 today), how the
cable company has architected their network (how many users share the
same bandwidth), and even what service level you’ve chosen.
When DOCSIS 3.0 comes out, the cable companies should be able to at least
match the speeds offered by the fastest DSLs and will be in the ballpark of
some of the fiber systems.
One big advantage for the cable modem folks is that the Internet bandwidth
provided by the DOCSIS cable-modem systems isn’t used to carry TV signals.
The same wires are used, but TV stations are on different channels. So where
a 50-Mbps VDSL connection would cordon off 35 Mbps or so for TV, a 50-
Mbps cable connection would be (theoretically at least) able to offer all that
bandwidth for Internet service.
Beaming Internet in from Satellites
If you live out in the hinterlands and can’t get DSL or cable (not to mention
fiber-optic service), you might think that you’re stuck with dial-up analog
modem service. Nothing can be further from the truth! Look to the skies and
you’ll see your option — satellite Internet service.
With satellite Internet service, your data is beamed down to you from on
high, from one or a series of earth-orbiting satellite systems that connect
back to the Internet through ground stations. While the data to your home
comes over the satellite connection, you may have two options for how data
gets sent from your computer to the Internet:
238
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

 You can buy one-way service: In this scenario, a standard analog
modem sends data back upstream (onto the Internet). This limits your
upstream speed to the same 33 Kbps as a dial-up ISP account.
 You can buy two-way service: With two-way service, which requires a
different antenna and receiver (one with a built-in radio transmitter),
you can use the satellite to send data in both directions. Because of FCC
regulations, if you get two-way service, a professional must install and
aim your dish.
The trend in the satellite Internet industry is towards the two-way model, and
if you’re shopping for satellite Internet access, we definitely recommend that
you choose such a system.
As we mentioned, for some people, satellite Internet access is the only game
in town. And it’s great for your otherwise off-the-grid cabin in the mountains,
or if you’re a rancher ten miles from the telephone company’s central office.
If you have a choice to go with DSL or cable instead, however, we think you
should. Here’s why:
 Relatively low speeds (bandwidth): Satellite Internet just plain isn’t as
fast as DSL or cable modem, with most systems topping out at about 1.5
Mbps downstream speed, and 200 Mbps upstream. The one-way systems
max out at a speed of only 33.6 Kbps upstream, which is the same speed
as a dial-up modem (which is what they use). These speeds aren’t awful
(except for the one-way upstream), but you pay $60 a month or more for
them, whereas the cheapest DSL service plans (at about the same
speed) are less than $20 in most locations.
 High latency: Latency is the measure of delay in a signal — the time it
takes to get, for example, from a Web server on the Internet to your com-
puter. Because of the sheer distances involved in sending radio signals
up to a satellite and back down (and some other factors as well), satel-
lite systems have higher latency than DSL or cable. This isn’t a big deal
for Web pages or e-mail, but it can be a big deal if you’re videoconferenc-
ing or audioconferencing over the Net, making phone calls, or playing
multiplayer online games.
 You might not be able share your Internet connection (right now):
Early satellite Internet systems were designed to be connected directly
to one computer only — so no network (and no smart home network-
ing!). Most systems shipping today can support a network, but make
sure you read the fine print before you shell out the cash.
239
Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 

 You can’t install it yourself: Because the two-way system has a satellite
transmitter, all sorts of regulations and FCC rules are involved in satel-
lite Internet and you aren’t allowed to install it yourself. (Folks would be
pretty mad if you bumped off their American Idol signal with a misdi-
rected satellite feed!) Installers cost money, which leads to our next
problem with satellite Internet.
 It’ll cost you: The hardware to get a satellite Internet system up and run-
ning costs hundreds of dollars. And unlike the cable and DSL world, the
price isn’t usually subsidized as much by the provider (so you pay up
front). Shop around between services and see whether anyone is offer-
ing free dishes or receivers or both — you’ll have to sign on to a longer-
term contract, but the savings may be worth it to you. Also, as we
mentioned, the monthly service fee is higher than competing DSL and
cable-modem plans. Over time, as competition grows, we hope we see
some price cuts!
Despite these disadvantages, satellite Internet has one big advantage over
most competing high-speed Internet access systems. You can use it just
about anywhere in North America, something that can’t be said about cable
modems or DSL. satellite Internet providers offering similar services in
Europe and in Japan.
Most of the satellite Internet companies offer a mobile version of their ser-
vice and hardware that can mount on your RV or boat. So you can take your
Internet with you, even when you’re out of range of cell phone providers.
This isn’t a smart home application, per se, but we think it’s pretty cool.
You can find several providers of satellite Internet service. In the U.S., the big
three are as follows:
 HughesNet: We describe the DIRECTV TV network in Chapter 5. Hughes
Electronics, the company that built the DIRECTV system, has also devel-
oped a satellite Internet access system called HughesNet
(http://go.gethughesnet.com, formerly called DirecWAY).
HughesNet is a two-way system, capable of speeds of up to 1.5 Mbps
down and 200 Kbps up, with three service plans offering varying speeds
and features.
 StarBand: StarBand is a newer provider to the U.S. residential market
(although the company’s been around since 2000). StarBand
(www.starband.com) offers two two-way Internet service plans — a
PRO service that doesn’t support networks in your home and a more
expensive ULTIMATE that does.
 WildBlue: WildBlue is another new competitor to HughesNet, offering
three service plans in the U.S. All are two-way and all support home net-
works. Speeds range up to 1.5 Mbps downstream and 256 Kbps
upstream.

We should note that while we’ve been a bit hard on the satellite Internet ser-
vices, we do know people who have them and love them. It’s all a factor of
where you are and what your options are. If we had to choose between dial-
up and satellite, it would take us all of about two seconds to come down on
the side of satellite.
Figure 13-3 shows a one-way satellite connection that uses a regular modem
to send data out to the Internet. The two-way connection looks pretty much
the same, except that data returns to the Internet through the satellite link.
Connecting Wirelessly
While the telephone and cable television companies slowly develop and build
network connections to bring data into your home at high speeds, a host of
companies are working on ways to do the same thing without wires.
Traditionally, most of us equate wireless with portable — and indeed many
wireless service companies are emphasizing this benefit of using wireless
technologies. Increasingly, however, service providers are looking toward
wireless technologies as a way to quickly and cheaply provide data and tele-
phone services to a fixed location — such as your house. New advances in
wireless technology are rapidly bringing down the costs of the network
equipment, such as transmitters and receivers, and setting up a wireless ser-
vice is usually quick. Instead of digging trenches or putting up utility poles
and running wires, wireless providers need only put up an antenna and then
provide one for each customer.

Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 

Only a few wireless Internet services are available to residential customers
today — in the early 2000s, the first generation of wireless companies went
into Chapter 11 and out of business in an industry-wide flameout about as
spectacular as any we’ve seen. That doesn’t mean that wireless to the home
is dead (and, by the way, we know you sharp readers picked up on the fact
that the satellite Internet systems discussed in the preceding section are
wireless, but we’re using the term here to refer to terrestrial wireless systems,
not space-based systems). Although a lot of wireless startups went broke
during the first generation of wireless mania, the big guys (such as your local
phone company or big nationwide telecommunications companies such as
Sprint and AT&T) are testing their next-generation wireless services and will
be launching them in the future, so check their Web sites if your other
options are limited.
You can find a list of wireless ISPs at Robert Hoskin’s Broadband Wireless
Exchange Web site: http://www.bbwexchange.com/.
Wireless service providers can offer service to residential customers in a few
ways:
 Fixed and portable NLOS (non-line-of-sight): These solutions (and we use
the plural because there are many different ways to skin this particular
cat) use a series of base-station radio/antenna towers that can transmit
and receive data communications out to homes and businesses in their
cell (like a cell for a mobile phone system). Fixed systems refer to those
that require an antenna that is mounted (usually on the roof) and then
aimed to get the best transmission possible. Portable systems are
242

Understanding mesh networks
If you’re looking into wireless broadband net-
works, you may hear the term mesh networks.
Mesh networks are based on smaller, lower-
powered antenna/radio systems that don’t nec-
essarily have to talk back to the master base
station. In a mesh network, traffic is bounced
from antenna to antenna within the network
footprint. So your traffic might bounce off three
other peoples’ antennas before it gets to the
base station and sent off to the Internet over a
wired connection (such as a fiber-optic line).
Similarly, your antenna might not only pick up
and receive your Internet traffic but also relay
someone else’s traffic. The big advantage of
mesh networks is that they tend to use more
inexpensive components, so the service
provider can build up the network gradually as
new customers sign up, instead of investing a
big chunk of money up front.
Mesh networks can be built using specialized,
proprietary radio systems. That’s usually not the
most cost-effective way of doing mesh, how-
ever. The more common approach is to use Wi-
Fi as the radio technology for a mesh network,
and then add some specialized hardware and
software that creates the “mesh.” Several com-
panies focusing on the metro Wi-Fi are using or
investigating mesh technologies.

designed with antennas that aim themselves, so you can perform the
installation without the need of a professional radio engineer to align and
aim antennas. As long as you’re within the cell, you can take your system
from work to home to a new house when you move across town, without
needing a new professional installation.
 WiMAX: The biggest hype (and promise) in broadband wireless services
comes from a technology called WiMAX. WiMAX (the name stands for
Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is not just one tech-
nology — it’s actually a group of NLOS wireless systems that can be
fixed, portable, or mobile (like a cell phone). The two main variants of
WiMAX are
• 802.16d: This is the fixed version of WiMAX, designed for installa-
tions where the user doesn’t get up and move. It’s an older version
of WiMAX, and most wireless service providers are waiting for the
newer version (which we discuss in the next bullet). A few compa-
nies, such as the DSL company Covad and the ISP EarthLink, are
offering 802.16d-based services now.
• 802.16e: Also known as Mobile WiMAX, this is big news in the wire-
less world. 802.16e can be used as a fixed or portable system but
can also be used as a truly mobile service (for example, you can
connect in a moving car or train). Most of the big players are
making their wireless plans around 802.16e — Sprint, for example,
will be migrating their high-speed Internet services to this technol-
ogy in the next few years.
WiMAX can potentially offer speeds as fast as DSL or cable modems and
at prices that aren’t too far from what the wired guys offer. And because
it’s wireless, a home has a better chance of being “on the network,” with-
out waiting for a physical upgrade to wiring and central offices.
 Metro Wi-Fi networks: These short-range networks make use of the
802.11, or Wi-Fi, wireless local networking technology that you might be
familiar with in your own home or office network. (We talk about this
technology in Chapter 16.) Although Wi-Fi was designed for short-range
transmissions (300 feet or less), it can be modified to go greater dis-
tances. Most service providers offering Wi-Fi networks are not using it to
send data to and from people’s homes. Instead, they’re using it to pro-
vide broadband services in hot spots such as hotel lobbies, airports,
and cafes for people toting laptops or PDAs with Wi-Fi capabilities.
However, a few service providers are examining Wi-Fi with an eye
towards providing broadband to homes, particularly where homes are
close to each other (and may therefore be within range). The biggest dis-
advantage of Wi-Fi in this scenario is the extremely short range we men-
tioned. The biggest advantage is the fact that Wi-Fi gear is extremely
inexpensive, and millions of people already have it in their homes and
computers. Big cities such as San Francisco and Philadelphia are in the
midst of deploying citywide metro Wi-Fi networks as a public service
and alternative to wired solutions — other cities such as Long Beach,
California, already have these networks up and running.
243
Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 

 3G mobile services: Mobile phone providers have launched data services
across the world. Many current services are still 2.5 G (the G stands for
generation, and these services are an interim step after 2G — 2G being the
transition to digital voice services for cell phones). 2.5G services offer
speeds up to about 40 Kbps, roughly equivalent to analog modem speeds,
but newer 3G systems can be as fast as 1 to 2 Mbps. For the most part, 3G
systems remain the province of mobile users — mainly business users —
because they’ll probably cost significantly more than other broadband
solutions. But with unlimited usage plans coming down to about $50 a
month for some wireless carriers, we are beginning to see some users cut
the cord and move all their telecommunications to the mobile network.
See the sidebar titled “Getting 3G into your home” for information on how
to make a 3G connection part of a whole-home network.
The bottom line on wireless Internet connections to the home is that the
technology is here, the service providers are testing it, some of us can get it,
and we’ll all probably see it soon. The biggest roadblock is whether wired
solutions such as cable modems and DSL will reach enough homes to allevi-
ate the need for wireless solutions. We don’t think that will happen because
too many people in rural areas of the U.S. and Canada are out of cost-effective
reach of wired networks. So we expect to see wireless offerings hit the market
in a real way in the near future.
244
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 
Getting 3G into your home
Although 3G mobile data services such as EV-
DO (offered on CDMA networks such as Verizon
Wireless and Sprint) and HSPDA (offered on
GSM networks such as Cingular/AT&T and T-
Mobile) are primarily for on-the-go users, they
can work as a broadband source for a home
network. We think DSL and cable modems are a
better value for most folks (and offer higher
speeds), but 3G may be an option for homes that
aren’t reached by standard wired broadband
services.
For a single computer, a 3G connection requires
nothing more than an air card, which is a NIC for
3G networks that fits into a PCMCIA port on a
laptop computer. For a network, however, some-
thing more is needed: a 3G router. These devices
work just like regular broadband routers 
(discussed in Chapters 15 and 16), providing the
smarts that direct data to and from the Internet
and the computers in your home. Most 3G
routers include both Ethernet and wireless (Wi-Fi)
connections, so that you can connect just about
any PC in your home to the router. Among the
companies offering 3G routers are Linksys (www.
linksys.com), Kyocera (www.kyocera.
com), Junxion (www.junxion.com), and 
D-Link (www.dlink.com).
By the way, although you may not want to use
one of these routers as your primary source of
Internet connectivity, you may want to consider
buying one as a backup. If you have an air card
for use in your laptop on the road, a 3G router
will let you quickly reuse that air card for the
whole home during DSL or cable outages.

Power Companies
We know what you’re thinking right now. “Power companies? What the heck
do they have to do with the Internet, besides maybe having a Web site that
tells me what to do when I have a gas leak?” (Incidentally, when you have a
gas leak, run like heck.) Well, believe it or not, utility companies are trying to
figure out how to get on the Internet bandwagon.
Just like telephone companies with DSL technologies, cable television compa-
nies with cable modems, and wireless companies with some of the new ser-
vices they’re planning to offer, utility companies want to offer you high-speed
Internet access to go along with their traditional services.
Why are power companies a good candidate to jump into a business they
don’t have any experience in? They have a few things in their favor:
 An existing communications backbone: You’d probably be surprised at
the complex and sophisticated communications network these compa-
nies already have — hundreds of miles of fiber-optic cable, copper wire,
and wireless systems are already in place and online for the internal use
of these companies. The smarter ones thought ahead and laid down
extra capacity while building out their own networks, so they have much
of the infrastructure in place and ready to go.
 Rights of way: If you were to try to build your own communications net-
work, one of the biggest problems you’d run into is getting the rights of
way to lay your fibers and cable across literally hundreds of miles of pri-
vate and public property. Even wireless providers run into this problem
when they try to put up antennas (the neighbors like having the phones
but hate seeing all those working parts). The power companies already
have these rights of way for their electrical lines.
 Ubiquity: Think it’s rare to find a home without a cable television con-
nection or at least a telephone line? It is, but it’s even rarer to find one
that’s not connected to electrical power. You’d have to go far into the
backwoods to find one, and even then, chances are good that those
households don’t have power because they don’t want it — back-to-
nature types, you know.
Power companies can provide high-bandwidth communications services to
you in two ways:
 They can use their rights of way to run new wiring to your home from
their network. This option isn’t necessarily cheap, depending on how far
their network access point is from your home.
 They can devise ways to use the existing electrical power line to also
carry broadband data and communications signals into the home. If they
245
Chapter 13: All Roads Lead to the Net 

can do this — and some big power companies and communications
equipment vendors say they can — all they have to do is install some
sort of box in your home that splits the data out from the power. The
data is then sent off to your telephones, computers, and whatever else
needs it in your home network. This is a neat idea, and something that
you may be seeing in the not-so-distant future.
Note: The first deployments of this technology are happening outside the U.S.
because of differences in how the electrical-power distribution networks are
designed. Basically, the first systems being tested use a converter box at
each transformer in the power network to connect the fiber-optic backbone
to the power line. Compared to Europe and Asia, the U.S. has fewer cus-
tomers served by each individual transformer in the network, which means
that many more of these (expensive) converters would be needed. At the pre-
sent pricing levels, this state-of-the-art, experimental equipment is too expen-
sive to install here. We do think, however, that the almost inevitable increases
in computer chip power and corresponding decreases in prices will soon
make this idea an economically viable solution in the U.S. as well. If you live
in Germany, you can buy broadband over power lines today!
We want to point out a recurring theme here. Many different companies have
sophisticated, high-speed communications networks (cable, telephone, and
power utilities) in place right now but none have a widespread, high-speed,
two-way means of connecting your home to these networks. Although it
would be nice if they would all get out their backhoes and work crews to
upgrade this last-mile connection, the procedure is expensive. So most of the
companies are looking at ways to reuse their existing connections in new and
bandwidth-rich ways.

Designing a Data LAN
In This Chapter

 Leveraging your Internet connection
I
n a simple form, a home-computer network can consist of a single com-
puter connected by modem to the Internet or to another external network
(such as your office’s network). A network can also be two stand-alone PCs
that share a printer with a simple A/B switchbox. We strongly encourage you
to think beyond these examples, though.
As the number (and type) of computers in your home increases and the price
continues to decrease, consider installing (or at least preparing your home’s
wiring for) a full-fledged computer local area network (LAN) to allow your
computers to quickly share access to the same resources. A home LAN pro-
vides a high-speed data connection among all the computers in your home,
allowing them to do things such as share files, share networked peripherals
(for example, a printer), and even play networked games. Multiple computers
can more easily share high-speed Internet access devices, such as DSL or
cable modems, over a home-computer LAN. Home media servers, which we
discuss in Chapter 5, also fit into your computer LAN because they provide
content not only to TVs and audio systems but also to computers throughout
your house.
In this chapter, we discuss the basics of computer LANs and some of the
ways to set up a LAN in your home. We also talk about some of the difficulties
you may encounter when you try to connect several networked computers to
your Internet account at the same time.

248
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 
Flipping the Wired or Wireless Coin
The first step in choosing a LAN technology for your home is to decide
whether you should go with a wired or wireless solution. If you’ve perused
other sections of this book, you know that we spend most of our time talking
about wired solutions. Data networks, however, have experienced an explo-
sion of no-new-wires networking systems (the immensely popular Wi-Fi net-
working products).
Here’s our take on the issue: If you’re building a new home or undertaking a
major remodeling of an older home and if the walls are open, by all means
install the wired alternative. Yes, you may (and probably will) want to add a
wireless network to your home. Having the wired infrastructure in place in
your walls actually makes it easier to add a whole-home wireless network
because you can add wireless access points in multiple spots within your
home, closer to where you need your wireless signals.
Although we think that putting the right kinds of wires and cables into the
right part of your home is the best solution to creating flexible and future-
proofed home-networking solutions, we do live in the real world. And in the
real world, you may not be able to get the necessary cabling systems
installed in your home for a number of reasons, including the following:
 You rent your home.
 You live in a condominium and can’t easily access shared spaces in
walls, attics, and basements.
 You live in a historic home and have to run any changes past the plan-
ning commission.
 Your home has design problems that keep you from easily running
cables, such as no crawl space, basement, or attic in which to hide
wires.
Whatever the reason, you may not be able to squeeze those fat CAT-5e/6 
and coaxial lines through the walls in your home. Luckily, you have some
options: You can use wireless systems to do the job, or you can use the
phone and electric power wires already in your walls (often called no-new-
wires solutions). We discuss these alternatives in Chapter 16.
Wireless and no-new-wires systems are great, but they do have some dis-
advantages when compared to a wired infrastructure:

 You’ll get lower speeds without wires: Although wired LANs can run at
100 or even 1000 Mbps, the fastest wireless alternatives max out at well
below 50 Mbps. This isn’t a big deal if you’re talking about sharing a 1- 
or 2-Mbps Internet connection, but it is when you start thinking about
sending large video or other media files between computers in your
home.
 You’ll probably pay a bit more. Prices of wireless LAN equipment for
the home have dropped like dot.com stock prices over the past few
years, but they’re still higher than those of wired LAN equipment.
 You’ll have to contemplate which industry standard to use. Although
the early competition between standards in wireless LANs is over, a new
wireless standard (called 802.11n) is on its way to market. As we write,
this new standard isn’t complete, but vendors are offering systems
ahead of the final standard. What this means is that you can end up
buying pre-n wireless gear now, and face the possibility it won’t work
with the final standard when it hits the streets in late 2007. We talk about
this issue in detail in Chapter 16.
 You may not like the way the wireless options work. In optimal condi-
tions, wireless systems work great, but things such as long distances 
(if you have a big house), thick walls, and metal objects can cause prob-
lems. Danny, for instance, has a house that was built in the late 1800s,
with 18-inch stone walls. He loves his wireless LAN, but unfortunately it
doesn’t work very well upstairs.
We hope we don’t sound down on wireless LANs — because we’re not. We
think they’re just about the greatest thing since sliced bread. Being able to
take your laptop to the bed, or the sofa, or the back patio without any tethers
is an almost life-changing experience. You’d be in for a big fight if you tried to
take our wireless LANs away from us. But we’ve seen many situations where
a wired LAN connection can be better. In practice, if you have the opportu-
nity to wire your house, we think you’ll probably want both a wired and a
wireless LAN — they coexist nicely.
The effect that choosing all wireless options — phone, data, audio, video, and
so on — has on your home is unclear. However, we can tell you that many
wireless technologies compete for the same spectrum in your home. For
example, many cordless phone systems use the same 2.4-GHz frequency band
that most wireless LANs use, and they can cause interference. Because these
are unlicensed frequencies, no authority controls all the devices transmitting
on the frequency — so no one is ensuring that phones and wireless LANs and
wireless video transmitters don’t run into each other on the airwaves. And
even if you are in control of your airwave use, there’s nothing saying that
your neighbor is as well.
249
Chapter 14: Designing a Data LAN

Running Cables Here, There, 
and Everywhere
In Chapter 15, we spend a bit of time discussing the various methods that
you can use to create LAN connections throughout your house. In this sec-
tion, we want you to think about where you may want to place these network
connections in your home.
Bedrooms
You may not consider bedrooms as prime locations for computer LAN out-
lets, but you probably should. With a bedroom outlet, you can work from
your bed by plugging a laptop into the network, for example. You may also
want a network outlet near the bedroom TV that allows you to connect future
generations of Web-enabled TVs or similar products to your LAN for some
TV-based Web surfing.
Also, the latest versions of PVRs (like the latest TiVo models) are able to syn-
chronize over high-speed Internet connections and share data between differ-
ent locations in the home, so you’ll want to have a data connection nearby.
The master bedroom isn’t the only place to consider providing LAN connec-
tion points. Your kids are probably hogging time on your PC, but with PC
prices plummeting, getting the kids their own computers and connecting
them to a home network makes a lot of sense.
You should also think long term here: Today’s nursery is tomorrow’s teenager’s
room, and someday maybe a home office. Or your guest room may be hosting
one of your computer-geek relatives, who just can’t leave home without his or
her laptop. Having those rooms LAN-ready just makes sense.
Living room
Computers in the living room? Probably not in most homes, especially if you
limit your concept of computers to PCs (although Pat is trying hard to con-
vince his wife that they need a new 20-inch flat-screen iMac next to the living-
room sofa). New devices are coming to market, however, that require LAN
connections and fit into the living room. Leading the way are today’s network-
able gaming consoles and PVRs (discussed in Chapter 5). But also think
about screen phones or set-top boxes that let you read e-mail or shop on 
e-commerce Web sites. Eventually, you’ll probably want to access this stuff
from your recliner.
250
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

Home office
You obviously want to have a LAN connection in your home office. However,
we suggest that you think of your home office not in terms of whether or not to
include LAN connection points but in terms of how many and where. Consider
providing at least two or three network outlets in your home office — enough
to support two computers and a networkable printer.
More and more devices are network-enabled, and the concept of a monitor,
printer, computer, and keyboard all in the same place is rapidly going by the
wayside. Danny has extended an extra keyboard, wireless mouse, and moni-
tor to his treadmill and can now read the New York Times every morning and
clear his e-mail before work — using the same computer that’s on his desk in
the home office down the hallway — while losing weight. (Pat needs to do 
the same.)
What’s great about Ethernet hubs is that you can cascade them throughout
your house if you run out of ports on your central hub. Suppose that you’re
using all your ports to run to different rooms, but your kids want four
Ethernet ports in their room instead of the two you provided. No problem:
Connect your Ethernet’s uplink port to the wall outlet, and the other ports
are available for that room’s networking — and everyone can still communi-
cate with everyone else on the home LAN.
Home theater or media center
You should consider including your home theater in your LAN plans for a
couple of reasons. First, you’ll probably have a Media Adapter, TiVo or some
other Internet-enabled media server in your home theater, or you may want
to have some sort of Web-enabled TV set-top box (such as Microsoft’s MSN
TV2) so that you can take a break from movies and surf the Web on your
widescreen tube. You may even want to install a media center PC in your
home theater to surf the Web, to keep track of your movie inventory, or even
to feed streaming media (such as YouTube videos) from the Web to your
audio or video systems.
Right now, broadband Internet service from DSL or cable TV companies
reaches your house through a modem (and you’ll probably install that
modem in your home office or wiring closet). Some providers, particularly
cable companies (but also some DSL providers who are looking to offer tele-
vision services over DSL), are bringing to market set-top boxes that incorpo-
rate the broadband modem. If this is the case, you’ll definitely want to have a
network connection behind the TV so that you can share this Internet con-
nection with the rest of your network.
251
Chapter 14: Designing a Data LAN

Kitchen
We think that having some sort of Net-connected computer device, whether a
full-fledged PC or something scaled down (such as the Internet refrigerator or
Internet microwave), is going to be a great way to do a whole host of kitchen
tasks. Imagine accessing your network’s recipe database CD-ROM from an
inexpensive PC on your kitchen counter, placing your grocery order online
while standing next to your empty fridge, or quickly ordering your favorite
pizza when you don’t feel like cooking. (Although some of the online grocery
startups such as WebVan have shut their doors, many brick-and-mortar gro-
cery chains such as Safeway, www.safeway.com, still do online grocery
ordering and delivery in limited areas).
Some day, your kitchen appliances will use IP to send information about
themselves to repair facilities and possibly to your home-automation system.
(Warning! The freezer is malfunctioning!) In fact, if you want to spend about
$6000 for a refrigerator, a few companies will sell you one with a PC and 
flat-panel display built in. Right now, most of these appliances use an
Ethernet connection, but we think that they’ll ultimately use the power line 
to communicate — there’s just not enough kitchens with extra Ethernet jacks
behind the fridge these days, and no matter how many people read this book,
that isn’t going to change any time soon. We still think it’s a good idea to get
at least one Ethernet outlet in the kitchen, just to be on the safe side.

Toiletly serious business
In Japan — where people evidently take 
certain elements of the bathroom a bit more
seriously than Americans do — high-tech toi-
lets are all the rage. Besides heated seats and
other luxury items, these toilets have . . . er . . .
facilities that perform medical evaluations of 
the . . . umm . . . contents of the toilet. Look at
Jasmin by TOTO USA, Inc. (www.totousa.
com), which has an optional warm seat feature
and built-in catalyzed-disk fan that freshens the
air (activated by sitting down). Also, by pressing
a button on the LCD remote control, which looks
like a Nintendo control pad, you are “bathed in
a gentle, aerated, warm water stream with mas-
saging action.” Ohhhh-kay. We wouldn’t be sur-
prised to see this kind of thing become more
common. The next step is a Net-connected
toilet that can give reports to your healthcare
provider (yes — really). Frankly, if these catch
on in the U.S., we have no clue how you’d net-
work. We’ll leave that to the fourth edition of this
book.

Other places
Where else in the home should you extend your data network? Well, person-
ally speaking, we’re proponents of including data cabling in just about every
room in the house. We’re not going to give you any specific recommendations
for network connections in other places in your home. Instead, we challenge
you to spend a bit of time thinking about the long-term uses of each part of
your home. For example, do you hope to one day finish your attic or base-
ment? If so, you may as well get the wire there ahead of time.
Some of the wireless or no-new-wires (telephone or electrical) networking
solutions that we discuss in Chapter 16 can also be good ways of extending a
network to unexpected places. These products allow you to interface with an
existing wired network and get the connection to places that you just never
anticipated during your planning process (places such as the garage, where
soon-to-arrive cars will dock into a home port to update their files and do
their diagnostic workout).
Migrating Your Computer 
Flock to the Net
Coming up with a general design of your home-computer LAN is the first big
step forward on this long march to networked nirvana. A home LAN helps
you get all your computers onto the Internet and certainly makes your com-
puting life easier and more fun.
Unfortunately, most consumer Internet accounts allow a single computer to
attach to the Net. In other words, when you log on to your analog modem,
DSL, cable modem, or other high-speed network Internet account, your com-
puter and modem communicate with your ISP’s server and are assigned a
single IP address. (The IP address is how the Internet knows what information
you’ve asked for and received — sort of like your mailing address for data.) 
A single IP address works fine when the modem is connected to a single com-
puter. When you’re trying to serve several computers at the same time with
that Internet connection, however, you need some way to separate those dif-
ferent requests so that the data doesn’t get jumbled. To solve this problem,
you can choose a router, which is a hardware solution, or a proxy server,
which is a software solution.
253
Chapter 14: Designing a Data LAN

Many DSL and cable modem accounts give you only a single IP address for
the base price but will provide your other computers with their own IP
addresses for a monthly fee (usually about $3 to $5 per month per additional
computer). If you choose this option, you need just a regular Ethernet hub —
not one of the home-networking routers or proxy servers we’re about to dis-
cuss. Each approach has pros and cons — the primary benefit of paying your
service provider to do this for you is that you don’t have to lift a finger to
make it work, but the costs can add up if you have lots of computers and
computer-like devices on your network. In the end, however, we think you’ll
want to add a router to the network.
Understanding home-network routers
If you were to go into the dark recesses of your office’s telecommunications
and data center, you’d probably find several weird-looking devices mounted
on racks and shelves. One of these devices is most likely a router.
A router is the piece of equipment that consolidates all Internet traffic coming
in and out of your office’s LAN and sends it to the appropriate computers in
the public network. The router performs this bit of Net magic by creating its
own subnet (or private IP network) within the office and assigning private IP
addresses to each computer connected to the router. The router is assigned a
public IP address (one that other computers on the Internet can send data to
and from) when it connects to the Internet, and then it figures out which
packets of data go to which computer in the subnet.
Setting up a router for a large network is a complicated procedure — another
one of those reasons why IT workers in your office make such good salaries.
Luckily, routers designed for small home networks are relatively easy to 
configure.
These home-network routers or residential gateways act as the interface
between your modem or broadband connection to your ISP and the rest of
your home LAN, receiving all incoming Internet data and sending it to the
correct machine on your network without your intervention. The first time
you set up your router (or when you change the configuration of your net-
work by adding or removing computers), you’ll have to use some network
management software to get things organized, but most of these routers have
easy-to-understand, wizard-style programs (accessible through your Web
browser) to lead you through this process. Figure 14-1 shows how you would
set up a home-network router.
254
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

The technology that makes your home router work is called NAT (network
address translation). NAT translates between the private IP addresses of the
computers on your network and the public IP address that they all share, and
is smart enough to make sure everything ends up in the right place.
Many home-network routers use your Internet browser as the software to
configure the system. The configuration software is written as HyperText
Markup Language (HTML) files — the language of Web pages. To set things
up, you simply open your Web browser software, type the Web address of
your router (it’s usually a number, something like 192.168.1.1), and open
these files. Fill in a few blanks, answer a few questions, and click a few but-
tons, and your router is ready to go.
Home-network routers range in price depending on what kind of modem is
included (if one is included at all) and how many computers they can work
with. The majority of home-network routers on the market today work with
only cable or DSL broadband connections — they have an Ethernet interface
to hook into the DSL or cable modem, and no way to connect to an analog
modem. So, if you’re still stuck on dial-up, you’ll have to shop around a bit to
find a model that works for you. (A few models are available with a built-in
analog modem, but they’re getting scarce.) Other features that influence the
price of a home-network router include the following:

 Firewalls: Although NAT itself provides some network security func-
tions, many home-network routers also contain sophisticated firewalls,
which keep hackers out of your computer.
 Wireless LAN support: The wireless networks we talk about in Chap-
ter 16 are often supported by home-network routers — many have built-
in wireless access point functionality, so you can support both your
wired and unwired computers from a single device.
 Other home-networking support: Besides the wireless systems just
mentioned, many home-networking gateways also include support for
connecting PCs to your network using existing telephone lines or even
electrical power lines. We talk about these systems in Chapter 16 as well.
 Support for VPN: Many business use VPNs (virtual private networks) to
allow their employees to securely connect their computers from remote
locations back into the corporate network. Not all home-network routers
will let you connect in this way. (VPNs have special protocols that not all
routers will pass through to the Internet.)
The cheapest home-network routers start at about $50 (these boxes were at
least $200 just five or six years ago). The major vendors of home-network
routers and router/modem combos include the following:
 Belkin (www.belkin.com)
 Buffalo (www.buffalotech.com)
 D-Link (www.dlink.com)
 Hawking (www.hawking.com)
 Linksys (www.linksys.com)
 NETGEAR (www.netgear.com)
 SMC (www.smc.com)
Although you can buy your own home-network router directly from the man-
ufacturer or from online and other retailers, you may also have the option of
getting one directly from your Internet service provider. DSL providers such
as BellSouth, AT&T, EarthLink, and Verizon will provide you with a home-
network router — usually for a monthly fee. Although you might end up paying
more for such a solution over time than just buying the router yourself, you
do have the advantage of having someone to support you if you run into any
problems.
Some broadband companies don’t like the idea of a customer being able to
hook up multiple computers to your broadband connection without paying
more to do so — so they frown on customer-owned home-network routers. We
haven’t heard of any providers prohibiting their customers from doing so (it
would be hard for them to even know that you’re using a router, technically
256
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

speaking), but some folks in these companies are looking into ways to keep
you from using home-networking routers that you haven’t rented from your
ISP (for a nice big monthly fee).
Using your PC to route packets
Routers are the hardware-based way of sharing an Internet connection. Given
their low price, we think they’re also the best way. But they’re not the only
way. The software-based alternative is to install or use a proxy server program
on one of your networked PCs. This program performs pretty much the same
function as a router — that is, it distributes Internet data packets from a
single connection to multiple PCs on a network.
We don’t recommend that you take the proxy server approach. Home-network
routers are so cheap and effective that setting up a proxy server is more work
than it’s worth. If the $50 for a home router is more than you want to spend,
scour eBay or Craig’s List (www.craigslist.com) for a used router.
In this scenario, you designate one of the PCs in your network (the one with
the modem connected to it, generally) as the proxy server for the rest of the
network. This proxy server PC collects all incoming and outgoing Internet
traffic; the proxy server software then determines which networked com-
puter the data is intended for and sends it on its way. Figure 14-2 shows a 
typical proxy server setup for an Internet connection other than through an
analog modem. (This configuration requires two NICs in the proxy server.)

Chapter 14: Designing a Data LAN

Proxy server software is usually easy to set up, and the programs themselves
are inexpensive — free, if you’re using a modern Windows or Mac operating
system.
If you have a Windows computer with Windows 98, Second Edition, or a later
operating system, you can set up a proxy server without additional software
by using the Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) control panel built into the
OS. For Windows XP and Vista, this functionality is built into the Network
Setup Wizard (in the Network Connections Control Panel). Mac users with 
OS X also have this functionality built right in to the OS.
You can also find inexpensive third-party software to operate as a proxy
server, which some folks choose for a greater number of features. The most
popular proxy server software for Windows users is made by a company
called WinGate (www.wingate.com). For Mac users, a program called
IPNetRouter is probably the most popular choice (www.sustworks.com).
To use a PC or Mac as a proxy server, you must choose a computer that has
two NICs. One NIC connects to the Internet connection, and the other con-
nects to your LAN. For a wired network, you’d need two Ethernet NICs in
your computer; for a wireless network, you’d need one Ethernet NIC for the
Internet connection and a wireless one for the LAN. Many computers have
both an Ethernet and a wireless NIC, but very few come standard with two
Ethernet NICs.
Routing and bridging with data networks is a complicated topic, and we’ve
just touched on it here. As you get into your data-networking plans, check
out Home Networking For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Kathy Ivens (published by
Wiley Publishing, Inc.) — it will help you figure out the next level of detail on
this topic.

C
hances are good that you have more than one computer in your home. 
If you don’t, we suspect that you soon will. You also probably have sev-
eral, perhaps even many, devices that can be networked with your computers
for doing things such as printing, storing files, making phone calls, listening
to music, and watching video. To make the most of all of these devices, you
need a home-computer network — a local area network, or LAN. And to make
use of these devices anywhere in your home, you need a whole-home LAN.
In this chapter, we tell you about the equipment and wires in a wired LAN 
and how to have it installed in your house.
Even if you think that you’re going to rely primarily on a wireless network
(which we discuss in the Chapter 16), you should still at least skim this chap-
ter. Wireless is great and we recommend that everyone include at least some
wireless in their computer network, but having a wired backbone in your
home makes your whole network more flexible and better performing.
Building CAT-5e/6 LANs
The backbone of a computer network — regardless of the types of computers
connected to it or the types of network software used to make it work — 
consists of the physical wiring and components that connect everything. The
most common type of wired computer LAN uses a special type of copper
cabling, CAT-5e or CAT-6 UTP (unshielded twisted pair).

260
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 
We discuss the differences between CAT-5e and CAT-6 cabling in Chapter 2.
CAT-6 cabling is capable of higher data rates than CAT-5e, but both are capa-
ble of handling up to and including Gigabit Ethernet (1000BaseT), which is as
fast a network as should be needed for a good number of years in the home.
Yep, saying that out loud is almost a guarantee that something will pop up.
(Remember when Bill Gates said a PC wouldn’t need more than 64K of
memory?) But realistically, most home networking gear is only 100BaseT, and
1000BaseT can handle even multiple channels of high-definition video (which
is the biggest bandwidth hog in the home). In Chapter 2 we help you decide
whether to choose CAT-5e or CAT-6. For the purposes of this chapter, they are
identical, and are treated as such.
Nearly all LAN technologies share a few basic building blocks:
 Cables: Cables usually provide the connection between networked
devices. But in some cases, the physical connection doesn’t take place
via wires — many emerging LAN technologies make use of wireless 
communications techniques to get data around your home (discussed 
in Chapter 16).
 Network interface cards (NICs): You must install NICs (pronounced like
the New York basketball team) — in each device that connects to the
network. The NIC bridges the gap between the cables (or wireless
devices) and the individual computers or other networked devices. NICs
generally work with only one kind of network, such as an Ethernet NIC
for Ethernet-based networks. Most computers today are shipped with
Ethernet NICs already installed.
 A network protocol — such as Ethernet: Ethernet is a hardware specifi-
cation that controls access to the network, allows individual devices on
the network to find and identify each other, and determines when each
device can transmit and receive data. The key thing about Ethernet is
that each Ethernet system adheres to a set of protocol standards that
enables various devices from different manufacturers to communicate.
Ethernet is the most common LAN for the home or small office (or in big
business for that matter). The total bandwidth and the type of cable the net-
work uses define different variations of Ethernet. For example, 100BaseT —
the most common variation — transmits data at speeds up to 100 Mbps and
uses UTP copper wires as its physical media.
Scores of Ethernet variations are available, but you need to consider only the
following:
 10Base2: 10 Mbps over coaxial cable (this network is just about extinct,
so we mention it only in case you run across it in an existing installation)
 10BaseT: 10 Mbps over twisted-pair cable
 100BaseT: 100 Mbps over twisted-pair cable — often called Fast
Ethernet

 1000BaseT: 1000 Mbps over twisted-pair cable — often called Gigabit
Ethernet, or Gig-E
The first number in each of these names stands for the bandwidth of the
system in megabits per second, so 10Base2 is a 10-Mbps connection. The last
number or letter tells you the kind of cable that it goes over; for example, 
T means twisted pair.
Like the other networks we describe in this book, local area networks sup-
port different architectures. LANs are particularly flexible, however, in allow-
ing you to mix and match architectures as you grow.
The two basic choices for how you model your LAN are the bus architecture
and the star architecture (sometimes called home run because each cable
runs back to a central home). If you’ve read other chapters in this book, you
already know that we prefer the star architecture, hands down. In fact, we
don’t believe the bus architecture is really worth talking about, so we just
concentrate on the star.
Twisted-pair Ethernet LANs (such as 10BaseT or 100BaseT) use a network
architecture called a star. In a star configuration, all hardware connects to a
central device called a hub or a switch. The hub transmits the data from each
incoming cable to every other cable that attaches to the hub — and, there-
fore, to each device that attaches to the far end of those cables.
261
Chapter 15: Choosing the Parts for a Wired Data LAN
The shortest Ethernet primer in computerdom
Ethernet in its traditional form is a shared net-
work. All computers and other connected, net-
worked devices share the 10 (or 100 or 1000)
Mbps of bandwidth available on the network.
Ethernet uses a protocol called CSMA/CD
(Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Detection) to divide access to the network.
Basically, CSMA/CD means that all devices on
the network listen for a free moment on the net-
work before sending data. When the coast is
clear, the data goes out. If two devices happen
to choose the same moment to send data, a col-
lision occurs. The devices then each wait a
random amount of time before resending their
data.
Newer versions of Ethernet hardware sys-
tems are switched. These Ethernet networks
use a sophisticated device — the switch, of
course — to direct data throughout the net-
work. Instead of sharing 10 or 100 Mbps, each
device has that amount of bandwidth dedicated
to it at all times. The switch basically keeps
each segment of the Ethernet network separate
from the others — directing data between the
devices that are talking and keeping data off the
wires running to other devices, instead of send-
ing the data to every device. This process can
reduce the number of collisions and make the
overall network faster as more and more
devices are connected to it.

Hubs and switches do basically the same thing. They are the central point to
which each run of CAT-5e/6 UTP cabling connects back to, and they allow
data to flow down different legs of the network to get from device to device.
The difference is that a switch uses internal intelligence to figure out which
legs of the network the data needs to flow over, but a hub just sends the data
(usually called packets) down every leg of the network simultaneously. If 
only two computers are talking to each other, the difference between these
approaches isn’t significant. But as more devices start to talk to each other, a
switch can make things much faster. Because switch prices have dropped
immensely, we recommend that you install a switch rather than a hub in the
center of your network.
We show a network built using a star architecture in Figure 15-1.
Need to add another device to the network? Just run another length of net-
work cabling and connect it to the hub. Someone drive a nail through one of
your network cables? Your whole network doesn’t go down — just the
affected segment.
Star architecture is a key concept in home networking because you can use it
for all sorts of networks, such as a telephone system or a video-distribution
system. In these systems, as in Ethernet and other LANs, the star topology
greatly increases the flexibility, reliability, and expandability of a network.

Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

Your star network can be expanded easily by hooking up a hub at one of the
endpoints you’ve wired into your network. So if you have a single Ethernet
outlet in a bedroom and need to connect two or three devices to it, you can
just plug a hub into the outlet, and then connect those devices to the hub. All
computers connected to this remote hub will be able to “see” the rest of your
network — just as if they were connected to one of your Ethernet jacks.
Cables and Connectors
If you’re getting ready to create a new data network (or telephone network,
for that matter) in your home, you’ll have to make sure that your baseline
cabling for this is CAT-5e/6 wiring, as we discussed in Chapter 2. For data,
you need CAT-5e/6, period.
Of course, cables don’t do you much good when they’re just a bunch of bare
wires hanging out of the wall — you need something to connect them to your
networked equipment. Luckily, this problem has an easy solution. Like tele-
phone networks, computer LANs utilize a common connector, the RJ-45. The
standard jack and plug for all UTP computer LANs, RJ-45 connectors look
exactly like the familiar (old-fashioned) telephone jacks called RJ-11s, which
we discuss in Chapter 2, only bigger (wider). RJ-45 connectors are designed
to terminate all four pairs of wire found in typical CAT-5e/6 UTP cables.
CAT-5e/6 cabling is designed for high-speed, high-performance networks.
Therefore, if you use CAT-5e, the entire system — the plugs, jacks, patch
panels, and connectors, in addition to the cable — must be CAT-5e rated. 
The same is true for CAT-6; everything must be CAT-6 rated. A LAN is only as
good as its weakest link, so if any one piece of the puzzle is rated less than
CAT-5e/6, the entire LAN will be as well.
The network components
Besides the cables and connectors, a few other pieces are necessary to
install a smart-home LAN. This equipment is pretty universal, whether you’re
installing an inexpensive one-room 100-Mbps Ethernet network or a sophisti-
cated Gigabit Ethernet network throughout the home. The key is to use 
CAT-5e/6 components throughout the network. That way, even if you start 
off with just a 10BaseT Ethernet system, your wiring is in place to upgrade 
by simply replacing a few components — no ripping down walls and starting
over from scratch for you!
263
Chapter 15: Choosing the Parts for a Wired Data LAN

The 1000BaseT, or Gigabit Ethernet, system is being deployed in corporate
office networks. It’s still expensive, relative to 10BaseT and 100BaseT net-
works, and most folks don’t need Gigabit Ethernet. Some day, however, you
may want Gigabit Ethernet in the home — mainly because it’s fast enough to
let you use your computer LAN to carry things such as HDTV signals. As 
long as you have a star-wired CAT-5e/6 network, you’ll be ready for Gigabit
Ethernet when you need it. Just upgrade your NICs and your switch or router,
and you’ll be there!
Punch it down!
Your home LAN’s central node — the place from which all your cabling runs
start — begins with a device called a patch panel or a punchdown block
mounted in your central wiring closet. If you read Chapter 2, where we dis-
cuss wiring, and Chapter 10 on telephone networks, you’re already familiar
with this device. A data network uses a punchdown block that is just about
identical to the one your telephone uses. The one major exception is that the
punchdown block needs to be CAT-5e/6 rated to allow high-speed data trans-
missions. You don’t need this level of cable and component quality for tele-
phone service — but it’s a good idea to use this for all your UTP wiring
infrastructure because it lets you easily repurpose cables (for example, turn a
phone jack into an Ethernet jack by just reconnecting it in the wiring closet).
Switches and hubs and routers for everyone
The key component in an Ethernet network is an Ethernet hub or switch, the
device that ensures that data gets from point A to point B in the network. 
A hub or switch (we’ll just talk about switches from here on out, because
they’re the superior way to go and don’t cost much more) is a small elec-
tronic box with a number of RJ-45 connectors (called ports) across the front.
Inside the switch is a circuit board that electrically connects all these RJ-45
connectors to each other in the proper way — the proper way means that the
wire carrying outgoing data from one computer connects to the wires that
carry incoming data to all other computers that are part of the switch. We
know all this information can be confusing, but don’t let it stress you out.
Honestly, you don’t need to spend much time thinking about how hubs and
switches work. They’re simply one of those magical boxes that allow your
computers to talk to each other.
The uplink port (also sometimes called a WAN port), which is a special RJ-45
port, is another feature of a typical switch. Unlike the other ports, the uplink
port doesn’t cross the incoming and outgoing data signals. Instead, it sends
them straight through (incoming to incoming, outgoing to outgoing). This
capability becomes useful if, for example, you want to connect two hubs or if
you have an Internet connection device, such as a cable modem, that you
want to connect to all computers in the network. In these cases, you use the
uplink port instead of a standard port.
264
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

It’s just about impossible to find a hub, switch, or router without an uplink
port, but if you ever do run into one, you can use a special kind of CAT-5e/6
patch cable, called a crossover cable, to connect your network to your broad-
band connection. A crossover cable crosses over the transmit and receive
conductors in the CAT-5e/6 cable so that data flows the right way between
your modem and your LAN. By the way, the regular cables used to connect
computers in the LAN are sometimes referred to as straight through cables.
Some Ethernet switches and hubs don’t have a dedicated uplink port.
Instead, they have a switch (a button, in other words) next to one of the regu-
lar ports that lets you configure the port to act as an uplink port.
You might be thinking, “Well, where do home-network routers fit in?” Great
question. Most home routers have built-in Ethernet switches. So you might
not need to buy a router and a switch. Just go shopping for a home-network
router (from companies such as NETGEAR, Linksys, or D-link), and you’ll be
set. (For more on home routers, see Chapter 14.) Keep in mind that most
home routers have a four-port switch. You might end up connecting Ethernet
devices in more than four rooms. If this is the case for you, you’ll want a sep-
arate switch that you’ll connect to one of the LAN ports on your router.
Like ice cream, switches (and routers and hubs for that matter) come in
many flavors — the one you purchase is a matter of taste. Be sure to look for
the following, though:
 Number of ports: Be sure to buy a switch that has enough ports to con-
nect all the computers and networkable devices (such as printers and
cable modems) that you plan on installing in your home LAN.
 Speed: 100 Mbps (100BaseT) is still the standard Ethernet installation
for most residential applications, but you may want to move up to the
faster 1000BaseT. There’s still a big price difference between 100BaseT
and 1000BaseT switches, so you should look at your requirements
closely as you make this decision.
Both 100BaseT and 1000BaseT use the same wiring infrastructure, so
you can start off with one and upgrade to the other just by changing the
switch and putting new network interface cards (NICs) in your PCs. A
growing number of computers have 1000BaseT Gigabit Ethernet NICs
built in, but 100BaseT is still the standard.
 Router integration: As we mentioned, many switches designed for the
home are part of an overall home router device. This can be handy (less
boxes to install), but most of these router/switch devices are limited to
four ports, which means you’d need an external switch anyway! 
265
Chapter 15: Choosing the Parts for a Wired Data LAN

Most of the integrated router/switch devices available for the home also
include wireless (Wi-Fi) networking functionality as well. See Chapter 16
for more on this.
 Price: Take a quick trip to any computer superstore or browse through
any computer equipment catalog, and you’ll find an amazing range of
prices for switches that are equivalent in speed and number of ports.
The last time we went shopping for a small, four-port, 10/100BaseT
switch/router, we discovered that the big name companies offered them
for about $50, while Gigabit versions were about double that. Doing a
little online detective work at a site such as shopper.cnet.com
can help.
NICs galore
All the cables in the world won’t do your computer a bit of good if it doesn’t
have the right hardware that lets it “talk” on your LAN. The network interface
card, or NIC, performs that job.
NICs come in different forms to fit the varying kinds of internal buses in
today’s (and yesterday’s) PCs and Macs. The most common internal bus
found in new desktop computers is the PCI (or peripheral component inter-
connect) bus. Some older computers also use the ISA (industry standard
architecture) bus, but this standard is becoming less common. You can find
NICs for both architectures, but PCI is more common. If you have a choice of
using either, choose PCI.
PCI and ISA are the card slots visible at the back of your computer. You insert
these cards by popping the cover off your computer and sliding a card into
an empty PCI slot inside, leaving the RJ-45 jack part sticking out the back of
the computer. Although the PCI bus theoretically offers faster data through-
put, for the NIC cards used in a home LAN there’s really no difference. We rec-
ommend that you utilize whichever slot you have available — just be sure to
check what’s free inside your computer before you buy one (or go to your
local computer superstore, have one installed, and ask a lot of questions).
For laptop computers, the most common bus for NIC cards is the CardBus
(also called the PCMCIA) slot. CardBus, the little credit-card-sized slot on the
side of most laptops, is functionally a specialized (miniaturized) PCI bus.
Many laptop computers come with only one (or even no) CardBus slots, so
the Ethernet NIC is usually embedded on the motherboard of the laptop — in
which case you already have a NIC and don’t need to do anything with it.
266
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

A new standard called ExpressCard is beginning to appear in the laptop
world. ExpressCards look a bit like CardBus cards, but they’re not inter-
changeable. We’re not going to worry too much about ExpressCard here
because if you have an ExpressCard laptop, it’s almost assuredly equipped
with embedded Ethernet.
You may also run across external NIC cards, which connect to your computer
through a USB cable and one of your computer’s USB 2.0 ports. We don’t see
these too often, but they can come in handy in the unlikely event that your
PC has no built-in Ethernet and also has no open PCI or CardBus slots.
NICs offer different interfaces to the LAN — in other words, they have differ-
ent connectors on the back for different kinds of LAN cabling. If you’re follow-
ing our advice, and we hope that you do, you should choose a NIC with an
RJ-45 jack.
Finally, NICs are designed to connect computers to different kinds of net-
works. For example, some connect to 10BaseT Ethernet networks, some to
100BaseT Ethernet, and others to 1000BaseT networks. Almost all NICs on
the market today will work with slower variants of Ethernet. So, for example,
if you buy a NIC (or a new PC with a built-in NIC) for Gigabit Ethernet, it will
work fine on 10BaseT and 100BaseT networks as well. This functionality
(where the card adapts to the network switch it is attached to) is called
autosensing. It’s hard to find a NIC that’s not autosensing these day, but you
should check. You are definitely better off with an autosensing NIC.
We recommend that you install NICs that supports at least 100BaseT net-
working. Or if the price (about $30) fits your budget, install Gigabit Ethernet
NICs. They are autosensing, work with whatever network you install, and
allow you to upgrade your network in the future without having to buy a
bunch of new NICs.
Most PCs are now being sold with NICs preinstalled from the factory — a
great thing, in our opinion. For example, as we wrote this, even the least
expensive Dell desktop PC ($350) included a built-in 10/100BaseT autosensing
NIC. If you’re in the market for a new computer, get one with a built-in NIC
and avoid the hassle of installation.
With cables and connectors, patch panels, NICs, and hubs, you’re 90 percent
of the way towards putting together a home LAN. The final key to the puzzle
is another set of CAT-5e/6 cables called patch cables. Patch cables fill the gap
between wall outlets and computers; they also connect the patch panel to
your Ethernet switch or home-network router.
267
Chapter 15: Choosing the Parts for a Wired Data LAN

Just like all the other components in your network, your patch cables should
be rated CAT-5e/6. Most are, but some of the cheaper ones are rated CAT-3 or
even unrated. You don’t want these — they’re a false economy that may keep
your network from reaching its maximum speed or working reliably.
Software to put it all together
The one additional component to making a LAN work — probably the most
difficult one for many people — is configuring all the network protocols and
software on each of your home’s PCs. This used to be the domain of hard-
core networking experts, but it has become less onerous with each succes-
sive release of Windows and Mac OS software.
Our focus in this book is to get you the infrastructure you need to have a
home LAN — we simply don’t have the room to talk about binding protocols
and configuring networking software. If you’re not comfortable with doing
this on your own, check out Networking For Dummies, 8th Edition, by Doug
Lowe or Home Networking For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Kathy Ivens (both
published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Visualizing How a Data LAN Works
In the star architecture, each LAN station — the outlet into which you can
connect a computer to the LAN — is served by its own length of UTP cable
radiating out from a central node, like the spokes on a wagon wheel. Probably
the best way to visualize this kind of LAN network is to follow your data from
a PC back to the central node of the LAN and back over the network to its
final destination:
1. The computer uses its networking software to send a chunk of data from
a program to your NIC.
2. The NIC converts the data into the proper format for the network
(Ethernet, for example) and sends it as an electrical signal over the
patch cable.
3. The patch cable carries this data signal between the NIC and the nearest
RJ-45 connector installed in a wall outlet.
4. The RJ-45 connector attaches to one end of a length of CAT-5e/6 UTP
cabling, which carries the data signal back through your walls to the
central node of your LAN (in the basement, garage, or utility room —
wherever you choose to house it).
268
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

5. The UTP cable terminates where it’s punched down into the patch
panel, which carries your data signal across its internal wiring to
another RJ-45 connector.
6. Another patch cable carries the data signal from the back of the patch
panel to the Ethernet switch or home-network router.
7. The switch takes your outgoing data signal and sends it on a U-turn trip
back through the patch panel and over a different CAT-5e/6 to its final
destination on your network (another computer, a printer, or elsewhere).
The devices that communicate over your Ethernet LAN don’t have to be com-
puters. Many peripheral devices such as printers have Ethernet ports, as do
things that might have nothing to do with your PC — such as a video gaming
console. If you want to use your Xbox 360 with Microsoft’s online gaming 
service, you can use Ethernet to connect it to your broadband Internet 
connection.
Working with your Internet connection
The scenario we just went through describes how data is shared between
computers across your LAN. But that leaves out what is, for many folks, the
most important thing: getting data to and from the Internet. That’s where the
home-network router that we’ve talked about so much fits in. A router’s main
purpose (besides switching local LAN traffic) is to send data between your
Internet connection and the computers and devices on your LAN.
A switch is a device that connects multiple PCs on a LAN. A router connects
the computers on a LAN to a wide area network (such as the Internet). Most
home routers that we discuss have a built-in switch but not all switches are
also routers.
Conceptually, transferring data through a router is really just like Steps 1
through 7 in the preceding section. The difference is this: In the scenario in
that section, the local LAN traffic makes a U-turn and is sent back to another
computer in your home. When you’re using your network for Internet access,
the Internet traffic goes through the router and gets sent to your cable or DSL
modem and off to the Internet (and vice versa for the data that you receive
from your Internet connection).
This leads to a key question: Where should you put the broadband modem? In
pre-networking days, you just stuck it on your desk, right next to the computer.
After all, that computer was the only thing using it, so why put it far away? But
now that we’re all networking our computers, there’s no obvious place to put
the broadband modem. Most people narrow it down to two options:
269
Chapter 15: Choosing the Parts for a Wired Data LAN

 Put the broadband modem in the wiring closet, next to the router and
the CAT-5e/6 patch panel. This is a nice, neat, easy solution, with every-
thing in one place. Your cable or DSL lines come into the home here, so
you’ll have something to hook the broadband modem to.
 Put the broadband modem in your home office (or wherever you 
keep your primary computer). In this scenario, you need two CAT-5e/6
cables — one to connect the output of the broadband modem back
down to the router or switch in the wiring closet and another that con-
nects the output of the router or switch to the computer in the room.
We like to use the second solution. Running that second CAT-5e/6 cable up to
the home office is simple (we recommend extra CAT-5e/6 cables to the home
office anyway), and it gives you a chance to keep an eye on your broadband
modem. These modems are notoriously unpredictable, and sometimes you
just need to pull the plug and restart them to get them working properly.
You’ll also be able to quickly check the status lights on the modem to make
sure everything is hunky dory.
Integrating with no-new-wires networks
In Chapter 16, we describe several networking technologies that don’t use
CAT-5e/6 UTP cabling. Instead, they use wireless, power line, and phone line
technologies to hook computers together. Even if you have a wired CAT-5e/6
network in place, you still might find these networks useful — particularly
wireless LANs that let you roam around the house with your laptop or hand-
held computer without plugging into anything.
Combining these networks with your wired LAN is simple. Wireless LANs are
the easiest of all — wireless LAN access points (the hubs of a wireless net-
work) in almost all cases have an RJ-45 Ethernet connection, which is
designed to be connected to a wired LAN. So just find a good place to put
your access point (we give you some tips in Chapter 16), plug it into the near-
est wired LAN outlet (and into the wall power outlet too), and you’re set. And
in many cases, the wireless access point is built right into your router, so
there’s nothing to connect at all!
You’ll need to do a little bit of software setup. This varies from access point
to access point, but there’s one tip we want to give you. Most access points
can act as DHCP servers as well — assigning IP addresses to computers. If
you’re using a router on your wired LAN and are using a separate access
point (one that’s not built into the router), the router is already set up to do
assign IP addresses, and letting the access point also assign them to your PCs
will mess up your network. Instead, you should set up your access point in
what’s usually called bridging mode. This lets the router do its job — the
access point just transparently connects, or bridges, between the wired and
wireless sections of the network.
270
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

For networks that run over power lines or phone lines, there typically isn’t a
central network hub such as the access point of a wireless LAN. What you
will find, however, are Ethernet-to-power-line or Ethernet-to-phone-line
bridges (there’s that term again!). You’ll use two (or more) of these bridges in
your network. One bridge connects to an Ethernet outlet somewhere in the
house (or directly to the switch or router in the wiring closet) and then plugs
into a phone or power outlet. On the far end (where your remote devices are
located), you use another bridge in the reverse fashion — the bridge plugs
into a phone or power outlet (to pick up the data sent by the first bridge) and
then connects to the Ethernet port of the device that you want to connect to
the network.
271
Chapter 15: Choosing the Parts for a Wired Data LAN
Infrared — using light instead of wires
Infrared networking — using light waves
instead of radio waves — is already a part of
many computer networks. A relatively mature
standard known as IrDA (Infrared Device
Association) is in place. IrDA devices are com-
monly found in three main sets of equipment:
 Printers: Using an IrDA interface, you can
beam print jobs from one or several com-
puters to your printer without cables. You
find IrDA interfaces mainly on high-end
laser printers — the inkjet models that most
people have in their homes don’t have this
capability yet. Remember, though, that a
printer with an IrDA interface doesn’t do
you any good unless your PC has one as
well.
 Notebook computers: Many laptops have a
built-in IrDA interface to facilitate printing
and to make for easy data synchronization
with your desktop PC.
 Handheld computer devices: You also find
IrDA interfaces on many handheld PDA
(personal digital assistant) computers,
mainly for synchronizing data with your
desktop computer.
Depending on its implementation, infrared 
networking can be efficient and speedy — 
with data throughput rates reaching several
megabits per second in some cases.
Infrared does have a major downfall, however,
that makes it unsuitable for a whole-home net-
work: Infrared signals are line-of-sight only. In
other words, an infrared signal won’t penetrate
some of those pesky things you often find in the
home — such as doors, walls, and giant-screen
televisions. So although infrared is useful in a
single room, it won’t get you very far beyond
that. In Chapter 16, we talk about a bunch of
solutions that can give you whole-home net-
working without using CAT-5e/6 wires. IrDA 
is more of an adjunct to a home network for
connecting peripheral devices and syncing
things — not a replacement.
One more thing: IrDA is a computer protocol
used for computer communications. IrDA is 
not typically used for noncomputer purposes,
such as remote controls for stereos and 
TVs. Although these remote controls also use
infrared signals, they’re an entirely different
critter.

Phone-line and power-line bridges are a great way to extend your Ethernet
network to places where you just didn’t think to put CAT-5e/6 cables. For
example, if you don’t have CAT-5e/6 next to your gaming console, but you
want to connect that console to your LAN and to the Internet, use a pair of
bridges and you’re all set. We’ve been using some of these bridges from NET-
GEAR in our homes, and they work great.

e think that a wired computer network — using CAT-5e or CAT-6
cabling in the walls — is the best way to set up a home-computer 
network. Wired networks are faster, more reliable, and more secure. Having
said that, we absolutely LOVE our wireless networks. Just try to take them
away from us — just try. . . .
We think that the no-new-wires computer LAN technologies have come a long
way in the past few years. They can fit into your smart home in one of two
ways. First, if you can’t get into the walls to run CAT-5e/6 cabling and your
house isn’t huge, you can build a satisfactory data network with no-new-wires
technologies. Second, even if you have a wired LAN infrastructure in your
walls, you’ll probably find a reason to use one of these no-new-wires net-
works. You might want to add a wireless network so that you can use your
laptop untethered, or you may find a spot where you don’t have CAT-5e/6 but
need network connectivity (such as behind your new Internet fridge).
In this chapter, we tell you about the three leading technologies for no-new-
wires computer networks: wireless (this is by far the most popular and useful
of the three), phone line (using your existing telephone wiring), and power
line (using your existing electrical wiring). Most people choose to go wire-
less, but there are good reasons to consider all three, and you may run into
situations where you’ll use more than one of these technologies in your
home.

274
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 
In Chapter 15 we talk about building the wired infrastructure in your home
for a computer LAN. We’re strong proponents of having wires when you can,
but we think just about anybody can benefit from a wireless LAN as well.
Luckily the two technologies (wired and wireless) work together pretty much
seamlessly. So even if you’ve installed a whole-home wired LAN, you should
at least consider adding some wireless on top of that infrastructure. The
mobility and flexibility that wireless gives you is worth the minimal 
expenditure.
Cut the Cord!
Probably the most exciting development that we’ve seen in the home-
networking field over the past few years has been the emergence of wireless
computer networks. Wireless networks have such a high coolness factor that
many other networking technologies have taken the back seat in people’s
minds — despite some limitations to the technology. We can understand this
because we too have been caught up in the wireless LAN mania.
When compared to wired Ethernet LANs, wireless networks have relatively
limited bandwidth, are subject to interference from other electrical devices in
the home (such as cordless phones and microwave ovens), and have some
security issues (wireless signals will go right through your walls and into
your driveway, street, or neighbor’s living room, so you need to encrypt your
data if you want to keep it private). We think the best way to use wireless is
to incorporate it into your wired network — using your wired LAN for things
that don’t move (such as the desktop PC) and adding a wireless LAN for
portable devices such as laptops and PDAs.
Understanding the standards
As is the case for many new and emerging technologies, various companies,
industry groups, and international standards bodies are involved in the wire-
less LAN industry. If you shop for a wireless LAN, you’ll run into competing
standards.
Standards are vitally important to networking. For example, the various stan-
dards for wired Ethernet networks allow equipment from different vendors to
work together right out of the box, with no special tweaking or esoteric set-
tings to configure. The same is true in wireless LANs — equipment conform-
ing to a specific standard should work seamlessly with other equipment that

also conforms to the standard, regardless of the manufacturer. In fact, many
standards bodies sponsor interoperability bake-offs on a quarterly basis to
ensure that this is the case.
The problem with wireless networks is that multiple standards are available.
For the most part, interoperability between different devices within a stan-
dard can be taken for granted, but deciding on a particular standard can be
difficult, especially if you haven’t spent a lot of time researching wireless net-
working technologies. An even bigger issue is that the newest of these stan-
dards (called 802.11n) is still under development but many vendors aren’t
waiting for the standard to be finalized before they begin selling 802.11n gear.
In this section, we talk in depth about the standards and how they might
affect your decisions.
All the systems we’re about to discuss fall under the general category of Wi-
Fi, which is the industry term for wireless networks tested for interoperabil-
ity between and among vendors using the IEEE 802.11 standards for wireless
networking equipment. A given piece of gear is Wi-Fi certified by the Wi-Fi
Alliance (www.wifialliance.com/), which is an industry group formed to
develop standards and test gear to assure its interoperability. If you buy Wi-Fi
certified wireless networking gear (and you shouldn’t buy anything that’s not
Wi-Fi certified!), you can be assured that it will work with other Wi-Fi certified
gear using the same 802.11 standard regardless of which company made it.
As you begin your Wi-Fi journey, you might find gear using the following
802.11 standards available (or soon to be available) in your favorite brick-
and-mortar or online store:
 802.11b: This was the first widely available LAN technology on the
market. Tens of millions of 802.11b devices were sold in the first half of
this decade, and many millions of them are still in use — a few vendors
still ship 802.11b equipment, but for the most part 802.11b gear is no
longer manufactured. Here’s the technical detail we know you’re waiting
for: 802.11b uses the 2.4-GHz radio spectrum (we discuss the radio spec-
trum in Chapter 11) and can deliver a maximum of 11 Mbps of shared
bandwidth to the devices in your home that are connected to the wire-
less network.
 802.11a: In a textbook example of the weirdness of standards naming,
802.11a is a newer technology than 802.11b. 802.11a uses a higher-
frequency chunk of the radio spectrum than 802.11b (5 GHz instead of
2.4 GHz). The big advantage of 802.11a is that this higher-frequency
spectrum is much less crowded with phones, microwaves, and other
wireless LAN systems, so it can work better in an environment where
802.11b or g face too much interference. With a maximum speed of 54
Mbps, 802.11a is potentially much faster than 802.11b. Because 802.11a
275
Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN

uses a different frequency (and has other differences in the way the
signal is encoded and sent out over the radio) than 802.11b, the two are
not compatible. That means if you want to move to 802.11a, you have to
junk your 802.11b gear (or use it elsewhere in your network).
Because 802.11a isn’t all that popular (compared to 802.11g, discussed
next), most 802.11a gear is dual-mode 802.11a and 802.11g in the same
device. This gives the user the flexibility to connect to the more common
802.11g (or even 802.11b) networks and still take advantage of 802.11a
where appropriate.
 802.11g: 802.11g is the most commonly used Wi-Fi standard and uses the
same 2.4-GHz frequency spectrum as 802.11b. 802.11g is backwardly
compatible with 802.11b, meaning it will work with any 802.11b system
on the market, dropping to the lower 802.11b speeds when interworking
with those devices. 802.11g gear won’t work with 802.11a systems. So
what’s the big deal? When 802.11g systems work with each other,
instead of with an 802.11b system, they’re more than twice as fast, with a
maximum bandwidth of 54 Mbps (the same as 802.11a).
Most Wi-Fi gear on the market today, both the networking hardware
itself and the network interface cards (NICs) built into new computers
and laptops, will use the 802.11g standard.
 802.11n: 802.11g is the current Wi-Fi standard, and 802.11n is the next
standard. The 802.11n standard is (in early 2007) considered to be a draft
standard. This means that everybody in the industry has pretty much
agreed on the technical specifications for 802.11n, but they’ve not quite
dotted all the i’s and crossed all the t’s. 802.11n can use either the 2.4-
GHz or 5-GHz frequency spectrum and improves upon 802.11g and
802.11a by using a technology called MIMO (multiple inputs, multiple
outputs). MIMO technology allows the use of multiple receiving and
transmitting antennas to improve both throughput (speed) and range.
As we mention earlier in this section, many vendors are currently selling
what they are calling pre-802.11n gear, which conforms to the draft stan-
dard but which may not completely meet all of the final standard’s tech-
nical specifications. (Because they’ve not been finalized, no one knows
exactly what they will be.) 802.11n provides a big jump in performance
(speeds of over 100 Mbps) and will be backward compatible with
802.11b, a, and g (although at lower speeds than 100 Mbps). See the sec-
tion titled “Is it time for N?” for more on 802.11n.
Got all that straight? Ready for your wireless LAN pop quiz? Don’t worry. 
We won’t do that to you. But what we will do is give you the handy little 
Table 16-1 to summarize what we just talked about.

Right now, 802.11g is by far the most available and widely used wireless LAN
standard. It’s also the cheapest (about $50 for an access point or router, plus
typically less than $20 per computer — and it’s built into almost every new
laptop and many desktop PCs as well). Many offices have Wi-Fi networks, 
and thousands of hotels, airports, cafes, and other public spaces have Wi-Fi
networks in place where you can get online wirelessly, and 802.11g will get
you on to any of them.
277
Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN
A word about Wi-Fi speeds
The speeds listed in Table 16-1 are the theoret-
ical maximum speeds of a given Wi-Fi technol-
ogy. Real world speeds differ significantly from
these maximums due to a number of factors
including interference from other radio systems
and distance from the base station. (Wi-Fi
speeds drop off at longer distances.)
Also significant is something known as over-
head. The theoretical maximum rates measure
the number of bits of data that can pass over the
network per second. These bits are not all
usable bits that represent the data or voice sig-
nals or video you are carrying over your wire-
less network. Instead, some of these bits are
part of the 802.11 signaling protocols. (That is,
some of the data going across the wireless link
is used by the wireless system itself to make the
connection, encrypt the data, and direct traffic.)
Other overhead is related to the networking pro-
tocols you are using, such as Ethernet and TCP-
IP (the Internet protocol), both of which use
some of your data throughput for their own 
signaling.
When you subtract the overhead, the true
effective bandwidth of a Wi-Fi system is about
half (or less) than the theoretical maximum. So
today’s common 802.11g systems, which theo-
retically pass data at a speed of 54 Mbps, actu-
ally give you a usable bandwidth of about 22
Mbps. For most purposes this isn’t a big deal (22
Mbps is faster than almost all broadband
Internet connections, for example), but for
applications such as high-definition video,
which can use 22 Mbps all by itself, you start
understanding the need for faster Wi-Fi systems
such as 802.11n.

Products that are Wi-Fi certified have a logo on the box saying as much. This
testing and certification process means that these devices not only meet cer-
tain technical requirements but also can connect to Wi-Fi products from
other vendors (using the same 802.11 standard). For example, an 802.11g
product will have a logo like the one shown in Figure 16-1, saying “Wi-Fi
Certified b g” (both b and g are listed, because all 802.11g gear is backward
compatible on b networks). If the logo is not on the box, don’t be surprised if
the product doesn’t work in a mixed-vendor network. You can find a list of
certified products on the following Wi-Fi Web page:
certifications.wi-fi.org/wbcs_certified_products.php
Right now, there are no Wi-Fi certified 802.11n products. There are pre-n
products that are Wi-Fi certified, but that certification is for the 802.11g func-
tionality within the pre-n products, not for the 802.11n functionality. The Wi-
Fi Alliance hasn’t started a certification process for 802.11n yet, so you will
have no true guarantee that a pre-n product you buy will work with every
other 802.11n product in the future.
Is it time for N?
802.11n has been cooking in the labs for years. We’ve had pre-n gear in our
home networks for over two years (it works great, by the way), and as we
inch towards the finalization of the standard, more and more manufacturers
are beginning to slap the n label on their new gear. So that leads to the ques-
tion: Does it make sense to buy 802.11n gear now? Our answer is qualified
because it depends on your willingness to take a risk. The 802.11n draft stan-
dard is very complete and is widely accepted (during the last vote on the
draft standard, about 98 percent of the voters — representatives of the net-
working and semiconductor industries — approved the standard as is).
Because of this high degree of support, we suspect that there won’t be a lot
of change in the 802.11n standard when it is (finally!) finalized.
And manufacturers seem to agree. For example, Dell and Apple have been
shipping laptop computers with 802.11n-ready network adapters since mid-
2006. And networking vendors themselves, as mentioned, have been doing so
for more than a year.
There’s a but here though. The IEEE standards mean a lot, but when it comes
down to working through the minutia of interoperability (where a network
adapter from vendor A works with an access point from vendors B through
Z), sometimes some hidden gotchas don’t get worked out until the testing
process is well underway. This is why the Wi-Fi Alliance isn’t certifying
802.11n gear yet.
278
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

So what to do? Well if you can wait (perhaps you have some old 802.11g gear
laying around), wait. If you can’t wait or don’t want to wait, look for a vendor
who offers an upgradeability guarantee. Many vendors will provide this (“buy
my pre-n gear now, and we’ll give you a software upgrade to make it 802.11n
certified or your money back”), and it reduces your risk.
And if you’re a risk taker (like us)? Go for it. 802.11n routers and access
points are relatively cheap ($150 max, in most cases), and they are certified
for 802.11g network connections. Stick with one vendor if at all possible —
and if you can’t, do some research online and stick with one chip vendor.
Only a few companies make the 802.11n chips inside the gear, and if all your
gear has the same chip, it should work well regardless of vendor.
Back to base(ics)
Regardless of the underlying wireless protocol or technology, wireless LANs
share a few common elements, the most important of which is the base sta-
tion or access point. If you think of your wireless network in the same way
that you think of the wired LANs we discuss in Chapter 15 — in terms of
having a hub and spokes — the access point is the hub of your wireless net-
work. A wireless access point is usually a stand-alone, purpose-built device,
but there you can implement a wireless hub for your network in several ways:
 Buy a wireless-only base station (an access point, or AP): These
devices, which you can buy from a host of vendors (NETGEAR, Linksys,
Apple, and D-Link are just a few), connect through a wired Ethernet con-
nection to your home LAN or directly into your router, broadband DSL,
or cable modem. The access point distributes Internet or local network
traffic among all the wireless endpoints on the network (PCs, laptops,
PDAs, Wi-Fi phones, and more).
 Buy a base station and home router combo device: Many of the home
routers we discuss in Chapters 13 and 15 are available with built-in wire-
less base stations. Because they have both wireless and wired outputs
(usually a multiport Ethernet switch), you can connect these devices
directly to your broadband modem and use them as the central hub for
your entire LAN, connecting both wired and wireless computers.
 Use a computer as a base station: With some operating systems (Mac
OS X and Windows XP and Vista), you can replace the hardware base
station with a dedicated PC. In this scenario, a broadband modem is
connected to an Ethernet port on the base station computer, and then
the computer is set up to share the Internet connection over an installed
wireless network card. (This is really just a wireless version of the
Internet-sharing proxy server concept we discuss in Chapter 14.)
279
Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN

Out of these three options, we think that the hardware-based approaches
(first and second) make the most sense, unless you have a dedicated home
server with wireless-LAN functionality bundled in. You’d have to try really
hard to spend more than $200 for a wireless access point or router, and we’ve
seen them advertised for well below $40. Using a computer as the base sta-
tion means that you’ll need to have that computer running all the time — and
you’ll probably take a performance hit if you use that PC for other things.
In the NIC of time
Just as computers need network interface cards (NICs) to connect to a wired
LAN, they need wireless NICs to connect to a wireless LAN. Wireless NICs, or
wireless LAN cards (as they’re often called), either plug into a slot in your
computer or sit next to it on the desktop and plug into a USB connector on
your computer. Four main types of NICs are on the market:
 PC Card NICs: These are probably the most common — because they’re
designed for mobile computers, and mobile computers are the most
likely candidates for a wireless network. The PC Card is about the size of
a thick credit card, with a small antenna module on the end, and fits into
the PC Card (sometimes called CardBus) slot of a laptop or handheld
computer.
The PC Card is slowly being replaced by the PCI Express Mini Card,
which is a faster and smaller system that a few laptop vendors have
begun supporting (for example, Apple includes only a Mini Card slot on
its high-end MacBook Pro laptops).
 PCI Card NICs: For desktop computers that don’t have a PC Card, there
are wireless LAN cards that fit into an internal PCI slot (the same slots
used for many wired Ethernet NICs or for video cards). If you use a PCI
Card NIC, you still need an external antenna (which will come in the
package), so everything won’t be all neat and hidden inside your PC.
 USB external NIC: A better alternative for desktop computers is an
external NIC that connects through a USB port. Virtually every computer
made since 1999 has USB ports, and the external NIC requires no real
installation — just plug it in and load the software driver.
 Built-in (embedded) wireless NIC: In the laptop and PDA world, built-
in Wi-Fi NICs are increasingly common. There’s nothing for you to do
here — just turn on the computer and connect to the network. Because
the NIC is built in, you can keep your PC Card slots free for other 
peripherals.

Battening down the hatches
The biggest advantage of wireless networks — the fact that you can connect
to the network just about anywhere in range of the base station (up to 300
feet) — is also the biggest disadvantage. Because the signal is carried over
the air, on radio waves, anyone else within range can pick up your network’s
signals too. It’s sort of like putting an extra RJ-45 jack for your wired LAN out
281
Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN
What fits into a Wi-Fi network?
Although we focus on computers in this chap-
ter, they are far from the only devices that can fit
into a Wi-Fi wireless network. In fact, Wi-Fi
capabilities are being built into all sorts of
devices, greatly increasing the usefulness of
your wireless network and allowing you to
incorporate your wireless network into other
networks in your home (such as your audio/
video network or phone networks). Among the
devices you can find Wi-Fi in are the following:
 Gaming consoles: All current gaming con-
soles we discuss in Chapter 5 — Nintendo’s
Wii, Microsoft’s Xbox 360, and Sony’s
PlayStation 3 — can connect to your wire-
less network (using embedded Wi-Fi or
inexpensive Wi-Fi adapters that connect
to a USB port on the console). Using these
Wi-Fi connections, you can download pic-
tures or music to your console, play videos,
surf the Web and — most fun of all — 
participate in online head-to-head or multi-
player games.
 Digital media adapters: These devices (dis-
cussed in Chapter 9), provide a bridge
between your PCs and your audio/video
networks and systems and allow you to
listen to digital music, watch videos, and
display digital photos stored on your com-
puter anywhere in the home.
 VoIP and Skype phones: Wi-Fi phones (dis-
cussed in Chapter 11) provide a portable
connection to VoIP services (such as
Vonage or Skype), so you can call regular
phones anywhere in the world over your
broadband Internet connection.
 PC peripherals: A growing number of PC
peripheral devices such as printers, scan-
ners, and network storage devices (all dis-
cussed in Chapter 12) include embedded
Wi-Fi network adapters so you can access
them from anywhere in your home — and
you can put them anywhere in your home,
rather than having them located next to
your computer. Pat, for example, uses a
wireless printer that he can hide in a closet,
rather than have it take up valuable shelf
space in his overcrowded home office.
You can even add Wi-Fi to any Ethernet-enabled
device by buying a Wi-Fi Ethernet bridge. This
simple device has a Wi-Fi radio and an Ethernet
port. When you plug it into a power source and
your Ethernet-equipped device, it acts as a Wi-
Fi client on the network; any data flowing into
and out of the bridge is translated from Wi-Fi to
Ethernet (or vice versa). Most Wi-Fi manufac-
turers (such as Linksys, D-Link, Belkin, and NET-
GEAR) sell these bridges; they’re sometimes
called gaming bridges because the most
common use is for connecting gaming consoles
that don’t have Wi-Fi (such as the previous gen-
eration of Xbox and PlayStation).

on the sidewalk in front of your house — you’re no longer in control of who
can access it. So securing a wireless network takes a bit more work. To make
matters worse, if you’ve spent any time reading computer industry publica-
tions, you may have heard about the weaknesses in wireless-network security
systems. The bottom line is this: If someone is dedicated and motivated
enough, they can get onto your wireless LAN. The flip side of this coin, how-
ever, is that the chances of someone targeting your LAN and breaking in are
slim. They need to be within a reasonable distance to be able to receive the
radio signal, and then they need to have the skills, equipment, and interest to
break in. Not too likely, we think.
That doesn’t mean that you should leave your wireless LAN wide open for
any and all comers — unless you want to (we talk about some reasons why
people do this in the “Opening up to your neighbors” sidebar). You can take
the following steps to secure a wireless LAN. Note that these steps vary from
system to system, so we give only general instructions:
 At a bare minimum, turn on WEP: WEP (wired equivalent privacy) is the
security system built into all Wi-Fi systems. It encrypts all data flowing
between the access points and computers on the network. This encryp-
tion basically uses a mathematical function to make the data flowing
across the network look like a bunch of random numbers to someone
who doesn’t have authenticated access to the network. We say WEP is a
minimum step because the WEP protocol itself is easy to crack. Anyone
can download software from the Internet, listen in on a wireless network,
and use the software to figure out the WEP key. After they have the key,
they’re able to log right into your network and intercept all of your data.
 For true security, use WPA: The folks at the Wi-Fi Alliance were well
aware of the shortcomings of WEP and developed (along with the folks 
at the IEEE who develop the 802.11 standards) a new generation of 
Wi-Fi security called WPA (Wi-Fi protected access). WPA offers a much
improved mechanism for encrypting data; although no system is fool-
proof, WPA is pretty darn close. There are multiple variants of WPA,
including some designed for business networks (called WPA Enterprise). If
your equipment supports WPA2 (the newest version, with the strongest
encryption system), you should use it. It will keep your network safe.
 Use a decent password: This is probably the number one complaint we
hear from IT folks running corporate networks. People use easy-to-
remember passwords because it’s a pain remembering an obscure one.
But if it’s easy for you to remember, it’s easy for someone else to guess.
Use alphanumeric combinations (numbers and letters together).
Many wireless access points ship with all these security settings turned off
by default. If you want to be secure, turn them on.
282
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

Some folks provide other security recommendations that aren’t that effective
(we’ve been guilty of this in the past ourselves). Specifically, you’ll hear rec-
ommendations to “hide” your network by turning off the base station’s broad-
cast of your network’s SSID (Service Set Identifier) — the “name” of your
network. Although this might keep honest folks off your network, it won’t do
a thing to keep a malicious user off because they can download dozens of
tools that will find your network even with SSID broadcast turned off. An
additional bit of not-so-effective advice is creating a closed network that
allows only specific MAC addresses to connect to your network. (The MAC
address is a unique alphanumeric ID assigned to each NIC ever created.) This
sounds like a great idea (only allow your own MACs to connect to the net-
work), but it’s simple for a malicious user to clone one of your MACs and get
around this roadblock. To secure your wireless network, turn on encryption,
preferably WPA or WPA2. Don’t bother with these other steps, because they
will simply give you a false sense of security.
Putting together a wireless LAN
Putting together a wireless LAN is simple because you don’t have to spend
any time running new wires or punching down UTP cables. If your house isn’t
too big, just plug the access point into your broadband modem or into an
283
Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN
Opening up to your neighbors
We’re not talking about group therapy or wild hot
tub parties. Wireless networks can carry through
walls, across yards, and potentially around the
neighborhood. Although wireless LANs were
designed from the start for in-building use, the
technology can be used in outdoors settings. For
example, most college campuses are now wired
with dozens or hundreds of wireless access
points so that students, staff, and professors can
access the Internet from just about anywhere on
campus. At UC San Diego, where Pat’s wife
works, freshmen are outfitted with wireless
PDAs and can schedule classes, send e-mails
and instant messages, and even find their friends
at the student center (using a locator program
written by a student). Many folks are adapting
this concept and setting up community wireless
LANs.
Some creators of these community LANs have
taken the openness of the Internet to heart and
have opened up their access points to any and
all takers. There’s even an Internet subculture
with Web sites and chalk markings on side-
walks identifying these open access points. In
other areas, where broadband access is
scarce, neighbors pool money to buy a T1 or
other business-class high-speed Internet line
and then share it wirelessly.
We think that both of these concepts make a lot
of sense, but we do have a warning. Many ISPs
don’t like the idea of people sharing an Internet
connection without paying (you may, for exam-
ple, have to pay for a more expensive commer-
cial ISP line). Check your ISP’s terms of service,
or look at the listing of wireless-friendly ISPs on
the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Web page
(www.eff.org).

Ethernet jack fed by your home router, and turn it on! You’ll need to go
through a few additional steps, such as naming your network (the SSID) and
assigning passwords. Keep the following in mind:
 Assigning IP addresses: Every computer (or handheld or whatever)
connected to your wireless network needs to have an IP address to talk
on the Internet. The overall architecture of your network (all wireless,
mixed wired and wireless, and so on) plays a big part in how you do this,
as does the kind of access point you’re using.
• If you have a broadband connection connected to a home router
and LAN (as discussed in Chapter 15), you need to set up your
access point to be a bridge connection. In this case, the router
assigns an IP address to your wireless computers, and the access
point just provides a connection between the wired and wireless
networks (a bridge — get it?). You can plug your access point into
any outlet in your wired network, set it to bridge mode, and start
computing.
• If you’re using a wireless access point incorporated into a router,
the access point is your router. In this case, you will most likely set
up the DHCP functionality of the router (we talk about this in
Chapter 15), and use it to assign IP addresses to your wireless
computers (as well as those attached to your wired LAN).
 Finding a good spot: Wireless LAN signals can travel through walls,
doors, and the like, but some things are not nice to wireless signals. Huge
chunks of metal (think full-sized filing cabinets) or really dense walls
(such as the 18-inch-thick brick walls in Danny’s house in Maine) can kill
the strength of a wireless signal — which either keeps you from connect-
ing or lowers your speed if you do get connected. Most access points
include software that displays how much signal strength you’re getting
and provides tips for placement of the base station. Access points vary a
bit model to model, because they have different antenna systems and the
like. We recommend that you place your access point somewhere in the
middle of the main floor of the house (or the floor on which you’ll be
most often using the wireless network), in a high location. (Pat has
placed his high up on top of a shelf in his home office, after much trial
and error.) Keep the access point away from potentially interfering
devices (such as microwaves, power outlets, TVs, and stereos).
After trying different locations, you might find that you just can’t get by
with a single access point. For example, Danny couldn’t get a signal
upstairs. This situation can be easily resolved if you have a wired net-
work infrastructure; just get a second (inexpensive) access point and
plug it in on a different floor or on the other side of the house. If you
don’t have a wired infrastructure, you may want to try connecting a
remote access point using a phone line or power line technology 
284
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

(discussed later). This works great if you want an access point outside
on the porch or covered patio.
 Securing the network: We recommend that you plug in the network and
find a spot for your access point before you turn on all the security fea-
tures. This is exactly why most access points ship with security turned
off by default — what you might think is a defective access point or an
impenetrable wall is just a mistyped password. So begin with security
features turned off, get the network working and the computers talking
to each other and to the Internet, and then go back and turn on WEP and
do the rest of the security stuff we mentioned.
We put together two diagrams of a wireless network. Figure 16-1 shows a
wireless network added to a wired LAN infrastructure, and Figure 16-2 shows
a wireless-only network.
Extending a wireless LAN with WDS
The folks who have developed Wi-Fi systems are aware that many folks —
particularly those who have bigger homes — run into problems getting Wi-Fi
coverage everywhere in the home. Although Wi-Fi can theoretically extend up
to 300 feet (and even further with the MIMO systems found in 802.11n), the
real world range is usually much shorter, sometimes as little as 50 feet.

Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN

The construction of your home, other radio systems, and even the objects in
your home (such as appliances and furniture) can all conspire to reduce your
Wi-Fi range. One approach to extending your Wi-Fi footprint is to install addi-
tional access points using your wired CAT-5e/6 Ethernet network. This works
well if you have that network, but what if you don’t?
Well that’s where the Wi-Fi engineers were thinking ahead; they developed a
system called WDS (wireless distribution system). WPS allows you to install
additional Wi-Fi repeaters, or extenders, which receive the signal from your
main access point or wireless router and rebroadcast that signal to reach far-
ther into your home.
In a WDS system, you have a main access point (connected to your wired net-
work or directly to your home router and cable/DSL modem) and a remote
access point that extends the signals to your wireless clients (such as a laptop
computer). You can even get sophisticated and install a repeater access point
between the main and remote access points to extend your network even 
farther.
To get into WDS, you need the following:
 A main access point (or wireless router) that supports WDS, such 
as models from Linksys, D-Link, and Apple. You may also be able to
upgrade the firmware (essentially the system software of your access
point) to allow WDS features.

 A remote access point. This can be an identical access point as your
main access point or a stripped-down AP developed for Wi-Fi extension.
 The proper software configuration. You need to configure your APs for
WDS. Using the software or Web configurator built into your APs, you’ll
need to “turn on” WDS. How you do this varies from AP to AP — often it
will be explicitly called WDS, but it may go by another name such as 
Wi-Fi extension or Wi-Fi repeater.
When considering using WDS, keep the following in mind:
 WDS slows your connection. Because WDS is essentially receiving and
then retransmitting your wireless signals, the speed of your network
connections are effectively cut in half. This is no big deal for Web surf-
ing, e-mail, and voice calls, but may be a problem for video.
 WDS isn’t implemented exactly the same way by different vendors. There’s
no Wi-Fi Alliance testing and logo for WDS and no guarantee that, to make
up an example, your Apple AirPort Express will act as a WDS remote AP for
your D-Link router (even though both support WDS). Our advice here is to
stick with a single vendor if you’re going to be messing around with WDS.
But wait — there’s more 
to wireless networks
The technologies we’ve talked about so far in this chapter have been wireless
LAN technologies. There are some complementary wireless technologies
known as wireless PANs, or personal area networks. PANs, the most promi-
nent of which is called Bluetooth, are shorter in range and typically lower in
speed than LANs (which, in turn, have a shorter range than WANs, or wide
area networks, such as the Internet). A LAN is designed to cover an entire
home or business (or at least most of one), but a PAN is designed to connect
devices within a few feet or yards of each other.
Most PANs are covered under the 802.15 standard. The initial version, 802.15.1, 
was adapted from the Bluetooth specification and is fully compatible with
Bluetooth. Other short-range, in-home wireless standards that focus on very
short-range mesh networks to interconnect home devices are on the way.
Following are some uses for PAN technologies:
 Connecting peripherals (such as printers, mice, and keyboards) to a PC
 Connecting a digital audio source (such as an MP3 player) to a wireless
speaker or headphone system
 Connecting handheld computers and PDAs to a desktop computer for
syncing and file transfer
287
Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN

 Connecting PDAs and mobile phones, to share Internet connections or
contact lists
 Connecting voice-enabled PDAs or mobile phones to wireless headsets
or to hands-free systems in cars
The bottom-line distinction between LANs and PANs tends to be blurry. If
something connects to a computer by a network cable today, its wireless 
connection is a LAN. If it connects by a local cable (such as USB), its 
wireless connection is a PAN.
As mentioned, by far the most common PAN technology is Bluetooth. This
isn’t what you get when you eat too many blueberries or blue-dyed Popsicles.
Instead, Bluetooth is a wireless PAN technology developed by big mobile
communications companies (including Nokia and Ericsson) to expand what
their mobile devices could do and to make their devices easier to use. Today,
Bluetooth is controlled by an industry consortium called the Bluetooth SIG
(special interests group) at www.bluetooth.com, which also includes com-
panies such as Microsoft and Intel.
You’re going to ask, so we’ll tell you: Bluetooth is named after Harald Blåtand
(“Bluetooth”), King of Denmark from 940 to 981, who was responsible for unit-
ing Denmark and Norway.
Bluetooth uses the same 2.4-GHz radio spectrum that Wi-Fi LANs use (though
most tests have shown that they don’t interfere with each other too much) and
is designed to be a low-power (good for battery-powered devices) and low-cost
(good for everyone) alternative to a LAN. Bluetooth radios are embedded in
cell phones, PDAs, and laptop computers, as well as a range of peripheral
devices such as headsets and keyboards. Bluetooth has been around since the
late 1990s and took a long time to take off, but the advent of those tiny (and
geeky-looking) Bluetooth headsets and in-car Bluetooth hands-free phone sys-
tems for cell phones has finally made Bluetooth a Very Big Thing.
These days, most new mobile phones include Bluetooth, as do many laptop
computers and a growing number of printers, keyboards, mice, and other PC
peripherals.
A couple of types of Bluetooth systems are on the market:
 Bluetooth 1.1: This is the older, slightly slower variant of Bluetooth,
with a maximum data rate of 721 Kbps.
 Bluetooth 2.0: The current version of Bluetooth, 2.0 adds an EDR
(extended data rate) mode that supports speeds of up to 2.1 Mbps. 
This faster mode comes in handy when you’re using Bluetooth to con-
nect your laptop computer to the Internet through a 3G smartphone.
(See Chapter 13 for more on 3G.)
288
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

Bluetooth 1.1 and 2.0 devices can connect to and talk with each other with no
problems, so you don’t have to worry about mixing and matching Bluetooth
1.1 and 2.0 devices. If you want the higher EDR speeds, however, you need to
ensure that both ends of the connection support Bluetooth 2.0.
Making the Most of Your Phone Lines
Another alternative to using CAT-5e/6 Ethernet cabling or wireless LANs is to
leverage your home’s existing telephone wiring to carry Ethernet data. Phone
line networking (the term for this networking technique) is a relatively mature
technology — the first systems were shipped in the mid-1990s. An industry
group called HomePNA or sometimes HPNA (Home Phoneline Networking
Association — www.homepna.org) provides standards and product certifica-
tion. As of 2007, there were three variants of HomePNA networking systems:
 HomePNA 1.0: This is a slower speed protocol (1.3 Mbps), and is 
essentially obsolete.
 HomePNA 2.0: This is a faster protocol (advertised as 10 Mbps, though
the maximum speed is actually 16 Mbps), which is used in just about
every HomePNA product on the market. HomePNA 2.0 is backwards
compatible with HomePNA 1.0, so newer products can talk to older
ones. The bad news about this backwards compatibility is that having
even one HomePNA 1.0 device connected to your phone lines slows 
all the HomePNA 2.0 devices down to 1.3 Mbps. As we write, a few
HomePNA 2.0 products are still on the market, but the number is 
dwindling as the new HomePNA 3.0 version hits the streets.
 HomePNA 3.0: The current version of HomePNA, now shipping from
several vendors, is HomePNA 3.0. This is HomePNA on steroids, with a
maximum speed of up to 240 Mbps.
Currently, no vendors are offering HomePNA 3.0 gear designed to be sold
directly to consumers. Instead, they are focusing on the IPTV market (see
Chapter 5 for more on IPTV) and are selling HomePNA solutions to phone
companies and IPTV set-top box manufacturers. The goal here is to use
HomePNA over existing phone lines to connect the set-top boxes in your
home. With a HomePNA solution, the phone company can install one big,
high-powered set-top box in your media room or home theater and then use
cheaper remote set-top boxes in other locations. The main set-top box does
the IPTV decoding and then sends your TV programming to the inexpensive
satellite boxes over the phone lines. After HomePNA is installed in the mil-
lions of homes that may potentially become IPTV customers, we expect that
additional devices will be developed to allow you to hop onto the HomePNA
network for more traditional home LAN purposes.
289
Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN

The HomePNA system operates on different frequencies than analog or DSL
telephone services, so you can simultaneously use a single phone line for
your computer LAN and for all the other things you currently use it for —
such as making phone calls, sending and receiving faxes, or connecting to 
the Internet.
Powering Your Network
Using electrical power lines for something more than sending juice to your
appliances is not a new concept. If you read Chapter 19, for example, you
know all about X10, LonWorks, and Insteon — home-automation protocols
that use electrical wires to send control signals to lights, appliances, and
more. For decades, people have been using X10 and other low-speed power
line networking systems, but attempts to use power lines for high-speed 
networking have largely failed. In 2002, a bunch of networking companies
(including Linksys, NETGEAR, and D-Link) began releasing high-speed power
line networking products based on a system known as HomePlug.
To set up a LAN in your home under the HomePlug specification, you use a
HomePlug-supporting device that runs an Ethernet cable to your computer
and an electrical cord to the electrical outlet. That electrical cord is your LAN
connection — along with all the rest of the electrical cabling in your house.
Cool, huh?
290
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 
I’ll have a MoCA please
In the IPTV world, the biggest competitor to
HomePNA 3.0 is a technology called MoCA
(multimedia over coax — www.mocaliance.
org). MoCA uses the coaxial cables that carry
TV signals around the home as its media for
high-speed Ethernet connectivity. MoCA can
carry data at speeds exceeding 100 Mbps. Like
HomePNA, MoCA technology isn’t something
you can go out and buy off the shelf. Instead, it
is embedded into set-top boxes for TV services
and is primarily used to send TV signals to remote
set-top boxes from an Internet-connected main
IPTV set-top box.
The company behind MoCA’s technology,
Entropic Communications (www.entropic.
com) sells the same technology as an Internet
access system as well as a home-networking
system. Many high-rises and apartment and
condo complexes are wired to the gills with
coaxial cable but don’t have CAT-5e/6 cabling
for Internet access. Service providers can use
(and are using, particularly in Asian markets)
the coax and Entropic’s technology to provide
Internet service to each unit in the complex or
building, without having to rewire.

Like the HomePNA group, HomePlug is an industry consortium designed to
develop standards and promote products using HomePlug technology.
Development of the HomePlug standard took several years, mainly because
networking on power lines is a technically challenging task. Power lines are
noisy, electrically speaking, with surges in voltage level and electrical inter-
ferences introduced by all sorts of devices both within and external to the
home. The state of the electrical network in a home is constantly changing as
well, as devices are plugged in and turned on. Because of this, the HomePlug
standard adopts a sophisticated and adaptive signal-processing algorithm —
the technique used to convert data into electrical signals on the power
wiring. Because HomePlug uses higher-frequency signals than low-speed
power line communications systems such as X10, the technology can avoid
some of the most common sources of noise on the power line.
Following are the three variants of HomePlug devices:
 HomePlug 1.0: The initial HomePlug standard, HomePlug 1.0 devices
provide connections at a maximum speed of 14 Mbps.
 HomePlug Turbo: Not actually an official HomePlug standard, HomePlug
Turbo uses a proprietary chip that allows faster connections — up to 85
Mbps.
 HomePlug AV: The current version of HomePlug, HomePlug AV can 
provide speeds of up to 200 Mbps across your home’s power lines.
HomePlug AV is still basically brand new as we write in early 2007 — the
first 14 products were certified in January 2007.
Like most home-networking systems, HomePlug advertises itself based on
maximum theoretical speeds. Real world speeds are lower, due to both over-
head and the vagaries of the power lines themselves. You should expect
actual throughputs of no more than half the rated maximum speeds. This
isn’t that big of a deal with HomePlug AV, but tends to make HomePlug 1.0
and even Turbo devices less than ideal for high-bandwidth network applica-
tions such as video. There’s a reason HomePlug AV has AV (audio/video) in
the name!
Besides the speed, there are a few other neat things to consider about
HomePlug-based networking systems:
 Power outlets are the most common and ubiquitous jacks in the home.
Even if you heavily wire your home with CAT-5e/6 cabling for an Ethernet
network, chances are you won’t have more than two LAN jacks in the
majority of rooms in your house. With HomePlug, every one of the
dozens or even hundreds of power outlets in the house becomes a data-
networking jack.
291
Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN

 HomePlug can be built right into many networked appliances. The
almost legendary Internet refrigerator that we’ve discussed in several
places in this book is a cool concept, but even we don’t have a CAT-5e/6
outlet in the dark nook behind our fridges. We do have a power jack, and
so do you.
 HomePlug automatically crosses phases in your electrical system. (The
majority of homes have two-phase electrical power — where the 220-
volt power line coming into your house is split into separate 110-volt
phases or circuits.) As we discuss in Chapter 21, systems such as X10
may require a bridge device installed in the main electrical panel so that
different parts of your electrical system can see each other and so that
signals can reach all parts of your home. Because of the higher frequen-
cies that HomePlug uses, it can cross these phases without a bridging
device.
 HomePlug can reach beyond the limits of your home (and at lower signal
levels) right into your neighbor’s house. Although the signal levels are
attenuated at longer distances, you could use HomePlug to create a 
community network with your neighbors, like the ones we describe in
the “Opening up to your neighbors” sidebar. This works as long as you
share the same power transformer with your neighbors as well as your
encryption key, so it might not be the best thing to do.
 HomePlug has a built-in encryption system. Because HomePlug can
reach beyond your house and you may not want to share your LAN with
your neighbors, you can turn on HomePlug’s encryption. In that way,
only devices that have your password can be on the network.
Like the wireless systems we described previously, most HomePlug sys-
tems come with encryption turned off by default, or use a default pass-
word that anyone with Internet access can find on the manufacturer’s
Web site. We recommend that you get your network up and running first,
and turn on encryption (with a new, strong password) after you’ve
proven to yourself that your network is working.
 HomePlug is compatible with other power line communications sys-
tems. Because it operates on such high frequencies, HomePlug doesn’t
interfere with X10 and other low-speed power line systems, so you can
use your LAN and your home-automation system at the same time.
HomePlug products are available in a variety of devices — you can buy
HomePlug routers and switches (which often include wired Ethernet ports as
well). As we write this, there aren’t any HomePlug NICs. Instead, the most
common application for HomePlug is Ethernet or USB bridges. These devices
look and act a lot like the external USB Wi-Fi NICs we discussed earlier. You’ll
need two of them: one to connect to an Ethernet port on your router (or any
LAN jack in your home) and another to plug into the wall outlet where you
need LAN access.
292
Part IV: Livin’ Off the Fat of the LAN 

The bridge typically has a power cord on one side of the box and an Ethernet
or USB connector on the other. Plug the power cord into any wall outlet, and
plug the Ethernet or USB into the computer or other networked devices, and
you have a connection. Pat has been using a NETGEAR power line Ethernet
bridge like this for a spot in his house that has neither Ethernet nor good
wireless coverage — and he loves it. Danny has a NETGEAR bridge connect-
ing his office (where the cable modem is) to the kids computing area (where
all the screaming is). Figure 16-3 shows a typical use of HomePlug bridges.
Another interesting use of HomePlug is in the Wi-Fi extension arena. Several
manufacturers (most notably NETGEAR — www.netgear.com) sell HomePlug
Wi-Fi access points. These devices connect to a HomePlug-equipped home
router (or to a HomePlug Ethernet bridge connected to an existing router) and
provide a local Wi-Fi signal in whatever room they’re plugged into.
We think power line networking through HomePlug is great, but we probably
would never use it to replace our wired networks or even our wireless LANs.
But HomePlug is quick, cheap (bridges cost about $80 a piece, with prices
dropping rapidly), and perfect for spots you never thought you’d need to wire.

Chapter 16: Alternatives to a Wired Data LAN

We hinted at this already, but let’s just come right out and say it. We think
HomePlug will have a huge effect in the noncomputer market — stereos, TVs,
gaming machines, Internet fridges, and other pieces of electronic equipment
that might benefit from an Internet connection. And as HomePlug becomes
incorporated into new generations of appliances, you’ll need just the power
cord to make it work.
Mixing and Matching
Although many vendors will try to push you into one solution (“You need 
Wi-Fi,” “No, you need HomePlug”), you might find that these various no-new-
wires networks can complement each other. You know that we think a wired
CAT-5e/6 network should be the basis of your computer-LAN infrastructure
(and phone network, and maybe even your audio and video network), but we
think also that all four of these technologies can be used in concert when you
build a whole-home network.
Just for fun, here are a few examples:
 Build a wired Ethernet LAN, but plug a Wi-Fi access point in your living
room for cordless sofa-based Web surfing.
 Use Wi-Fi as the basis for your home-computer LAN, but use HomePlug
or HomePNA (or SercoNet’s phone line solution) to extend your network
to access points in distant locations out of reach of your primary base
station (such as by the pool).
 Use wired Ethernet for your computers, but use a HomePlug AV system
to connect your Xbox to the broadband Internet connection for online
gaming.
We could keep this list going and going, but we think you get the picture.
Think creatively, and use wired and unwired technologies together to get
your LAN wherever you need it to go.

M
ost people are familiar with some of the core con-
cepts of home security and safety. Smoke detec-
tors, fire extinguishers, and shrieking alarms tend to come
to mind, but a smart-home security system is much much
more.
In this part, we talk about how to protect and prevent. We
introduce you to a home-security infrastructure that goes
beyond just setting off an alarm when someone opens a
door. We tell you about sensors galore that not only run
your home-security subsystem but also lay a foundation
for later use in your home-automation environment. We
also tell you about how some security services can utilize
a broadband Internet service to make your home-monitoring
system more interactive.

ven though you have to plan for all sorts of scary disasters — robbery,
fire, carbon-dioxide poisoning, floods, and so on — you don’t need to be
afraid of your alarm system. You may find that your alarm system is one of
the more fun systems to plan because you can do so much with sensors and
control panels. For example, you can configure an alarm system to detect
when someone is standing on your front doormat and have the system turn
on a light or even call you at work and let you know that you have a visitor.
An alarm system should fit your style and tastes. The system design should
work around your daily schedule, your kids and pets (if you have any), and
the overall way you live your life. For instance, the design should take into
consideration whether you have valuable possessions in your home — a
stash of jewelry, mattress money, gold, silver, baseball cards, or a wine cellar.
The system can also contain a medical alert capability if you have the need
for one or a pool alarm if young people live in the house. A smart-home alarm
system simply reflects you.
Security systems entail a great deal of planning to make sure that you literally
cover every angle. Just one glaring hole in your system makes you vulnera-
ble. Still, the security component of your home network is probably one of
the easiest to understand and plan because it’s familiar and intuitive. And,
because you’ll likely have someone else wire your security system, you have
to only think about where all those sensors need to be.

In this chapter, we show you how to batten down the hatches on security.
Specifically, we describe what security systems can do for you and how they
work. We also talk about the components that make up a security system and
how they sense conditions that might be cause for alarm.
Deciding That You Need 
a Security System
People install security systems for three main reasons:
 To protect their home when they aren’t around
 To protect their home when they are around
 To protect both their home and its occupants — different sensors and
sensor arrangements are necessary to protect your home and to protect
occupants, and many people want both
Protecting your house when you’re not home typically serves as a baseline
goal. If this goal is your only concern, you can take the minimalist approach —
apply contact sensors on the doors, install a few passive infrared scanners on
the interior of the house, and throw in a siren and control panel.
To protect your house when you are at home requires a more intense
approach. Beyond what we just described, you have more to cover, espe-
cially the windows on the basement and first-floor levels. Security experts
have determined that nearly 90 percent of break-ins involve a door. That is to
say, 90 percent of the time, the burglar either enters or leaves the house
using a door. When all you want to do is determine that a break-in has
occurred, a simple perimeter defense like we just described is considered
adequate. If you want a more thorough system that can detect the presence
of an intruder and immediately sound an alarm, you need additional sensors.
You may want to consider glass-breakage detectors along with contacts 
(contacts only detect whether a window has been opened, but glass-breakage
detectors can tell whether someone has smashed a window). If you don’t want
to see the devices for cosmetic reasons, you can install stress detectors —
which are mounted to support beams under the floor and can register an indi-
vidual’s weight and activate the alarm. Stress detectors are often used in his-
toric homes. You can also add other sensors, as we discuss in the “You fill up
my sensors” section.

Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security

Security Basics
Before you head out shopping for a security system, you should know what
these systems are designed to do. A smart-home security system has at least
three goals:
 Detection: Your system should be capable of sounding an alarm when
something triggers a sensor (though you may choose not to sound an
alarm for certain types of events).
 Emergency response: Your system should be able to call for appropriate
help, depending on the circumstances.
 Prevention: Your system should help prevent problems — such as scar-
ing away potential intruders by automatically turning on outside lights
at night. Well-built doors and windows and quality locks help determine
whether a criminal attempts to break into a home, whether or not you
have an alarm. Bringing prevention into the equation means connecting
your security system with your home-automation system (see Part VI).
Your alarm system accomplishes its goals in three steps:
 Input: The system can’t act if it isn’t aware of a problem. The sensors in
your system alert your security subsystem when something deserves
attention.
 Processing: Something has to interpret these inputs to determine
whether the system needs to do something. Your security system is con-
stantly analyzing real-time inputs from all its tethered sensors, monitor-
ing the status of your home’s health.
 Output: After your subsystem decides what to do, it reaches out and
runs through its preprogrammed checklist of to-do items. Sirens, flash-
ing lights, silent alarms, and more are possible with a smart system.
Although every manufacturer has variations on the pieces and parts that
make up a security system, your system should include at least the following
basics:
 A control panel
 A keypad and corresponding key
 Basic sensors, such as an inside motion detector, door and window 
contact sensors, glass-breakage detectors, and a smoke alarm
 A siren or flashing strobe light
You should also link the system to a central monitoring station (a security
company, in other words) for around-the-clock coverage.
299
Chapter 17: Home Security Boot Camp

Getting control of your security panel
You usually find the control panel — your security system’s brain — in your
home’s wiring closet. This room also houses your telephone and home-
automation subsystems. The control panel is basically an electronic box that
serves as the core interconnection point for all the wiring (and wireless con-
nections) in your subsystem. A sophisticated control panel has outputs that
allow you to interface with X10, Z-Wave, or ZigBee home-automation systems
(which we talk about in more detail in Chapters 19 and 20) to control lights,
for instance, and with RS-232 serial ports for more proprietary and custom-
programmed automation systems. The control panel also has ports for inter-
facing with telephone systems. In addition, the control panel has an internal
battery for battery backup in case of a power failure.
Control pads range in size — some are the size of a telephone keypad, and
others utilize several separate boxes mounted out of sight. In small systems
that require only one keypad (perhaps for a small apartment), the keypad
and control panel are often integrated into one unit.
Don’t panic — use your keypad!
You can use different systems to activate and deactivate your security
system. The most common interfaces for residential applications are 
keypads, which resemble telephone keypads, and key switches, which take a
physical key. The majority of new installations use keypads because they
offer a lot of flexibility.
Most people use a four- to five-digit code to activate and deactivate their
alarm system and to gain entry for maintenance. Different systems record
this activity in different ways. Higher-end systems track which codes are
entered at which times; lower-end ones merely record that the system was
activated or deactivated on a particular date and time.
You can also program your system directly from the keypad. A quick glance
at the keypad’s status display immediately tells you whether your system is
armed, ready-to-arm, and so on (for example, if you’ve disabled sensors in a
certain zone). You can change your system pass codes at any time, giving
additional users temporary entrance. For instance, you can give out-of-town
guests temporary codes that are automatically erased when you return.
If something triggers one of the sensors, the system has many options,
including sounding the alarm, notifying remote monitoring services, paging
you, or calling you on the phone and alerting you to the problem. The most
common quickly activate an audible panic alarm, fire alarm, or medical 
emergency alarm.

Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security

Some alarm systems have a module that turns any Touch-Tone phone into a
fully functional keypad. This saves you money because you don’t have to dis-
tribute wired keypads all over the house. And if you’re on vacation, you can
check the status of your system for greater peace of mind. You can also dial
in and activate the system if you forgot to turn it on when you left.
You fill up my sensors
You can use all sorts of sensors and detectors to drive your security system.
And although some security-system purists try to make a strong technical dif-
ferentiation between sensors and detectors, everyone that we know uses the
terms interchangeably.
Sensors are the central part of your security architecture because your secu-
rity subsystem operates solely on the inputs of the sensors — it can’t act on
something that it can’t sense. You can surmise what most detectors do, so we
won’t take up your time detailing how each one works. Later in this section,
however, we cover the main sensors you’re likely to encounter in a base
system: contact sensors, passive infrared sensors, and smoke detectors.
You can use the following sensors in your smart home:
 Break sensor: Mounted near windows to detect the specific high-
frequency sounds of glass being shattered
 Carbon monoxide detector: Used inside a home to detect hazardous
levels of CO gas
 Contact sensor: Mounted in doors and windows to detect when doors
and windows are opened or closed
 Flood sensor: Mounted in basements or other flood-prone spaces, often
used to trigger sump pumps
 Freeze sensor: Mounted outside to detect freezing temperatures for
plant protection
 Gas detector: Detects the presence of gas fumes
 Heat detector: Part of a smoke- and fire-alarm system, detects high 
temperatures
 Ionization detector: The actual smoke detector in a smoke detector
 Magnetic sensor: A kind of contact sensor, determines when a door or
window is opened
301
Chapter 17: Home Security Boot Camp

 Moisture sensor: Mounted indoors to determine humidity, often used to
trigger air-conditioning or dehumidifier systems
 Motion sensor: Mounted in halls and stairways to detect the movement
of unwanted intruders
 Photoelectric sensor: Shines a beam of light across a hall or doorway to
detect motion (activates when a person walking by interrupts the beam)
 Plunger switch: A contact sensor that uses a small plunger (which looks
like a refrigerator or car door light switch) to determine when a door or
window is opened
 Power status sensor: Detects power outages and then possibly starts a
generator
 Pressure sensor: Often mounted in doormats or under driveways to
detect weight
 Rain sensor: Mounted outdoors to trigger or cancel sprinkler systems
 Smoke detector: Used for fire protection, but smoke detector is a bit of a
misnomer because most include a heat detector
 Snow sensor: Mounted outside to detect snow and then activate, for
example, a heated driveway
 Tamper switch: Mounted in vulnerable areas of alarm systems to sound
in case of tampering
 Temperature sensor: Unsurprisingly, used to detect temperature
 Vibration sensor: Mounted under floors or elsewhere in a home’s 
structure to detect people walking above
 Water disturbance sensor: Used in a swimming pool or hot tub to 
determine when someone or something has entered the water
 Weather sensor: Mounted outside to detect a number of weather 
conditions
Not only do these sensors drive your security system, but many can drive
your home-automation capabilities as well. For instance, you can use the
magnetic detector along your driveway to note that a car has pulled in and
use an infrared motion detector to note when someone walks to the door.
Contact sensors
Some 90 percent of all break-ins involve outside doors — whether going in or
going out. So only 10 percent of the time will someone come in and leave
through windows. Clearly, protection for your doors is probably the single
most important element of security-system planning.
302
Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security

Magnetic switches are one of the most popular ways to protect doors. You
put a magnet on the edge of the door itself and then, with the door closed,
place a switch across from it in the doorjamb. When you open the door, the
magnet loses contact with the switch, causing it to change electric states.
The control panel recognizes this change and, if appropriate, triggers an
alarm or other course of action.
Passive infrared receivers
Passive infrared receivers (PIRs) are another popular security-system item.
These devices see heat in the infrared spectrum. A series of lenses on the
receiver’s cover guide a PIR’s vision (which is fixed in one direction). PIR
technology has been refined to the extent that false alarms are minimal.
You can get different coverage areas by using different lenses on the front of
the PIR. A good security team can further aim or restrict this vision by plac-
ing opaque tape over portions of the lens to reduce the opportunity for false
alarms from roving dogs and other unintended motion.
Many PIRs are pet immune and designed to keep Rover from setting off your
alarm.
PIRs are relatively cheap and small (about the size of a light switch), can
mount on a wall or ceiling inconspicuously, and go a long way toward pro-
tecting your home. The idea with PIRs is to guard your most sensitive areas,
while attempting to catch a criminal early in an intrusion. A PIR covering the
stairway to the second floor is always a great plan — you don’t want the bad
guys to get upstairs. Hallways leading to family rooms where electronics and
saleable items are kept make sense, too.
Many PIRs offer different zones in the sensor’s vision so that you can create
events based on the sequence in which the sensor’s zones are tripped. One of
the neat things about sensors is that you can team them together for unique
303

Prepare to repel boarders!
Security systems work great on burglars — but
did you know that they can protect your toma-
toes too? A smart security system can help 
you with unwanted animals in your yard 
day or night. How about a motion-detector-
based animal repeller that keeps wildlife and
neighbors’ pets out of your garden by spraying 
them with water? One model, the Scarecrow
Water Spraying Animal Repeller by Contech
Electronics Inc. (http://www.contech-inc
.com//), has a range of up to 35 feet with a
spray head adjustable from 10 to 360 degrees.

applications. Because software drives and enables sensors, you can attach
additional detectors, such as active IR beams or magnetic contacts, to trip
only in special combination circumstances.
For instance, with certain manufacturers’ sensors, such as Optex America’s
VX-40A (www.optexamerica.com), you can wire two PIR detectors together
and use different software modes to do different things:
 Set a mode that lets the two PIRs work together to double the size of
your detection area
 Set your PIRs to activate alarms directionally — so they trip an alarm if
they detect a person walking in a certain direction in your home
 Select a sequential mode to generate an alarm only if two detectors 
activate sequentially and separately
You can combine the VX-40A is with a voice-warning feature. When the
system is armed, the voice-warning feature (a weatherproof speaker is inside
the sensor) delivers one of two types of voice messages to anyone entering
the protected area. This warning is designed to deter a would-be intruder
from continuing toward the protected area.
A wireless annunciator system, such as the wireless Voice Alert system from
Cross Point Industries (www.voicealert.com), alerts you with a custom
voice message based on PIRs. You record your own alert messages. It has an
extensive reach — up to 1000 feet in open space and up to 300 feet through
walls. For high-traffic areas, it has a sleep mode that will wait three minutes
before waking up and triggering again, so all your guests arriving at a party
don’t hear, “Hey, thanks for coming!” over and over. The sensor/transmitters
can be used indoors and outside and can notify you of just about anything.
“Alert, Pat’s in the cookie jar!”
Smoke detectors
Battery-powered smoke detectors (you know, the little jobbies that you stick
to the wall or ceiling) help you get clear in an emergency, but they don’t do
much to protect your home when you’re not around. Neither a control panel
nor a central station can monitor these detectors. If no one is around when
the alarm goes off, the alarm beeps, buzzes, and whirs until, well, it melts.
You need to ensure that your security system monitors for fire and automati-
cally calls for help when necessary.
These smoke detectors are hardwired back to the alarm control panel and typ-
ically offer several levels of protection — a temperature sensor that sounds
the alarm at a preset temperature, a temperature sensor that measures the
304
Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security

rate of rise of a room’s temperature and sounds the alarm when it meets its
preset minimum, and an ionization detector that “smells” smoke and sounds
the alarm.
In some parts of the country, these detectors may not meet your local fire
regulations for hardwired smoke detectors because the security control
panel itself (which powers the detector) may not be hardwired. Instead, the
panel is attached to a transformer.
Tying in to home automation
One of the great things about these security devices is that they have multi-
ple uses. A sensor just senses something — how the system acts on a trigger
event is a different issue. If you tie these sensors into a home controller, 
you can set different states for these sensors. For instance, if someone trips
an infrared beam across your lawn while you’re working at home, you may
see a display video on a monitor in your office. If the same trigger occurs
when you’re away on vacation, the system may instead phone your alarm-
monitoring station.
As you think about automating your home, be careful when replacing nonau-
tomated devices with automated ones because the results will not always be
to your liking. If you don’t like the effect of an X10 adapter, for example, you
can simply unplug it. Other devices, however, might require that you climb a
ladder or call the electrician or plumber. For example, people often leave
floodlights on when guests are arriving. If you replace these with motion-
sensitive floodlights, you might need to make other adjustments, such as
adding sensors to your driveway to turn lights on when people arrive. Think
twice about why your device works that way at the start and how it would
work differently after being adjusted.
Sirens
You should complement your alarm system with visible and audible outputs,
such as external sirens and flashing strobe lights. Your alarm system will
probably allow different tones for different situations, such as an intermittent
tone for fire but a steady tone for burglary.
Position your visible alarms in as high and as obvious a place as possible so
that people coming to your aid can easily locate the beacon. Firefighters,
police, and so on all look for these visible alarms first as they speed to your
rescue. Remember, their siren is likely going off too, so being an obvious
target can work to your advantage.
305
Chapter 17: Home Security Boot Camp

Monitoring
You have to make the key decision of whether or not to have a central moni-
toring station monitor your alarm. Because this option offers the bonus of
professional security response, we highly recommend that you choose it. For
a minor cost of $20 to $25 or so per month, you can give yourself peace of
mind — and possibly save your life.
Most of the 12,000 plus alarm companies in the U.S. don’t have their own 
central monitoring station. Rather, they bundle someone else’s monitoring
service — businesses that do nothing else but monitor systems for alarm
companies — with their own installation and maintenance service. Your con-
trol system calls out to this monitoring station when an emergency or other
problem situation arises; the central station interprets the information
coming from your alarm system and calls the appropriate parties.
Traditional alarm-monitoring services use a standard (POTS) telephone line,
with the alarm panel connected to your phone using a special jack (called 
an RJ-31x, discussed in Chapter 18). This solution has worked well for years,
but the advent of broadband connections and phone services using VoIP 
(services such as Skype or Vonage) has changed the equation. For anyone with
a broadband connection, broadband alarm monitoring provides an opportunity
to save money and get a more interactive service that lets you control your
alarm system from anywhere in the world (as long as you have an Internet
connection). And for folks who have cut off their phone lines to use VoIP (or
cell phones) exclusively, broadband monitoring may be the only way to get
your alarm system monitored. We talk more about monitoring connections in
Chapter 18.
Gathering Your 007 Security Equipment
Your security system can get quite extensive, depending on what you choose
to place under the master control panel’s domain. You can program your
system to respond automatically or manually to almost any type of sensor or
input device. One popular application for security systems — in fact, an area
of considerable growth within the industry itself — is in video surveillance.
In Chapters 6 and 7, we talk about distributing video throughout the home by
using modulators to send video from one room to every TV in the house. You
are effectively doing the same thing here. You can buy security and safety
products that transmit video signals so that you can see front, side, and back
doors, garages, driveways, pool areas, play areas, valuables, babysitters,
cleaners, and other people helping in sensitive areas of your home.
306
Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security

In fact, you can record video signals to VHS tape to review at your leisure.
Have you hired a new nanny? Want to see whether your cleaning person is
really cleaning all day long, or just eating your food? This technology lets you
see what’s happening at home — whether you’re inside your home or 500
miles away.
Video surveillance
Many alarm, intercom, and telephone systems have an extension capability
that includes video distribution for monitoring applications, such as checking
out who’s at the front door or how the baby is doing in the nursery. This area
is one where the lines between security, telephones, and intercom subsys-
tems blur because any of them can provide video distribution throughout
your smart home. It’s also an area where you can find solutions ranging from
really cheap to really expensive — those guys in Las Vegas don’t use X10 to
monitor the craps tables, you know.
It’s important to note the difference between surveillance and security.
Surveillance products tend to require some sort of active involvement on
your part. You have to watch something or take part in something for it to
have a full effect. Security tends to be more passive — it does the watching
for you. However, not all vendors adhere to this distinction.
You’ll want to consider two forms of video surveillance: still image and live
picture. Although you may love to have live, detailed, color pictures as part
of your video-surveillance system, you have to determine whether the feature
is worth the cost. A number of inexpensive systems that are either black and
white or still image may do the trick, and they’re easier on your budget. As
you go up to color and faster frame-refresh rates, the cost of the product
increases substantially.
Video-surveillance products have seen a lot of development in recent years.
Prices have dropped for off-the-shelf consumer solutions, and more robust
professional-grade cameras (for consumer applications) have likewise
become much cheaper. Most consumer-oriented imaging products for sur-
veillance are stand-alone, closed-circuit style cameras or are tethered to a
local PC. Many newer products have networked cameras, which means they
connect directly to a network without a host PC. This is the way to go if you
can afford it because you can place these cameras just about anywhere, and
you don’t need to have a PC running for them to work.
The size of today’s cameras and how secretive their locations can be is amaz-
ing. SecurityandMore (www.securityandmore.com) carries a line of hidden
cameras that look like thermostats, tissue boxes, radios, books, PIRs, and
even fake plants. These devices pick up video as well as audio signals. And at
a few hundred dollars per camera, they’re not that expensive an add-on to
your system.
307
Chapter 17: Home Security Boot Camp

CCTV options
You used to see closed-circuit television (CCTV) only in movies and conve-
nience stores. This technology is ideal for surveillance — you can monitor
and record CCTV to stop theft, limit liability exposure, maximize productivity,
and protect yourself and your property. You can get CCTV products at a
range of prices and functionality. They start out at the low-end, black-and-
white, low-frame-rate models and move up to color, multi-camera, high-frame
rate models.
An example of a traditional wired CCTV system is Smarthome’s 4 Color
Camera Kit with 80GB DVR (find it on www.smarthome.com). This system
includes four wired and waterproof cameras that operate in either color or
black-and-white mode (depending on available light) and communicate back
to the DVR (digital video recorder). You can view your cameras on a TV, or
simply let them record to the DVR to save up to two weeks’ worth of footage.
The system uses standard NTSC composite video, so any standard definition
or HDTV can display it.
If running a coaxial cable for your video-camera signal distribution is out of
the question, you can use a video balun (basically a cable converter) to con-
vert the signals for transmission over CAT-5e/6 cabling. You use two of the
eight conductors in the telephone/data cabling for each signal. Surprisingly,
line noise, cross talk, and attenuation are low, approaching the performance
of shielded coaxial cable. You need one balun for each of the receiving and
the sending devices.
Many warehouse clubs (such as Costco and Sam’s Club) and office product
stores (such as Staples and Office Depot) carry CCTV kits.
PC options
Another option for viewing and storing video in a home video-surveillance
network is to leverage your PC investment. You can do so in two ways:
 Use special-purpose PC video cameras that connect to the video cap-
ture card installed in your PC: Most of these cameras are designed for
other uses, such as videoconferencing, and can’t get too far away from
your PC (the average cord doesn’t get much beyond 12 feet), but a few
companies have wireless systems that will let you connect several cam-
eras spread throughout your house. (See Chapter 12 for more info on
these cameras.)
 Install a TV card inside your PC and then connect your video-
surveillance cameras to your home’s video network: Using devices
called modulators (see Chapter 7), you can put these cameras on
unused television channels and watch them on your PC or any TV.

Network options
By far the best option — and one of the most expensive — is a network
camera, which is a camera with the internal parts of the computer to give it a
presence on a LAN or on the Internet. In other words, you don’t need the
camera enslaved to a PC for it to work. All you need is a regular Web browser
to access the cameras to set up the parameters; all other required software,
including control software and e-mail software (for automatic e-mailing of
images) is inside the camera.
Like the other cameras, wireless and wired options are available. Panasonic
has both in its Network Cameras product line (www.panasonic.com/
consumer_electronics/gate/cameras.asp). Panasonic’s cameras have
built-in software to record data to a Web site using the FTP protocol (which
you may be familiar with if you download or upload software on the Internet).
You can use its subscription-based service at www.viewnetcam.com to view
your images from anywhere in the world. The service basically creates a per-
sonal Web address for you. Or you can use the same FTP interface to record
to the hard drive of a local computer. The cameras can be mounted on walls,
tripods, a desk stand, or even the ceiling.
The Panasonic software allows you to view images from up to four cameras
at once, and each image is a link to the control Web page for that camera.
These cameras transmit up to 15 frames per second of live motion video with
resolutions of up to 640 x 480 pixels. The Panasonic wireless models are com-
patible with standard 802.11b wireless devices, allowing the flexibility to
install and operate the camera without running network wires. These prod-
ucts can cost up to $1000 for the most expensive models, but the price of
indoor cameras is coming down rapidly, at about $200 for cameras that 
connect to your wired computer LAN (using Ethernet) and about $300 for
cameras that use 802.11 Wi-Fi wireless technology.
Audio surveillance
Audio surveillance hasn’t taken off in most home-security installations, but
it’s pretty neat nonetheless. By adding a device called a two-way audio module
into your alarm’s central panel, you can send and receive audio to and from
your alarm company’s central monitoring station. Most two-way audio sys-
tems communicate through a microphone and speaker installed in the alarm
keypad. After an alarm is triggered, the alarm system notifies the central sta-
tion, and the two-way audio system automatically kicks in.
309
Chapter 17: Home Security Boot Camp

Using the same telephone line that connects you to the monitors, you can
have hands-free conversations with the monitors, which could be very handy
in the event of a medical emergency. (See the “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!”
section in Chapter 3.) If you’re not home, the monitoring station can record all
the sounds that your uninvited visitors make while they’re in your home —
not that you’d probably want to listen to their take on your home-decorating
skills.
Finding and Installing the 
Right Security System
Security systems are easily expandable, provided that you have the right
foundation. To choose a security system, look at both hardwired and wireless
systems and determine how these systems will interface with your other
smart-home subsystems, such as home automation.
Hardwired systems
We’ve heard one company compare wiring a wireline security system with
wiring a train set. If you can do one, you can do the other. (If you don’t have a
train set, buy one, install it, see whether the installation was hard, and then
come back to reading this book.)
Wireline systems are
 Reliable: There are no batteries to worry about; wires are hidden reli-
ably in the walls. Control panels routinely have battery backup in case
the power fails.
 Sophisticated: Because the alarm industry has its roots in wireline
installations, wireline systems are by far the more sophisticated sys-
tems. Most of the innovations have taken place with the wireline as a
foundation.
 Supervised: Wireline systems are constantly in touch with their end-
point devices, querying them to check their health and availability.
Doing so ensures that your system is at peak efficiency at all times.
On the other hand, wireline systems are much more complicated to install
and are permanent after you install them.
310
Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security

Wireless systems
Wireless systems are easier to install than wireline systems, particularly if
you’re doing the work yourself after your house has been built.
Wireless systems are
 Portable: If you move, simply unplug the wireless system and take it
with you to your next home. You can get monitoring services from any-
where in the U.S. All you need is electricity and a phone line.
 Easy to use and install: The only tool you need is a screwdriver. Some
systems come in a nice tidy do-it-yourself package, such as Visonic’s
PowerMax+ (www.visonic.com) or X10’s Protector Plus Wireless
Security System (www.x10.com). These systems are shipped to you
with simple instructions and 24-hour customer support (for all of those
2 a.m. installations!).
 Private: No strangers come into your house, drill holes in your walls, or
know your home’s layout or system password.
Wireless systems require you to change batteries, so if you’re the type who
hates to change the batteries in your smoke detectors, you may want to opt
for a wireline system.
You may hear people say that wireless systems are less reliable and more
prone to false alarms. Years ago, wireless systems were inferior to wireline
systems (and lower-end wireless systems are still inferior to wireline sys-
tems), but manufacturers of wireline systems are feverishly bringing high-
quality, reliable wireless interfaces to market today.
Wireless systems used to be totally unsupervised — meaning that the central
control panel did not know whether the sensor batteries were running low or
whether the sensors had some problem. Now, however, some of the more 
professional wireless systems (such as the Visonic product mentioned previ-
ously) include a supervision capability that makes them increasingly accepted
as part of a wireline implementation. More than 25 percent of all alarm sys-
tems installed professionally are now hybrid wireline/wireless. We give you
more information on supervision issues in Chapter 18.
Getting someone to do the job
You have two options when installing a home-security system — do it your-
self or hire a professional contractor to do it for you. Most do-it-yourself pro-
jects are wireless in nature. You can buy a range of sensors and control
panels from home-improvement stores or electronics stores.
311
Chapter 17: Home Security Boot Camp

You can also choose a kit that offers everything in one box. Most of these kits
come with a control box, an alarm siren, and various combinations of wire-
less contact and keychain remote controls. One such vendor is X10 (www.
X10.com), which sells several systems over the Internet. They also sell all
sorts of add-ons for surveillance, appliance control, and more.
Few homeowners install wireline systems themselves (although they could
do so easily during a remodel or new home construction). Rather, most
homeowners hire professionals to install wireline security systems designed
explicitly for their homes. Professional security installers provide a proposal
and make recommendations on the type and location of each sensor. They
may have promotional deals that provide you with a starter system.
The choice between putting in a security system yourself and hiring a profes-
sional is a matter of budget and preference. We recommend that you seri-
ously consider hiring a professional to install this system. Messing up the
cabling of your stereo system is one thing, but messing up your security
system could be life threatening. Don’t scrimp on your security system.
Some companies install a basic system in your home for free if you sign a long-
term (usually five-year) agreement with them for monitoring services. The
upside of these deals is a low initial cost. The downside is inadequate coverage
and higher fees as you go along. Most of these secure-now, pay-later packages
include coverage for only four doors or windows and a single motion sensor. If
you want to expand your coverage, you have to pay high additional costs.
Moreover, you lease the system rather than own it. Monitoring fees are higher,
and you have to agree to a long-term contract with a hefty early-termination fee.
Be sure to check out comparable deals with non-free systems and figure the
costs over time; you’re generally better off just paying for a system up front.
The National Burglar & Fire Alarm Association (http://alarm.org/info_
ctr/consumer.htm) offers advice on how to shop for a security system as
well as the names of contractors who have qualified for their Installation
Quality certificate.

H
ome-security systems are better suited for installation by professionals
than by do-it-yourselfers. Too much is at stake, whether you think in
terms of your family’s safety or the potential troubles that an improperly
installed system can cause (such as false alarms, which drive the police and
fire departments crazy and can result in fines to the homeowner). If you’re
using a wireless system, do-it-yourself is feasible, but for a full-up wired secu-
rity network, hire a professional.
That said, we think it’s important to have an idea about what kinds of wiring
and equipment make up a home-security system so that you can have an
intelligent conversation with potential installers. This chapter discusses
these wiring and architecture issues and explains how security systems
work.
How to Prewire
The best place to start thinking about a home-security system is to look at
how you can prewire your home to meet your short- and long-term security
needs. In this section, we discuss the layout, or architecture, of a security
system and the types of wire (or wireless systems) that connect the compo-
nents of a security system.

Running a security loop
Your home-security system is based on the star architecture, in which every
cable meets at a central wiring control panel (see Figure 18-1). Locating your
wiring control panel in the central wiring closet that we describe in Chapter 2
makes sense; your control panel should be near the point where your tele-
phone service comes into the house so that you can configure the system to
call for help in an emergency. We cover this connection in the “Super supervi-
sion” section later in this chapter.
The cables that connect to the sensors and other elements of your security
subsystem extend from the control panel. Although you can daisy-chain 
sensors — adding an extra sensor sometime after the initial installation to
the line that runs to a nearby sensor — the control panel can’t differentiate
between devices that share a line to the control panel.
The cable that connects security devices generally contains two or four
smaller wires called conductors. Half the wires cover the circuit that delivers
information to the sensor; the other half delivers information back to the
security control panel. The signals form a loop between the control panel and
each sensor. These loops enable the control panel to tell whether the sensor
is functioning correctly.
Wiring choices
You use the following main types of wire in typical alarm installations:
 Normal telephone wire: This is 22-gauge, four-conductor telephone
wire.
 Fire-alarm cable: You must connect fire alarms with special fire-alarm
cable that rates to 105 degrees centigrade so that it doesn’t easily burn.
You see this wiring strung as bright red cabling in your basement.
 Intercom cable: Some intercom systems allow you to add intercom-
monitoring stations to the security system. If you decide on such a
system, make sure that your installer uses special 22-gauge stranded
and shielded wiring and grounds on every run. Failure to do so exposes
the intercom system to electrical interference, which generates an
annoying hum.
314
Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security

Wiring for wireless
Prewiring for wireless systems may sound weird, but it makes sense. Few pro-
fessional installations are totally wireless; you usually install some sort of
hybrid system. Wireless systems don’t require prewiring at each point where
you install the wireless endpoints, but you need to be careful about where
you install your phone line interfaces (as we discuss later in the chapter in
the “Phone line interfaces” section) and how you tie your central system into
your other wireline assets.
If you trip a wireless sensor, it sends a high-frequency coded signal to the
central station, which interprets and acts on the signal as necessary. Wireless
systems basically act just like wired ones, sending electrical signals to and
from sensors, keypads, and central stations, but the wireless systems use
radio signals instead of cabling to send and receive the signals.

Chapter 18: Wiring a Security System

Beware of all-in-one wireless security solutions. These systems are wireless
designs for apartments and other smaller applications that combine a passive
infrared receiver, or PIR, with a siren. (We explain how these passive units
monitor the infrared spectrum in Chapter 17.) When the PIR detects a bur-
glar, the siren sounds to alert the family or frighten the burglar away. In prac-
tice, however, these systems are questionable because many issue a beeping
tone if you trip them, which enables you to disarm the unit with a user-
entered code. This time delay gives a burglar a chance to locate the alarm
device and smash it before the siren goes off.
All Zoned Out
The central security control panel tracks each circuit as a separate zone, and
ideally, each circuit connects to only one sensor or device. So if you have a
room with three window contacts and a passive infrared receiver, you have
four zones here, not one. Typical security control panels for home applica-
tions can monitor 6 to 48 zones.
Zones enable the control panel to query the status of each device and inter-
pret the inputs from each device. By tracking triggers sequentially from three
related zones, for example, you can interpret that someone is walking a spe-
cific direction down a hallway.
Still, in some cases, you may need to run multiple sensors on the same cir-
cuit, known as dividing a zone into subzones. The drawback to the subzone
approach is that all the sensors that connect to the same circuit appear as a
single sensor to the control panel. If you connect a door, a window sensor,
and a PIR to the same circuit, you can’t tell which is causing the alarm.
316
Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security
Good news for basement dwellers
Unlike other subsystem wiring schemes, secu-
rity systems are expandable because so much
of the wiring runs through the basement ceiling
and then up short distances to the first-floor ter-
minations. (In most cases, you don’t need many
sensors on upper floors.) So, unless you use
sheetrock or otherwise close off your ceiling in
the basement, running an extra cable shouldn’t
be an issue if you decide to add another sensor
or end device. As long as you have an unfin-
ished basement or drop ceiling, you don’t need
to overbuild your system. You merely install
what you need today and add on to the system
when you want to expand.

Wireless systems work by zones, too. Each wireless device that’s part of a
professional installation has its own port on the control panel, just like on the
wireline devices. The wireless devices typically communicate in the 300- to
900-MHz frequencies, which are highly reliable — unless a lot of radio activity
is nearby.
Super supervision
A key element of your security subsystem is the concept of supervision, which
is the capability of an alarm system to sense the status of any attached device.
The control panel continuously monitors its attached devices — how often
and which things it monitors vary from panel to panel. Among the things that
most systems monitor for are power failure, telephone line trouble, loss of
internal clock, trouble in any part of the system, low-battery conditions,
attempts to tamper with systems, and other internal faults.
317
Chapter 18: Wiring a Security System
Phone lines — the weak link
The most vulnerable part of your security
system is your phone line interface. Your phone
line isn’t monitored. The alarm system relies on
that phone line to call the monitoring station and
implicitly assumes that it’s always there. And
the monitoring service, which may be located
hundreds of miles away, also assumes that the
line is there and working.
As a result, many phone-line-based alarm sys-
tems are vulnerable if someone cuts the phone
line before entering the house and tripping the
alarm. As you’re building your house, think
about hardening the access to your telephone
lines. In new subdivisions, the builders usually
bury many of these lines, which is great. Many
other homes, however, have exposed NIDs (net-
work interface devices) on the outside of the
house, and the telephone line is in plain view. If
your telephone company requires an outside
interface, work with them to protect it as much
as possible with a lock box and hardened 
conduit.
You can also buy a special alarm line called a
derived channel from your local telephone com-
pany. The phone company puts a little black box
in the central telephone office serving you and
another box where the line from your house
ends. This second box creates a subaudible
two-way communication that provides a chan-
nel for your alarm’s supervision. If the signal
trips open, the central station gets a signal sig-
nifying that the phone line is down. Because of
its cost, which is about $45 per month, the
derived-channel approach has never taken off.

Typically once a week, the alarm system sends in test signal to the central
monitoring station. You’d be amazed at the number of customers whose
systems aren’t functional. People install computers on telephone lines, and
the telephone installer may reroute or cause problems with the same phone
line that your subsystem is on. People put additions on their houses and
mess up wiring. Lots of simple things can conspire to throw part of your
security system into chaos, which is why supervision is so important.
Wireless supervision
Wireless systems need supervision to be successful, too. Control panels that
support wireless systems should also enable you to supervise these devices.
Unsupervised wireless systems can detect whether a sensor circuit opens.
This sort of system can tell you whether someone opens the front door, for
example, but can’t tell you the state of the remote sensors at any particular
time. It can’t, for example, tell you that its batteries are low.
Supervised wireless systems mimic wireline systems. Typically, the system
sends each wireless zone a supervisory round every so often. If the receiver
hears from the wireless device at least once during that query, it doesn’t
report a problem. If it doesn’t receive a response, it treats the situation just
as it does any other fault and reports a problem with the system to the 
monitoring station.
Within the supervisory transmission, the system usually queries the device
about the status of the battery. If the battery is low, the system reports a
fault.
Connecting to Other Systems
The power of your security system is measured not only by its inherent 
capabilities but also by what subsystems you can add to it.
Phone line interfaces
If you can afford it, a monitoring service should remotely monitor your secu-
rity system. Your control panel then dials the alarm-monitoring service if any
event that you programmed into your system occurs.
318
Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security

To dial out, your system needs access to an outside phone line. In most
cases, it accesses the phone line that you use as your home telephone
number, unless you opt for derived-channel service. (See the “Phone lines —
the weak link” sidebar.)
The alarm system must be inline with your service, meaning that the tele-
phone line physically runs through the panel on its way to your in-home tele-
phone network. If something trips a sensor, the system seizes the telephone
line to make an outbound call. The alarm system uses a piggybacked jack
with a shorting bridge that disconnects the rest of the home-phone network.
In doing so, the system effectively disconnects all the phones in the house
while it makes that outbound call for help.
Stand-alone wireless systems, such as those you find at the do-it-yourself out-
lets, enable you to merely plug them into the nearest phone outlet in the
house. But if someone leaves a phone off the hook or if the phone is in use as
the alarm trips, the wireless system can’t seize the line and make the emer-
gency call for help. For this reason, we recommend that you don’t install a
wireless system from a normal telephone extension in the house. Instead, 
run a phone line to the inline jack at the control box where your phone line
enters the house.
Don’t connect the alarm-panel communicator to telephone lines that you use
with a fax machine. Fax-machine lines may incorporate a voice filter, which
disconnects the line if it detects anything other than fax signals. This filter
can result in partial transmissions to the monitoring center.
Your central security control panel connects with your home-phone lines with
an RJ-31X connection. This interface — called the digital communicator —
transmits the signal from the control panel to the central monitoring station.
The connection is straightforward; the conductors from the local telephone
line connect to the panel and then route back out of the panel to connect with
the in-home telephones. One of the big advantages of the RJ-31X interface is
that it enables you to dial into your system from a phone to do stuff such as
turn the system on and off or turn up the temperature inside the house.
You can add enhanced phone functionality to your house through your alarm
system. Sounds backwards, doesn’t it? But because the alarm system is in-
line with your phone connections, it can act as a gatekeeper to all the phones
in the house. For instance, ADEMCO (www.ademco.com) has a TeleSmart
module for its VISTA security systems that adds a digital answering machine
to your alarm system. With TeleSmart, homeowners can arm or disarm their
security system, check messages, screen calls, block calls, and more.
Additional features include caller ID, memory and repeat dial, customized
mailboxes for up to four family members, and a family message center that
lets users record, play back, and retrieve voice memos.
319
Chapter 18: Wiring a Security System

Alternative phone line interfaces
Having the control panel send alarm signals to a remote monitoring station is
not the only way to accomplish your goal of getting help if an emergency
arises. Other possibilities are the focus of this section.
One alternative to having a phone line connection to the central security con-
trol panel is to use wireless communications — cellular phone technologies,
for example — to dial into the remote monitoring station. You can use wire-
less technologies as an alternative to a phone line connection or as a supple-
ment (in case someone cuts the phone line). At least two national networks
are vying to get your wireless monitoring business: Uplink (www.uplink.
com) and Honeywell’s Alarmnet (http://www.security.honeywell.com/
hsce/solutions/alarmnet/index.html), both of which use cellular and
wireless data networks to carry signals between your local control panel and
the monitoring station. These networks enable two-way wireless alarm com-
munications to any monitoring station. Your alarm installer should be famil-
iar with both of these services and can provide you with details about
equipment requirements and pricing.
Home-control interfaces
Various control panels sport X10, ZigBee, Z-Wave, or other home-control
modules that can also turn your lights on and off through the addition of pro-
gramming and timers. By using such modules, you can program your security
system so that if the fire alarm goes off, for example, you can turn on specific
lights to guide you out of the house.
You can program more sophisticated systems, such as those that we discuss
in Chapter 20, to utilize the inputs from your sensors to perform all sorts of
tasks. You can use a driveway sensor that you connect to your security panel
to issue home-automation commands that turn on the garage and porch
lights, for example, or sound a chime in the home office.
X10.com (www.x10.com) has keychain-fob interfaces for its Monitor Plus secu-
rity system that work from up to 40 feet away. You can arm and disarm the
system with the press of a single button as you pull into the driveway! Modes on
the remote include arm (instant mode), disarm, control of lights, and a panic
feature to trip the system immediately. Each remote effectively has a unique
code that is identified to the alarm panel so that only the remotes that the user
has set up can be used to control the system. Napco (www.napcosecurity.
com) has a fob unit with eight intuitive icons for system status that show up 
on an LCD display. Additionally, corresponding beep sequences on the min-
isounder confirm commands. BellSouth (www.bellsouth.com/security/)
issues these as standard on its security services. So much for having to remem-
ber a code or special siren sequences.
320
Part V: Keeping the Bad Guys at Bay —Security

Audio interfaces
Some alarm systems enable you to connect a number of standard interior
and exterior intercom stations or sensors to your alarm system. You can use
these for listening in on the baby, playing background music, seeing who’s at
the door, answering incoming phone calls, and paging people around the
house. A neat feature of such systems is that the central station can also
access these intercoms, so monitoring agents can listen and talk through
these systems.
Broadband interfaces
The Internet interface is a natural extension of the security subsystem, and
some of the more progressive firms are making use of it. With a constant
broadband connection to the Internet, you can have constant connections to
your monitoring center and not have to rely on grabbing a dial-up phone line
to communicate your status. You can also set up Web-based interfaces to
control various aspects of your security system, including real-time video.
Two things about this connection are critical: the speed of the connection
(how much information can be crammed up and down your access line) and
the fact that the connection is always on, meaning that your home is always
connected to the Internet. These systems use two-way communications that
confirm your system is online and working, and the sheer size of the band-
width available means you can do all sorts of neat things to provide service.
321
Chapter 18: Wiring a Security System
Serial port connections via RS-232?
A few home-security systems, such as those
made by Napco (www.napcosecurity.
com), provide an electronic interface known as
RS-232. This connection is basically the same
kind that the serial port on most PCs use. If you
install a security panel with an RS-232 interface
and you also have a home-automation con-
troller with its own RS-232 input, you can con-
nect them to get even more sophisticated
sensor-to-automation relationships.
Why doesn’t everyone use RS-232? Well, that
involves a big problem. Although the RS-232
interface itself is standardized and common, the
programming code that works the alarms and
home-automation controllers is proprietary. So
a security panel from manufacturer X may not
be capable of talking to a home-automation
controller from company Y. This lack of compat-
ibility can be a major pain in the neck, although
some companies are beginning to open up their
programming to ensure interoperability.
Right now, security and automation interfacing
is iffy. Unless you’re a serial-programming
expert, you need to leave this kind of system
integration to a professional installer who’s
trained on both alarm and automation systems.

An example of a broadband security-monitoring service comes from a com-
pany called NextAlarm (www.nextalarm.com). NextAlarm’s service uses a
specialized version of VoIP (Voice over IP) hardware (we discuss VoIP hard-
ware in Chapters 11 and 12) to connect a standard alarm panel to the central
monitoring station. (The Web site lists the many panels that work with the
service.)
Broadband alarm services provide all the standard alarm-response services
you’d expect from any alarm-monitoring service, but use the always-on
nature of the Internet connection to add additional features. For example,
NextAlarm provides an extra layer of security assurance by pinging the alarm
panel to confirm the connection every five minutes (traditional phone line
systems do this only once a day). The Internet-based system also provides
additional alerting and control mechanisms that are effectively real time —
you can receive alerts or check your system’s status by logging onto a Web
page, through e-mail or SMS (text messages) to your cell phone, or by dialing
into an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) unit from any phone.
The coolest part of services like NextAlarm’s are that they cost less to 
operate than traditional phone line services — in fact, NextAlarm’s most
basic service is free!
Make sure that you have a UPS, or uninterruptible power supply, connected to
your broadband modem, router, and the broadband alarm adapter itself. Unlike
conventional phone lines (which get their power from the phone company),
broadband connections go out when the power goes out. A UPS will keep
things up and running typically for 30 to 90 minutes while the lights are out.

ing standards that can make home automation and control easier, cheaper,
and better than what’s available today.
Where an Automated Home 
Begins — and Ends
An automated home can be a simple grouping of controls, such as a few
lamps that turn themselves on and off, or it can be an extravaganza, where
just about everything electrically powered is remotely controlled. The great
thing is that you can start small and grow over time.

Any home-automation and home-control system includes the following basic
elements:
 Protocol: The common language that all the devices in the home-
automation network understand. X10 is the predominant protocol in
home automation today, but it’s being rapidly supplanted by new proto-
cols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, and INSTEON.
 Wiring infrastructure: The wires that carry signals to each automation
or control device in the network. Many home-automation systems
(including X10) use the existing electrical wiring to transmit signals, but
a few require special wiring. Other systems (such as ZigBee or Z-Wave)
use wireless technologies so you need no wires at all.
 Controller device: A device that sends signals over the infrastructure in
a way that conforms to the protocol. The signals tell specific pieces of
equipment what to do.
Some of the newer home-automation systems can work in a peer-to-peer
environment, where you don’t need a centralized controller. In these
cases you can let individual devices send commands to your equipment;
for example, a Z-Wave light switch could communicate with a bunch of
other switches to send elaborate commands without the use of a stand-
alone centralized controller. You may still want to add a centralized con-
trol device so you can use the controller’s interface (which often uses a
TV or computer screen and is designed for ease of use) or to get involved
in more complex automation tasks (such as integrating access from out-
side the home).
 Device controllers: Because most appliances and electronic devices
aren’t designed from the factory to be automated or remotely con-
trolled, you need individual controllers that can respond to signals from
the main controller device and make individual components do what
you want them to do — such as turn on and off.
The big difference among the various implementations of home networking
comes in the realm of controllers. You can start off with a small, stand-alone
controller that costs about $40, or you can go with a high-end PC-type con-
troller that runs into the thousands of dollars. (You can find much cheaper
PC controllers, however.) These PC-type controllers can be software and
hardware interfaces for a general-purpose PC in your home, or they can be
stand-alone PC-like hardware devices purpose-built for home-automation
control.
Understanding the Protocols
Just as data networks in your home use a protocol (Ethernet for wired net-
works and Ethernet plus Wi-Fi for wireless networks), home-automation sys-
tems use their own networking protocols to facilitate communications over
326
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

powerlines, wireless systems, or even special proprietary cables. The first
decision you’ll need to make when you’re considering a home-automation
system is which of the several protocols you’ll want to use.
There’s no reason why you can’t have more than one protocol in your 
home — perhaps some devices controlled over the powerlines using X10,
LonWorks, or INSTEON, and others controlled wirelessly using ZigBee or 
Z-Wave. You just need to have a controller that can “speak” both protocols.
However, we don’t recommend that you mix and match protocols on the
same physical media — meaning we wouldn’t use, for example, both ZigBee
and Z-Wave in the same home.
Six major home-automation and home-control protocols are on the market as
we write:
 X10: X10 is the granddaddy of home automation, having been around
since the 1970s. X10 uses your home’s powerlines to communicate its
commands around the home and can control up to 256 different devices.
Each X10 device is configured with a house code (A through P) and a unit
code (1-16) — 16 letters times 16 numbers equals the 256 devices that
can be controlled. X10 devices can be one-way or two-way (many of the
least expensive are one-way); one-way devices receive commands but
can send no confirmation that they did so, which means your controller
may think it has turned a light on when it hasn’t. X10 is the cheapest of
all systems but also the least reliable (powerlines are tough to communi-
cate over) and the slowest (you can control only one device at a time,
and it takes several seconds to issue a command). You can find X10
equipment at most home automation stores and online at suppliers such
as www.x10.com or www.x10pro.com.
 Universal Powerline Bus (UPB): This standard was developed in the 
late 1990s by a company called Powerline Control Systems (PCS, www.pcs
lighting.com) and is designed to be a faster and more reliable alterna-
tive to X10. Like X10, UPB uses powerlines (which you probably guessed
by the name!) for communications. UPB is a two-way, peer-to-peer system
with data rates up to 20 to 40 times faster than X10, so a command can
be sent and received in a tenth of a second, instead of multiple seconds
in an X10 environment.
 INSTEON: The folks at SmartLabs (www.smartlabs.com) run one of
the biggest online stores for home-automation gear. They also have a big
engineering team that develops their own equipment and devices. One
outgrowth of that has been the development of the INSTEON home-
automation protocol, SmartLab’s replacement for X10. INSTEON-enabled
devices can communicate either over powerlines or using wireless com-
munications (modules are wireless only, powerline only, or use both
media), and can work in a peer-to-peer or centralized environment.
327
Chapter 19: Home Automation Extravaganza

INSTEON’s main advantages over X10 are increased reliability and a
much faster data rate (about 13Kbps versus X10’s 20 bits per second).
SmartLabs has licensed the technology to a number of companies, and
the best place to find INSTEON equipment online is at www.smarthome.
com.
 ZigBee: ZigBee is wireless automation networking standard based on an
international standard (called IEEE 802.15.4 — similar to the 802.11 stan-
dards used for Wi-Fi networks). ZigBee systems use a peer-to-peer net-
working infrastructure, and furthermore use something called mesh
networking to extend their reach. In a mesh network, a module or other
ZigBee-enabled device not only communicates with other devices and
controllers for its own commands but can also be used to relay com-
mands on to devices elsewhere in the home. So the more devices you
have in a mesh network, the better your coverage. ZigBee provides a
much higher data rate than X10 (at 250 Kbps, it’s more than 1000 times
faster), while using chips that are very inexpensive to manufacture. A
group called the ZigBee Alliance (www.zigbee.org) — similar to the
Wi-Fi Alliance — is helping manufacturers bring ZigBee products to
market and to ensure that they work well together. As we write, only a
few ZigBee products are on the market, but dozens of manufacturers
have joined the Alliance.
 Z-Wave: A Danish semiconductor company called Zensys (www.zen-sys.
com) has developed a competitor to ZigBee called Z-Wave. Z-Wave is a
wireless mesh peer-to-peer automation networking protocol that’s simi-
lar to ZigBee. Z-Wave systems operate at speeds of up to 9.6 Kbps
(slower than ZigBee, but still more than fast enough for home automa-
tion and control). Z-Wave products are still new to the market, but sev-
eral major manufacturers, such as Leviton (www.leviton.com) and
Wayne Dalton (http://www.waynedalton.com), are shipping prod-
ucts using Z-Wave.
 LonWorks: Outside of the home, LonWorks is perhaps the most success-
ful automation networking protocol of all — and most home owners and
builders have never heard of it because LonWorks is used in millions 
of commercial applications (not in residential applications). Like X10,
LonWorks uses the powerline, but it does so in a much more robust and
reliable fashion and at much faster speeds. The folks who developed
LonWorks (Echelon Corporation, www.echelon.com) are beginning to
bring the LonWorks system to the smart homes market. Tens of millions
of LonWorks chips are already installed around the world, and this
volume has allowed the company to create low-priced chipsets, which
will soon be marketed to homeowners and builders for residential
automation applications.
328
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

Understanding the Components
Regardless of which protocol you choose, the controller devices you’ll use
are similar. The basic building block of a home-automation system is a
module or switch designed to control the state (on/off, dim, and so on) of an
electrical or electronic device. These modules (we’ll use that term generically
to cover the entire spectrum) communicate with a controller or even amongst
each other using one of the automation protocols discussed in the preceding
section, and translate the commands communicated by the protocol into
actions.
Modules
If you look in a home-automation catalog or go to a place that carries home-
automation gear, such as Radio Shack or Home Depot, you’ll find home-
automation modules ranging from generic lamp modules to specialized
devices that control specific pieces of equipment. The main distinctions
among modules are as follows:
329
Chapter 19: Home Automation Extravaganza
A bit more about X10
X10 actually refers to two things: a protocol and
a company name. (We lied — it refers to three
companies’ names.) X10 is the dominant proto-
col for controlling (turning on and off) electrical
devices such as lights and appliances through
your home’s electrical lines. Three X10–named
companies are involved in the X10 automation
industry: X10 Limited bought the original patent
for X10 technology back in the 1980s and held
the patent until it expired in 1997; X10Pro is a
subsidiary of X10 Limited and builds X10 equip-
ment for the professional installer market; and
X10 Wireless Technologies is a manufacturing
and marketing partner of X10 Limited that sells
X10 equipment directly to consumers.
Confused yet? Most people type www.X10.
com in their Web browser and find the third
one, X10 Wireless Technologies. If you want to
find X10Pro on the Web, type www.X10pro.
com. X10 Limited doesn’t sell anything to con-
sumers under that name, so don’t bother trying
to find that one.
X10 is now an open standard, sold by the two
X10 companies mentioned, as well as by other
companies, such as Leviton and Stanley. We
use the term X10 to refer to the protocol or to
mean a device that’s compatible with the X10
protocol because thinking of X10 in this way
reminds you that you don’t need to buy from one
of the X10 companies to get X10. All compatible
products display an X10-compatible logo on
their packaging or on the product itself; when
you see this logo, you know that the product
works with other X10 products regardless of
manufacturer.

 The kind of device they control: Modules that control devices such as
lamps are cheaper (and handle less electrical current) than those that
turn on and off such high-powered devices as electrical dryers.
 The control signals they can understand: The simplest modules know
how to turn things on and off in response to a control signal. More
sophisticated modules can perform additional functions, such as lamp
dimming or brightening or ceiling-fan speed adjustments.
 The automation protocol they use: It probably goes without saying, but
we’re saying it anyway! Another important characteristic of any module
is which of the many home-automation protocols (discussed in the pre-
ceding section) the module uses for communications around the home.
You’ve got to choose a protocol and stick with it!
 Whether they’re one-way or two-way: Most X10 modules are one-way —
that is, they receive control signals but don’t respond back to the cen-
tral controller to tell it that the module has performed an action. The
least expensive modules don’t offer a confirmation signal back to the
controller, but a new breed of two-way modules provides this status 
confirmation. Newer protocols are inherently two-way, which is a great
advantage because your system will always know the true state of devices
being controlled, instead of “hoping” that your commands went through.
If you’re using X10, keep in mind that sometimes (oftentimes in some homes),
electrical noise and interference on a home’s powerlines can prevent an X10
module from understanding or receiving the X10 signals. The new two-way
modules tell you (or your controller) whether a command worked, which is a
handy feature for such important commands as starting the coffee pot in the
morning. Most of the modules that we discuss in this chapter are available in
both one-way and two-way configurations. You can use them interchangeably
in an X10 network, but only two-way modules send confirmation signals back
to a two-way compatible controller.
The following sections describe some of the modules available for your use.
Lamp modules
The simplest and most common modules are lamp modules. These modules
simply plug into any standard 110-volt AC outlet, between the lamp cord and
the outlet. You can use these modules only with incandescent bulbs, usually
up to 300 watts. (Check the labeling as you’re choosing a module to make
sure that it can handle the type of bulb involved.)
Lamp modules respond to on and off commands for the particular house and
unit codes that you assign to the module. They respond also to all-on/all-off
commands from your controller — commands that turn on or off (you
guessed it) all the lights in the house that the modules control. In addition,
330
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

many lamp modules respond to dim/brighten commands that a controller
issues, so you can set the mood for dinner or a movie — or whatever you
have in mind.
There’s a big push afoot to have folks swap out their incandescent bulbs for
CFL (compact fluorescent lights), due to the great energy savings these bulbs
offer. When you are controlling fluorescent lights, you need to use lamp mod-
ules specifically designed to work with these types of bulbs for the following
reasons:
 Most fluorescent bulbs can’t be dimmed, so you need a module that
doesn’t try to dim them! A few dimmable CFLs are on the market (at
about $18 a bulb) but the vast majority are not dimmable.
 Fluorescent bulbs can interfere with powerline signals. If you’re using
X10, UPB, or Insteon, you may get “noise” on the line that keeps your sig-
nals from being properly transmitted around the house. Special fluores-
cent lamp modules can filter out most of that noise — you may also
want to consider a wireless automation protocol if you’re planning on
controlling a lot of fluorescents.
Appliance modules
For all the stuff in your house that uses a bit more juice (electrically speak-
ing), you want appliance modules. These modules can handle the higher
draws of electric current required by devices such as coffeemakers, portable
heaters, and other household appliances.
You don’t find dim/bright commands on most appliance modules, which
makes sense because you can’t really dim a coffee pot. You also don’t find an
all-on function on these modules, which is for safety reasons — some devices
that connect to appliance modules are things that you don’t want to turn on if
you’re just trying to light the house by turning on all of your lamp modules.
You do usually find an all-off command — if you want everything off, you gen-
erally want everything off.
You can find appliance modules in both 110-volt AC and 220-volt AC versions.
Heavy-duty stuff, such as hot tubs, window air conditioners, and clothes
dryers, may require the 220-volt versions.
Universal modules
Universal modules (sometimes called low-voltage modules) are special-purpose
appliance modules that control the electrical and electronic devices in a
home that a relay (or remote switch) turns on and off. These devices include
garage-door openers, electric drapery controls, sprinkler systems, and low-
voltage lighting systems (such as yard lights and some track lighting).
331
Chapter 19: Home Automation Extravaganza

You can set the universal module to provide a momentary or continuous relay
closure. You might use the momentary mode for the garage-door opener
(which creates the equivalent of pressing the open/close button) and the
continuous mode for sprinklers and other devices that you want to remain 
on until you turn them off.
Universal modules don’t receive all-on or dim/brighten signals (for the same
reason that appliance modules don’t) but do receive all-off commands.
Receptacles
Most modules are small and discrete, but for a truly invisible appearance,
you can have your electrician install in-wall receptacles. These outlets are the
same size and shape as conventional power receptacles but function the
same as appliance modules. The main consideration in installing receptacles
is whether you want the automation system to control one or both outlets in
the receptacle. Some models have a controlled outlet on top and an always-
live regular outlet on the bottom.
Duplex automated wall receptacles offer control over both outlets. We often
see companies marketing these kinds of receptacles to parents who want to
ensure that their kids aren’t watching TV beyond certain time limits. After TV
time is over, the controller can turn off the outlet and disable the TV set in
the children’s room. Boy, will that make them mad!
Switches
Another way to make automation connections less visible in your home is to
have your electrician install automated wall switches to control hardwired
lights, fans, and other devices. These switches enable both local and auto-
mated control of the devices that the electrician wires to them — so you can
have your controller turn a light on or off, or you can just walk over to the
switch and do it yourself.
If you use two-way automated switches, they can inform your intelligent con-
troller that you manually changed the state of the switch (from on to off or
vice versa). If you don’t have two-way switches, you can end up getting your
control system out of whack by manually controlling a switch. This system
confusion arises when the switch is manually set to a different position (on
or off) than the controller thinks it is set to.
You need to consider the following points when purchasing wall switches:
 Special switches (known as three-way master and slave switches) are
necessary for applications in which more than one switch controls a
particular light. Regular switches can’t handle this job because they
can’t keep track of the light’s status when another switch turns the light
332
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

on or off. Three-way switches can communicate with each other to keep
track of this status.
 Switches with dimmer functions work only with incandescent light 
fixtures — not with fluorescent lighting systems.
 Ceiling fans and low-voltage lighting sources (such as halogen track
lighting) require a specific inductive switch — which by design specifi-
cally controls fan speeds or dims and brightens low-voltage lights.
 Certain 220-volt devices — such as pool pumps, hot-tub heaters, and
some air conditioners — require special heavy-duty switches because of
the large amount of electrical current they draw.
With the newer peer-to-peer automation systems such as Z-Wave and ZigBee,
wall switches can take on the role of controller (discussed in the next sec-
tion). You can program one switch in a room or section of your house to send
commands to multiple modules or switches.
Controllers
All the automation modules, receptacles, and switches in the world aren’t
useful without some means of controlling them remotely. Luckily, you have at
least as many options for controlling automation systems as you have
module options.
Standard controllers range from $10 X10 minicontrollers, which provide
remote control (but not automation) of a number of modules, to $500 touch-
screen controllers that provide a more sophisticated means of controlling
your network. Throw into the mix wireless controllers, specialized lighting
controllers, telephone-activated controllers, timers, controllers that activate
by light (or darkness), controllers that your security system triggers, voice
controllers, and even controllers that use your PC to run your home network,
and you have quite a selection to peruse. And that’s not even considering
some of the high-end, proprietary systems that control X10 systems, HVAC
systems, alarms, and other controllers.
The sheer number of choices in the controller world can be a bit bewildering,
but we have some good news: You don’t need to limit yourself to just one
controller. You can start small and then supplement your controller inventory
with more sophisticated models as you expand your automation network —
while keeping the original controllers active in the network.
You could begin with just a simple minicontroller, for example. Then as you
expand your network, use a PC-based controller system to automate your
entire house. You don’t need to throw the minicontroller out; transfer it to
the master bedroom and use it to control certain lights or appliances that
you want to turn on and off from the comfort of your bed.
333
Chapter 19: Home Automation Extravaganza

As we discuss controllers, whenever we use module, we’re also including
automation receptacles and switches. We just figured that you didn’t want to
read module or receptacle or switch a whole bunch of times.
The following sections describe some of the various controllers available.
Stand-alone controllers
The simplest and most inexpensive controllers are stand-alone controllers.
These devices don’t need a PC — or anything else — to operate. Just plug
them into a wall outlet, program them to match the house and unit codes,
and you’re ready to go.
Minicontrollers and tabletop controllers
Among stand-alone controllers, the cheapest and easiest to install and set up
are minicontrollers. These small boxes simply send on/off, all-on/all-off, and
dim/brighten commands to a small number of X10 devices (usually eight).
The minicontroller doesn’t do any automation — that is, it requires input
from a person to perform a task — but it does provide you with remote con-
trol from anywhere in the house.
Tabletop controllers do basically the same thing as minicontrollers — the
only real difference is that they can control a larger number of modules (and
they’re bigger).
Programmable controllers and timers
The next step up in controllers — programmable, or timer, controllers —
begins to offer a degree of home automation to complement the home-control
functions of minicontrollers. These devices, which you mount on a wall or
place on a desk or table, enable you to control a number of automation mod-
ules (usually eight or sixteen) manually or automatically.
To make the controller work automatically, you simply need to program the
controller to perform a command or sequence of commands at a particular
time. So you can, for example, tell your controller to turn on modules A1 (the
kitchen lights) and A2 (the coffee pot) at 6:30 a.m. every Monday through
Friday. This kind of automation isn’t the end-all in sophistication, but it’s a
good way to get started down the road to an automated home.
Telephone interfaces
You don’t need to be in the house to control your automation modules. By
installing a telephone interface, you can dial into your network from any
Touch-Tone phone and turn on the lights or get the hot tub warming up
before you get home from the office.
334
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

Telephone interfaces plug into a phone line (using a telephone cord with a
standard RJ-11 jack) and into any power receptacle in the house, and use
Touch-Tone keypad tones to perform various control actions in your home.
Prices for these devices range from about $70 for a simple unit that controls
ten modules up to about $300 for units that can control one hundred or more
modules.
When choosing a phone interface for your X10 network, look for the following
features:
 Local control: Some phone interfaces enable you not only to dial in
remotely, but also to pick up any phone (on the same line) in your home
and enter commands.
 Voice enunciator: More expensive models have built-in voice enuncia-
tors, which confirm your commands (a handy feature if you’re not sure
whether you just turned on the porch light or the hot tub).
 Answering-machine mode: Some models enable you to put an answering
machine on the same phone line as the controller, an important feature if
you have only one phone line in the house. To use the controller, you
just ignore the beep on your answering machine and punch in your com-
mands. This feature doesn’t work with telephone-company-provided
voice-mail services, however, and may not work with every answering
machine.
Sensor controllers and interfaces
Although programmable and timer controllers add some degree of automa-
tion to your home network, they’re basically dumb devices. A certain time
passes, and they initiate commands that you previously programmed into
them. That’s handy, but what happens if you want a command to activate
under circumstances that don’t adhere to a predictable schedule? What if, for
example, you want the lights in your hallway to come on whenever your chil-
dren walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night? (And believe Danny
when he tells you that no predictable schedule exists for that.)
For these kinds of scenarios, you may want to use sensor-initiated con-
trollers, such as those described in the following list:
 PIR controllers: These controllers send out a control signal whenever a
passive infrared (PIR) motion detector picks up someone walking into a
room (or past your back door in the middle of the night).
 Photo sensors: These controllers send out control signals as it gets dark
outside (or, alternatively, as the sun rises).
 Alarm interfaces: These controllers use an input from your security
system and sensors from the alarm system to trigger control commands.
335
Chapter 19: Home Automation Extravaganza

Wireless controllers
After you start getting an automated home up and running, you’re likely to
find that you have less and less inclination even to get up and walk over to
the controller sitting on the table across the living room from your comfy
couch. Luckily, automation manufacturers have exactly the answer you need
if you face this problem: wireless controllers.
For wireless automation protocols such as ZigBee and Z-Wave (and some
INSTEON devices), the wireless controller is a self-contained unit. Put batter-
ies in it, program it (typically using a USB connection to your PC), and you’re
ready to go. For automation protocols that use powerlines, wireless con-
trollers consist of two parts — an RF (radio frequency) receiver, which plugs
into the wall (and sends the actual commands over the powerline), and the
handheld or tabletop RF transmitter. Some of these handheld remotes also
serve double duty as IR remote controls, so you can use a single remote to
control the TV and audio systems as well as the lights.
You can find wireless controllers in all sizes and shapes, ranging from sixteen-
device controllers for the living-room table to small three- or four-module
controllers that can hang on your keychain. (These smaller devices are great
for controlling the modules that open your garage door or turn on your porch
lights.)
The fanciest of these wireless controllers — such as those sold by Monster
Cable (www.monstercable.com) and Leviton (www.leviton.com) in part-
nership or those sold by Logitech Harmony Remotes (www.logitech.com/
harmony) — have advanced programmability and are essentially slightly less
expensive versions of the touch panels we discuss next. There’s a thin line
between high-end wireless controllers and touch panels.
Touch panels
The fanciest controllers are the programmable touch-screen panels made by
companies such as SmartHome Manufacturing (at www.smartlinc.com)
and Control4 (www.control4.com). For about $500, these controllers enable
you to control and automate hundreds of modules by using a touch-sensitive
LCD screen.
You can use these systems also to create macros, or sequences of actions
that you want to trigger through a single touchpad command or a timed, pro-
grammed command. Most touch-panel controllers are also compatible with
two-way modules, so you can see an on-screen confirmation that your action
has been performed.
The combination of two-way modules and macro capability also enables
these controllers to set devices to certain levels of brightness. If you want to
set a light to a medium level of brightness, for example, this type of controller
can turn on the light, send a dim signal a certain number of times (to reach
336
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

your desired level of brightness), and then confirm remotely that the light is
set where you want it.
If you’re going to shell out a significant amount of money for a touch panel or
other high-end controller, get one that is two-way compatible and buy mod-
ules that can do two-way communications. These systems will make sure that
your control signals get to modules in your home and are carried out.
PC interfaces
If you want to get fancy with an automation network, you can supplement or
replace your stand-alone controllers with a PC-based control system. These
controllers use the horsepower of your PC and the familiar graphical inter-
face of Windows (or the Macintosh) to enable you to set up and control all
automation modules in your home.
The majority of PC-based controllers are two-way capable, so they control
and monitor the status of two-way modules. Many also provide inputs from
external sensors such as temperature monitors and photo sensors and use
these inputs to trigger commands.
Following are the two key components of a PC-based controller:
 Control software: Lets you program and control your automation net-
work using a graphical interface on your PC.
 Interface unit: Connects your computer to the home’s control network,
using the home-automation protocol you’ve chosen.
Most interface units connect to one of your PC’s USB ports, but you can find
other interfaces, such as internal PC cards. You may think that you can just
use your computer’s own powerline connection to the wall to do your con-
trolling, but the internal design of a PC doesn’t allow this. That’s why you
need this interface unit to create and send control signals over your home’s
powerlines.
Most PC interface units download and save your preferred settings in their
internal memory, so you don’t need to keep your PC running for your automa-
tion system to work. Some systems, however, require a PC that’s always on
(and always has the home-automation software running). Unless you have an
extra PC that you can dedicate to your home-automation network, think long
and hard about this requirement. On the other hand, if you have an old com-
puter sitting around, this sort of setup may be a great use for it.
You can interface with your PC home-automation software in the following
ways:
337
Chapter 19: Home Automation Extravaganza

 Keyboard: The simplest and most common way to set up and control
PC-based automation software is to use your keyboard and mouse. Using
a graphical interface, you can sit in front of your computer and program
timed and macro events for your controller to perform, or you can man-
ually control modules.
 Telephone: By using your computer’s modem, you can dial into your
home controller or PC from remote locations and trigger automation
commands using Touch-Tone key commands.
 Internet: With a broadband, always-on Internet connection (such as DSL
or a cable modem) and the right software, you can access your automa-
tion software from anywhere in the world using a Web browser. Your PC
turns into a Web server, creating remotely accessible Web pages display-
ing the status and controls for your house.
 Voice: The neatest way to utilize PC control of your automation 
network is by voice command. Systems such as HAL2000 (check out

phone connection or a microphone connected to your PC to speak com-
mands into your computer to trigger automation commands. These
systems not only listen to (and obey) you but also answer back to pro-
vide confirmation of your spoken commands.
Lights, AC (Powerline), Action
One of the most important areas of home automation is control over your
lighting systems. When we say control, we mean more than just turning lights
on and off (though that can be useful). With a true lighting-control system,
you can move beyond on and off and into the world of scenes, which allow
you to control groups of lights in a room or throughout the house to set the
mood for various occasions.
For example, you might have a scene programmed into your lighting con-
troller to dim the lights in your home theater when you want to watch a
movie, and another to dim all but your reading lamp when the TV is off and
you just want to catch up on your current favorite novel. Many people like to
create special scenes for the sleeping parts of their homes, so that the hall
light can remain on at a very dim setting, for example, and the bathroom
lights can be turned on to a nonblinding brightness when needed at night.
Although many general-purpose programmable controllers can be pro-
grammed with macros to create scenes to control lighting, we like to use a
purpose-built lighting system to create and control our scenes.

Traditionally, lighting-control systems have been the province of the very
rich and have required extra wiring, switches, and control panels. Big lighting
and wiring manufacturers, however, have brought high-end scene lighting to
the mass market using X10 powerline controls or wireless systems (ZigBee or
Z-Wave).
A good example of the X10 approach to scene control is the Toscana Deluxe
controller from Leviton. This system uses Leviton’s Intellisense-enhanced X10
protocol and can control up to 256 devices (the maximum allowed by any X10
system) and be programmed for up to 64 scenes. The Toscana controller can
be controlled and programmed by a Windows PC and a standard RS-232 serial
port, and can be controlled also using an IR remote control. (We talk about
these later in the chapter.) The Toscana system is mounted in a standard wall
outlet — but it’s wider than a regular wall switch so it uses a four-gang outlet

Internet-controlled electric usage
Energy companies are launching a range of
variable-rate pricing plans for consumer elec-
tricity, such that the rates during peak demand
times are higher than those during off-peak
times. Because no consumer wants to have to
memorize energy rate tables, Internet-connected
thermostats, such as those from market leader
Lightstat, Inc. (www.lightstat.com), pro-
vide consumers with a user-friendly way to pro-
gram their thermostats to do certain things
during specific rate periods. You log onto a Web
site that enables you to set your temperature
preferences for sleeping at night, when you’re
away at work during the day, and so on. And you
set your preferences for what to do when the
prices hit certain thresholds, such as turning off
one of your two water-heater elements to save
energy.
Some of the smarter thermostats go beyond just
the heating and cooling in the house. These
have a discrete output (like a relay) built into the
thermostat to control the water heater, for
instance. There has to be a relay on the water
heater, and the signal gets to the water heater
from the thermostat either by a low-voltage
cable or a wireless transmit/receive signal
(Bluetooth or similar). In the same way, the ther-
mostat could also turn off an electrical load
such as a pool pump (until the rates are cheap
again). In one implementation, Lightstat turns on
a natural-gas-fired emergency generator with
the thermostat and takes the whole house off
the utility grid when the price is high enough!
Houses that have alternate power-storage
capability, such as solar cells, can tap this
power in peak periods.
Leading home-automation programs, such as
HAL2000, are starting to link to the utility energy
databases to do the same thing for other devices
around the home, including appliances such as
dishwashers. Suppose a dishwasher uses around
58 kilowatt-hours per month. In one real-life
example, the electricity rates range from 4.2
cents a kilowatt-hour on nights and weekends to
10 cents on weekday afternoons — more than
double the cost. Add in air conditioning, the
washer, the dryer, and other devices, and you
can save a lot of money.

box. The system is two-way X10 compatible, so we recommend that you use
two-way modules with it. And if you want to get the benefits of the Leviton
Intellisense AGC (automatic gain control — which improves performance in
“noisy” powerline environments), you’ll need to use Leviton modules
(although any X10 module will work with the system).

Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 
Getting fancy with home automation
For home automation and control that goes
beyond even the functionality of most PC-based
control systems, you may want to consider a
high-end, proprietary home-automation system.
These are stand-alone systems that you usually
mount in a panel in your home’s wiring closet.
They have their own central-controller unit
(usually a PC-based computer), controllers, and
interfaces to a large number of other systems,
such as security systems, audio and video net-
works, telephone and intercom systems, and
external sensors.
If you walk into a really high-end A/V dealership
(the kind of place with $50,000 speaker systems
and the like), chances are you’ll see Crestron’s
systems on display next to the megabuck A/V
gear. Crestron is the choice for expensive smart
homes, and it’s not for the shallow of pocket-
book: A typical Crestron installation in a resi-
dential setting costs about $50,000.
If you can afford it, Crestron is a cool way to go.
The keys to Crestron’s system are a series of
touchpad controllers and a centralized computer-
based controller. With these pieces in place
(along with a wiring infrastructure of CAT-5e/6
and Crestron’s own powered CrestNet cable),
you can use the system to control just about
everything in your home — HVAC systems,
lighting, security, audio and video systems, 
and more. Crestron is more than just a con-
trol network. The combination of CAT-5e/6 
and CrestNet cable is used also as a distribu-
tion backbone for audio, video, and even com-
puter LAN networks throughout the home. 
If you’re looking for the ultimate in smart
homes, check out Crestron’s systems at www.
crestron.com.
If you’re looking for much of the same function-
ality at a slightly lower price, we recommend
that you check out Control4 (www.control4.
com). Control4 was started by some smart guys
who had previously worked with some of the
super-high-end, Crestron-style automation com-
panies, and their goal was to bring the same
kind of automation to a broader market. A full
Control4 system for a typical whole-home instal-
lation runs between $5,000 and $10,000. You get
essentially the same thing as you’d get from a
Crestron system for a lot less. Control4 systems
include ZigBee-based lighting controls, integra-
tion into home-security systems, whole-home
audio systems (including a neat iPod dock),
home-theater control, and more, with a great
interface and some cool touch-panel con-
trollers. How does Control4 do it more cheaply
than their competitors? Mainly by leveraging
standardized, mass produced components and
technologies — such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi and
ZigBee — instead of building everything from
scratch. Although you can’t install a Control4
system yourself (they sell through custom
installers, which is one of the cost elements),
and the programming takes some expertise,
they are much more widely available in the
kinds of stores “regular” people shop in, such
as Magnolia A/V stores, Ultimate Electronics,
Circuit City, and even Home Depot (in some 
markets).

On the wireless side of the coin, Leviton has recently launched a new Z-Wave-
powered solution called Vizia RF. (As we write in early 2007, this is brand
new.) This system consists of a range of plug-in modules, switches, and
dimmer switches that can be installed throughout the home and communi-
cate with each other wirelessly. Leviton also has a range of in-wall controllers
(light switches with built-in controller functionality) and handheld wireless
controllers. And they’ve also partnered with the folks at Monster Cable for the
development of a universal remote control that works with ViziaRF lighting/
control systems and also controls all of the components in your home theater
or entertainment system. Very cool stuff.
We think that both the powerline (X10 or other powerline system) approach
and the wireless (Z-Wave or ZigBee) approach are valid ways of controlling
lighting in the home. Both work well and the cost is about the same. As with
the rest of your home, you’ll likely use some of both approaches, albeit prob-
ably within one manufacturer’s product line. We do recommend that you buy
a good quality product because the higher-end products tend to have more
robust capabilities to deal with interference from other devices in the home.
Control Networks for Entertainment
Systems
Home-audio and -video systems present a special case for home automation
and control because you probably want to do a lot more with a VCR or CD
player than just turn it on and off. In fact, you need a whole host of com-
mands that lighting and appliance-focused automation standards don’t even
begin to address, such as start and stop, pause, and fast forward.
In a single room, you can take care of these functions using an infrared (IR)
remote control — either the control that came with your equipment or a pro-
grammable universal remotes. Unfortunately, IR remote controls are line-of-
sight and can’t carry signals between rooms. So unless you can somehow
suspend the laws of physics, pressing repeatedly on the pause button of your
VCR’s remote doesn’t do you a bit of good if you’re in the bedroom and the
VCR is downstairs in the living room. You have the following three common
ways of getting around this problem:
 Use a radio frequency (RF) remote system, if your equipment supports it.
 Use an RF repeater system to expand the reach of your IR remote.
 Use a wired IR repeater system to send the remote-control signals from
one room to another.
341
Chapter 19: Home Automation Extravaganza

Using RF remotes
Radio waves have one big advantage over light waves (including those of the
infrared variety): They can get through and around obstacles such as walls,
furniture, and large house pets. This particular trait makes radio waves ideal
for whole-home remote-control systems. Unfortunately, because they cost
more, RF remote controls are rarely part of the consumer-electronics pack-
age. If your entertainment-network needs are simple (for example, you just
want to watch the output of your DBS satellite dish from a different TV), you
may be able to find components fitted with an RF remote. Sony, for example,
sells a DSS receiver system with an RF remote for just this purpose.
If your network becomes a bit more complicated, or if you already have the
components and are stuck with IR remotes, you do have a solution. Several
manufacturers offer wireless RF-repeater systems for IR remotes. Setting one
of these systems up is a piece of cake. Most consist of just two parts: a trans-
mitter that converts IR signals from your remote control to radio waves and
beams them out throughout your home, and a corresponding receiver that
reverses the process and sends the reconverted IR signals to your audio and
video equipment. All you need to do is plug the receiver into a wall near the
equipment that you want to control and do the same with the transmitter 
in your remote location. Some transmitters even come in a small, battery-
powered package — all you need to do is slip such a transmitter over the end
of your IR remote control and carry it to wherever you want listen or watch.
We’ve seen another variation on this theme as well. Consisting of the same
transmitter/receiver duo, some systems plug into a wall outlet and carry your
remote-control signals over your home’s AC powerlines instead of using RF
signals.
Both these systems should work reasonably well, but they do have the fol-
lowing downsides:
 RF signals are better than IR at getting through and around obstacles,
but as anyone with a cordless phone can tell you, they’re not foolproof.
Long distances, thick walls, and interference by other RF sources can
cause problems.
 Powerline solutions can also suffer from interference and electrical
noise in your electrical wiring.
 RF and powerline repeater systems aren’t sophisticated enough for use
in elaborate, multizoned audio- and video-distribution systems — they
can’t distinguish between zones or discriminate between multiple pieces
of audio or video source equipment.
342
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

Using a wired IR repeater system
The best way to distribute audio and video control signals throughout your
home is to install a hardwired, IR-signal-distribution network. In this kind of
system, the IR signals from a standard handheld remote or wall-mounted
keypad convert to electrical signals. These signals then travel to your enter-
tainment center over in-wall wiring that runs to your audio or video equip-
ment room and, by using devices known as emitters, are converted back into
IR signals that can control your systems.
You can wire an IR network in one of the following three ways:
 You can run dedicated IR cables along with your audio and video signal-
distribution wiring.
Using IR cables is the old way of doing a whole-home IR control network.
You can still find and buy this stuff, but most people have moved onto
the next solution, using CAT-5e/6 cables.
 You can use an IR repeater system that uses CAT-5e/6 UTP cabling to
carry the signals. Many of the CAT-5e/6 video and audio systems that we
discuss in Chapters 7 and 9 carry IR control signals along with your
audio and video source signals, so you can carry everything on a single
CAT-5e/6.
 You can piggyback the IR signals on the RG6 coaxial cabling that you use
for video distribution (as we mention in Chapter 7).
The third option, using existing coaxial video-distribution cables, requires
you to have audio- and video-network outlets in the same locations. If you
have some audio outlets (or wall speakers) in places where no video outlet is
present, you can’t control the system in that location.
The following components are common to any IR network:
 Infrared sensors: These devices convert the IR signal from a handheld
remote into a DC electrical signal that you can distribute over your IR
wiring. IR sensors come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including wall-
mounted units, tabletop units, and even minisized sensors that you can
hide in a small hole in the wall.
 Infrared emitters: At the other end of an IR network (next to your audio
and video equipment), you install devices known as emitters. An emitter
converts the DC electrical signal back into an IR signal and beams this
signal to your equipment. Some companies call these devices IR blasters.
343
Chapter 19: Home Automation Extravaganza

 Emitter-connecting blocks: These devices enable you to connect IR 
sensors in different rooms to single or multiple emitters. If you have a
multizone audio system, an emitter-connecting block is an essential
component of the IR control network because it enables you to separate
IR signals by zone — so the signals from a particular zone go only to
equipment that serves the same zone. For a system that uses CAT-5e/6
cabling instead of IR cabling, you can use a standard CAT-5e/6 patch
panel to connect cables and route IR signals to and from your media
room.
 IR keypad controllers: You can use a keypad controller in place of a
handheld remote and IR sensor. Keypads are not required and cost more
than simple sensors, but they’re cool. Mounted on the wall like a light
switch, the keypad controller can learn the IR commands that your
system uses and send them back to your emitters at the push of a
button.

Making Home Automation 
a Reality
In This Chapter
 Discovering X10 tips and tricks
 Finding control and automation for everyone
 Having your sensors do it for you
 Building an IR network
I
n Chapter 19, we talk about all the things that make up your automated
home. In this chapter, we talk about wiring and design strategies for
putting it all together. Specifically, we talk about home-automation networks
and IR control networks. Neither of these networks requires much in the way
of special wiring — especially the powerline and wireless networks for home
automation and control, but certain IR networks do require the installation of
control wiring.
Installation is only half the battle in these kinds of systems, however. The real
trick is to configure all the sensors, modules, emitters, keypads, and so on to
make sure that they work together correctly. For simple networks — such as
X10 lighting controls or IR controllers for single-zone audio networks — this
configuration isn’t too difficult, but more complicated systems can test your
patience, diligence, and skill at reading manuals. We can’t simply tell you how
to get your Xantech IR controller keypad, for example, to turn on and off your
Toshiba HD-DVD player and Harmon Kardon amplifier — just too many vari-
ables exist for us to cover everything. What we can do, however, is give you a
good jumping-off point for getting a home-automation and control infrastruc-
ture in place and provide you with some useful tips.
In the first half of this chapter, as we talk about automation systems, we talk
about ways you can create an automation system using any of the protocols
we discuss in Chapter 19. We have a slight focus on the powerline systems
(particularly X10) only because these have long been the most popular
options, but our advice here applies equally to systems using any of the
(many) home-automation protocols on the market. We aren’t focusing on any

one protocol because there’s simply no telling at this point (early 2007)
which of the competing protocols will become most popular. For example,
three newer protocols are vying to replace X10 as the default powerline com-
munications method for home automation, and ZigBee and Z-Wave are still in
the early days of battling it out in the wireless market. Our advice here is a
bit generic, but — just to repeat ourselves — it will apply regardless of which
protocol you choose.
If you are using a wireless protocol such as Z-Wave or ZigBee, you can disre-
gard all of the discussions about how to overcome the issues facing power-
line communications.
X10 Marks the Spot
The wonderful thing about X10 (and other home-automation standards that
use powerline communications) is that the installation’s effects on your
home’s wiring infrastructure are minimal. However, you should consider
having an electrician do a few things to optimize your home’s wiring for 
powerline control (and we describe such changes in the following sections).
These optimizations aren’t complicated or expensive.
After your powerlines are ready for control networks, setting up the compo-
nents is the epitome of plug and play. Plug a module into a power receptacle,
plug the light or appliance into it, and that part of your network is complete.
This simplicity combined with the low cost of components are the main rea-
sons why powerline continues to be the default recommendation for home-
automation systems for many folks.
You can take a few additional steps and precautions to ensure that every-
thing works together in happiness and harmony: install bridges, noise blocks,
signal amplifiers, and X10-, Insteon-, UPB-compatible surge protectors, as well
as make sure that all your receptacles have three wires rather than two.
Building bridges
Depending on the state of the electrical wiring in your house, your electrician
may need to install a device known as a signal coupler in your electrical serv-
ice panel. This handy-dandy little unit — which costs about $50 — enables
the powerline signals to get around the house even if the electrical system is
split into two circuits.
The powerline that comes into your home from the utility company usually
consists of a two-phase, 220-volt powerline (two 110-volt phases). After this
line connects to your service panel or breaker box, the two phases split from
346
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

each other to provide 110-volt powerlines to all standard outlets, switches,
and hardwired fixtures. (A few outlets in your home, such as those for elec-
tric clothes dryers, use both phases for 220-volt circuits.) Because of this
separation, powerline signals in some homes have a hard time getting across
from one phase to the other. So a controller connecting to an electrical circuit
in one room may not “see” a module in another room that runs on the other
phase of the circuit. The signal coupler forms a bridge that enables the com-
mands to jump across to the other phase.
A good way to tell whether a powerline problem is caused by this phase issue
is to turn on an electric oven or dryer (these devices typically use 220-volt
AC and effectively create a temporary bridge between the two legs when
they’re on). If your problem goes away when the oven is on, you need a cou-
pler to correct the problem permanently.
Keep those nosy (or noisy) neighbors 
off your powerline
Powerline signals aren’t powerful — you don’t need to worry about one trav-
eling back up your powerlines and sending your local nuclear reactor into
meltdown. Powerline signals could, however, go from house to house in the
small local area served by the local transformer for your house (that round
thing on the telephone pole), disrupting your carefully planned powerline
system.
Other powerline signals aren’t the only thing that can make powerline signals
act a bit funky. Electrical interference of all kinds finds its way into power-
lines, giving you a noisy power supply, which can disrupt command signals.
If your powerline network is behaving weirdly or if you’re just the cautious
type, you may want to have an electrician install a noise block inline to your
electrical power feed, just before the circuit-breaker box. This device should
stop any incoming interference and keep the neighbors’ controllers from trig-
gering your modules.
Most of the noise blocks we’ve seen (ranging from $70 cheap ones to fancy
$500 models) include signal-coupling functionality as well. So the electrician
can make only one trip to kill these two birds (the noise block and the 
coupler).
Dozens of items in a typical home — for example, fluorescent lights, air con-
ditioners, fax machines, and even computers or audio equipment — can
interfere with powerline signals by creating noise on the electrical power-
lines. In some cases, the circuits and chips within these devices send unin-
tended electrical energy back into the power infrastructure that can confuse
347
Chapter 20: Making Home Automation a Reality

your X10 (or other powerline system) into thinking they are control signals —
or block your signals from getting through at all. In these cases, you can
install an inline noise filter (that plugs in between the noisy device and the
wall) or a hardwired filter (for devices that are hardwired into the electrical
system, such as air conditioners).
Noise-blocking filters are easy to install (especially the plug-in inline filters).
The hard part is figuring out which of the dozens or hundreds of electrical
devices in your house are causing the problem. You can buy an X10 signal-
testing device, which may help you track down problems, but the best
approach for most people is good old-fashioned trial and error. (We’ve not
yet seen similar testers for other powerline protocols, probably because they
are less susceptible to problems.) When you have issues with a certain pow-
erline module not receiving signals, start turning off electrical devices until
your module works again. Nope, it’s not rocket science, but it does work!
When you find the offender, simply install a noise filter and get back to your
powerline-automated lifestyle.
The newer powerline systems (such as Insteon, UPB, and LonWorks) are
much more robust — meaning their protocols are better at discerning control
signals from the background noise on the powerlines. If you’re starting from
scratch, we highly recommend that you use one of these protocols or a wire-
less protocol (such as ZigBee or Z-Wave) rather than going with X10. If you’re
wedded to X10 (because of an existing installation or because certain compo-
nents of your automation system aren’t available with the newer protocols),
we recommend that you choose an enhanced X10 solution using AGC (auto-
matic gain control), such as the Leviton Intellisense system we discuss in
Chapter 19.
Boost that signal
In an average-sized home, X10 signals coming from controllers (or back over
the network from two-way modules) are usually strong enough to reach any
spot in the house — as long as there’s a signal coupler in place. Like many
other things (cars, packs of toilet paper, and supersized fries, to name a few),
houses are getting bigger. After a house hits about 3000 square feet, X10 sig-
nals start having a hard time reaching distant nooks and crannies. The solu-
tion here is to install an X10-signal amplifier/repeater in the main electrical
panel.
There’s no big mystery about what a signal amplifier/repeater does (this is
definitely a case where the name fits). X10 signals entering the electrical
panel pass through the signal amplifier/repeater, and the signal is boosted
(amplified) and repeated to ensure that it reaches remote modules with suffi-
cient strength to be understood by the module.
348
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

Even in smaller homes, a signal amplifier/repeater can come in handy as a
way of getting around noisy electrical lines because the stronger signal is
easier for modules to pick out from background noise. In fact, Leviton recom-
mends that you always install their signal amplifier/repeater whenever you
install their DHC X10 systems.
Signal amplifier/repeaters almost always have a built-in signal coupler, so you
won’t need a separate coupler.
Although the newer powerline systems are better at reaching every outlet in
your home, they’re not perfect. You can buy amplifiers/repeaters for these
systems as well, if your home needs them.
Surge protectors kill powerline signals
Surge protectors, devices that protect your sensitive electronic equipment
from transient voltages (such as lightning strikes on utility poles), can be real
lifesavers. Ask people who have had a power surge zap a computer or televi-
sion, and they’ll tell you how much they wish they’d invested $30 or $40 on a
decent surge protector.
Unfortunately, many surge protectors not only filter out bad stuff such as
lightning but also remove or disable powerline signals. So you’re left with an
unpleasant choice: Protect your equipment from surges or automate it?
Luckily, you have the following two ways of getting around this problem:
 Install X10-compatible (or other powerline protocol compatible) surge
protector strips (which don’t cost any more than good-quality conven-
tional ones) and plug your appliance modules into the strips.
 Take a whole-home approach to surge protection and have an electrician
install a whole-home surge suppressor at your breaker box. These sup-
pressors cost about $200 (the same as five or six good-quality strips),
and they protect every circuit in your home.
When lightning strikes, no one can predict where it will hit. Your powerline
(safely protected behind a surge protector) may not be the thing that gets
struck. There are plenty of other electrical paths to your home’s other sensi-
tive electronics — antenna and cable TV cables, phone lines, or even satellite
dishes and their cables. It makes good sense to install surge protectors on all
these systems, just in case.
349
Chapter 20: Making Home Automation a Reality

Wire those switches right
As your electrician is installing junction boxes and wiring for light switches in
your home, tell him or her to do the following (and you’ll really sound like
you know what you’re doing!): Run the neutral wire to the light switch’s junc-
tion box instead of bypassing it.
Having all the wires run to the switch rather than running some to the switch
and some directly to the light gives you more freedom to install powerline
automated switches in the future.
Each of the 110-volt electrical circuits in a house consists of three separate
wires: a hot wire (usually black), which supplies the current to the circuit, a
neutral wire (usually white), which provides a return path for the current, and
a ground wire (usually green), which grounds the circuit for safety. The con-
ventional way to install light switches is to connect the hot wire to one side
of the switch and run another wire, called the load (usually blue), from the
switch to the light (or other device) itself. The neutral and ground wires often
bypass the switch and run directly to the light. So the switch just interrupts
the flow of the hot wire’s current to the light: The light itself completes and
grounds the circuit.
In an X10 environment, the wiring scheme for switches limits what you can
control with an X10 light switch. X10 switches can control only incandescent
light fixtures if you wire the switches this way — because the light bulb fila-
ment itself provides a path for the X10 signals, something that fluorescent
and low-voltage lights can’t do. If you want to use a switch to control fluores-
cent lights, low-voltage track lighting, or appliances, you need to use a spe-
cial inductive dimmer or appliance switch that connects all the wires: the hot
wire, the load wire, and the neutral wire. So all these wires must be available
at the junction box.
For more information on how to wire electrical switches and how not to fry
yourself while working with them, please check out Home Improvement For
Dummies, by Gene and Katie Hamilton and the editors of HouseNet (pub-
lished by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Some of the fancy X10-controllable mood-lighting switches also require this
neutral wire connection, even for incandescent lights.

Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

Controlling Your Home-Automation
Systems
You can use X10, INSTEON, Z-Wave, and other home-automation protocols
and equipment in one of the following two ways:
 As a simple home-control system that enables you to perform actions in
one part of the house while you’re in another part of the house
 As part of a true automated system that performs actions on its own,
based on a schedule or on events that it detects
The modularity of automation systems and the fact that they’re based on
common standards that ensure that each manufacturer’s equipment works
with another’s (within the bounds of that protocol — X10 modules won’t talk
to ZigBee modules, for example) make it easy to start with a simple home-
control network and gradually build your way up to a fully automated system.
You just add new components to the network as you go. So if you’re not con-
vinced that an automated home is for you, you can start with a few compo-
nents and — if the automation bug bites — go crazy with it later.
Keeping it simple
If you just want to get your feet wet in the home-automation world, we recom-
mend that you start with a simple plug-in module-based home-control net-
work. You probably don’t need to worry about electrical-wiring considerations
or how to connect your computer to the network. All you really need to do is
to plug a few lamp or appliance modules and a controller of some sort into
your AC powerlines.
We can’t promise that you aren’t going to experience some electrical-wiring
difficulties, even in a simple X10 network, but most people don’t.
For a total investment of less than about $75 (about $11 for the controller and
$8 for each lamp or appliance module), you can set up a simple network that
controls eight lights or small appliances from a central location. Expanding
this network is as simple as adding more modules and controllers as your
needs expand. You may want a controller in the living room to set the right
lighting levels for movie watching and another in the master bedroom to turn
on a bunch of lights if you hear something go bump in the night.

Chapter 20: Making Home Automation a Reality

You can also expand your control network by using wireless controllers (per-
haps as part of your home-theater universal remote control) that enable you
to trigger controls without leaving the comfort of your couch or the front
porch.
If you want to add a degree of automation to your control network, simply
plug a programmable controller into the system. Doing so enables you to
create simple timed programs to activate or turn off various modules.
Adding a computer for more control
Adding a personal computer to the mix enables you to bring a new level of
sophistication to a home-control and home-automation network. The addi-
tion of a home-automation protocol interface (in other words, a device that
plugs into your computer and “speaks” your chosen protocol) and graphical-
interface software on your PC enable you to create complicated on/off 
schedules quickly and easily. The ease of using a computer interface for 
this purpose — instead of trying to fiddle with a small, somewhat unintuitive
programmable controller — is worth the price of admission.
But wait — there’s more! (We loved those old Ginsu knife commercials.) By
using the computer software, you can program your PC’s home-automation
interface box to perform macros — sets of consecutive commands, such as
turn on the kitchen light, start the coffee pot, and open the curtains. After
you create a macro, you can save it and use it again. For example, you could

Linking your car and home with HomeLink
More than 140 new car models are now available
with a remote-control system called HomeLink.
For most folks, the main selling point for this
system is its capability to operate most garage-
door openers; you don’t need to search under the
seat for the door-opener remote. HomeLink is
integrated into your car’s interior — usually in
the headliner above the rearview mirror — and
usually consists of two or three pushbuttons
(each of which controls a single device). Some
cars include HomeLink controller buttons on the
car’s remote entry key fob.
In a smart-home environment, however, you
can also use one or more of the HomeLink’s RF
channels (most versions have three) to trig-
ger wireless X10 controllers to send commands
to such devices as lights and even X10-
compatible security systems — from the warmth
and comfort of your car. HomeLink isn’t sold as
an after-market add-in — instead, it’s sold as a
built-in, integral part of the car (although some
automakers sell HomeLink as a dealer-installed
accessory that you can have installed in certain
car models after the fact). To find out more
about HomeLink, look on the Web at http://
www.homelink.com.

create a lighting macro for TV watching, and then schedule it for whenever
your favorite shows are on. You can even download macros from the Internet
and apply them to your system.
Making your home interactive
Remotely controlling and scripting your home-automation systems are pretty
cool ways of automating your home, but you can bring an automated home to
a higher level by making it interactive and intelligent. By combining sensors
with your X10 control systems, you can program your home to react to cer-
tain events by turning on lights, alerting you with a chime, or even muting
your TV.
You can integrate sensors into a home-automation system in the following
ways:
 You can keep things within the realm of your automation system, utiliz-
ing sensors with built-in automation controllers to trigger events.
 You can integrate an alarm system with your home-automation network
and use the alarm’s sensors to trigger home-automation events.
 If you have a sophisticated PC-based or stand-alone home-automation
controller, you can directly connect sensors to the controller.
353
Chapter 20: Making Home Automation a Reality
Put your network on the Net
Suppose that you control your home’s X10 net-
work with a PC and also have an always-on
cable-modem or DSL connection to the Internet.
Why not put the two together and use the
Internet connection to control your PC from
work or even from your laptop’s wireless Net
connection wherever you are? Well, you can do
just that with HAI’s Omni controller system and
WebLink II software (check out www.home
auto.com). The total package (the high-end
hardware controller and the Web-based soft-
ware) costs about $1500, which includes the
professional installation of a system that con-
trols not only lights but also the thermostat and
a security system. HAI can also integrate touch-
pad controllers for remote control of your
audio/video network.
WebLink II uses a standard Windows PC as a
Web server. The WebLink II software creates a
series of interactive Web pages that can give
you the current status of your home and control
of any devices in your home that are connected
to the Omni controller. You can turn lights and
appliances on and off (individually or by using
lighting scenes as discussed in Chapter 19),
adjust the thermostat, and arm or disarm the
security system. You can even use the software
to remotely view video surveillance cameras
that you’ve connected to the PC. The WebLink II
software can also be set up to send you e-mail
alerts or messages when certain conditions
have occurred (such as an alarm condition or
the kids returning home from school).

The following sections elaborate on these three methods.
Automation sensors
The simplest way to integrate sensors into a home-automation network is to
install sensors that use your chosen automation protocol in your home.
These sensors combine the sensor itself (a photocell or passive infrared
detector, for example) and a controller that can send automation and control
commands to several addresses. You don’t need to go through a central con-
troller for these devices — just assign some command actions to them (such
as turning on certain lights) and plug them into a powerline receptacle. It’s
that simple.
Among the automation sensors that we’ve seen are the following:
 Photocells: Unless you live way up North, you can plan on the sun
coming up and going down every day. By using a photocell, your home
can distinguish the light from the dark and automatically turn lights on
at dusk and off at dawn.
 Motion detectors: By using a PIR, these wall-mounted sensors can send
several automation commands if they detect motion. You might want to
install one in the upstairs hallway, for example, and set it to automati-
cally turn on the hall lights if someone walks by.
Many motion detectors also have a built-in photocell so that you can set
them to turn on lights only as darkness falls.
 Motion-detector floodlights: These outdoor lights function just like the
standard motion-detector lights that guide your path down the front
walk after your dog forces you into yet another late-night walk. By using
a PIR, these lights turn themselves on if someone (or something — such
as that pesky dog from next door) walks into their detection field. After
they turn on, the floodlights also send out a number of control signals
and trigger other modules such as those controlling inside lights or
chime modules.
 Low-voltage sensor module: This type of module accepts the output of
almost any stand-alone sensor — such as a magnetic door-closure
sensor, a doorbell, a driveway sensor, or even a nonautomated burglar
alarm — and sends a command if something activates the sensor.
Using an alarm with built-in automation functionality
As we discuss in Chapter 17, a typical home-security system is chock full of
sensors — door-contact sensors, window-contact sensors, glass-breakage
354
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

detectors, PIRs, pressure-sensitive doormats, and many more. The primary
function of these sensors is, of course, to monitor your house for bad guys
and trigger the alarm if necessary. By using an automation-protocol-equipped
alarm system (or by adding an automation controller expansion module to
certain brands of existing alarm systems), you can make these sensors serve
double duty.
355
Chapter 20: Making Home Automation a Reality
Voice control, the ultimate in interactivity
A few home-automation control software pack-
ages include voice activation as the primary
means of controlling your home’s systems. Using
recent developments in speech recognition,
these systems (most notably the HomeVoice
system by Applied Future Technologies and the
HAL2000 from Home Automated Living) enable
you to speak in plain English to initiate X10 or 
IR commands. So you can boss your house
around, Star Trek style, turning on lights or open-
ing drapes without lifting a finger.
A discreet, omnidirectional microphone (or a
telephone, for remote access) picks up the
sound of your voice and feeds it into the micro-
phone input of your PC’s sound card. The
speech-recognition software then translates
your commands and correlates them with stored
X10 or IR commands and sends the appropriate
control signals out over your home’s powerline
or IR network. These products can also use
speech synthesis to talk back to you — giving
you a confirmation that your command was
heard and carried out. Neat stuff.
Connecting a microphone to the sound card of
your PC and getting the system up and running
in the same room that contains your computer
and computer-to-X10 interface are simple tasks.
The job becomes a bit trickier, however, if you
want to use voice control throughout the house.
To do so, you need to install microphones in
each room and run microphone cable back to
the controller location. Because most sound
cards have only one microphone input, you
need to combine all incoming microphone leads
into a microphone mixer, which sends a single
signal into the PC. (On the horizon is a method
that uses distributed microphones built into light
switches or other distributed devices that can
process the sound at the origin and send over
X10 only the actual command inputs.)
Both systems are software-based and run on
most Pentium-class PCs. They’re compatible
with most computer-to-X10 interfaces, so you
can easily add voice control into an existing
system. Microphones cost about $90 each, but
the mixers we’ve seen are expensive. (The Home-
Voice mixer kit, which also includes a limiter/
gate device to help filter out background noise,
costs nearly $700.) The software itself isn’t too
expensive — $239 for HomeVoice and $169 for
HAL2000.
We think that voice control is a logical next step
for home-automation and home-control net-
works and something you’re going to see more
of in the future.

The simplest of these alarm systems activate X10 commands (such as All On)
in an alarm condition — in other words, they turn on your lights if the alarm
siren sounds. This setup isn’t really the kind of home automation we’re talk-
ing about, but it does add a nice security feature. (Being able to see where
you’re going sure would be nice after you peel yourself off the ceiling during a
middle-of-the-night alarm.)
More sophisticated systems take a subtler approach in that they offer levels
of reaction to various sensor inputs. In other words, these security systems
are smart enough to know that certain sensor inputs don’t necessarily spell
doom. A pressure-sensitive doormat or a driveway sensor, for example, tells
the system that someone is there, whether a burglar or the UPS delivery
person. Obviously, the system’s reaction to these sensor inputs should be
something less than a full alarm. (No need to call out the cavalry if it’s just
the pizza guy.)
These security systems can interface with your automation network in the
following ways:
 A sensor input can trigger a random automation output to create a
“lived-in” look. An outdoor PIR motion detector, for example, may cause
your alarm control panel to send control signals to lights in several dif-
ferent rooms, turning them on and off at seemingly random intervals.
 In the most advanced of these systems, you can program specific sensor
inputs to trigger specific control outputs. So the motion detector in the
backyard can turn on the rear porch lights, or the driveway sensor can
turn on the carriage lights running from the driveway to the front door.
Combining sensors with a central controller
The biggest drawback to having an alarm trigger automation events is that
most alarm systems are limited in their capabilities. You can think of these
systems as alarms with some automation control added on, not as full-blown
controller systems.
If you want to create a sophisticated, interactive home-automation system —
one that combines a large number of sensors with a whole bunch of potential
corresponding commands — consider using a high-end PC-based or stand-
alone home-control system.
These systems directly accept the inputs of a number of sensors and can
control hundreds of automation modules and even nonautomated hardwired
systems (such as heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems and
sprinkler controls), based on the settings you enter into the system’s control
interface.
356
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

Many of these central controller systems include an alarm system component
or can integrate with many nonautomated alarm systems.
These intelligent home controllers can accept the following two types of
sensor inputs:
 Analog inputs: These sensors can detect a range of measurements, such
as temperature sensors or moisture/humidity detectors.
 Digital inputs: These sensors either detect a condition or don’t detect
one, such as motion/no motion sensors.
The wiring for these sensors varies — depending on the individual sensor
type and manufacturer — but most use wiring similar to what you use for
wiring alarm sensors (two- or four-conductor wiring, although some tempera-
ture sensors use three-conductor wiring). The key to integrating sensors into
such a system is to anticipate as much of your sensor needs as you can
upfront so that you can have your installer run the right wires ahead of time.
After you connect the sensors to your controller, you can program them
(using a computer or a television and the system’s graphical-interface soft-
ware) and even create event-driven macros that map sensor inputs to spe-
cific control outputs. The sky’s the limit here — if a system is controllable,
you can match it to a sensor input. We’d like to find a way to turn on the lawn
sprinklers if a salesperson comes to our door, but we haven’t yet been able to
find a sensor that can differentiate between the Fuller Brush man and the
next-door neighbor.
Getting IR Around the House
As we mention in Chapter 19, automation systems are a great way of control-
ling all sorts of devices in a home, but they’re not ideal for taking care of the
complicated commands that you need to control audio and video systems.
You can rig up something like an X10/IR converter system to perform this
task, but doing so is complicated and a case of reinventing the wheel.
We make that last statement because you already have a great way of control-
ling audio and video systems — by using IR remotes. The only problem with
IR remotes is that IR signals don’t pass through walls and floors. You can
solve this problem by using a radio frequency IR-extender system — this is
the cheap and easy solution. Unfortunately, the RF method isn’t quite up to
the job of controlling multiple systems in multizone networks. To do that, you
need a wired IR-repeater network.
357
Chapter 20: Making Home Automation a Reality

If you’re sending audio and video signals around your house using one of the
next-generation CAT-5e/6 systems, such as Leviton’s Decora Media System or
ChannelPlus’s SVC-10, you probably don’t need an extra network to handle
your IR networking needs. Most of these systems (including the two men-
tioned) use spare conductors on the CAT-5e/6 cable that carries the audio and
video signals around the house to also carry IR signals. This is a neat, inte-
grated way of creating an A/V network — you don’t need separate audio, video,
and IR control infrastructures. Remote control of these network systems is usu-
ally accomplished with a touchpad or an IR sensor built into the remote CAT-
5e/6 faceplate (or sometimes both — a touchpad with a built-in IR receiver).
Similarly, wireless (Wi-Fi) entertainment systems (such as the Sonos Music
System) can handle all of the control of your source materials over the wireless
link, so there’s no real need for an IR control network in these cases either!
Making your coaxial cable work overtime
If you have a coaxial cable network to distribute video signals throughout the
home and if the endpoints of this network correspond with the endpoints of
your audio network (or you don’t have a whole-home audio network), you
can avoid running extra wires throughout the home by running IR signals
over that coaxial cable.
To do so, you need to install devices known as IR signal injector/splitters,
which perform two tasks. In remote locations, the signal injector/splitter
combines the electrical signal that an IR sensor sends with the video signals
running over your coaxial network. In your media equipment room, another
signal injector/splitter splits the same signal out from the coaxial cable and
feeds it to an IR emitter to control your equipment. Figure 20-1 shows how
these devices fit into a coaxial network.
Many newer audio/video devices, such as receivers and DVD players, are
built with the home networker in mind and come with a jack on the back for
connecting to remote IR systems. In these cases, you don’t need to use an IR
emitter. Instead, you connect the IR cable directly into this jack, usually using
a stereo miniplug like the one used for headphones on iPods and portable CD
players. Makes for a neater appearance and usually works better — we like
this trend a lot.
The signal injector/splitter needs electrical power to do its thing because it’s
creating an electrical signal from an IR sensor output. You have the following
two ways of providing this power to the devices:
358
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

 You can install a remote power injector near your coaxial distribution
panel. One of these devices provides power for the entire network.
 You can use a video-distribution panel (discussed in detail in Chapter 7),
which has a built-in power injector. Note: Some coaxial panel makers 
call this feature an IR engine (and no, it doesn’t burn high-octane fuel)
because it powers all remote IR sensors.
You can configure the guts of this IR network — where the IR signal splits off
the coaxial network and goes to IR emitters — in one of the following ways:
 If you’re controlling only one or two devices (such as a single VCR or an
audio receiver and a CD player), simply connect the IR output of the
signal injector (it has both an RF output and an IR output) to a single or
dual IR emitter. The emitters themselves usually stick right onto the IR
sensor of the equipment they control, so you need one per piece of
equipment.
 If you’re controlling more than two pieces of A/V equipment in one loca-
tion, you can connect your signal injector/splitter to an IR expansion
block, which enables you to connect multiple emitters to a single 
injector/splitter.
You can find IR-over-coax gear from most vendors of coaxial video network
equipment. We like the stuff from ChannelPlus (www.channelplus.com).

Chapter 20: Making Home Automation a Reality

Being dedicated
Using coaxial cable is a perfectly adequate method of IR distribution, but the
optimal way of carrying IR signals throughout a house is to build a separate
IR control network using its own wiring. This setup provides the most flexibil-
ity and reliability and makes controlling several components in a multizone
audio system easier.
In this section, we discuss two ways of creating a dedicated A/V control net-
work in your home: using the traditional approach of dedicated IR control
wires, and using the newer approach of using CAT-5e/6 cabling. We prefer the
CAT-5e/6 method, and most manufacturers are moving (or have already
moved) their product lines to support this approach.
The traditional approach
Traditionally, hardwired IR-distribution networks use simple three-conductor
shielded cable (sold as IR cable in most catalogs and stores) to connect
remote locations back to your audio and video network equipment. You wire
this cable in a simple star architecture, with an individual run coming from
each control point back to the audio/video equipment room, as shown in
Figure 20-2. You can also run your IR cabling in a daisy-chain fashion, with a
single cable running from room to room, connecting all your sensors and key-
pads. This type of wiring works only with a single-zone audio network, and
we recommend that you don’t try to save money on IR cable (which costs
only about ten cents a foot) by running your cabling this way.
360
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 
Multizone IR considerations
If the roster of devices that an IR network con-
trols includes a multizone audio system, you
need to use a connecting block specifically
designed for multiple-zone systems. This require-
ment stems from the fact that some of the com-
ponents in this system are zone-specific, and
others are common to the entire system. The
amplifier that powers the speakers in a particu-
lar zone, for example, is used (and controlled)
only in that zone, while all zones share the CD
or DVD player.
A multizone connecting block separates the
common and shared IR signals by providing
separate sets of emitter connections: common
emitter signals and zone-specific emitter sig-
nals. This separation is especially important if,
for example, you use the same type of amplifier
in several different zones. By using the zone-
specific emitter signal, you can direct which
amplifier you actually want to turn up (or turn
off).
Getting a multizone system up and running can
prove a difficult and frustrating process — and
one best left to a professional. Trust us on this
one.

Even if you start with a single-zone speaker wire audio system, you may want
to upgrade to a multizone system some day. A star-architecture speaker wire
system used for a single-zone audio network can be easily upgraded to multi-
zone with some additional equipment in the network. Don’t get caught with
an IR system that has to be completely reworked — wire your IR network the
same way, with individual cabling runs to each remote location.

Chapter 20: Making Home Automation a Reality
Plugging in the PC
As the PC becomes more integrated into your
home’s audio and video networks, you’ll find
that having a way to control audio equipment
while sitting in front of the computer (or having
your computer do this automatically) can come
in handy. For example, if you’re using your PC as
a PVR and recording TV shows on the PC’s hard
drive, it’s necessary to give the PC (and your
PVR software on the PC, such as SnapStream’s
Personal Video Station) the capability to tune
your TV, cable set-top box, or DSS receiver to
the channel you want to record. Most of these
solutions use an IR emitter with a USB interface
to the PC. The PVR software on the PC then
sends an IR signal out through this USB inter-
face, which can control the channel changing.
If your PC isn’t in the same room as the video
source equipment (and it probably won’t be),
you can aim the IR emitter from this USB inter-
face at an IR receiver installed in the room
where the computer is located, and use your
wired IR infrastructure to carry the commands
back to your media room.

Connecting the endpoints of this network — the IR sensors and keypads and
IR emitters — to the IR cabling infrastructure is easy. Sensors and keypads
connect directly to the end of the IR cable in remote locations — nothing
complicated about that. On the equipment end of the network, all your IR
cable “home runs” terminate on a connecting block, which then provides a
number of outputs for IR emitters. The IR emitters simply plug into these out-
puts and physically sit right in front of the IR receivers on your audio/video
equipment.
Like the IR-over-coaxial network that we discuss in the “Making your coaxial
cable work overtime” section, the hardwired IR network needs a power
supply to make the sensors sense, the emitters emit, and the keypads . . . 
er . . . key. Providing this power is a secondary job of the connecting block.
Using emitters, sensors, keypads, and connecting blocks from a single manu-
facturer ensures that everything works together smoothly. Major manufactur-
ers of these systems, such as Niles Audio (www.nilesaudio.com), Nuvo
(www.nuvotechnologies.com), and Xantech (www.xantech.com) make
all these parts in matched sets.
The new approach
Throughout this book, we’ve mentioned lots of ways to use CAT-5e/6 cabling
in your house. Phone networks and data networks use CAT-5e/6; audio and
video networks can use it. There’s really not much you can’t do with CAT-5e/6
cabling. It’s useful stuff.
So it probably won’t surprise you to learn that you can use CAT-5e/6 cabling
in place of three-conductor IR cabling in your home. There are two ways this
can work for you:
 You can use three of the eight conductors in CAT-5e/6 cabling as a 
direct replacement for the three conductors in IR cabling. This is a
simple process; just use the same three conductors on each end of the
connection, and leave the others unterminated.
 You can use IR receivers and keypads designed to work with CAT-5e/6
wiring. Many of these keypad-based systems (such as Leviton’s Chopin
Volume control, or Nile’s Audio’s Intellicontrol ICS keypad system) need
more than two conductors to do their job and are built from the start to
accept only CAT-5e/6 cabling to send control signals back to the media
room.
Most new audio/video control systems are built on the concept of using CAT-
5e/6 cabling — rather than traditional three-conductor IR wire. CAT-5e/6
cables can carry all of the control signals, power, and more using a standard
362
Part VI: Putting It All Together — Home Automation and Control 

type of cabling that many more folks are familiar with and experienced at
installing.
Our recommendation for a new installation of an audio/video control network
is to — whenever possible — install two runs of CAT-5e/6 cabling to each
room where you’ll want to have a local control point (such as a wall volume
control or touchpad). At first, you’ll probably use only one of these CAT-5e/6
cables (to attach the controller itself). Over time, however, you’ll find that
more and more systems will be able to use the CAT-5e/6 cabling for carrying
the audio/video signals themselves. By installing that extra CAT-5e/6 cable,
you’ve created a future-proofed installation that will provide you with the
flexibility to upgrade your entire A/V network as components change and
evolve.

hroughout this book, we try to point out potential gotchas that we’ve run
into when building a smart home — things we’ve seen other people do,
horror stories our friends in the smart-home industry have told us, and even
a few dumb things we did when we were first getting started.
Building a smart home isn’t rocket science or brain surgery. It’s a common-
sense approach to home building and wiring that makes your house more
valuable to you now and more useful in the future. But we all know that
common sense ain’t all that common, so here are ten things we think are
important to remember not to do as you get going.
Missing the Basics of Automation
Powerline (such as X10, INSTEON, or UPB) automation is simple. Plug a module
in one outlet and a controller in another, and you’re ready to go. But (as we
mention in Chapters 19 and 20), these systems rely upon communications

over your home’s electrical powerlines, which were never designed to be a
communications network. So your electrician, the power company, and com-
panies that make electrical lights, appliances, and devices that connect to
your AC power spent little time making sure you’d have a nice, noise-free
power network over which you could automate and control your house.
You need to keep the following in mind:
 In the United States, the electrical main line coming into your house con-
sists of two 110-volt phases, which are split off at the main distribution
panel. Some outlets in your house are connected to one of these phases,
and the other outlets to the other phase. To get X10 signals to cross over
to different phases, you need to install a signal coupler in your main dis-
tribution panel. This is serious, high-voltage, zap-yourself-and-don’t-live-
to-tell-about-it stuff, so hire a qualified electrician to do it for you.
 Low-powered electrical signals such as X10 get weaker as they travel
over long distances. If you have a big house, consider installing a signal
coupler that also includes a signal amplifier/repeater to boost your
signal strength.
 The surge protectors that you should (and probably already do) have
connected to electronic gear in your home will not let automation sig-
nals through. Instead of buying a bunch of individual surge protectors,
have your electrician install a whole-home protector at the main electri-
cal panel. This will keep the noisy stuff out and let your automation sig-
nals work inside your home.
Not Reading the Manual
There are hundreds of different kinds of home-automation modules on the
market. Some are designed to turn regular incandescent lights on and off,
some are designed for dimming, and some can control fluorescent lights. Pay
attention when you buy and install modules (or switches for that matter).
Our friends at companies who make automation products tell us that the
number one reason for returned products and calls to their tech support
lines isn’t defective modules or noisy electrical systems, but rather people
trying to do things that the equipment they bought just won’t do, such as
trying to dim a light with an X10 module that handles only on and off signals
or trying to use a dimming switch on a fluorescent light. No matter how many
times you hit that switch on your controller, you’re not going to get a module
to do something it simply can’t, by design, do.

Thinking That AC and Low 
Voltage Are Friends
With the exception of the powerline home-automation systems that we dis-
cuss in Chapters 19 and 20 (and the HomePlug data-networking system we
discuss in Chapter 16), everything we talk about in this book is a low-voltage
system. AC power is high voltage; CAT-5e/6 , RG6 coax, IR cable, and the rest
are low voltage. High-voltage systems, because they carry so much power,
emit stray electromagnetic fields. Low-voltage systems, because they use
very little power, are easily interfered with by these stray fields. It’s not a
marriage made in heaven.
If you install low-voltage lines too close to the high-voltage ones, the interfer-
ence can cause major havoc with the networks in your home running over
the low-voltage wiring. Have your installers keep low-voltage lines at least 18
inches from high-voltage lines. Try to not run these lines parallel to each
other whenever possible. And when crossing high- and low-voltage wiring, do
so at a right angle to minimize the length of cables that are near each other.
Using the Weakest Link
We hope that we’ve convinced you that it’s worth the small amount of extra
money to use CAT-5e/6 cabling wherever you run cable for telephones, com-
puter networks, and the like. Even if you don’t plan on having a phone or a
LAN outlet in a room, the sheer usefulness and flexibility of CAT-5e/6 makes
running a length or two to every room worthwhile. Every day, we see new
systems that let you run audio, video, surveillance cameras, IR controllers,
and more over CAT-5e/6.
The problem many folks run into doesn’t have anything to do with the 
cable — most people accept the need for CAT-5e/6 cable. But what they 
don’t realize is that all the pieces and parts of the CAT-5e/6 network are just
as important as the cabling in the walls. The outlets, the jacks and plugs, the
patch panel in the wiring closet, even the patch cords used to connect a
device to an outlet all have to be rated CAT-5e or CAT-6 as well. Having even a
single $1 piece of equipment that’s not CAT-5e/6–rated connected to the net-
work lowers the rating of the overall network.
It’s not hard to find CAT-5e/6 equipment; most connectors, cords, and cables
qualify for the rating. But there’s still plenty of stuff on the market that looks
exactly like CAT-5e/6–rated equipment, but isn’t.
Now, to be honest, this really isn’t going to matter much for some things you
do on CAT-5e/6 networks. Phones, for example, don’t require CAT-5e/6 (or
369
Chapter 21: Ten Common Pitfalls When Building Your Smart Home

even lower-rated CAT-3 cable) — heck, they’d probably work over a string
and two tin cans. But as you start looking towards the future and doing
things such as installing gigabit Ethernet LANs and high-definition video net-
works over your UTP cables, you absolutely need CAT-5e or CAT-6.
That PPPPPP Thing
Nope, we’re not coming up with a new networking acronym for you. PPPPPP,
or proper planning prevents pretty poor performance, means you get out of
your home network what you put into it. In Part I, we emphasize the planning
aspect of building a smart home. Think through what you want to accom-
plish, what you can afford, and what kind of help you need to make your
smart home happen. These are vital steps. Skip them at your own peril.
Don’t think you need cable in the nursery? Well you might not, if the kids stay
toddlers in perpetuity. But when they’re in school and need a computer,
wouldn’t you like to have an Ethernet LAN port next to the desk? We would.
You can do a pretty good job of prewiring your home by following the basic 
formula of two CAT-5e/6 and two RG6 coax cables to every room in the house
(four and four in your home office and media rooms). There’s not much you
can’t do with this setup. Plan well, and remember: You can’t prewire too much.
Thinking That Wiring Is a Dirty Word
We absolutely LOVE wireless technologies. Love as in can’t live without.
Wireless LANs for our laptops, cordless phones, Bluetooth mobile phones —
even Wi-Fi phones for making calls over the Internet. But despite all the hype,
wireless networking technologies don’t take away from the basic usefulness
and necessity of wired connections in your walls.
Compared to wireless networks, purpose-built, wired networks using CAT-
5e/6 and RG6 are cheaper and more capable than these wireless alternatives.
For example, wireless LANs today top out at about 100 Mbps; wired LANs
that cost no more can reach speeds of 1000 Mbps. That’s an astronomically
high difference.
Now, if you live in an apartment or historic house or for some other reason
you can’t run new wires, by all means take advantage of wireless and no-
new-wire technologies. And in any case, use them where appropriate as an
adjunct, companion network to your wired networks. Just don’t think they’re
somehow better or more capable than a wired network.
370
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Falling into the Proprietary Pitfall
Some cool home-networking and home-automation and control systems are
built on a specific vendor’s proprietary protocols. These proprietary systems
often have tangible benefits. For example, they may offer tighter integration
between different subsegments of the network than systems built on industry
standards, or they may have a special feature (such as the capability to dis-
tribute component video) that standards-based systems don’t yet have.
The downside of these proprietary systems is that you’ll often find yourself
locked into them — if you want to expand, upgrade, or otherwise modify
your system, you need to go back to the same vendor who provided the rest
of the system. Worse, if the vendor suddenly goes out of business, you may
find yourself without any future support.
Sometimes you just can’t avoid a proprietary system. For example, if you
want to send audio and video over CAT-5e/6, you need to use some particular
vendor’s own equipment on all endpoints in the network. (This is the main
reason we still recommend that you at least consider using speaker wire and
RG6 coax for these networks.)
You may find that the benefits and features of a particular proprietary system
are too compelling for you not to use it. That’s a perfectly valid decision. Just
make sure that you go into such an installation fully aware of the consequences.
Oh yeah — even if you do use one of these proprietary wiring systems, we
still recommend that you put in some CAT-5e/6 and RG6 cabling. It will proba-
bly come in useful someday.
Tumbling into the All-in-One Trap
A close relative to the proprietary systems mentioned previously are all-in-
one packaged solutions that some vendors sell. A single vendor offers all the
cabling, all the wiring-closet hardware, all the outlets and receptacles, as well
as active electronic equipment such as audio amplifiers, Ethernet switches
and routers, and speakers.
We differentiate these approaches from the proprietary approach because
typically you don’t get locked in — these systems just use standards-based
equipment from a single vendor. We’re not really opposed to people using
them. There’s nothing wrong with going this route.
But (you knew there’d be a but, didn’t you?) we prefer the best-of-breed
approach. That’s the beauty of standards: You can choose the equipment that
best meets your price and performance requirements from a host of vendors
371
Chapter 21: Ten Common Pitfalls When Building Your Smart Home

and be assured that it will fit in with the rest of your network. So if you think
that XYZ Company’s amplifier or router or whatever is the best one for you,
buy it! The same goes for the rest of your smart home; use standard infra-
structures and choose the endpoints you like best.
Forgetting to Add Conduit
In Chapter 2, we mention adding conduits (PVC piping with pull wires) in
your walls so that you can easily run new cables in the future. Someday there
may be home-networking technologies and related wiring requirements that
no one has even dreamed of yet. For example, networks running over fiber-
optic cables hold much promise, but so far no one has figured out how they
would be configured in a residential setting.
Having conduits in your walls makes it much, much, much easier to run 
new cables later. Ripping open walls is dirty, destructive, and expensive —
accessing a conduit and pulling a wire through it isn’t.
Not Bothering to Use Labels
Having a wiring closet is really handy. When you need to reconfigure your
network, you just go in the closet, change the connections of cables on the
patch and distribution panels, and you’re finished. If you’ve ever peeked into
a wiring closet, however, you’ll notice one thing about wires. They all look the
same. As in identical. As in “uh, I wonder where this one goes?”
So take a little time when you’re doing your initial wiring (or have your
installer take a little time) and label every single cable. Label both ends: in
the wiring closet and at the outlet or receptacle in the remote location. Do
this for your electrical panel too. Be obsessive about it (you might even want
to print labels on your PC printer or a labelmaker if, like Pat, you can’t read
your own writing). Secure the labels to the cables well.
You can buy special-purpose labelmakers from companies such as Dymo or
Brother for labeling cables. These use special label “tape” that’s sturdier than
the stuff you put on file folders and have built-in graphics designed for the
needs of cabling labels. You certainly don’t need one of these, but if you’re
willing to part with about $70, you can get professionally labeled cables and
feel like the ultimate smart homes geek!

mart homes never want for innovation. People are constantly inventing
new gadgets and gizmos. Something that is niche-oriented and expensive
today may be a high-volume consumer product tomorrow. In this chapter, we
introduce you to some neat new toys, from robots to buttkickers. If you’re
like us, you’ll want to mortgage your home to get at least one of these toys!
We have more to say about these gadgets and ones like them, but we ran out
of room. Check out our www.digitaldummies.com for more information as
well as reviews of smart home gear.
Robotic Servants
On TV, it all started with robots like Klaatu in The Day The Earth Stood Still,
Rosie on The Jetsons, and Robot on Lost In Space. It’s progressed to Data on
Star Trek, Max Headroom, and Simone. Whether on a screen or in person,
robotic personalities offer the opportunity to create a life of leisure for us,
while plotting to take over the world, apparently.

Although there are academic trials of various types of android-style robots —
Honda’s ASIMO robot among the leading examples — the robots that will be
available commercially soon are focused on specific tasks, so we call them
taskmasters. Something as simple as a breadmaker (which takes ingredients,
mixes them, kneads the bread, and then bakes it automatically) can be con-
sidered a robotic kitchen aid, says Colin Angle, CEO and co-founder of iRobot,
Inc. From cooking meals to cleaning windows, robots are on the way.
A dishwasher washes our dishes, a washing machine washes our clothes, and
answering machines answer our phones. Here are some of the neater toys on
the market now:
 Robotic lawnmowers: Cutting the grass is a repetitive and basic task, 
so it’s a logical jumping-off point for robotics in the home. Products such
as Friendly Robotics’ Robomower (www.friendlyrobotics.com),
Husqvarna’s Automower (www.automower.us), Zucchetti’s Ambrogio
(www.roboticazucchetti.com), and Kyodo’s Lawnbott (www.
lawnbott.com) have hit the streets. Typically costing about $1500
street price, if you add up all those lawn mowing charges (or hours if
you do it yourself), you’d probably find these a bargain!
 Robotic vacuum cleaners: Okay, we admit it, we’re lazy when it comes
to cleaning the house. (And we’re constantly reminded of it by our
spouses.) So when a product such as a robotic vacuum cleaner comes
along for only $139, we get excited. iRobot (www.irobot.com) was first
to market with a mass-production model that uses intelligent navigation
technology to automatically clean all household floor surfaces. This
machine, dubbed Roomba, looks like a squat little space saucer that can
roam around the house sensing obstructions and switching floor modes
automatically. iRobot also has a floor-scrubbing model now, the Scooba,
as well as models for cleaning the pool or your workshop. Other robot
vac vendors include Infinuvo, www.infinuvo.com/) has the CleanMate
family of personal cleaning assistants, Yujin Robot (www.iclebo.com)
has iClebo, AB Electrolux has its Trilobite (www.electrolux.com) . . .
heck, there’s even a race car robot vacuum, the Vesture NASCAR
TrackVac Robotic Floor Vacuum (www.vesture.com). 
Networking the Family Sedan
You may not realize this, but your car contains a massive computer network
that touches many of its most critical parts, such as brakes, airbags, and
monitoring systems. You don’t see most of that stuff, so it’s more useful 
than fun.
374
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

The focus on enhancing a car’s internal smarts is driven mostly by the con-
vergence of a number of add-ons, such as mounted cell phones, in-car video
systems, and laptop wireless access devices. These previously unrelated
items are starting to be linked to similar devices and services outside the car.
For instance, the music you want to play in your car is probably much the
same that you play at home.
Much of the focus thus far has centered on a few key areas, such as network
connectivity (being able to communicate with things outside the car), the
inherent computing capability of the car (being able to load new software to
enable new functionality), and integration with the dashboard and steering
wheel. If it sounds like we’re talking about a computer, a network, and a user
interface, we are: a network for your car, linking various endpoint devices to
a central computer with the smarts to do a lot of things, in a fashion that’s
easy to use.
The key technology for cars is Bluetooth, which we talk about in Chapter 16.
Bluetooth connects (or will connect) laptops, cell phones, PDAs, watches,
and other such devices to interact with the car. Today, Bluetooth is mainly
used for handsfree phone calls. You can also find in-car GPS navigation sys-
tems, such as those from TomTom (www.tomtom.com), which connect to
your cell phone via Bluetooth and use your mobile broadband (Internet) con-
nection to download information such as real-time traffic, weather reports,
and detailed city maps.
Losing Weight on the Internet
There’s something about riding an exercise bike to nowhere. It just doesn’t
work for us. Danny has a computer monitor, keyboard, and wireless mouse
mounted just above the front of his treadmill to take in the best of the Web
each morning. It’s easy to do — just add a keyboard, video, mouse (KVM)
switch that allows you to switch a single keyboard, video display monitor,
and mouse between two computers (works when you want to interact with
only one computer at a time).
But the folks at Icon Fitness (www.ifit.com) have taken it a step further 
by linking your exercise equipment, the Internet, SD cards, live personal
coaches, and a library of audio and video slide tours that make each day’s
exercising a new adventure.
You can hike the hills of San Francisco or explore Hawaii’s volcanoes, take in
the Canadian Rockies or climb in Yosemite National Park. You can be berated
by a drill-sergeant-like trainer or soothed with a firm voice. You can choose
375
Chapter 22: Top Ten Toys of the Future

background music, your level, your pace, and more. Icon Fitness not only
provides you with something to watch, but they can remotely control more
than 100 models of treadmills, elliptical trainers, stationary bikes, and incline
trainers — from Icon’s NordicTrack, Pro-Form, Reebok, HealthRider, and
Image divisions (www.iconfitness.com). 
iFIT has many other products with an “exercise and entertainment” compo-
nent: treadmills with built-in flatscreen TVs (cable-ready), ellipticals and
treadmills with 3.5mm audio jacks for your iPod or other MP3 player, and
ellipticals and bikes with built-in games in the console. 
Figuring Out Which CD to Play
Do you have a few hundred CDs? Lots of MP3? Want to listen to them around
the house? What are you to do? There’s been a flurry of activity in recent
years about opening up the stored content on an iPod, on CDs, and in MP3s.
Making this info available elsewhere will depend on your budget and plan-
ning. In Chapter 9 we discuss media adapters and how to get info off your
PCs and onto your stereo. These are relatively inexpensive extenders that
give you remote access to your music. But suppose you want something
specifically crafted to handle a music aficionado’s need? What you want is a
CD server! And here’s the one you want: Request, Inc.’s AudioReQuest system
(www.request.com). Capable of storing as many CDs as you have (you can
add additional storage by their swappable hard drives or getting higher
capacity units), this is the ultimate in CD listening pleasure.
You can use your TV screen or any Web browser as the interface to your
music collection. You create playlists from albums and artists stored in the
system. Loading (ripping) a CD into the system is as easy as opening the tray
and closing it. The system determines whether the CD is already in your
system and then looks up the name of the album and artist in its internal
database of almost a million albums; if the system can’t find the CD, it checks
a master database on the Internet.
It’s truly the future of music in the entertainment center. An entry-level N
Series system costs about $1500 and scales up from there depending on stor-
age capacity and features. This is the box you put in your home if you’re seri-
ous about music!
376
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Serving Up Video on Your Screen
Video is a different animal when you are trying to make it available all over
the house. Digital rights management (copy protection) has more of an
impact, files are larger, and let’s face it, there’s something cool about having
500 DVD cases all lined up on your bookshelves. Still, a video server is in
your future, we’re sure of it!
The ideal solution is to do the same thing you do with the Request N Series
audio server — load your discs into the tray, scan them, and voila, they’re
available throughout the home. However, your Hollywood friends are not as
keen on this as you’d think, and so most video servers are designed around
the idea that you have large DVD carousels that spin around to the movie
you’ve selected and start playing the DVD.
Again, we’ve looked to the serious consumer electronic vendors to tackle 
this problem. ReQuest, Inc. has a great video product, VideoReQuest (www.
request.com), that is paired with up to four Sony DVP-CX777ES 400 disc
DVD changers to give you on-screen access to 1600 movies. An on-screen TV
menu lets you quickly find your DVDs through visual pictures of the movie
posters and through search options such as Recently Added and Recently
Played. You may also access your DVDs by MPAA rating, actor, director, or
changer. Request’s main product, the VRQ-1, retails for about $2500. A CD-
changer will run you about $300.
Giving a Concert
Entertaining tonight? Why not treat your guests to a stylish in-home concert
of Mozart’s Piano Sonatas K. 310, K. 333, and K. 533? Don’t play the piano? No
problem, try Baldwin Piano’s (www.baldwinpiano.com) ConcertMaster.
Your smart home can plug into your Baldwin, Chickering, or Wurlitzer piano
and play almost any musical piece you can imagine. ConcertMaster works in
several ways: as a standard piano, as a player piano that utilizes special digi-
tal data instead of the rolls used by old-fashioned ones, as a playback system
(with built-in amplified speakers) for your own CDs, and as a karaoke system.
You can even plug it into your home network’s VCR and watch the pianist cre-
ating the music your piano plays back for you. If you play the piano a bit
yourself, you can use ConcertMaster to record your own performances. You
can use your smart home’s Internet connection to download the latest oper-
ating system software from Baldwin’s servers, too. Encore!

Gazing on a Starry, Starry Night
You want your child to see the space shuttle zooming across the sky, so you
grab your trusty telescope and wait for it to appear across the horizon, right?
Lots of luck. The space shuttle is moving at more than 17,500 miles per hour,
and keeping an object moving that fast in focus is nearly impossible — unless
you have a smart home. Imagine sitting on your couch and watching the
night sky through your home-network-fed telescope.
Start with one of the finer telescopes, such as a Meade ETX, LX200GPS, or
high-end RCX400 series (www.meade.com). With its super-high-tech motor-
ized system for rotating the lens across the sky, the LX200GPS is a wonderful
platform for satellite observing and tracking. As you use a handheld control
to select specific planets or galaxies, the telescope slides over to that area of
the sky. (The Meade telescopes start at about $500 and go up to more than
$16,000 for the true sky enthusiast.)
Meade telescopes can be controlled remotely using AutoStar Suite software.
Telescopes can be connected through serial or USB ports to a computer and
operated from the warm comfort of your home. If you want to get star-crossed,
you can add a Meade Deep Sky Imager Camera to your telescope and the
images of celestial objects can be viewed directly on the computer screen.
Point and click to any celestial object on the PC display and watch as the tele-
scope moves to the object and places it in the field of view. Check out the
International Space Station that’s under construction as it passes by your
field of vision!
Hook up a computer to a big screen TV and enjoy celestial wonders from
your living room’s plasma screen! Command the telescope to show you the
night sky with “Tonight’s Best” guided tour. Some models of Meade tele-
scopes include extensions that allow the scope to be remotely controlled
from any Web browser, so you don’t need to install any software to control
the telescope from your PC, Mac, PDA, or even a cell phone. This makes it
ideal for kids to operate the scope without extensive software training. 
3D Home Theater
3D has always meant something out of the ordinary for most folks — “Santa
versus the Snowman” in IMAX, or the T2: 3D “ride” at the Universal Studios
theme park, or the Honey I Shrunk the Kids exhibit at EPCOT in Disney World.
Well, watch out, because 3D is coming to the mainstream.
378
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

A number of competing solutions will be vying for your 3D dollars. For years,
the most common 3D technology has used anaglyph encoding. The anaglyph
method creates a single image from two superimposed color-coded images —
providing a sense of depth or 3D. Those red/blue cheap cardboard glasses
you get at the theater are anaglyph-based. However, we’re moving out of the
age of cheap and into the age of super technology. One approach is to create
a high-quality version of these cheap paper glasses. Sensio (www.sensio.tv,
$2995), a Canadian firm, created glasses with electronic LCD shutters that
alternately image on the left and right, allowing each eye to view the screen
every other sixtieth of a second. Each eye only sees its corresponding image
(left eye only sees the left angle images) on the screen. The base unit, Sensio
S3D-100, is connected between your DVD player and your TV display. You
play a special Sensio-encoded DVD in your DVD player; the S3D-100 reads the
signal coming from the DVD player and translates that into alternative (left
and right) progressive images that are sent to the screen. It also sends a
signal over an IR emitter to the wireless IR-driven glasses that you wear.
The Sensio approach yields great results. Some cautions:
 You need a special DVD that carries the Sensio encoding — at the time
of this writing a dozen movies were in their library, but more are coming. 
 You need a TV or projector that can take a VGA connector — which is
common on most video projectors. If you don’t have VGA, you can use a
VGA-to-component converter from companies like Key Digital.
 You can’t use the Sensio with a plasma TV because the plasma screens
emit a great deal of infrared, which interferes with the glasses’ sync
signal.
 Because the glasses shutter on and off rapidly, folks prone to seizures
should avoid wearing the glasses.
A second major way that 3D is coming to a wall near you is the advent of 3D
televisions. That’s right, the television itself is capable of displaying a 3D
image without the eyeglasses. You can just look at the screen and see depth of
images. This is done by polarizing the display. A processor in the TV gener-
ates nine slightly different views fanning out in front of the display. From
almost any location in front of the monitor, a viewer catches a different image
in each eye. It enhances standard 2D content, as well as exploits 3D content.
Before you think this will take a while to roll out, the NBA has already broad-
cast a game in 3D — the 56th NBA All-Star Game. Standard broadcast cam-
eras were replaced with a 3D HD setup that sports two HD cameras that work
together to create one visual experience. On the viewing side of the equation,
NBA fans watched on 3D television displays in special viewing areas set up
just for the experience. Also, most recently made video games generate
379
Chapter 22: Top Ten Toys of the Future

three-dimensional objects internally, and then flatten the images into 2D rep-
resentations for standard monitors. 3D TVs can read the original depth infor-
mation from the game engine and use it to create 3D images on their displays.
So where can you view all this great imagery? Philip’s 42-3D6W01 WOW is a
good example of a TV offering 3D enhanced depth performance with out-of-
screen effects. Like the first generation of 2D plasmas, this unit is expensive;
this 42” 3D TV costs about $15,000.
Putting the “Motion” in Motion Pictures
Are you ready to RUMBLE! We are, and there’s lots of great toys to help us do
this. There’s nothing like the bone-shaking feeling of that low bass frequency
humming from the speakers in a real theater. Now you too can have that at
home, in some inexpensive or pricey ways — whatever suits your budget.
You can start with a set of audio transducers from companies such as Clark
Synthesis (www.clarksynthesis.com) and The Guitammer Company Inc.
(www.thebuttkicker.com). The grapefruit-sized units are screwed onto
the bottom of your furniture or into the frames of your floorboards and take
their cues from the special effects (LFE) channel of your home’s sound
system. They are better than the more generalized subwoofer-based effects
because they can be localized — only your couch shakes, for instance, if they
are attached to the couch’s underframing. 
You’ll hear transducers by many names — bass shakers, tactile transducers, or
even, buttkickers. They are inexpensive — you can buy a version that bolts to
your chair for less than $100, and a multi-unit couch version is less than $300. 
But for those who want to go the extra mile (or shall we say inches?), there
are the motion simulator systems from D-Box (www.d-box.com). Where bass
shakers vibrate and shake in response to the audio track and are in reality
merely transducers that vibrate rather than move air, the D-Box motion simu-
lator is a sophisticated three-axis motion simulation system driven by actua-
tors that physically lifts you according to action in the film. 
When a car crests a San Francisco hill in a car chase scene — or that F-14
screams into a tight turn — you jump or turn with it. The D-Box controller
directs the translation of motion cues from the DVD to the motion of the actu-
ators. The controller’s microprocessors direct the vertical and horizontal
movement of the actuators. Unfortunately, not all movies come with D-Box
codes. Indeed, codes must be programmed for each specific movie by D-Box.
Hundreds of movies and TV shows (such as Lost and 24) are supported now
380
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

(see the list at www.d-box.com/en/codes/index.html), with more
coming each month.
D-Box systems are pricey — a full system will run you $15,000, but you 
can get individual chairs for far less. The high price is in the high-quality
actuators. 
Playing with LEGO, the 
21stCentury Way
Even toys can be made smart by your smart home. Driven by your PCs,
LEGO’s MINDSTORMS kits are the traditional LEGO building bricks on robotic
steroids.
The LEGO MINDSTORMS kit ($250), targeted at kids 10 and over, lets you
design, build, and program real robots using the standard LEGO brick system,
a microcomputer core, and special bricks with light, touch, sound, and super-
sonic sensors. You can create light-sensitive intruder alarms, line-tracking
rovers, robotic soda-can retrievers, or even robots with collision and edge
detection.
The brain is the NXT brick, an autonomous microcomputer that looks like a
big LEGO brick with an LCD screen in it. The NXT uses sensors to take input
from its environment, process data, and signal output motors to turn on and
off. You can also download the system’s upgradeable firmware to your PC
over your smart home’s Internet connection, and then send it by Bluetooth to
the NXT.
You build your robot by using the NXT and LEGO elements. Then you create
a program for your invention by using NXT-G (a simple programming lan-
guage for controlling your robot). Your creation can now interact with the
environment, fully autonomous from the PC. Want to get other programs?
The LEGO MINDSTORMS Web site http://mindstorms.lego.com/ has
