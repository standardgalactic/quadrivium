INTRODUCTION 
Shortly after its incorporation in 1975, NALA (the National Association of Legal Assistants, Inc.) 
addressed a primary reason for its formation—the establishment of national professional standards for 
the legal assistant career field. The development of professional standards serves to define and 
provide direction in the dynamic growth and acceptance of the legal assistant/paralegal career field. 
After examining the work of professional associations and the purposes and successes of voluntary 
certification programs, NALA members determined that a certification examination process is the best 
and most meaningful way to address this goal. 
The Certified Paralegal program is the result of this initial work. This program has enabled the profes-
sion to develop a strong and responsive self-regulatory program offering a nationwide credential for legal 
assistants. The Certified Paralegal program establishes and serves as: 
• A standard of achievement and excellence for paralegals. 
• A means of identifying those who have reached this standard of excellence. 
• A national standard for paralegals, rather than fifty different standards for fifty different states. 
• A program responsive to the needs of paralegals and responsive to the fact that self-regulation is needed 
to strengthen and expand development of this career field.
• A positive, ongoing, voluntary program to encourage the growth of the paralegal profession, attesting to 
and encouraging a high level of achievement, rather than serving as a barrier to entry into a profession. 
Since administration of the first examination in 1976, the Certified Paralegal program has had a signifi-
cant impact on the legal assistant/paralegal profession. For many paralegals, achievement of professional 
certification is a career goal. For others, immediately following completion of a paralegal training program, 
it is the final step in preparing for their career. And for others, it is a stepping stone to advanced certification 
in specific practice areas. For everyone in the field, it is a means of recognition and demonstration of 
competency. 
The continued growth, development, and recognition of paralegals are critical elements to our profession. 
Each paralegal is enhanced by voluntary certification programs. Enhancement of the paralegal career field 
is the driving force of NALA.

CERTIFIED LEGAL ASSISTANT · 
CERTIFIED PARALEGAL STUDY GUIDE 
AND MOCK EXAMINATION
To support legal assistants in pursuit of their certification, NALA offers study programs and materials 
designed to assist in individual study and preparation. This Study Guide and Mock Examination for the 
Certified Paralegal Examination is part of the educational offerings of the association.
This publication is divided into three parts. The first part is a brief description of the Certified Paralegal 
Examination.
The second part provides an outline for a 9-week group study program with weekly examinations. These 
examinations will serve as a starting point for further discussion and study.
The third part of this publication consists of a Certified Paralegal Mock Examination. Suggested testing times 
are indicated for each section. These sample questions represent the general nature of the Certified Paralegal 
Examination. No representation is made as to whether or not these questions will actually appear on the exami-
nation. While every effort is made to ensure that the answers given in the answer key are correct at the time of 
publication, verifying the answers through independent study is an excellent means of review and study.
STUDY REFERENCES
A list of suggested study references for the Certified Paralegal examination appears in the outline of the 
weekly study sessions. This Study Guide and Mock Examination is an excellent companion to:
CLA Review Manual: A Practical Guide to CLA Exam Preparation, 2nd Ed., by Virginia Koerselman, J.D., 
in cooperation with the National Association of Legal Assistants, Inc.; Copyright 1998, Delmar, Cengage 
Learning.
Certified Paralegal prep classes are also offered continuously at <http://www.nalacampus.com>. These 
include both live and self-study Web-based programs.
THE CERTIFIED PARALEGAL EXAMINATION
ADMINISTRATION
The Certifying Board for Legal Assistants was established by NALA in 1975 to administer a nationwide 
certification program for paralegals. This Board is responsible for content, standards, and administration of the 
Certified Paralegal national program. It is composed of paralegals who have received an Advanced Certified 
Paralegal designation, attorneys, and paralegal educators. In the technical areas of statistical analyses, exami-
nation construction, reliability, and validity tests, the Board contracts with a professional consulting firm offer-
ing expertise in these areas as well as in occupational research. Technical analyses of the Certified Paralegal 
Examination are conducted on an ongoing basis to ensure the integrity of the examination. Content analyses 
of the test design, accuracy of questions, and topic/subject mix for each exam section are ongoing processes of 
the Certifying Board. The Board also utilizes the occupational data available through surveys of paralegals 
and other means, including review of textbooks and research within the field of paralegal education. Thus, the 
Board is assured that the examination reflects and responds to workplace realities and demands.
CERTIFICATION PROCESS
The Certified Paralegal Examination is a 2-day comprehensive examination administered at locations across 
the United States. The major subject areas of the examination are: 
• Communications (which includes Human Relations and Interviewing Techniques)
• Ethics
• Judgment and Analytical Ability
Copyright 2010 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

4  Part 1
• Legal Research
• Substantive Law 
This section consists of five examinations. One examination is on the American Legal System and is 
taken by all examinees. The remaining four sections are selected by the examinees from the following list 
of practice areas:
___ Administrative Law
___ Bankruptcy
___ Business Organizations/Corporations
___ Contracts
___ Criminal Law and Procedure
___ Family Law
___ Litigation
___ Probate and Estate Planning
___ Real Estate
The examination is updated continually. The last structural update occurred in 2001. Prior to 2001, the 
sections on “Legal Terminology” and “Human Relations and Interviewing Techniques” were separate sec-
tions of the examination. In 2001, “Human Relations and Interviewing Techniques” was consolidated with 
the “Communications” section; “Legal Terminology” was combined with all areas of the examination. The 
subject material of both sections remains an important part of the examination. The change reinforces the 
exam structure by organizing subjects into logically related sections where they make contextual sense and 
reduces the time required to complete the exam without compromising the integrity of the examination itself.
Knowledge and understanding of each of these areas is vital to the professional success and achievement 
of all paralegals regardless of individual specialty fields.
An essential element of the success of a paralegal is a general working knowledge of legal phrases 
and terms and common Latin phrases, as well as the correct understanding and utilization of these terms 
in written documents. Legal terminology has been incorporated into all sections of the Certified Paralegal 
Examination to test this knowledge, understanding, and utilization. Examinees are asked to demonstrate the 
different meanings of terms and identify terms through definitions or descriptions. Knowledge of general 
terms and phrases of major practice areas are tested. These areas are:
• Civil procedure
• Criminal procedure
• Trial/evidence
• Property
• Contracts
• Estates
• Corporations
• General legal terms
• Labor
• Administrative
Suggested references for legal terminology include Black’s Law Dictionary, 8th (or most current) Ed., 
and Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, 11th (or most current) Ed., G. & C. Merriam Company, 
Springfield, Massachusetts. These references are the authorities for all definitions.
ADVANCED PARALEGAL CERTIFICATION
Once a paralegal has achieved the national Certified Paralegal credential, advanced certification is available 
to those seeking to further their education and training and to achieve recognition of this effort. While the 
Certified Paralegal credential is vital to many beginning their careers, advanced certification is important in 
career development and in addressing the changes that happen in professional life.

CLA/CP Mock Examination  5
Work began in 2002 on a restructured advanced certification program that was introduced to the paralegal 
profession in July 2006. The new program is curriculum-based certification and is offered exclusively by way 
of the Internet. A certified paralegal is able to participate in a Web-based training program offering national 
certification in a variety of specialty areas of practice. An advanced certification credential is awarded to the 
paralegal who has demonstrated mastery of the material through successful completion of a battery of tests.
There are advantages to this model of certification beyond the convenience of a Web-based program. 
Paralegals no longer have to wait several months to seek advanced certification, and the clearly defined 
subject matter in a curriculum-based program makes sense to employers.
This curriculum-based model of advanced certification for paralegals may be new to the legal profes-
sion, but it is a well-established approach for certification in many other professions. It lends itself well 
to the NALA program because those who achieve this certification already have the Certified Paralegal 
credential; they have already demonstrated that they meet the standards of general knowledge and skills 
required of all paralegals. The new advanced curriculum-based certification is a boon to paralegals 
wanting recognition of their advanced knowledge and experience, and it is advantageous to employers 
seeking ways to further develop and train employees.
Courses for the advanced curricula are written by experts in training and development programs and 
in sequential learning. Similar to the Certified Paralegal program, course writers are guided by an outline 
developed by a board of experienced paralegals, paralegal educators, attorneys, and paralegal managers. The 
new programs meet the same high standards of certification and educational programs long sponsored by 
NALA. They may be relied on by employers and paralegals alike.
The Advanced Paralegal Certification program is ever changing. For details about the programs and cer-
tifications awarded, visit the NALA Web site at <http://www.nala.org>.
CONTINUING EDUCATION AND RECERTIFICATION
The Certified Paralegal designation is awarded for a period of 5 years. To maintain certified status, parale-
gals must submit proof of participation in a minimum of 50 hours of continuing legal education programs 
or individual study programs. Credit is also awarded for significant achievement in the area of continuing 
legal education, such as successful completion of a statewide certification test, completion of an Advanced 
Paralegal Certification examination, or teaching. Specific requirements for recertification are furnished 
to certified paralegals upon successful completion of the certification examination. The continuing legal 
education (CLE) requirements are also available from NALA Headquarters and on the NALA Web site.
REVOCATION
The Certified Paralegal designation may be revoked for any of the following reasons:
1.  Falsifying information on the application form
2.  Being subsequently convicted of the unauthorized practice of law
3.  Failing to meet continuing legal education requirements established by the Certifying Board
4.  Divulging the contents of any examination question(s)
5.  Being subsequently convicted of a felony
6.  Violating the NALA Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility
GRADING
A passing score of 70 percent is required for each of the examination sections. Although the substantive law 
section consists of five parts, the section is graded as a whole. Of the 500 points possible in the substantive 
law section, the applicant must achieve 350 points regardless of how the points are distributed among the five 
subparts. Results are announced by the Certifying Board in writing to all applicants, generally 6 to 8 weeks 
after the examination. Results are not available by telephone, fax, or e-mail.
RETAKE POLICY
There are five sections of the Certified Paralegal Examination: Communications, Ethics, Legal Research, 
Judgment & Analytical Ability, and Substantive Law. An examination section must be retaken if the 
70 percent minimum score is not achieved. Applicants in retake status may attend a maximum of five 
retake sessions within a 3-year period. Applicants may choose which sections will be retaken during 
Copyright 2010 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved. May not be copied, scanned, or duplicated, in whole or in part.

6  Part 1
any retake session. The examination must be successfully completed within five retake sessions or 3 years. 
If not, credit for all passed sections will be forfeited.
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
The term legal assistant is defined by NALA as follows:
Legal assistants are a distinguishable group of persons who assist attorneys in the delivery 
of legal services. Through formal education, training, and experience legal assistants have 
knowledge and expertise regarding the legal system and substantive and procedural law 
which qualify them to do work of a legal nature under the supervision of an attorney. (Within 
this occupational category, individuals are also known as “paralegals.”) Adopted by the 
NALA membership, July 1984.
In July 2001, the NALA membership voted to adopt the definition of the American Bar Association. It is 
as follows:
A legal assistant or paralegal is a person qualified by education, training or work experience who 
is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity 
who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work, for which a lawyer is responsible.
In statutes, bar association–adopted guidelines, and supreme court rules among the states, the terms paralegal 
and legal assistant are used interchangeably. NALA also continues to use the terms interchangeably, recognizing, 
however, that in many geographic areas, there is a preference. In this publication, paralegal is used throughout.
To be eligible for the Certified Paralegal Examination, a paralegal must meet one of the following alter-
nate requirements:
1.  Graduation from a paralegal program that is:
a. Approved by the American Bar Association
b. An associate degree program
c. A postbaccalaureate certificate program in legal assistant/paralegal studies
d. A bachelor’s degree program in legal assistant/paralegal studies
e. A legal assistant/paralegal program that consists of a minimum of 60 semester hours 
(or equivalent quarter or clock hours*) of which at least 15 semester hours (or equivalent 
quarter or clock hours**) are substantive legal courses.
*900 clock hours is equivalent to 60 semester hours; 90 quarter hours is equivalent to 60 semester hours.
**225 clock hours is equivalent to 15 semester hours; 22½ quarter hours is equivalent to 15 semester hours.
2.  A bachelor’s degree in any field plus 1 year’s experience as a legal assistant/paralegal. Successful 
completion of at least 15 semester hours (or 22½ quarter hours or 225 clock hours) of substantive legal 
courses will be considered equivalent to 1 year’s experience as a legal assistant/paralegal.
3.  A high school diploma or equivalent plus 7 years’ experience as a legal assistant/paralegal under 
the supervision of a member of the Bar, plus evidence of a minimum of 20 hours of continuing 
legal education credit to have been completed within a 2-year period prior to the examination date.
Individuals currently incarcerated for any offense or on probation, on parole, or under other court-
imposed supervision for a felony offense are ineligible to sit for the CLA/CP examination. Application 
forms and information concerning testing sites for the Certified Paralegal Examination are available from:

TESTING CENTERS
Testing centers are located in many schools, universities, and junior colleges that offer paralegal programs. 
As of January 2005, over 100 schools throughout the United States serve as testing centers. In cities in 
which a school testing center is not already established, NALA will establish a testing center where ten or 
more legal assistants apply. All testing center locations are subject to minimum registration, and NALA may 
not open a testing center where less than five applicants register. Examination applicants are advised of the 
closest available testing center several weeks prior to the examination. Applicants wanting to change from 
one testing center location to another must notify NALA Headquarters in advance of the examination.

TAKING THE CLA EXAMINATION
WHEN
The Certified Paralegal examination is offered three times annually: in late March/early April, July, and 
December. Application forms and the requisite fees must be received by the published filing dates. Filing 
deadline dates are January 15 for the spring examination, May 15 for the July examination, and October 1 
for the December examination.
FEES
In 2008, the fee for the Certified Paralegal Examination is $250 for NALA members and $275 for 
nonmembers. Retake fees are $60 per section. Fees are subject to change at any time.
APPLICATION APPROVAL AND ADMISSION TICKETS
Once the application is received and approved, the examinee will receive an acknowledgment of receipt 
from NALA Headquarters. The acknowledgment may include a request for further information. The appli-
cation form must be complete upon filing. If the application is rejected because it is incomplete, the fee will 
be returned, less a $25 processing fee. Shortly before the testing date, the examinee is sent an admission 
ticket that confirms the testing center location, provides an examinee identification number, and confirms 
the substantive law areas to be tested. If any of the information on the admission ticket is incorrect, the 
applicant is asked to advise NALA Headquarters.
TESTING TIMES
The daily schedule for the Certified Paralegal Examination is:
First Day (Friday) 
Second Day (Saturday)
Morning: 
Morning:

Examinees should be finished by 3:45 p.m. on Saturday. This schedule is subject to change.
EXAMINATION STRUCTURE
The Certified Paralegal Examination is composed of true/false, multiple-choice, matching, and essay or 
short answer questions. The objective questions utilize a machine scan answer sheet, which is described 
below. It is very important that examinees understand how to use this answer sheet to ensure accuracy 
of responses. Separate pages for answers to essay questions are also provided. The most important con-
sideration for examinees in reference to essay questions is very simple—essay and short answers must

 4. Applicants will be assigned to the closest available testing center. Any applicant desiring to change 
from one testing center to another must notify NALA Headquarters at least 30 days prior to the exami-
nation date. In the event a center is canceled by NALA after admission tickets have been provided to 
registered applicants, affected applicants will be advised of nearest open center and will be entitled to 
a full refund if distance or other circumstances preclude travel to an alternate testing center.
 5. If an applicant must withdraw the application, or if the application is rejected, payment less a $25 pro-
cessing fee will be refunded, if the cancellation is postmarked, FAXED, or submitted by e-mail on or 
before eleven working days prior to the test date. Requests for withdrawals postmarked, FAXED, or 
submitted by e-mail ten working days or less before the test date will be subject to a $75 processing 
fee. Retake and specialty processing fee is $25.
 
 Applicants who do not appear at the testing center due to an emergency must call either the examina-
tion administrator or NALA Headquarters by the day of the examination, and must submit a letter to 
NALA Headquarters confirming the absence no more than five days after the examination in order to 
be eligible to a partial refund (examination fee less $75 processing charge). “No-shows,” those who do 
not appear at the testing session and who do not contact NALA Headquarters within five days after the 
examination will forfeit the examination fee. All examination refunds will be issued within a reason-
able period after the respective examination date.
 
 Applicants are eligible to transfer from one testing session to another upon payment of a $50 nonre-
fundable transfer fee. Applications may be transferred, with payment of the transfer fee, a maximum 
of three times within 12 months of the application date. Except in emergency situations, transfers are

JUDGMENT AND ANALYTICAL ABILITY—GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Paralegals must be able to analyze a problem, relate it to case law and legal precedents, and compose docu-
ments that summarize their analysis and findings. The examination consists of objective questions and an 
assignment from a supervising attorney in which the applicant is provided with a fact situation and supporting 
statutory and case law. Applicants must analyze the problem and additional materials and prepare a summary 
of their findings and analysis as directed. The following judgment and analytical skills are tested in equal 
weight on the CLA/CP examination:
Analysis of data: ability to review instructions, applicable rules, and preliminary data; ability to identify 
and understand the question.
Application of knowledge: ability to link facts or legal issues from other cases to the problem at hand; ability 
to recognize similarities and differences by analogy; ability to recognize facts or relevant information in 
different forms.
Evaluating/categorizing data: ability to determine what is relevant and irrelevant information to the ques-
tion under analysis.
Description of findings: ability to organize data and findings in a written document.
With reference to the essay question, examinees will be graded on the ability to:
• Identify which facts are relevant and state them concisely and accurately.
• Identify the threshold or main issue and any secondary issue(s).
• Identify the relevant legal authority and apply it to the facts.
• Draw persuasive logical conclusions.

21. A contract is executed when it is
a. signed.

d. litigated.
Following the paragraph set out below are questions based on its contents. After reading the paragraph, 
select the best answer for each question. Base your answers to the questions only on what is stated or 
implied in the paragraph.
The burden of proof is the standard that the fact finder is to apply to a set of facts in 
determining how to reach a verdict. A preponderance of the evidence must be shown for 
the plaintiff to prevail in a civil case. This is interpreted to mean that the plaintiff’s ver-
sion of the facts is correct rather than the defendant’s version of the facts. In the charge 
to the jury by the trial judge, the applicable burden of proof is always covered. In civil 
cases, the jurors frequently are asked to imagine a set of scales with the plaintiff’s evi-
dence on one side and the defendant’s evidence on the other. If the equilibrium of the 
scale is perfect or if the defendant’s scale is lower than the plaintiff’s, plaintiff may not 
recover since the burden of proof has not been satisfied. If the plaintiff’s scale of evi-
dence is heavier than the defendant’s scale of evidence so that it goes lower, no matter 
how much lower, plaintiff is entitled to recover.
22. Which of the following expresses the best title for this paragraph?
a. The Balancing of the Legal Scales
b. The Plaintiff’s Side v. the Defendant’s Side
c. The Burden of Proof
d. How a Jury Determines Facts
23. Which statement is false according to the paragraph?
a. Jurors are sometimes asked to use their imaginations when it comes to questions of evidence.
b. Plaintiff may recover if the defendant’s scales are lower.
c. A preponderance of the evidence must be shown for the plaintiff to prevail in a civil case.
d. If the plaintiff’s scale of evidence is heavier than the defendant’s scale, the plaintiff is entitled 
to recover.
24. One may conclude most correctly from the paragraph that
a. in applying the burden of proof to a set of facts in reaching a verdict, the plaintiff must show a 
heavier weight of evidence.
b. in charging the jury, the judge generally covers the applicable burden of proof.
c. equilibrium of the scales of justice is evenly balanced when presenting evidence to the jury.
d. a lot of imagination is used by jurors in deciding the burden of proof based on evidence.
For each of the following situations, select the answer that is most correct.
25. Paralegals in your firm are assigned to work with specific teams of attorneys. Although you 
have been suspicious for some time, it now is clear to you that the senior attorney on your team 
is charging some of his clients for more time than was used to do the work. Your best course of 
action is to
a. bring the situation to the attention to another attorney of equal or greater seniority whom 
you trust. 
b. delete the extra hours from the clients’ billings and keep the correction to yourself.
c. keep the situation to yourself and start looking for different employment.
d. contact the client to see how he or she feels about the matter.

29. You are a paralegal for a collections attorney. One afternoon while the attorney is away, 
a woman appears in the office. You recognize her as your neighbor, although you had not 
known her last name previously. She recognizes you as well and begins to cry. Apparently, her 
employer had just been served with a garnishment of her wages. Your office represents 
the judgment creditor.
 
  
You know that she is a single mother with nine children, that she has financial problems, and that 
she is struggling to support her family. She begs you to help her, since she does not have enough 
money left to buy food for her children this week. She asks if there is anything she can do. Her dis-
tress is genuine, and she seems completely helpless. Your employer will not be back in the office until 
Monday of next week. By that time, the employer will have forwarded the garnished wages to the 
court. Select the best course of action.
a. Find out if she has a lawyer; if not, offer to call the creditor for her.
b. Find out if she has a lawyer; if not, tell her to call the creditor herself and tell her 
what to say.
c. Call your employer and find out what she wants you to do.

30. The law clerk in your office is assigned to work with you on a particular litigation case. The two of you 
are to review certain client documents in anticipation of discovery disclosure and requests. The law clerk 
discovers several pages of handwritten notes that are extremely damaging to the client’s case. He removes 
the pages, declaring that they must have been left in the file by mistake. Your best course of action is to
a. notify the supervising attorney and let her determine what to do.
b. call the bar association and find out if you can remove the pages.
c. discuss your reservation with the law clerk and have him call the bar association.
d. discuss your reservation with the law clerk and have him check with the supervising attorney con-
cerning propriety.

31. In the same situation as the preceding question, you later discover the handwritten pages in the waste-
basket. The law clerk maintains that since the pages were erroneously placed in the file, there can be 
no basis for requiring them to be left there. Which is your best course of action? 
a. Tell the law clerk that he will be fired immediately. 
b. Call the bar association and find out if you can remove the pages.
c. Notify the supervising attorney and let her determine what to do. 
d. Remind the law clerk that he promised to check with the supervising attorney.
32. To work most effectively, a paralegal must
a. know who directs his or her work.
b. know whose work, if any, he or she directs.
c. neither is correct
d. both are correct
33. True or False. One way for a new paralegal to gain the respect of others in the law office or law depart-
ment is to look for antiquated systems and practices and to push for their immediate modification.
34. True or False. If a system works well in one law firm, one reasonably may assume that the system will 
work well in another law firm with the same number of lawyers.
35. True or False. If a paralegal is instructed by the supervising attorney to obtain a special type of mark-
ing pencil to prepare a special exhibit for trial, it is not reasonable to assume that the paralegal has 
authority to charge the exhibit tabs to the firm’s account at the office supply store.
36. Linda is a new paralegal at Garcia & Hicks. She notices at once that most of the paralegals answer their own 
telephone and do their own filing. Which of the following assumptions can be made in this circumstance?
a. The firm does not know how to use paralegals properly.
b. Management believes this to be the most efficient way to handle the work.
c. The paralegals are being used as glorified secretaries.
d. Both a and c are true.
e. None of the above is true.
37. You are an experienced paralegal. Your supervising attorney has assigned to you the task of creating 
a control plan to catalog and summarize a room full of client documents in preparation for litigation. 
The litigation will be filed in approximately four weeks. Clearly, this will be a monumental job. Your 
best course of action at this point is to
a. review one or two of the boxes of documents, complete the tasks assigned, keep track of the 
time required, and review the project with your supervisor to determine how much time and how 
many people will be required to complete the assignment. 
b. formulate the control plan, review it with your supervisor, and then implement the plan.
c. find out who may be available to assist you since you obviously cannot complete such a large project 
in so little time, and work with that individual in formulating and implementing the control plan.
d. discreetly let your friends in other offices know that you are looking for a new job.
For each of the following situations, select the answer that is most correct.

RE: 
 Dan Sampson
New Client File
Dan Sampson is an 18-year-old construction worker who lives with his parents. Shortly after he 
was employed, he bought a car. His father co-signed for the loan. Then Dan bought a $600 television 
set for his room. After the warranty had expired on the television set, it stopped working. Dan took the 
set to Easy Eddie’s Repair Shop to be fixed. When Dan left the television, Farley, the head bookkeeper 
at Easy Eddie’s, required Dan to sign an agreement authorizing the repair shop to make whatever 
repairs might be necessary and obligating Dan to pay for any necessary repairs that were made. Eddie 
promised the television set would be ready to pick up by the end of the week.
On that Friday, Dan appeared at the repair shop to pick up his television set. It was not ready. 
Dan stopped on the following Friday as well as the Friday after that. Dan became very upset at being 
put off and demanded that the television set be returned to him at once. After a long discussion, 
Eddie, the owner, convinced Dan to leave the set and promised that it would be ready the following 
Wednesday. 
On Wednesday, Dan came to the repair shop and learned that the set had been repaired. Eddie presented 
him with the repair invoice for $607.35. Dan became very upset that the shop would spend more to repair 
the set than the set had cost originally. Eddie reminded Dan that he had signed a contract to pay for neces-
sary repairs and told him to “take it or leave it.” Dan was incensed. He stomped out of the shop without 
paying the invoice and without his television set.
After brooding about the matter for several days, Dan and one of his friends parked near the repair shop 
on the following Friday. Dan knew that the shop was busy on Fridays; and while all of the clerks were help-
ing customers, Dan slipped into the back room. He found his set, took it out the back door, and put it in his 
friend’s car. Dan and his friend then drove away. 
On the following day, two police officers appeared at Dan’s home with a search warrant. Dan’s mother 
let them in the house. They found the television and arrested Dan for theft. He was released on his own 
recognizance. Dan’s parents, Joe and Betty Sampson, are long-time clients and have retained our firm to 
represent their son.
The following statutes may apply to this case. Please prepare a memorandum to me concerning Dan’s 
potential criminal and civil liability based on these statutory provisions.

RE: 
 Dan Sampson
New Client File
You have asked me to review specific statutes to determine Dan Sampson’s civil and criminal liability, if 
any, concerning events surrounding repair of his television set by Easy Eddie’s Repair Shop.
Facts:
We represent Dan Sampson, an 18-year-old construction worker who bought a television set for $600. After 
the warranty expired, the television set stopped working. Dan took the set to Easy Eddie’s Repair Shop and 
signed a contract under the terms of which he agreed to pay for any repairs necessary to fix the television.
After several delays, the repairs were completed at a cost of $607.35. Dan refused to pay the invoice 
because the amount was more than he had paid for the television originally. He left the repair shop without 
the television set.
Dan and one of his friends returned to the repair shop several days later. While all of the clerks were 
busy with customers, Dan slipped into the back room and took his television out the back door. He was

38  Part 2
arrested the next day with the television in his possession. Subsequently, he was released on his own 
recognizance.
Issues:
1.  What is Dan’s potential criminal liability in taking the television from Easy Eddie’s Repair Shop with-
out paying for it?
2.  What is Dan’s potential civil liability in taking the television from Easy Eddie’s Repair Shop without 
paying for it?
Discussion:
If a television is an appliance (and it probably is), the repair shop appears to have a valid artisan’s lien 
under § 52-202 since it repaired the television at the request or with the consent of our client. Accordingly, 
the repair shop was entitled to possession of the television until the amount of its lien was paid.
Dan most likely violated § 28-511(1) when he removed the television set from the shop without paying 
for the repairs. Under this statute, a person is guilty of theft by unlawful taking if he or she “exercises con-
trol over movable property of another with the intent to deprive him or her thereof.” Although the repair 
shop did not own the television set, it did have the right to possess it based upon its artisan’s lien. Dan vio-
lated that possessory right when he took the television from the shop without paying for its repair. Since 
Dan did not enter the shop forcibly and did not deceive anyone, he does not appear to have violated the 
statutes prohibiting burglary or theft by deception, respectively.
Theft by unlawful taking under § 28-511(1) will be graded as a Class IV felony in this case if the prop-
erty is valued between $300 and $1,000, as appears to be the case. § 28-518(2). If the fair market value of 
the television is less than $300, it is a Class I misdemeanor. § 28-518(3).
Dan’s potential civil liability is tied to the validity of the artisan’s lien created by repair of his television 
set at his request or with his consent under § 52-202. Dan signed a contract agreeing to pay for necessary 
repairs. Even if this contract could be avoided based on Dan’s minority, the repair shop still would be enti-
tled to the reasonable value of its repair work, which may leave Dan in no better position than he is in now.
It may be possible to dispute the necessity of the repairs or to dispute the reasonableness of their cost; 
however, we currently have no facts upon which to base claims such as these. Without such a factual basis, 
Dan’s best interests may be served by paying the repair cost. This course of action cancels any potential 
civil liability and may go far in persuading the prosecutor and the repair shop to drop any criminal charges.
Conclusion:
Because of the repair shop’s artisan’s lien on the television set owned by Dan Sampson, Dan most likely 
committed theft by unlawful taking when he removed the set from the repair shop. This may be either a 
Class IV felony or a Class I misdemeanor depending on the fair market value of the television set when it 
was taken.
Dan’s civil liability to the repair shop is the reasonable value of the repairs made to his television set. 
Unless Dan pays this cost, he will be obligated to return the television set to Easy Eddie’s Repair Shop so 
that Eddie may foreclose his lien by selling the property. Considering all known facts, Dan’s best course of 
action may be simply to pay the repair charges.

LESSON PLAN
• Communications Worksheet (10 minutes); go over answers; students grade own
• General Law Quiz (30 minutes); go over answers; students grade own
• Provide chart for federal courts; Constitution and Bill of Rights
GENERAL LAW, THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM—GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Working within the American legal system demands knowledge of how laws are made, the foun-
dations of law (i.e., the U.S. Constitution), and the structure of the state and federal branches of 
government and the court system. These concepts provide the foundation for every legal prac-
tice area that exists. (Note: This corresponds to the section of the CLA examination entitled 
Substantive Law—General. The Substantive Law section of the CLA examination is composed of 
five subsections. This section must be taken by all examinees; the other four sections are selected 
by the examinees.)
Major subject areas of this section are:
Court system: knowledge of municipal, state, and federal court systems, including appellate courts and 
Supreme Court; structure and jurisdiction.
American legal system: branches of government; U.S. Constitution; Bill of Rights; federal agencies; 
concepts such as separation of powers; the way laws are made.
Legal concepts and principles: sources of law; judicial decision making, including conflicts of law, trial 
process, appellate process, and arbitration/mediation.
Sources and classifications of law: constitutions; statutes; common law; civil law; statutory law; 
equity law.

sion; identifying as a paralegal; soliciting business; advertising; accepting a case; making initial client contact.
Professional integrity/competence: general knowledge of the profession; knowledge of paralegal codes; 
demonstration of understanding of how these codes relate to day-to-day activities; ability to identify a situation

erning office matters such as letterhead listings, business cards, bonuses, profit sharing plans, delegation of 
work to support staff, and discussion of cases with co-workers.

WEEK NINE:
MOCK EXAMINATION
LESSON PLAN
• Scaled down to three-hour overall time limit
• Sections taken in succession under established time limits; answers are provided at the end of this class 
session (students grade their own at home)
• Students must preregister for the four substantive law sections they wish to take
TAKING A TEST—HELPFUL HINTS
The following suggestions are taken from the CLA Review Manual: A Practical Guide to CLA Exam 
Preparation, by Virginia Koerselman, J.D., in cooperation with the National Association of Legal 
Assistants, Inc., 2nd Ed., 1998, Delmar, Cengage Learning.
Prepare Yourself
• If possible, visit the testing site the day before the examination is to be taken. Determine the best route to 
take and estimate the time to arrive there. Allow for morning rush-hour traffic and plan to arrive twenty 
to thirty minutes ahead of time. Determine where you will park and how much it will cost. Familiarize 
yourself with the location of the testing room and of the other facilities located in the building, such as 
the restroom(s), snack bar or coffee shop, if any, and so forth.
• On the evening before the examination, review your outlines and notes one last time for the sections to be 
administered the next day. Then put them away.
• Get a good night’s rest. You will need all of your energy when the test begins. Don’t squander it by sit-
ting up half the night, worrying about what will happen tomorrow or trying to cram. Cramming now will 
do nothing but cause confusion and panic. Don’t do it.
• Relax. Immediately before the exam begins, panic can immobilize you unless you stay in control. Before 
entering the examination room, walk around and stretch your neck, shoulders, arms, hands, and legs. 
Don’t just pace.
• In selecting your examination seat, sit where you can hear the examination administrator without 
being distracted by activity at or near his or her desk. If possible, avoid those seats located near air 
vents.
• Breathe deeply—breathe in through the nose, bringing the air all the way down to the knees, and hold it 
for a count of five; then breathe out through the mouth s-l-o-w-l-y until all of the air is released. Continue 
this exercise until the air comes out slowly and smoothly.
• If you begin to panic (evidenced by the inability to think clearly—you see the words, but they don’t reg-
ister in your head) while taking the exam, stop and quietly perform the breathing exercise. As you breathe 
in, imagine yourself going down an elevator all the way to the lower sub-basement. Stay at that level for 
a count of five and then slowly breathe out as you return to ground level. Do it again. Then go back to 
work. This thirty-second exercise is well worth the time invested.
Test Questions in General
• All test questions are designed within a national framework. Do not rely on the rules of a specific state 
when answering any of the questions.
• Answer all questions, even if you have to guess. Since there is no additional penalty for a wrong answer, 
guessing may result in a few extra points here and there. An unanswered question, however, never can be 
correct.

104  Part 2
• Read the instructions for each group of questions very carefully. Be absolutely certain that you know 
what you are being asked to do before you begin.
• Be sure that you understand each question before you attempt to answer it. Read it twice if necessary. 
Fine-line distinctions are commonly drawn in examinations like this one. If you read a question too 
quickly, important words will be overlooked.
• Read the question as it is, not as you expected it to be. Don’t try to help the question-writer by qualifying 
your answer. The question means exactly what it says.
• Pace yourself in relation to the length of the examination section. Answer the questions you know first. 
Write the page and question number of the others on your scratch paper and come back to them later. 
Don’t spend too much time on any one question.
• Do not change your answers unless you are positive that you wrote the wrong answer the first time. If 
you read the question carefully, your first impulse is almost always right. If you second-guess yourself, 
the second guess likely will be wrong.
• If you finish the section before the allotted time has expired, as unlikely as this is, stop. Do not go back 
through the questions, because second-guessing problems will arise (see above).
• Do not mark anything but the answers on the answer sheet. If you do change an answer, make sure 
the old (incorrect) answer is fully erased. Answer sheets for non-essay portions of the examination 
are scanned by computer. Stray marks, including incomplete erasures, may be treated as wrong 
answers.
• Use the break between each testing period effectively. Walk, stretch, relax, and mentally prepare yourself 
for the upcoming testing period. Do not squander this valuable time by dwelling on the section that you 
just finished. It is over. Move on.
• Resist the temptation to compare your answers with those of other applicants while on break, 
during lunch, or at the end of the day. Do not even listen to this type of discussion while sections 
remain to be taken. Politely excuse yourself if anyone else talks about specific answers. If any of 
their answers were different from yours (and some of them will be different), it will create unnec-
essary anxiety, which, in turn, will have a negative effect on your performance during the next 
testing period.
True or False Questions
• Be wary of true or false questions that contain the word “always” or “never.” While there are occasional 
exceptions, few things in the law are “always true” or “never true.”
• If any part of the statement is inaccurate or incorrect, the entire statement is incorrect, in which case the 
answer is “false.”
• The word “generally” or “may” in a true-false question often indicates that the answer is true.
Multiple-Choice Questions
• Read the questions carefully. Multiple-choice questions generally will ask you to select the most correct 
answer or the best answer, but some will ask you to select the least correct answer or the worst answer. 
Watch for these.
• Beware of “none of the above” and “all of the above” selections. Certainly there are some questions for 
which “none” or “all” is the correct answer. As a general rule, these questions are few.
• If a question or a set of answers sounds totally foreign, leave that question and go on to those you can 
answer. Remember to write the page number and the question number on your scratch paper. If you 
return to the question and still do not know the answer, guess. There is no penalty for wrong answers, so 
there is no benefit in leaving any question unanswered.
• Make an educated guess or use a process of elimination. Eliminate as many of the wrong selections as 
you can and then pick from the remaining selections. If your instincts point to one of them, choose it and 
move on to another question.
• If you cannot make even an educated guess about the correct answer and if you have not already elimi-
nated the “c” selection as being wrong, “c” is the best guess (based upon generic testing statistics).

Weekly Study Plans  105
Although the “a” selection is sometimes the correct answer for a particular question, it is the worst 
guess statistically. Comparing statistics and educated guesses, your educated guess is always the 
better choice.
Matching Questions
• Read the instructions to determine whether items from either list can be used more than once. If not, the 
items can be matched through a process of elimination. Match those that you know are correct and select 
the others by eliminating those that you know are wrong.
• Matching questions tend to take more time than either true-false or multiple-choice questions. Budget 
your time with this in mind.
Essay Questions
• Quickly skim the instructions and the question to get a feel for the material. Then read them again, very 
carefully this time. With this reading, underline any important points or items. This makes it easier to find 
things later, which saves time.
• Be absolutely sure you understand what it is that you are to do (whether it is to summarize, to compare, 
to discuss, and so forth).
• If you are asked to summarize material, condense it to the bare-bones facts. Do not editorialize; do not 
change facts or add facts that are not clearly stated in the original material. In general, a summary should 
be no longer than one-fourth the length of the original material. Double-check to be certain that the 
names, places, times, and so forth in your summary coincide with the original material.
• If you are asked to compare one thing with another, limit the essay to comparison and contrast (similari-
ties and differences). Don’t engage in extraneous dissertations. For instance, do not explain how a par-
ticular concept or principle evolved historically when the question asks simply that you compare it with 
another specified concept or principle.
• When asked to explain or to discuss an issue, concept, term, or the like, do precisely that. At a minimum, 
the discussion must provide a concise definition. It may also include usage—when, how, and why it is 
used. Do not compare it with something else unless that is the only way to explain it, which rarely will be 
the case.
• Do not define terms by using those same terms as part of the definition. In other words, do not say 
“Criminal law is the law that defines criminal conduct.” This is a circular statement. It defines nothing 
and no points could be given for it.
• Do not ask rhetorical questions in an essay answer. For example, do not ask, “Why have the rule if it is 
not enforced?” Rephrase the thought into a declarative statement, such as, “The rule means nothing if it is 
not enforced.”
• Plan to spend at least as much time thinking about and planning your answer as you spend writing it.
• Use the scratch paper provided to you to plan your answer completely before writing anything on the 
answer sheet. Do not merely begin to write, believing (or hoping) that you can clarify your thoughts as 
you progress. It almost never works.
• Get to the point. In planning your answer, write down the three or four (three is better) most important 
points to be made. Then put them in complete sentences; be sure they convey complete thoughts and 
make sense. Use abbreviations and brief forms of words to speed the process. Once you have done this, 
number them in the logical order in which they should be presented or discussed. Decide whether there 
are any subpoints that must be included for clarity. If so, jot a word or a phrase under the main point as a 
reminder. Unless the subpoint is absolutely necessary, leave it out.
• Formulate a brief, introductory sentence and draft the final answer. Stick to your planned outline. To the 
extent that you digress, your answer will appear disjointed and disorganized.
• Say what you need to say in as few words as possible and then stop. Refer to the Communications sec-
tion of the CLA Review Manual for more information.
• Double-check spelling, punctuation, grammar, and word usage. Make corrections as needed. Errors can 
result in lost points.

106  Part 2
• Write the final essay legibly. Use care that the writing is large enough to be read easily. Discard calli-
graphic flourishes. If necessary, print the final essay answer to ensure its legibility.
• Do not attempt to divert the graders’ attention by bluffing or by discussing peripheral issues at length. 
This technique does not work and can backfire in such a way that the resulting essay score is less than 
it would have been if the applicant had stopped at those things that were known and were relevant to the 
question.
• Do not try to be humorous; it generates no points. Likewise, do not write explanatory or apologetic notes 
to the grader. It’s unprofessional.

uncomfortable events. It is best to avoid the term rape when interviewing a client who just experienced

JUDGMENT AND ANALYTICAL ABILITY
Select the best answer for each of the following questions unless a specific group of questions instructs 
you to do otherwise.
 1. Jane is a legal assistant with the firm of Dewey & Billum, where she has worked for the six months 
since her graduation. Alice Batch, her supervisor, is reputed to have dismissed three employees in the 
past year for poor performance. Alice, however, also tends to be somewhat brusque in her dealings 
with clients and staff members alike. In Jane’s view, the tasks given to her since her employment 
(photocopying, running errands, and relaying messages to her clients) could be done by a first-year 
legal assistant student; and she is eager to have more challenging projects. Which of the following 
options is Jane’s best alternative?
a. Be patient and do nothing.
b. Try to draft the preliminary prospectus for a public stock offering contemplated in the Simpson 
case, since Jane knows this must be completed by Friday.
c. Ask Alice for a project that will allow Jane to use her drafting or organization skills.
d. Inform Alice’s supervisor that Alice is not using Jane’s skills effectively.
 2. Jack’s supervising attorney, Harry, is out of the office for the rest of the week, taking depositions in 
another city. Jack is very busy, however, summarizing documents in preparation for depositions that 
will be taken next week. One of the senior partners appears in Jack’s office and says, “Since Harry is 
out of town, I want you to help me by calling potential contributors for the United Way Campaign.” 
Which of the following is the worst response for Jack to give?
a. “Harry asked me to summarize these documents for next week’s depositions; but if you want me 
to stop now, I will be happy to help with the calls.”
b. “Harry asked me to summarize these documents for next week’s depositions, but that can wait.”
c. “Harry asked me to summarize these documents for next week’s depositions, but I will be happy 
to help when I am finished with this project.”
d. “The fact that Harry is out of town does not mean that I have nothing to do.”
 3. Bill has worked for Mary Lee, a sole practitioner, for several years. While Mary was on the telephone 
with a client yesterday, Bill heard her say, “I apologize for the error, but Bill must have been confused 
about which form to use. We will send the correct form right away.” Knowing that Mary selected the 
form herself, Bill was angry about being blamed for her error. What is Bill’s best course of action?
a. Do nothing.
b. Let Mary know that he heard what she said to the client.
c. Mention the incident to the legal secretary to prevent the same thing from happening to her.
d. Call the client and tell him that it was Mary who made the error.
 4. The attorney for whom Joe works is extremely unorganized and undisciplined about the way in which he 
uses his time. It seems to Joe that the lawyer frequently talks on the telephone for days at a time. During 
those periods, Joe is able to work at an easy pace. Then, without warning, the lawyer decides to attack 
the paper mountains with a vengeance, and he expects Joe to keep pace with him for two or three days 
until the lawyer is caught up. Joe, on the other hand, is left with mountains of paper, all with a due 
date of yesterday. Joe finds this practice unsettling, but he has not been able to motivate the lawyer to 
use time in a better way. Which of the following represents the best option for Joe?
a. Find a position in another firm as soon as possible.
b. Adjust.
c. Let the attorney know that no reasonable person could work under this type of stress forever.
d. At the next firm meeting, suggest a workshop or seminar on time management for all of 
the lawyers.

 5. Karen has many years’ experience as a legal assistant and works for one of the senior partners of a 
large firm. Part of her job is to help train some of the newer associates. Karen overheard Dan, one of 
her assigned trainees, say to another young lawyer in the lunchroom, “Well, be glad you don’t have to 
report to that witchy Karen. She’s one tough, old broad.” When Dan turned in his weekly case report 
on the following Friday, Karen noticed a number of obvious errors. Before she forwards the report to 
the senior partner, Karen should
a. do nothing. (If Dan thinks Karen is tough, wait until he has to deal with the senior partner.)
b. circle the errors in red and pass the report on to the senior partner, who is certain to 
chastise Dan.
c. circle the errors in red and return the report to Dan with a terse memo.
d. take the report back to Dan and point out the errors, suggesting that his secretary may have 
misread his handwriting when the report was prepared.

11. A statute provides that minors “thirteen years of age and under” shall come under the exclusive juris-
diction of the juvenile court except when a case involves murder or treason. Willie Jones stole a car to

Which of the following statements is most correct?
a. Charges must be filed in juvenile court because Willie is under thirteen years of age.

Read this passage and select the best answer to each of the questions that follow it.
Above the west portico of the Supreme Court Building are inscribed the words EQUAL 
JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. At the opposite end of the building, above the east por-
tico, are the words JUSTICE THE GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY. These mottos reflect 
the Court’s difficult task: achieving a just balance among the values of freedom, order, 
and equality. Consider how these values came into conflict in two controversial issues 
that the Court faced.
Abortion pits the value of order—the government’s responsibility to protect life—against 
the value of freedom—a woman’s right to decide whether or not she will give birth. In 
the abortion cases beginning with Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), the Supreme Court 
extended the right to privacy to cover a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy. The Court 
determined that at the beginning of pregnancy, a woman has the right to an abortion, free of 
government-imposed constraint. However, the Court also recognized that toward the end of 
pregnancy, government interest in protecting the fetus’s right to life generally outweighs a 
woman’s right to abort.
School desegregation pits the value of equality—equal educational opportunities for 
minorities—against the value of freedom—the right of parents to send their children to 
neighborhood schools. In Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the 
Supreme Court carried the banner of racial equality by striking down state-mandated segre-
gation in public schools. This decision helped to launch a revolution in race relations in the 
United States. The justices recognized the disorder their ruling would create but believed that 
equality clearly outweighed freedom. Twenty-four years later, the Court still was embroiled in 
controversy over equality when it ruled that race could be a factor in university admissions 
(to diversify the student body) in the case of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 
438 U.S. 265 (1978). In securing equality of blacks, the Court then had to confront the claim 
that it was denying the freedom of whites.
The Supreme Court makes national policy. Because its decisions have far-reaching 
impact, it is vital that we understand how it reaches those decisions. With this understanding, 
we can better evaluate how the Court fits within our model of democracy.
13. The issue of abortion pits the values of
a. freedom and order.
b. freedom and equality.
c. equality and order.
d. freedom and racial segregation.
14. The right of parents to send their children to a neighborhood school is
a. an issue of freedom.
b. an issue of equality.

d. denied by the Constitution.
15. True or False. Until forty years ago, it was legal for states to segregate public schools.

16. True or False. The Supreme Court has ruled that universities may use an applicant’s race as a consider-
ation in deciding whom they will admit as a student.
17. True or False. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decided that a woman’s right to terminate a preg-
nancy outweighs other rights during the first part of a pregnancy.

I favor the legalization of marijuana. Most arguments favoring such a change focus attention 
on the dearth of evidence concerning harmful effects of the drug. The effect of such conten-
tions is to neutralize the negative impact of arguments supporting prohibition because of a 
supposed correlation between the use of marijuana and antisocial behaviors such as murder 
and rape. Thus far, the burden of constructive argumentation has been borne by the doctrine 
of individual rights. “Liberty” has been the rallying cry of those who favor legalization. No 
serious proponent of legislative change has advanced the obvious proposition that marijuana 
has the beneficial effect of improving human condition by allowing its user to “get high.” It is 
a sad commentary on our culture that pleasure is not recognized as a desideratum but must 
be justified by some more ponderous purpose.

a. A written constitution is essential to the proper function of the state.

ing. Sam never has worked on Saturdays and values his weekends, when family events occur. Sam’s

Topeka. He saw a farmer standing in a nearby cornfield. Sir Sidney knew there were two types of farm-
ers in this region, those that always told the truth and those that always told the opposite of the truth. Sir 
Sidney knew he had time to ask only one question of the farmer, for an ominous dark cloud was about to 
overtake him. Which of the following questions would have ensured Sir Sidney’s finding the right road?

awaited the due date for the loan. Knowing that Maura could not pay the note, Gay hoped to embar-
rass her by filing a lawsuit. On the due date, Maura’s sister came to Gay with $3,500 and announced 
that she had come to repay the loan. Gay refused to accept the money and sued Maura. The court held 
for Maura. Which of the following principles most narrowly explains this result and is not inconsistent 
with the ruling in the previous case?
a. A promisee has no legal right to insist that performance under a contract be made directly by the 
promisor.

Which of the following principles most narrowly explains this ruling and is not inconsistent with the 
rulings given in the previous two cases?

such an order is administratively practical.

Which of the following is most accurate?

police department to obtain some confiscated cocaine. Soon after, Timmy visits Dottie, who enjoys 
the cocaine and Timmy’s company. During the evening, Dottie discloses information that is damaging 
to her credibility as a parent. Timmy tucks away this new information in the event he needs to use it.
