FOREWORD 
Previous conferences on “Symmetry and Perturbation Theory” were 
held in Torino’ (1996), Roma2 (1998), and in Cala Gonone, on the eastern 
coast of Sardinia (2OOl3l5 and 20024). 
Comforted by the success of previous conferences in the series it was 
decided to organize a new SPT conference, again in the magnificent scenery 
of Cala Gonone, in late spring of 2004; this was organized by three of us 
(GG, BP, ST) together with Prof. A.Degasperis from the Department of 
Physics of the “Universith La Sapienza” in Rome and with the help of the 
SPT2004 Scientific Committee. 
On this occasion, we also added a new feature, i.e. a satellite workshop 
on separable systems; this was organized by one of us (SRW) together with 
S. Benenti (dipartimento di Matematica, UniversitL di Torino), F. Calogero 
(dipartimento di Fisica, Universith di Roma), and F. Magri (Dipartimento 
di Matematica, Universith di Milano-Bicocca); this is turn followed an ear- 
lier workshop on the same subject’ SRW organized in Linkoeping in Jan- 
uary 2004. 
In SPT2004 we focused on several topics and, for the first time in this 
series of conferences, had to resort to parallel sessions due to the number 
of high-quality proposed contributions. In particular, we would like to 
point out we had two intensive sessions on the quite new - and hot - 
topic of “choreography” solutions of the N-body problem, organized by ST; 
these were, for the quality and quantity of talks, nearly a conference in the 
conference. 
Other special sessions - beside the general sessions held in the mornings 
- have been devoted to algebraic and geometric integrability, to geometry 
and symmetry of dynamical systems, to integrable evolution equations, to 
different kind of perturbation theories and bifurcation analysis, and again 
to the geometrical theory of separation of variables. In organizing these 
we received the helpful assistance of Profs. Degasperis, Fels, Kuznetsov, 
Verhulst and Walcher. 
The papers collected here should give some flavor of the many topics 
V 

vi 
discussed, and results presented, at the conference (unfortunately, for sev- 
eral reasons, contributions in the field of algebraic integrability were not 
provided for this volume). We preferred, in line of the interdisciplinary 
nature of the whole SPT conference series and as in previous SPT confer- 
ence volumes, to present all of them together, i.e. without a separation in 
different topics. 
We would also like to point out that, as already happened in 199g2 and 
20015, there were some “tutorial papers” prepared in connection to the 
conference; these will appear separately6. 
We hope the reader will enjoy the paper collected here and will find them 
useful to gather a picture of the recent progress in the fields our conference 
touched upon. If this is the case, the merit is of course not ours but of the 
authors.

A CO-CHAIN MAP FOR THE G INVARIANT 
DE RHAM COMPLEX 
I.M. ANDERSON, M.E. FELS

1. Introduction 
In this note we characterize the Lie group actions for which there exists, at 
least locally, an evaluation map that defines a cochain map from the differ- 
ential complex of invariant forms on a manifold to the de Rham complex 
for the quotient. This problem is motivated by the principle of symmetric 
criticality [4]. 
Before giving any specific definitions we would like to illustrate the 
notion of such an evaluation map with a simple example. Consider the two 
dimensional Abelian Lie group G = IR2 with coordinates (a,b) acting on 
IR3 by 
(a, b) * (2, Y, z )  = (z, Y + a, + b). 
If (Y E R2(IR3)G and v E R3(IR3)G, where we use the convention that a 
group superscript denotes the invariants of the group, then cy and u are 
necessarily of the form 
cy = a(z)dz A dy + b(z)dz A d z  + c(z)dy A d z  and 
v = A(s)dz A dy A dz. 
The Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators of this action of G is generated 
by {ay, a,} and it is easy check that evaluation on the generators 
cy(ay, a,) = 4.) 
~ ( a y ,  a,, -) = A ( s ) d z  
defines a cochain map from R*(IR3)G to R*-2(IR), that is, 
(dCY)(ay, a,, -) = d(cy(d,, a,)) = c(z)’dz. 
As we shall see, not all group actions admit cochain evaluation maps.

2. Lie group actions and invariant vector fields 
Let G be a pdimensional Lie group which acts effectively on an n- 
dimensional manifold M with multiplication map p : G x M + M .  We 
write gx instead of p(g,x). For x E M and g E G, we define p, : G -+ M 
and pg : M + M to be the maps 
P X ( 9 )  = Pg(X) = gx. 
For any g E G ,  pg is a diffeomorphism of M .  We let G, denote the isotropy 
subgroup of G at x, 
G, = (9 E G J g x  
= x}. 
For each x E MI the map b, : G/G, --f h/l given by jl,([g]) = gx is a one- 
to-one immersion which is also G equivariant with respect to the canonical 
action of G on the coset space GIG,. 
The Lie algebra g of the Lie group G is the Lie algebra of right in- 
variant vector fields on G. The action of G on M induces a Lie algebra 
homomorphism r : g --f X ( M )  of g to the vector fields on M whose image 
is the Lie algebra of the infinitesimal generators of the action of G on M 
[7]. 
We write I? = r(g). Because the action of G on M is assumed effective, 
the map r is injective. Let I' c T M  denote the (integrable) distribution 
generated by I?. 
The action of the Lie group G on M is said to be regular if the space of 
orbits is a manifold &f = M / G  such that the quotient map 
q : M + & f  
is a submersion. We will assume from here on that all actions are regu- 
lar. For regular actions the orbits all have the same dimension which we 
assume to be q and so the isotropy subgroup G,, for any x E M ,  will have 
dimension p - q. Let Vert M -+ M be the sub-bundle of q vertical vectors 
in T M ,  so VertM = kerq, = I'. We also have the important property 
The action of G on M defines an action of G on T M  using the differential 
(bx)*(T[e]G/Gx) 
= VertxM. 
(pg), : T M  + T M .  
For each g E G,, equation (1) gives 
(pg)+ : T,M 
-+ T,M 
which defines the linear isotropy representation of G, on the tangent space 
T,M. 

3 
Suppose now that X is a G invariant vector field, that is, 
(Pg)*Xx = x g x .  
(2) 
If g E G,, then equation (2) implies that 
x, E (T,M)G? 
This observation leads us to define the following subset of T M ,  
n(TM) = u K(T,M), where n(T,M) = (TxM)GJ. 
xEM 
(3) 
Equation (3) implies that every G invariant vector field X takes values in 
the subset K ( T M )  c T M .  
Since qopg = g ,  the action of G on T M  restricts to an action on Vert M 
and the linear isotropy representation of G, also restricts to a representation 
on vertical vectors 
(,ug), : Vert,M -+ Vert,M, 
g E G, 
Thus a G invariant vertical vector field takes values in the set 
K (  VertM) = u K (  Vert,M) , where 
n( Vert,M) = ( Vert,M)Gr 
xEM 
In the next theorem we give conditions which guarantee the existence 
of invariant vector fields. This is a special case of the general construction 
given in [2] or on p. 657 in [3]. 
Theorem 2.1. 
If n ( T M )  c T M  is a vector sub-bundle, then for each 
x E M and Y E n(T,M) there exists a G invariant vector field X on M 
such that X ,  = Y .  The analogous statement holds for G invariant vertical 
vector fields i f  K (  Vert M )  c Vert M is a vector sub-bundle. 
Remark 2.1 For the rest of this article we assume that all group actions 
are regular and that K ( T M ) ,  and K (  VertM) are bundles. 
3. Lie algebra cohomology 
Given a Lie group G and a Lie subgroup K c G, with corresponding Lie 
algebras t c g, define the vector space of K relative forms on g by 
A'(g, K )  ={ cy E AT(g) I ~,a = 0, b' v E t and Ad*g. cy = cy , b' g E K }, 
where A'(g) are the alternating r-forms on g and Ad* denotes the co-adjoint 
representation of G on AT(g). 

4 
The usual exterior derivative d on A*(g) restricts to make A*(g, K )  a 
differential complex whose cohomology is denoted by H*(g, K ) ,  the Lie 
algebra cohomology of g relative to the subgroup K .  
If K c G is a closed Lie subgroup, let H*(R*(G/K)G) be the d- 
cohomology of the G invariant forms on G / K .  
Lemma 3.1. 
HT(R*(G/K)G) 
N HT(g, K ) .  
See Theorem 13.1 in [6] for a proof of this Lemma. It is well-known [8], 
that if G is connected and compact and K closed, then H*(g, K )  computes 
the de Rham cohomology of the homogeneous space G / K .  
It is useful to note that if K2 = gKlg-' are conjugate subgroups of G 
then Ad(g) induces an isomorphism 
If K C G is closed, then RT(G/K)G N AT(g,K) and 
A*(& K1) = A*(& K2). 
(4) 
Example: Consider the 2 sphere S2 and the projective plane RP2 as the 
homogeneous spaces S0(3)/S0(2) and S0(3)/0(2). Letting X I ,  X2, X 3  
be a basis for so(3) with X3 the basis for so(2) (which particular so(2) is 
actually irrelevant because of (4)) and letting a', a2, a3 be the dual basis, 
we find 
A'(so(3), SO(2)) = ( 0 )  and A2(so(3), SO(2)) = {a' A a'}. 
Therefore H2(so(3), SO(2)) is generated by a1 A a2. On the other hand, 
there is a reflection in O(2) which maps X1 to - X I  and X2 to X2 so that 
A1(so(3), O(2)) = ( 0 )  and A2(so(3), O(2)) = ( 0 )  
and therefore H2(so(3), O(2)) = 0. Of course, these computations reflect 
the fact that S2 is orientable whereas IRP2 is not. 
4. 
In this section we generalize the evaluation map from the introduction by 
studying the problem of defining a map 
A map on the G invariant de Rham complex 
px 
IC . 
' s2k(M)G -+ R"q(M) 
which shifts form degree by the orbit dimension q of G on M .  To begin, 
we define A,( VertM) + M to be the vector bundle of vertical q-chains 
on VertM (alternatively, the bundle of vertical multi-vectors of degree q). 
Given that the orbits of G have dimension q it follows that about each point 

5 
x E M there exists an open set U and vector fields X I ,  X2, . . . , X ,  in I? 
which define a local frame for Flu = VertU. Consequently if X is a section 
of A,( VertM) then X(u can written as 
XI" = J X , A X 2 A . . . A X q ,  
where J E C"(U). The action of G on VertM described in section 2, 
induces an action of G on A, ( Vert M )  . 
Given a G invariant q-chain X : M -+ A, ( Vert M )  , we now define a map 
L X  : O k ( M )  -+ S2:C4(M) where 
Cl2,*,(M) = {w E R*(M) I L
~
W
 
= 0 for all X E r) 
are the q semi-basic forms on M .  The map LX is defined by setting 
(LXW)x(Yl,Y2,-. , Y k - q )  = ~ x ( ~ x , ~ l l ~ 2 1 . . . l ~ k - q )  
for w E 0 2 " ( M )  
and Y, E TxM. If w E S2k(M)G then LXW is q semi-basic, 
and since X is G invariant, L X W  is G invariant and so G basic. By this last 
statement L X W  E S2:,q(M)G, and therefore by Lemma A.3 in [l], we find 
there exists a unique ( k  - q)-form LXw on 
satisfying q*(W) 
= L X W .  
The sought after evaluation map p x  is then defined by 
Note that for each invariant X we have a map p x .  
Theorem 4.1. 
X on M ,  then 
If there exists a non-vanishing G invariant vertical q-chain 
As(g,G,) # 0 
for all x E M. 
(6) 
Conversely, if for each x E M ,  Aq(g, G I )  # 0 then about each xo E M there 
exists a G invariant open set U and non-vanishing G invariant vertical q- 
chain X on U .  
Proof. Let X be a non-vanishing G invariant vertical q-chain. Let x E 
M and let 2 be the restriction of X to G/G,, so that (jix)*2 = X .  By 
the equivariance property of jix the q-chain 2 is G invariant. Now let 
a E W ( M )  satisfy a(X) = 1. The form Q: is not unique, and it is not 
necessarily invariant. We claim the form ji;a defines a non-zero element of 
Oq(G/Gx)G. We compute 
(g*ji:cy)(q = a ( ( L ) * g * X )  = cr((jix)*%) = a(X) = 1. 
Thus ji:cy is a non-vanishing G invariant form of top degree on GIG, and 
so, by Lemma 3.1, Aq(g, G,) # 0. 

6 
We now prove the converse part of the theorem. Let 
K(A,(VertM)) = u K(h,(Vert,M)), 
where K(A,(Vert,M)) 
= 
(A,(Vert,M))G=. We shall show that 
Aq(g, G,) # 0 implies n(A,(VertM)) is a line bundle. Then the existence 
of a G invariant q-chain is guaranteed (in a similar manner to Theorem 2.1) 
by Theorem 1.2 in [2]. 
If Aq(g,G,) # 0 then by Lemma 3.1 there exists a non-vanishing 
6 E s2q(G/Gz)G. Let % be the invariant q-chain defined by ti(%) = 1. 
Then x, = (p,),5&1 E A,(Vert,M))G= by the equivariance of f i x ,  and is 
non-zero. Thus A,(Vert,M))G7 = A,(Vert,M) and so K(A,(VertM)) = 
0 
,EM 
A,(VertM) is a line bundle. 
5. The cochain condition 
In this section we find necessary and sufficient conditions on the action of 
G on M that determine whether we can choose a G invariant q-chain X so 
that the map px : s2*(M)G 4 R*-,(M) defined in (5) is a cochain map, 
that is, 
P X ( d 4  = dPX(W). 
(7) 
Granted that the action of G on M satisfies the conditions in Remark 2.1, 
the solution to this problem is given by the following theorem. 
Theorem 5.1. If there exists a non-vanishing invariant q-chain X such 
that the map px in (5) defines a cochain map, then H4(g,Gx) # 0 for 
all x E M .  Conversely, i f  HQ(g,G,) # 0 for all x E M then about each 
xo E M there exists a G invariant open set U and a non-vanishing G 
invariant vertical q-chain X on U such that px s2*(U)G ---f R*-q(U/G) is 
a cochain map. 
In order to prove this theorem, we need a number of preliminary results. 
The first of these is the important observation that the cochain condition 
(7), which is a condition that involves the quotient manifold a, can be 
expressed as a condition entirely on M .  
Lemma 5.1. 
if and only if 
A G invariant, vertical q-chain X defines a cochain map px 
~xdw = (-1)4d(LXu) 
for all w E s2*(M)G. 
(8) 

7 
Proof. If q is any G basic form, then dq is also G basic. Let f j  be the 
unique form on H such that q*(fj) = q. Then, since 
q*(dfj) = dq*(fj) = dq 
the two forms dfj and & pullback by q to the same form and must therefore 
be equal. Since X and w are both G invariant, we can apply this observation 
to the G basic form LXW to deduce that 
d ( w )  = d(Lxw). 
The cochain condition (7) can therefore be expressed as 
~~ 
(-1)'LXd(w) = d(LXW). 
(9) 
But two G basic forms on M are equal if and only if the corresponding 
forms on 
are equal and so (9) proves the equivalence of (7) with (8). 
Lemma 5.2. 
for all G invariant r-forms, r 2 q. 
If (8) holds for all G invariant (n - 1)-forms, then (8) holds 
Proof. Suppose (8) holds true for all G invariant (n - 1)-forms. Let w 
be a G invariant r-form, where q 5 r < n - 1. Then, if Q is any G basic 
(n - r - 1)-form, w A a is a G invariant (n - 1)-form and therefore we can 
use (8) to write 
LXd(w A a) = (-1)'d 
( L X ( W  A a ) )  
Because CY (and hence d a )  is G basic, the expansion of both sides of this 
equation b' 
wives

Since Q is an arbitrary G basic form and LXdw and d(Lxw) are both G basic 
this implies 
Lemma 5.3. Let p be a G basic (n - 4)-form on a G invariant open set 
U .  Let X be a non-vanishing, G invariant, vertical q-chain on U and let Q 
be any q-form such that a ( X )  = 1. Then 
v = Q A p  
is a G invariant n-form on U .

Proof. For any g E G, we compute 
[P;(a)l(x) = 4(PUs)*(X)) = 
Lx[P;(41 = LX[P;(a) A PI = CL = L X V .  
= 1 
and therefore 
This suffices to prove that pi(u) = u.

vector field then 
CRX = X R X ,  
where XR is a G invariant function. 
Proof. Let X I , .  . . , X q  be vector fields in r which form a local basis for 
VertM in some neighborhood about the point x. Then X = J X 1  A X2 A 
. . . A X, and, since [ R, X ,  1 = 0, 
Theorem 5.2. 
then the map px : C2*(M)G -+ O*-q(m) is a cochain map if and only if 
If X is a non-vanishing, G invariant, vertical q-chain, 
LRx = 0 
(10) 
for all G invariant vector fields R on M 
Proof. We start by assuming (10). Then by Lemma 5.2 it suffices to prove 
(8) for G invariant (n - 1)-forms. 
Given the non-vanishing G invariant vertical q-chain X ,  let x E M and 
use Lemma 5.3 to construct a non-vanishing G invariant n-form u = a A p 
on an invariant open set U about x. Let w E C2n-1(M)G, then restricted 
to U there exists a unique G invariant vector field S on U such that 
w u  = LSU. 
(11) 
Let R be a G invariant vector field on M which agrees with S on an invariant 
open set V c U of x so that 
W v  = LRU. 
(12) 
With wv given by (12), we compute on V 
[d(Lxw)IV = ~ ( L X L R U )  = (-l)'d(LRLXU) = (-1)'d(LRP) 
and 
[ L X C ~ W ] ~  
= L X ~ ( L R V )  
= LXLR(V) 
= LR(P) - L ~ ~ ( X ) U .  

9 
But it is easy to check that if p is a G basic (n - q)-form, then dp = 0 and 
therefore 
[d(LXW) - ( - l ) q L x 4 ,  = (-l)qLLR(x)v. 
(13) 
Evaluating (13) at x E V shows that if (10) holds at x then (8) holds at 
x for all G invariant (n - 1)-forms w .  Since our original point x E M was 
arbitrary, equation (8) holds on M .  
To prove that (8) implies (10) we reverse the argument above. Let R 
be a G invariant vector field on M and let x E M .  Choose a G basic 
(n - q)-form p which doesn't vanish at x. Then the form w = LRv, where 
v = Q A p with Q ( X )  = 1, is a G invariant n - 1 form on M .  Equation (13) 
(evaluated at x) coupled with Lemma 5.4 shows that (8) implies (10) at x. 
0 
But x was arbitrary so (10) holds on M .  
We are now in a position to prove Theorem 5.1. 
Proof. We begin the proof by first noting that the condtion Hq(g, G,) # 0 
is equivalent to the following: 
i] For each x E M there exists a non-vanishing 6 E S2q(G/Gz)G; and 
ii] for all f j  E S2q-1(G/G2)G, dfj = 0. 
Suppose there exists a non-vanishing G invariant q-chain X such that 
p x  is a cochain map. Let a E P ( M )  with a(X) = 1. Then as was shown in 
Theorem 4.1, given any x E M ,  &a E S2Q(G/G,)G and is non-vanishing. 
Thus condition i] is true. 
Let f j  E S2q-1(G/G2)G. Then f j  can be written f j  = L ~ P ~ Q  
where 
is 
a G invariant vector field on G/G,. 
Now (p2).qe1 E ts(Vert,M) and by 
the hypothesis on invariant vector fields (Theorem 2.1), there exists a G 
invariant vector field Y on M such that Y, = (p,).qel. Thus f j  = & ( ~ y c r ) .  
In order to calculate dfj we let p be a G basic (n - q)-form which doesn't 
vanish at x so that by Lemma 5.3 cr A p  is G invariant n-form which doesn't 
vanish at x. It is simple to check that L X [ ~ ( L Y Q ) ] ~  
= 0 if and only if 
By using the fact p is d-closed and by applying equation (8) to the 
LX[d(LYO) A 4 2  = 0. 
invariant one-form L Y ( Q  A p) = ( L Y Q )  A p, we find 
LX[d(LYQ) A PI2 = LX[d(LYQ A P)12 = 
dfj(X)[e] = [QWLYQ)(~)] 
[4 = [ P ~ ~ ( L Y Q ) ( Q ] [ ~ ]  
= [ ~ ( L Y & ) ( X ) I ,  
= 0 
[d(LXLYQ) A P)], = 0. 
(14) 
Thus L X [ ~ ( L Y C Y ) ] ,  
= 0. Now computing 

10 
and using the invariance of ij we get dij = 0. This proves ii] and therefore 
Then by Theorem 4.1 the 
hypothesis Aq(g, G,) # 0, implies there exists a non-vanishing G invariant 
q-chain X O  on an invariant open neighbourhood U of XO. Suppose that the 
rank of K (  VertM) is s and that the rank of K ( T M )  is T .  Let Y,, a = 1,. . . s 
be a local frame about 20 for K (  VertM) consisting of invariant vector fields. 
Choose invariant vector fields Z,, t = s + 1,. . . , r which together with Y, 
form a local frame about xo for n(TM). Refine U so all these objects exist 
on an invariant open set which we again call U .  
We now show that if Hq(g, G,) # 0 then Cx,Xo = 0. First we compute 
Hs(8,GX) # 0. 
To prove the converse, choose xo E M .  
( l Y a a ) ( X o )  = Y a ( a ( X 0 ) )  - CY(.CYaXO) = - a ( l Y a X 0 ) .  
[d(Lyaa) + ~y-da] 
( X O )  = -a(.CxzXo). 
Expanding out the left side of this equation we get 
(15) 
Immediately LXoLyada = 0, because Y, is vertical, while condition ii] implies 
by the argument used above that[d(~y,a)] 
(XO) = 0, and so (15) along with 
Lemma 5.3 implies Ly,Xo = 0. 
To finish the proof of the theorem we now show there exists an invariant 
K which doesn't vanish at xo so that X = KXo satisfies equation (10) for 
Y,,Z,. Using the fact that CxLX0 = 0, it is easy to check Cx,(KXo) = 0. 
The conditions CZ, (KXo) = 0 leads to the differential equations for K 
Lz,X = (Z,(K) + KXz,)Xo = 0 
where XZ, are determined as in Lemma 5.4. 
2, 
= q*Z,, this equation for K can be written on 
The functions K ,  XZ, and the vector fields 2, are all invariant so letting 
as 
Z,(K) + RXz, = 0. 
(16) 
The integrability conditions for K or K can be easily verified by a com- 
putation using Lemma 5.4. Therefore there exists an open neighbourhood 
v of 10 and a non-vanishing 
which is a solution to (16). Consequently 
K X ~  
= (q*K)Xo satisfies (10) on q-l(V). 
6. Examples 
Example 1. As our first example consider the two dimensional solvable 
group G = IR' x IR with coordinates (a, b) acting on IR x IR* x IR by 
( a , b ) * ( X , Y , z )  = (az+b,ay,z). 

11 
This is a free action and so H2(g, G,) = H2(g) and one easily computes 
H2(g) = 0. 
We proceed to check Theorem 5.2 for this example. The most general 
G invariant vertical 2-chain X is of the form 
x = K(z)y2ax A a,. 
The invariant vector fields are 
Computing C,a,X 
we get 
CYa,X = 
A 
and so, consistent with Theorem 5.2 and Theorem 5.1 there is no choice of 
non-zero K ( z )  so that (10) is satisfied, and no cochain map exists. 
Example 2. Consider the action of the two dimensional Abelian group 
G = IR2 with coordinates (al b) on IR2 given by 
(a,b) * ( Z l Y )  = ( s + a Y  + b , Y ) .  
The fact the group is Abelian implies H1(g,G,) # 0, for all z E IR2, so a 
cochain map exists by Theorem 5.1. The G invariant vertical 1-cochains 
are given by 
and the invariant vector fields are 
R = a(y)& . 
So every cochain X in (17) satisfies (10). This examples demonstrates the 
fact that the q-chain may not be unique, and by a further simple compu- 
tation, that the cochain map px may not be surjective. 
As a final remark we state a theorem on the surjectivity of p x .  
Theorem 6.1. Let X be a G invariant vertical q-chain such that px defines 
a cochain map. Then px is surjective if and only i f  there exists Q E a q ( M )  
such that a(X) = 1 and Q is G invariant.

NEW EXAMPLES OF TRIHAMILTONIAN STRUCTURES 
LINKING DIFFERENT LENARD CHAINS

The extension of bihamiltonian systems allows to realize a recursion relation be- 
tween different Lenard chain. In particular extensions of either three-particle pe- 
riodic Toda lattice, or systems on the Euclidean plane separable in parabolic co- 
ordinates or in elliptic-hyperbolic ones are presented. 
1. Introduction 
The classical concept of Hamiltonian vector field Xh, generated by the 
Hamiltonian function h, can be generalized using a Poisson tensor P and 
formulas 
Xh(f) = P(dh, df) = {h, f} 
. 
One of the advantages of this generalization is the possibility to construct 
many Poisson tensors on the same manifold and then to associate more 
vector fields to a given Hamiltonian, or to associate more Hamiltonians to 
a vector field. Moreover, in this way it is possible to deal with degener- 
ate Poisson brackets too, i.e. brackets that admits non-constant functions 
(called Casimir functions of the bracket) in involution with all the others. 
Two Poisson tensors P and Q are said to be compatible (in Magri’s 
sense) if Q - XP is a Poisson tensor for any A; this Poisson tensor is called 
the Poisson pencil of the two tensors. Two compatible Poisson tensors 
define a bihamiltonian structure. A vector field is called bihamiltonzan if it 
is Hamiltonian with respect to two compatible Poisson tensors. 
A particular importance in the study of integrable systems is given to 
bihamiltonian vector fields X ,  belonging to a Lenard chain, i.e. such that 
their Hamiltonians satisfy the Lenard-Magri recursion relations 
Pdh, = Qdh,+l 
(1)

for a bihamiltonian structure. The recursion relations (1) can be repre- 
sented by the diagram 
An important theorem of the bihamiltonian theory states that all the Hamil- 
tonians associated to the vector fields of a Lenard chain are in involution 
with respect to both the Poisson structures. A quite effective method to 
construct a Lenard chain is to look for a Casimir function of the Pois- 
son pencil generated by the two Poisson tensors: all the coefficients of the 
powers expansion with respect to X of such function satisfy the recursion 
relations (1). 
In many cases a Poisson tensor has more than one Casimir function, 
therefore multiple Lenard chains exist. Moreover, there are well known 
examples of bihamiltonian systems admitting three or more Hamiltonian 
formulation. However, in almost all these classical examples the further 
Poisson structures give a recursion between vector fields already belonging 
to a certain Lenard chain; if there are different Lenard chains, they will 
remain unconnected. Then it becomes very interesting the case of bihamil- 
tonian systems with first integrals organized in multiple Lenard chains for 
which a third Poisson structure exists and establishes a recursion relations 
between distinct Lenard chains. In this way a “two-dimensional’’ recursion 
scheme is constructed, instead of the one-dimensional one (2). Some gen- 
eral properties of these kind of systems were investigated and a class of 
examples was constructed7, but until now very few systems that are tri- 
hamiltonian in this sense are known. In this work some new examples of 
this kind of systems are presented, and moreover they are related to wide 
used techniques, like separation of variables and R-matrix theory. 
2. Trihamiltonian framework 
A trihamiltonian structure on a manifold is given by three mutually com- 
patible Poisson structure P, Q and R. In this paper only trihamiltonian 
structures admitting a common Casimir function are considered. A common 
Casimir function for a trihamiltonian structure is a function f (depending 
on two parameters X and p) such that 
(Q-XP)df=O, 
( R - p P ) d f = O .  

15 
Not every trihamiltonian structure admits such a function7, and it plays 
a role analogous to Casimir functions of the Paisson pencil in the stan- 
dard bihamiltonian framework: the coefficients of its powers expansion 
f = C fijX',uJ 
obey the recursion rules 
representable by the following recursion diagram

Similarly to the bihamiltonian case, the recursion relations (3) imply that 
the coefficients fij are mutually in involution with respect to each of the 
three Poisson structures7. 
3. Trihamiltonian extension of Toda lattice 
A Lax representation for the periodic Toda lattice can be constructed" on 
the Kupershmidt associative algebra K ,  of formal power series in the shift 
operator A with coefficients in the ring, equipped with the component-wise 
operations, of n-periodic sequence a = (all,. . . ,gin). On this algebra the 
relation Aku = aIklAk, where 
= uli+k, holds; moreover the linear 
involution *(aAk) 
= APku and the traceform 
are defined. An operator L E K ,  is skewsymmetric if *L = -L, and it is 
symmetric if *L = L. A symmetric element is of degree k if it contains 

16 
powers of A only until k, then it can be represented as 
L = A-'ok + . . . + oo + . . . + okAk 
On K,, using the associative product, the two natural operations 
[A, B] = AB - BA 
AB+ BA 
2 
A . B =  
and the ad-invariant scalar product (A, B )  = tt(AB) are introduced. 
The Lie algebra K, can be split into two subalgebras: g+ of skewsym- 
metric operators and g- of operators with powers of A not greater than 0. 
Using the ad-invariant scalar product a second decomposition K, = g+@g- 
is obtained, where g+ = (g+)l is the vector space of symmetric operators 
and g- = (8-)' 
is the subalgebra of operators with powers of A strictly 
negative. The space of symmetric operators of degree k is indicated with g z .  
Therefore an R-matrix is given, as usual, by 
r=rI+-n- 
and one can prove1~2~12 
that the linear and quadratic Poisson brackets 
if7 g } p  = ( L  [r(Vf), 091 + [Of, r(Vg)I) 
{f, dQ = ( L  [r(Lo Of), 091 + [Of, r(L Vg)I) 
are reducible by restriction on g t  for any k. Finally, an isomorphism of 
associative algebras between K, and the algebra of formal Laurent series 
with coefficients in g [ ( n )  exists''. 
The ordinary periodic Toda lattice with n particles is set in the sub- 
space &. A Lax matrix for the three-particles case (the only one considered 
from now on), in Flaschka coordinates (bi, ai), is given by" 
A Casimir function of the pencil Q - XP is given by any coefficient in C 
of det(L - A€), so in this case one has two distinct Casimir functions, that 
are polynomial in the parameter A. The coefficients of these two polyno- 
mials are independent and mutually in involution first integrals, enough in 
number to prove the complete integrability of the system. 

17 
A natural extension is obtained considering the subspace g t ,  in this 
case the Lax matrix of the system, in the coordinates (bi, ai, ci), is 
and also in this case any coefficient in < of 
is a Casimir function of the pencil Q - XP'22.

This extension admits a trihamiltonian structure: introducing the Pois-

obtained','. The corresponding recursion scheme is

4. Trihamiltonian extension of natural separable systems 
A further class of examples is given by separable systems in the Euclidean 
plane. Here only systems separable in parabolic coordinates or elliptic- 
hyperbolic ones are considered, the general case can be worked out in a 
similar way6. A natural Hamiltonian is a function of the form 
1 . .  
H = -gz3p. 
. 
apj + V(q) 
9 
defined on the cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold ( Q , g ) .  The 
separability, trough point transformation, of this kind of Hamiltonians on 
the Euclidean plane is characterized by the existence of a second function 
K (related to a special3 Killing tensor for the metric g )  that satisfies the so 
called Stuckel relations. In each coordinate system there is a specific form 
for the two functions H and K and for the Stackel relations5. The two 
Hamiltonian functions in parabolic coordinates are: 
They satisfy the Stackel relation 

19 
The two Hamiltonian functions in elliptic-hyperbolic coordinates are 
(;P: + dl(S)) (s2 - k2) - (;P; + d 2 M )  (d2 - k2) 
H =  
K =  
s2 - d2 
(;P; - i p :  + 4 2 ( 4  - di(s)) (s2 - k2)(d2 - k2) 
s2 - d2 
and satisfy the Stackel relation 
Using the symplectic transformations for the parabolic case 
A1 = u, A2 = v, p1 = pu, p2 = Pv 
and respectively for the elliptic-hyperbolic case 
P S  
Pd 
= s2 - k2,X2 = d2 - k2,pl = - , p 2  = - 
2s 
2d 
in both cases the Stackel relations become: 
where, respectively for parabolic and elliptic-hyperbolic coordinates, the 
functions ri(X, p) are 
The two relations (4) are very similar to the separation equations ob- 
tained, in the general trihamiltonian framework, starting from a common 
Casimir function of the trihamiltonian structure7, except the fact that 
the canonical Poisson structure on the cotangent bundle doesn't have any 
Casimir function. The trihamiltonian scheme 

20 
is the simplest one that the vector fields associated to H and K fit, re- 
specting polynomial relations (4). In fact, it is associated to the common 
Casimir function f = i? + ~i;i 
+ x2c1 + pc2 + ~ p c 3 .  
The diagram (5) cannot be constructed using a non degenerate Poisson 
tensor. One needs to enlarge the phase space of the system to T*Q x R3 
(with coordinates Xi, pi and c,). This is a Poisson manifold with the trivial 
extension of the canonical Poisson structure on T*Q: 
On the other hand, fi and 
are functions that reduce to the Hamiltonians 
H and K on the symplectic leaf c, = 0. The explicit expression for H and 
K is found by imposing the separation relations (in Sklyanin's sense): 
K + x,H + X ? C ~ +  pzc2 + Xzpzc3 = rz(x,, p z ) ,  
(6) 
that generalize the relations (4), and by solving this linear system in the 
two unknowns H and i?. The two further bivectors Q and R are finally 
defined on T*Q x R3 by formulas 
a 
Q = c,x a 
apz A & + X, A =, 
a
a
 
R = z a p  - 
A - + X E  A a + X -  A -2- 
zap, 
ax, 
acz

acs. 
As final result of this construction, the three bivectors P, Q and R are 
Poisson tensors, the function f is a common Casimir function for the two 
pencils Q - XP and R - pP and therefore generates the recursion scheme 
(5), for any choice of the functions r, . 
The presented extension procedure is analogous to the techniques used 
in the bihamiltonian separability theoryg>'', and the relations (6) corre- 
spond to the separation curve recently introduced4.

WAVE PROPAGATION IN AN ELASTIC MEDIUM: 
GDS EQUATIONS

Wave propagation in a bulk medium composed of an elastic material with couple 
stresses is considered. Using a multi-scale expansion of quasi-monochromatic wave 
solutions, it is shown that (2+1) (two spatial and one temporal) dimensional wave 
modulation is governed by a system of three nonlinear evolution equations which 
will be called the ”generalized Davey-Stewartson (GDS) equations”. Some special 
solutions of the GDS equations are also presented. 
1. Introduction 
It is well-known that the envelope of a (lfl) dimensional quasi- 
monochromatic wave train is governed by the single nonlinear Schrodinger 
(NLS) 
ZAt +PA,, + q1AI2A = 0, 
(1) 
where t is time, x is the spatial coordinate and A denotes the complex am- 
plitude. The NLS equation appears to be a generic equation describing uni- 
directional wave modulation. If modulations transverse to the wave propa- 
gation direction are also allowed, second spatial coordinate effect should be 
taken into account and new (2+1) evolution equations should be derived 
[1,2]. A natural way to obtain two-dimensional modulations of nonlinear 
waves is simply to replace the one dimensional dispersive term with a two 
dimensional dispersive term [3,4] 
22 

23 
However, in many two dimensional systems both short waves and long waves 
may co-exist and the modulation of such a system can be characterized by 
the Davey-Stewartson (DS) equations [5,6,7] 
iAt +PA,, + TA,, + qlAI2A = bAd,, 
dm + m d y y  = (1A12)z, 
(3) 
where A is the complex amplitude of the short wave and 4 is the long wave 
amplitude. The DS system is a model for the evolution of weakly nonlinear 
packets of water waves that travel in one direction but in which the am- 
plitude of waves is modulated in two spatial directions. The main purpose 
of the present study is to extend the analysis of Davey and Stewartson to 
describe (2+1) dimensional wave motion in a bulk elastic medium. 
2. Two-Dimensional Wave Packets 
The micromorphic elastic solids, roughly speaking, are the classical elastic 
solids that admit micro deformations of the micro volume elements about 
the center of mass of the volume element [8]. The deformation tensors are 
defined as

Also, D2 and 0 3  represent the dispersion relation corresponding to the 
transverse displacement modes associated with u2 and u3, respectively. As 
is seen from equations (lo), both the longitudinal and the transverse modes 
are dispersive. 
At this step, by using the reductive perturbation method, the evolution 
equations characterizing the nonlinear wave interaction of a short transverse 
wave, a long transverse wave and a long longitudinal wave will be obtained. 

25 
To this aim, the slowly varying amplitude of the short wave and amplitudes 
of the long waves will be assumed to be functions of the slow variables

and t are fast space and time variables; E ,  r] and r are slow space and time 
coordinates in a frame of reference moving with the group speed of the 
short transverse wave. Here the direction of the wave propagation is taken 
along the x axis and it is assumed that the field variables depend on the 
transverse coordinate y as well. Since we deal with the nonlinear interaction 
of the quasi-harmonic transverse wave and the zero harmonic transverse 
and longitudinal waves, it is convenient to expand the components of the 
displacement vector in asymptotic power series of E as follows: 
u1 = €41 ( E ,  r], r) + 2[iZ(~, 
r ] ,  T>ezis + c.c.] + . . .

213 = €[A([, r ] ,  r)eie + c.c.] + E~[G([, 
r], T)e2ze + c.c.] + . . . 
(12) 
Here 6 = kx - w t  is the phase, k is the wave number of the carrier wave, 
w is the frequency, C.C. stands for the complex conjugate of the preceding 
term. In expansion (12), A is the complex amplitude of the free short trans- 
verse wave mode whereas 41 and 4 2  are the free long longitudinal and free 
long transverse wave modes, respectively. Now, the scale transformation 
(11) together with power series solutions (12) are substituted into the field 
equations. If the coefficients of like powers of E are equated, a hierarchy of 
perturbation equations is obtained. 
For order c3, using the results of lower order perturbation equations, 
leads one to the evolution equations. The non-dimensional form of these 
equations may be given as 
2 - 4  + 6AZZ + A,, = XIAI2A + b(41,Z + 42,y)A, 
41,ZZ + mz41,,, + n42,%, = (IA12)Z1

where (A- 1)(m2 -ml) = n2 and the non-dimensional coefficients are given 
in the form

3. Special Solutions of the GDS System 
In order to find the travelling wave solutions of the GDS equations (13), 
the following solutions are considered 
A = f(C)eie, 41 = g(C), 
4 2  = h ( 0 ,  
(15) 
where B = llx + 12y - Ot, and the amplitudes of the short wave f, and the 
long travelling waves g and h are real functions of 5 = klx+ kzg - 2(Sklll+ 
k2l2)t. Here we assume that all the derivatives of f, g and h tend to zero 
as C + 3~00. Substituting the solution (15) into the system (13) leads to 
a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (see [lo], for details). By 
solving these equations, the solution functions f ,  g and h are found in terms 
of Jacobian elliptic functions whose special cases involve the following two 
sets of solitary wave solutions: 
ffl 1 
ff2 1 
g(C) = - ; P 2  
tanh[PlC + 011, 
h(C) = - - P z

where a < 0 , P > 0 and 
where a > 0 , P < 0.

Consider a onemass system with two degrees of freedom, nonlinearly coupled, with 
parametric excitation in one direction. Assuming the internal resonance 1:2 and 
parametric resonance 1:2 we derive conditions for stability of the periodic solutions 
by using the normal form method of averaging. We found an attracting torus with 
large amplitudes by a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. The results on the Neimark- 
Sacker bifurcation obtained by the numerical software package CONTENT and by 
averaging are compared. In all cases we have good agreement. Continuation of the 
torus was done by averaging and by the numerical software package TORCONT. In 
all cases we have good agreement. The torus grows towards a homoclinic structure 
around the origin. The normal form method of averaging proves in general to be 
very effective in studying this type of continuation problems. 
1. Introduction 
Nonlinear vibrating systems often consist of two - or even more - subsys- 
tems, where one of them is excited, the Primary System, and the other 
ones are coupled through nonlinear terms; they are forming the Secondary 
System or Excited System. The Primary System is an oscillator which can 
be excited externally, parametrically or by self-excitation, while the Sec- 
ondary System is excited indirectly through the nonlinear coupling. 
In the present paper we shall consider a single-mass system, but with para- 
metric excitation in the Primary System and a nonlinear coupling expressed 
by second degree terms in the differential equations. The parametric excita- 
tion acts, for example, due to kinematic excitation of the supports through 
nonlinear springs; see Figure 1.

we have assumed the presence of progressive damping to ensure a limited 
vibration amplitude, even at parametric resonance. 
In section 1 we perform a scaling and first order averaging to the equations 
of motion. This leads to explicit results on the stability of the trivial solu- 
tion, see '. In section 2 we find families of periodic solutions. Their stability 
is well determined in l .  Because of the complexity of the expressions this 
is quite surprising. In section 3 the stable periodic solution is continued 
and becomes unstable. This instability is triggered off by a Neimark-Sacker 
bifurcation of the periodic solution. This results in an attracting torus with 
fairly large amplitudes. 
The Neimark-Sacker bifurcation was first pinpointed by using the numerical 
bifurcation program CONTENT. An unusual feature is that this bifurca- 
tion can also be identified and analysed using the normal form method 
(averaging). In section 4 the resulting torus is then continued using aver- 
aging as well as the software package TORCONT. A homoclinic structure 
is pinpointed with good accuracy by the normal form.

1. Scaling and first order averaging 
We shall now use a normal form method (averaging) which enables us to 
obtain more detailed information about the solutions and for which precise 
error estimates are known. As before we consider system (1) in the vicinity 
of the origin. To make this more explicit we introduce the following scaling. 
For more details about this typical scaling see I. 
y, a = 
112 - 
x =E'/'%, 
y = E 
60 =&60. 
b = &'I2&, K = EE, 6 = 8, y = 7, and 
- 
Introducing this scaling into system (1) and omitting the bars yields:

ji + q2y + EKY + Ebx2 = 0. 
The next steps are the usual ones in averaging approximations; see for 
instance 2, chapter 11. We introduce the following transformation: 
i 
y(t) = R2(t) cos(2t + $(t)) $(t) = -2R2(t) sin@ + $(t)) 
Averaging the resulting system in the near resonance case (i. e. q = 4 + 
E u ,  77 = 1 + ~ p )  
yields:

2. The periodic solutions 
Equating the right-hand side of system (3) to zero yields the nontrivial crit- 
ical points of these equations which correspond with 2~-periodic solutions 
of the original system (2). Without loss of generality we assume R2, > 0. 
For notational simplicity, we introduce the following quantities:

The stability of these periodic solutions in the case of exact resonance as 
well as in the near resonance case is discussed in l. 
3. The Neimark-Sacker bifurcation 
We have made use of the software package CONTENT 
to pinpoint this 
bifurcation; see 4, chapter 10, appendix 3 for more information on the 
available software packages and where to download them. We continued 
the stable periodic solution when ab < 0 with b as a control parameter and 
monitored its multipliers. CONTENT’S results are presented below. 
3.1. Numerical data generated by CONTENT 
The following parameters, with respect to system (2), have been used in 
all our numerical analysis. E = 0.1, c = 1, a = 0.5/JE, 7 = 1, 60 = 
0, K = 1, 6 = 0.4, y = 0.2, and u = 0.8 (q = 2.02). A Neimark-Sacker 
bifurcation has been found at the critical value b, = -0.179576/Jz. 
Note 
that, because of the scaling introduced in section 1, to obtain the original 
values of b corresponding to system (l), we have to multiply with &. 
The corresponding multipliers computed by CONTENT, presented in the 
modulus-argument form, are as follows: 
p1 = 1, 41 = 0.207607, p2 = 1, 4 2  = -0.207607, 
p3 = 1, 4 3  = 0, p4 = 0.623983, 4 4  = -0.163293, 
p5 = 0.623983, 4 5  = 0.163293, pf3 = 3.4873 
4 6  = 0. 

31 
We conclude that when the control parameter b goes below the threshold 
value b, = -O.l79576/fi 
a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation takes place, see 
Figure 2. Numerical results shown in Figures 15-17 of Ref. 1 confirm this 
very clearly. We can see from these figures that as the parameter b de- 
creases, it takes longer for the periodic solution to stabilise. When b drops 
below b, the periodic solution looses its stability in the bifurcation. Note 
that system (2) has to be made autonomous in order to able to spot the 
bifurcation with CONTENT. Its dimension becomes therefore equal to 6.

projected on the (x/&, y/&) plane. The outer cycle with dots is the one that bifurcates. 
NS stands for Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. 
3.2. Averaging method results 
Remarkably enough, one can also track down the Neimark-Sacker bifurca- 
tion by looking for a Hopf bifurcation of the nontrivial critical points of the 
averaged system (3). We have done this in the case So = 0 and compared 
the averaged results with the more accurate data obtained by CONTENT. 
The averaged system has a nontrivial critical point which undergoes a Hopf 
bifurcation at the critical value b, 2i -0.171/+. 
This is a rather good first 
order approximation of the more accurate value b, = -0.179576/& 
com- 
puted by CONTENT. The relative error in b is about 5%. The precision 
will improve if we take E smaller. 

32 
4. Continuation of the torus 
Continuation of tori is in general not an easy task to perform from the 
numerical point of view. However, as we know, the torus in the original 
system corresponds with a periodic solution in the averaged system. One 
can now easily continue the cycle in the normal form and try to predict the 
behaviour of the torus in the original system. However, from the theorems 
on averaging, see 5 1 6 ,  we know that this is possible if the torus is normally 
hyperbolic. If this is not the case, there is no guarantee the integral manifold 
in the averaged system will correspond with one in the original system. As 
in our case the periodic solution is hyperbolic and we have parallel flow, we 
can proceed with the continuation without complications. 
4.1. The averaged system 
To avoid hitting the singularity at the origin, we introduce the following 
transformation and average the resulting system keeping the parameters as 
in section 3.

mental software package TORCONT by Frank Schilder7. The torus grows

The relative error is here again about 5%, which is satisfactory. The torus 
looses gradually its smoothness and then disappears yielding this homo- 
clinic structure. This phenomenon of loss of smoothness of tori is quite 
interesting as it leads to the destruction of the torus which gives rise to 
interesting dynamics. See for references '. 
5. Conclusions 
(1) In most cases Neimark-Sacker bifurcations are studied by numerical 
means. Interestingly, we can also analyse this bifurcation in our 
problem by using the normal form method of averaging. The results 
are in good agreement. 
(2) The normal form method of averaging is a powerful tool which can 
easily be used for the continuation of tori without use of experi- 
mental software. Numerical results show here good agreement as 
well. 

34 
(3) Period-doubling as well as loss of differentiability of the torus (which 
we did not discuss in this paper) are well detected by this normal 
form.

COLLISIONLESS ACTION-MINIMIZING TRAJECTORIES 
FOR THE EQUIVARIANT 3-BODY PROBLEM IN lR2

We consider periodic and quasi-periodic solutions of the G-equivariant 3-body 
problem in R2 with a-homogeneous potential, a > 0, from the point of view 
of equivariant calculus of variations. We show that local symmetric minimizers 
for the Lagrangian action are always collisionless, without any assumption on the 
group G other than the fact that collisions are not forced by the group itself. 
1. Introduction 
In the past few years some variational methods have been exploited in the 
search of new periodic solutions as symmetric minimizers for the n-body 
problem. The major problems in the variational approach are the following: 
first the minimimum has to be achieved and this requires a condition of 
coercivity of the action functional on the space of symmetric loops. Second, 
one has to prove that the minimizer is collisionless. 
As we will see in Section 3, coercivity depends on the group G acting 
on the loops space and possibly on the angular velocity of the rotating 
frame. Concerning collisions, we obviously exclude the case when collisions 
are forced by symmetries. A group will be termed bound to collisions if 
every equivariant loop has a collision. To avoid collisions, in [3] the authors 
proposed a class of symmetry groups with the property that all local min- 
imizers are collisionless (groups with the rotating circle property), for the 
general a-homogeneous n-body problem in dimension d 2 2. In spite of its

Differenziali Nonlinear?'.

generality, the main theorem of [3] cannot be applied to some relevant sym- 
metry groups for the planar 3-body problem, such as the symmetry group 
of the Chenciner-Montgomery eight-shape orbit (see [2]). In Sections 4 
and 5 ,  we show that local minimizer for the planar 3-body problem are 
collisionless for all classes of symmetry groups and we prove the following 
Theorem 1.1. Let G a symmetrg group of the Lagrangian in the 3-body 
problem (in a rotating frame or not). If G is not bound to collisions, then 
any local minimizer is collisionless. 
We would like to enphsize that, in the proof of Theorem 1.1, we do not need 
action estimates on colliding trajectories, indeed our approach is purely 
local: we shall exhibit local variations around parabolic ejection-collision 
solutions (which, as shown in [3], are the blow-ups of possible colliding min- 
imizers) that make the action functional decreases. Moreover, Theorem 1.1 
holds for homogeneous potentials of degree -a for every a > 0. 
For the complete theory of the planar equivariant 3-body problem and 
a detailed proof of Theorem 1.1, we refer to [l]. 
2. Setting and notations 
Let E = R2 E C the 2-dimensional Euclidean space and 0 E R2 its origin. 
Let ml, m2, m3 be positive real numbers and X the configuration space of 
three point particles with masses mi respectively with center of mass in 0. 
Let a be a given positive real number. We work in a uniform rotating 
plane with angular velocity w and we consider the potential function (op- 
posite to the potential energy) and the kinetic energy defined respectively 
on X and on the tangent bundle of X as 
where J is the complex unit. We suppose that the origin (which coincide 
with the center of mass) is the point of the plane fixed by the rotation. The 
Lagrangian is 
L,(z,?) = K,(Z,?) 
+ U ( 2 ) .  
Let T c R2 denote a circle of length T = IT1 and A = H’(T, X )  the 
Sobolev space of T-periodic L2 loops T + X with L2 derivative. 

37 
The action functional is the positive-defined function A, : A -+ IR U co 
defined by 
JT 
We say that x E A has a collision at the collision time f E T if there exist 
i # j such that z,(q = z3(E). The action functional & is of class C1 on 
the subspace of collision-free loops of A; hence collisionless critical points 
of A, in A are T-periodic C2-solutions of the associated Euler-Lagrange 
equations 
au 
axi 
mixi = 2JwXi + w2xi + - i = 1,2,3. 
3. Symmetries and coercivity 
In this section we breafly explain how the action of a finite group G on the 
loops space A is defined, recalling that a group G is said to act on a space 
X if there exists a map G x X -+ X, (9, z) H gx, such that (g1,922) H 
(92 . gI)z, where . is the internal operation in G. As described widely in 
[1,3], we consider the orthogonal group representations T ,  p : G -+ O(2) and 
the group homomorphism c : G -+ &. By T and p, G acts on the time 
circle T c IR2 and on the Euclidean space E ,  respectively; by c it acts on 
the index set n = { 1,2,3} satisfying the property 
Vg E G : (a(g)(i) = j + mi = mj) 
Given p and o with property (l), G acts orthogonally on the configuration 
space X by (gx)i = p(g)zo(g-l)i = gxg-li, for every g E G, where in the last 
espression we understand the action of G as a space linear transformation 
or a permutation on the index set. Using the representation T ,  we are now 
able to define the action of G on the set of loops A as follows 
Vg E G, Vt E T, Vx E X ,  (9. 
x)(t) = gx(g-'t). 
Given a group G acting on the loops space A, we define the closed linear 
subspace A 3 AG := {z E A : (9. z)(t) = z(t),W E T,g E G}, as the set of 
G-equivariant loops. Thanks to the Palais Principle of symmetric critica- 
lity, the analysis of critic1 points for the action functional can be restricted 
to sets of equivariant loops and the existence of collisionless critical points 
will be guaranted by some properties on the group G .  Obviously, since we 
are looking for collisionless minimizers of the action functional &,, we are 

38 
not interested in those groups G such that every equivariant path has at 
least a collision, we will call bound t o  collisions a group of this kind. 
We will term A: the restriction of the action functional & I * G ;  
A: is 
termed coercive on AG if A:(z) diverges to infinity as the H1-norm of x 
goes to infinity in AG. Coercivity is the fundamental property to guarantee 
the existence of minimizers on the set AG for the functional d,". 
Remark 
that when w $ Z, 
for every finite group G acting on the loop space the 
action functional A: 
is coercive on AG; moreover, when w = 0, AG is 
coercive on AG if and only if X G  = {z E X : ga: = x, Vg E G} = { (0, 0, 0)) 
(see Proposition (4.1) in [3]). 
4. Symmetry constraints for collision trajectories 
As we have already explained in Section 3, the existence of minimizers for 
the action functional A: is guaranted by a condition on the action of the 
finite group G on the configuration space. In this section we deal with the 
much more complicate problem of avoiding collisions for a local minimizer of 
the action functional A:. Fortunatly, we can deeply simplify this problem 
using some well known results. At first, we recall that in [4] W. Gordon 
remarked that when Q 2 2, local minimizers for the action functional are 
collisionless, since the action level of colliding trajectories is infinite. Now 
on, we will then suppose Q E (0,2). 
In 4, D. Ferrario and S. Terracini, inspired by the Marchal's Principle 
exposed in 2 , 6 ,  propose a property of the action of the group G (the rotating 
circle property) to avoid collisions in local minimizers for the restricted 
action functional A,". Concerning the three body problem in the plane, a 
finite group G acts on n = { 1,2,3} (resp. k, Ikl = 2) and E with the rotating 
circle property (r.c.p.) if for every g E G the determinant det(p(g)) = 1 
and if there exist at least two different indices i l , i 2  E n such that V g  E 
G, (gil = il V gig = 22) 3 p ( g )  = 1 (resp. there exists at least one index 
i l  E k such that Vg E G : gil = il 3 p(g) = 1). 
We now start the proof of Theorem 1.1; let z E AG be a local minimizers 
for A:. Suppose that z has an isolated collision at t = 0 (Section 5 in [3] 
ensures that we are allowed to suppose a collision being isolated). Theo- 
rem (10.7) in [3] suggest the study of ker 7: for the planar 3-body problem, 
we proved in Proposition (5.5) of [l] that when kerT is not trivial, local 
minimizers are collisionless. We are then left with the situation of trivial 
ker 7; the T-isotropy subgroup, Go := { g  E G : T(g)(O) = 0}, correspondent 
to the collision instant is then maximal. Theorem (10.10) in [3] yields to 

39 
the study of Go which is a group of order two (since G 
T(G) c O(2)) 
generated by go and ensures that if a(g0) acts trivially on the index set or 
if the group Go has the r.c.p., then no collision can occur at t = 0. 
Without loss of generality we can suppose that a(g0) = (1,2). As to p(go), 
three cases are possible: either p(g0) is the identity, the antipodal map or 
a reflection with respect to a line I .  In the first two cases Go has the r.c.p., 
so we are left with the latter case. 
In the sequel we will refer to G as a group containing Go = (go), where 
pl := p(g0) is a reflection with respect to a line 1, a(g0) = (1,2) and .r(go) 
is a reflection with respect to t = 0. The G-equivariant loops satisfy then 
at least the symmetry constraint 
that we name the Isosceles Symmetry. In particular at t = 0, the third 
body lies on 1 and the positions of the first and the second are symmetric 
with respect to 1. 
5. Collisions with the Isosceles Symmetry 
In this section we conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1, showing that a local 
minimizer x E AG for dz, 
satisfying the Isosceles Symmetry in (2), can not 
have a collision at t = 0. 
By the sake of contradiction, suppose that z, satisfing (2), has a collision 
at t = 0 and let k c n = { 1,2,3} be the colliding cluster; the symmetry 
constraint (2), of course, after relabeling the indices, implies that either 
k = { 1 , 2 } o r k = n .  
A parabolic collision trajectory for the cluster k C_ n is the path 
qi(t) = lt12/(2f")(i, i E k, t E R 
where ( = ((i)iEk is a central configuration with k bodies (i.e. a critical 
point for the potential function restricted to xi 
r n i 1 ~ i 1 ~  
= 1). An escaping 
path for the cluster k C n is a path of type y = qf'p, where q is a parabolic 
collision trajectory for the cluster k and 'p E I$;@); we say that an escaping 
path is go-equivariant if y(g0t) = goy(t), for every t E R. 
We term Lw,k the partial Lagrangian function; when x = (z,)iEk, 
Lw,k(x) is the Lagrangian restricted on the bodies of the cluster k and 
we say that a parabolic collision trajectory, q = (qi)iEk, is a go-equivariant 
minimizing parabolic collision trajectory if for every go-equivariant escaping 

40 
path y = q + 'p 
+W 
A& := 
[Lw,k(q + 'p) - L w , k ( q ) ] d t  2 0. 
L 
Let q(t) = z ( t )  - z o ( t ) ,  where zo(t) is the center of mass of the bodies in 
k, and let qx be defined by 
q y t )  = P / ( Z + a ) q ( X t ) .  
As shown in Section 7 of [3], there are sequences A, 
--f 0 such that qXn(t) 
converges to a go-equivariant parabolic minimizing collision trajectory. 
Let 6 E (R2)k, k = 2,3, and T > 0 a real number. The standard 
variation associated to 6 and T is defined as 
if 0 5 Jtl 5 T - 161 
(T - t)h if T - 161 5 It1 5 T 
ws(t) = {: 
if It[ 2 T. 
Remark that when the vector 6 is fixed by go, 6 = 906, then d(t) is a 
go-equivariant escaping path. 
To conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1, we show that, if q is a minimiz- 
ing parabolic collision trajectory, then there always exists a go-equivariant 
standard variation such that AAw < 0 and q + w6 does not have a collision 
at t = 0. This would imply the existence of a go-equivariant collision- 
less trajectory whose action level lower the one of the parabolic collision 
trajectory. Consider the function 
where E ,  6 E R2. Let t9 E [ 0 , 2 ~ ]  such that cost9 = I, 
6 then 
(It1 ) 
hence the function S([,b) depends only on the mutual positions of the 
vectors E and 6. It is easy to verify (see (6.12) in [l]) that the function 
- T d t ,  defined continously 
on ( O , ~ T ) ,  has a symmetric plot with respect to the line 19 = T ,  decreses 
on [O,T) and, when a! < 1, Q m ( O )  = Qa(27r) is finite, while, when a! 2 1,

The function @a is the basic tool to estimate the variation of &; in fact 
if q = {q}i = {t2/(2+a)1i}, 
i = 1,. . . , k is a parabolic collision trajectory 
and v6 a go-equivariant standard variation, then for S -+ 
0 
We start studying binary collisions; since there exists just one cen- 
tral configuration with two bodies, thus t 1  = -&. 
To make the ac- 
tion functional decreses, we consider the standard variation associated 
to the vector 6 = (61,--61), such that 61 is orthogonal to the line 1 and 
19 = arccos (H, 
-61) lies in the interval [;,TI 
(see Figure 1 (a)). 
Figure 1. Collisions from collinear central configurations. 
On the other hand a triple collision can take place in two different 
ways: from collinear configurations or from the Lagrange configuration. 
Since m l  = m2, we are left with three possible situations: two collinear 
configurations (the second or the third body in the middle) and a Lagrange 
coniguration. When a collision occur from a central configuration, we con- 
struct a standard variation similarly as we made for the binary collision 
and we refer to Figure 1 (b)-(c). 
Consider now the 3 particles at the vertices of a regular triangle moving 
on a parabolic collision trajectory that makes them collide at t = 0 in 
their center of mass. Since m l  = m2, the center of mass lies on the line 
h represented in Figure 2 . Our aim is to show that there always exists 
a vector 6 E S', such that, when replacing 13 with & + 6, the interaction 
potential decreases (the sum of the two variations is negative even thought 
they are not necessarily both negative) and therefore A& is negative. In 
the following we refer to Figure 2. and we call y the angle in [0,7r/2] with 
edges the lines h and 1. To conclude we prove the inequality

NON-CONSERVATIVE SYSTEMS*

This is an outline of the major results contained in an extensive tutorial paper 
presented at SPT-2004 
and dedicated to a special kind of symmetric two-tensors 
which appear, in the recent and in the old literature, in connection with special 
kinds of mechanical systems and with the theory of the separation of variables in 
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. 
1. Posing a question 
A holonomic system is a mechanical system whose configurations form 
a set Q endowed with a differentiable manifold structure with finite di- 
mension n (the number of degrees of freedom).a This manifold is in turn 
endowed with a positive-definite metric tensor g = (gij) determined by the 
expression of the kinetic energy K = 
gij qiqj w.r.to any natural coordi- 
nate system (92, qi) on the tangent bundle TQ. The active forces are then 
represented by a vector field F = (Fi) 
on Q or by a one-form Fi = gij Fj.b 
For such a system, represented by the triple (Qnlg,F), the dynamics is 
completely determined by the second-order Lagrange equations 
which assume the Newtonian form

then we have a Lagrangian system. Eqs. (1) assume the well-known form 
where L = $gij(i.iqj - V is the Lagrangian function on TQ. In 
this case we can apply alternative methods of integration by passing to 
the Hamiltonian function on the cotangent bundle T*Q, with coordi- 
nates ( q , p )  = ( q i , p j ) ,  H = i g i j p i p j  + V .  This function gives rise to a 
HamilFoiian system (i.e., to first-order Hamilton equations) and to a 
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. 
Let us pose the question: m a y  the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian 
methods be extended to systems with non-potential forces? 
2. Equivalent systems 
For posing this question in a more precise way we make use of the notion of 
equivalent systems introduced by Painlev6 (1894) and Levi-Civita (1896). 
Definition 2.1. Let (Q, g, F) and (Q, g, F) be two holonomic systems with 
the same configuration manifold Q. Let 

45 
be the corresponding dynamical systems of T Q  with coordinates (qi, 
w i  = 
$). They are said to be equivalent or correspondent, if there exists a 
function of f :  T Q  + R, such that, for any solution 
of the first system (3), by a change of the time-parameter of the kind 
1 
- 
d t  
- _  
dt 
f (P"t), +w) 
we get a solution of the second system, 
(4) 
This means that the trajectories on the configuration manifold Q of the 
two systems coincide, up to a change of the time-parameters given by (4) 
(in other words, the trajectories are the same, but covered with different 
velocities) .' 
A special but fundamental case is that with F = F = 0. It concerns 
with geodesics: 
Definition 2.2. Two metric tensors g and g on the same manifold Q are 
said to be equivalent if they have the same unparametrized geodesics. 
After this definition our question can be reformulated as follows: which 
non-potential systems are equivalent to Lagrangian systems? However, as 
we shall see in the next section, at the state-of-the-art we are able to an- 
swer this question only by adding a further condition on the definition of 
equivalence. 
3. The equivalence theorem of Levi-Civita 
Levi-Civita was able to prove 
Theorem 3.1. Two systems (g,F) and (g,F) are equivalent zf and only 
if there exist functions p and cij, depending o n  the coordinates only, such 
(p. 272) 
In the definition of Levi-Civita the function f is considered depending also on t. How- 
ever, he proves that in fact this function is independent of time, under the assumption 
that the forces depend only on the coordinates 
(p. 269).

This last equation shows that the two metrics are equivalent and suggests 
the notion of geodesically equivalent dynamical systems: they are 
equivalent holonomic systems whose underlying Riemannian metrics are 
also equivalent. 
4. Main theorems 
Theorem 4.1. A dynamical system (Q, g, F) is geodesically equivalent to 
a Lagrangian system i.e., to a system (Q,g,F) where g is an equivalent 
metric and F = - V V ,  i f  and only if the fundamental metric g admits a 
non-singular special conformal Killinq tensor J such that 
F = -A- ‘VV, A = c o f J .  
(6) 
Definition 4.1. A special conformal Killing tensor (SCKT) is a sym- 
metric two-tensor Jij satisfying the equation 
VhJij = i (“a gjh + “j gih), 
(7) 
where ai are the components of a suitable one-form.d We denote by a 
boldface letter the corresponding (1,l)-tensor, J = ( J j ) ,  Jj = gihJhj. 
Such a tensor is strictly connected with other special symmetric two- 
tensors, here denoted by A, B and L and called for simplicity A-tensor, 
B-tensor and L-tensor (then a SCKT will be also called J-tensor). The first 
two-tensors are defined by the differential equations 
(8) 
VhAij = Ph Aij - 4 (Pj Ahi f Pi Ahj) > 
VhBij = - 4 (Pj Bhi + Pi Bhj), 
This kind of tensor has been introduced and studied by Crampin and Sarlet (2000- 
2003). 

47 
where pi are the components of a suitable one-form. The definition of 
L-tensor will be given in 55 below. 
All these tensors are related by several equations, used for proving The- 
orem 4.1 and other theorems. For instance, 
A = cof J = p J-', 
p = det J. 
J = PA-', 
(9) 
B = J-' = LA, cofB =z A-', 
P 
Hence, to look for a J-tensor with ,u # 0 is the same as to look for a 
non-singular A-tensor or B-tensor. 
It is rather surprising that systems satisfying the condition (6) of Theo- 
rem 4.1 have been recently introduce in the literature: they have been called 
cofactor systems.e Hence, we can restate Theorem 4.1 as follows: A dy- 
namical system (Q, g, F) is geodesically equivalent to a Lagrangian system 
i e . ,  i f  and only if at is a cofactor system. 
As a consequence of Theorem 4.1 it is clear that when we have a co- 
factor system then we can apply to the equivalent Lagrangian system the 
Hamiltonian methods, including the integration (possibly by separation of 
variables) of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Then we describe the motions 
of the original system simply by changing the time-parameter according to 
the formula 
which follows from (4) and ( 5 ) .  The components of the new metric tensor

Note that the operation of raising and lowering indices is always performed 
by the basic metric g. 
Note that the equivalent metric (12) may not be positive-definite. So, 
we are led to consider pseudo-Riemannian manifolds also in connection with 
problems of classical mechanics. 
A test for finding a cofactor-system-structure is given by the following 
Rauch-Wojciechowski, Marciniak, Lundmark, 1999, et a1 

48 
Theorem 4.2. A dynamical system (Q, g, F) is a cofactor system if and 
only if g admits a non-singular A-tensor A = (Aij) such that 
d(Aij Fj dqi) = 0. 
(13) 
This theorem has a local character. For a global meaning, the vector 
field AF = (AjFj) must be a gradient. Hence, Eq. (13) must be replaced 
bY 
AF= -VV. 
(14) 
This formula has the advantage of giving the potential V of the equivalent 
system. 
A remarkable fact concerning the cofactor systems (or the bi-cofactor 
systems, see below) is that, under certain condition on the eigenvalues of 
the special tensors involved, the Hamilton system defined by 
(11) is an 
orthogonal separable system of special kind, called L-system.f To see this 
we need the notion of L-tensor. 
5. L-tensors, L-sequences, L-systems 
Definition 5.1. A L-tensor L on a Riemannian (or pseudo-Riemannian) 
manifold is a torsionless conformal Killing two-tensor with pointwise simple 
and real eigenvalues. 
The following theorem shows the interest of this definition. 
Theorem 5.1. Let L = (Li) be a symmetric two-tensor. Then the tensors 
(K,) = (KO, K1,. . . , Kn-l) defined by the L-sequence 
KO = I, K, = tr (K,-IL) I - K,-1 L, 
a > 1 
(15) 
are n independent Killing tensors with common normal g eigenvectors if 
and only i f  L is a L-tensor. 
Indeed, n independent Killing tensors with common normal eigenvectors 
define a Killing-Stackel space K, containing the metric tensor and whose 
elements commute in the Schouten brackets of symmetric tensors; in other 
words, they give rise to a n-space of geodesic quadratic first integrals in 
involution. The geodesic flow is then completely integrable. Furthermore, 
Orthogonal separable systems are also called Stiickel systems. 
g This means that each eigenvector field is orthogonal to a family of surfaces (a foliation) 
of submanifolds of codimension 1. All these foliations form an orthogonal web. 

49 
the orthogonal web determined by the common eigenvectors is a separa- 
ble web, in the sense that any orthogonal coordinate system q = (qi) 
adapted to this web is separable (it separates, additively, thegeodesic 
Hamilton-Jacobi equation): these coordinates are such that the web is lo- 
cally represented by equations qz = constant or equivalently, the vector 
fields 8, = d/dqi are common eigenvectors (the one-forms dqi are common 
eigenforms). Let us call L-system any Stackel system of this kind. 
It is remarkable the fact that for a L-system all the Killing tensors 
underlying the separation, and forming the Killing-Stackel space K, 
are all 
constructed 
The general theory of the orthogonal separable systems shows that a 
potential V is separable w.r.to a Killing-Stackel space K if and only if for 
any arbitrary element K E K with simple eigenvalues the one-form K dV 
is closed (may be exact), 
algebraic way by means of the L-sequence (15). 
d(KdV) = 0, 
K d V  = dU. 
If this condition is satisfied, then by taking a basis (K,) of K and the 
functions Va such that K, dV = dV,,’ then the functions 
H L LKij 
a - 2 
a PiPj + Va 
form a system of independent first integrals in involution. 
All the results above applied to a L-system, show that, for instance, K1 
in the L-sequence is a characteristic Killing tensor, so that a potential V is 
separable in a L-system if and only if j 
d ((tr L) dV - L dV) = 0. 
(16) 
6. Cofactor and bi-cofactor systems are L-systems 
The sentence which is taken as a title of this last section is true under 
certain conditions. 
Theorem 6.1. Let (Q,g,F) be a cofactor system, whose J-tensor J has 
pointwise simple eigenvalues. Then the geodesically equivalent Hamiltonian 
system is a L-system generated by the L-tensor B, the B-tensor associated 
It can be proved that such a tensor, called characteristic tensor, always exists. 
Indeed, it can be proved that if K d V  is closed or exact, the same happens for all 
elements of K.

with J, i f  and only if F = 
Lagrangian system). 
Definition 6.1. A bi-cofactor system (or cofactor-pair system) is a 
holonomic system (Q, g, F) which is a cofactor-system in two distinct ways: 
- VW (i.e., the cofactor system is itself a 
F = -A-'VV 
= -A-'Vv,

-. 
where A = cof J and 
singular (and non-trivial) J-tensors w.r.to the metric g. 
Theorem 6.2. If a bi-cofactor system is such that the tensor J = 3 J-' 
has pointwise real and sample eigenvalues, then the equivalent Hamiltonian 
system (Q, g, H ) ,  where g is the equivalent metric determined by J, is a 
L-system generated by the L-tensor J .

SHADOWING CHAINS OF COLLISION ORBITS 
FOR THE ELLIPTIC 3-BODY PROBLEM* 
SERGEY BOLOTIN 
Department of Mathematics 
University of Wisconsin 
Van Vleck Hall, Madison 53706, USA 
We consider a Hamiltonian system modelling the plane restricted elliptic 3-body 
problem with one of the masses small and prove the existence of periodic and 
chaotic almost collision orbits. Periodic orbits of this type were first studied by 
Poincar6 who named them second species solutions. The proofs are based on 
variational methods. 
1. Introduction 
Let D be an open set in R2 containing 0 and let T = R/2nZ. Consider a 
Hamiltonian system ( H E )  with phase space P = ( D  \ (0)) x R2 x T and 
time periodic Hamiltonian 
depending on a small parameter E .  Let u,, V, E C3(D x T). For E > 0 the 
potential has a Newtonian singularity at q = 0 which disappears for E = 0. 
System (HE) is a singular perturbation of system (Ho). An example is: 
Elliptic restricted 3-body problem. Suppose Sun of mass 1, Jupiter 
of mass E << 1 and Asteroid of negligible mass move in R2. If the center 
of mass of Sun and Jupiter is fixed at the origin, then the trajectory u,(t) 
of the Jupiter and the trajectory - m E ( t )  of the Sun are elliptic orbits 
with foci at the origin. Normalize the variables in such a way the period 
equals 27[. and the eccentricity E is independent of E. Then in the coordinate 
frame with origin at the Jupiter, the motion of the Asteroid is described by 
Hamiltonian (1) with V, = (q - (1 - ~)u,(t)I-' and u, = &(t). For E = 0,

Jupiter disappears and system (Ho) is the Kepler problem in the moving 
coordinate frame which has integrals of energy E and angular momentum 
K .  The Hamiltonian HO isn't conserved. 
A special case is the circular problem, when the eccentricity E of Jupiter's 
orbit is 0. Then system ( H E )  is autonomous in the rotating coordinate 
frame, and hence has Jacobi's integral J = E - K .  
Main results of this paper hold for any system of type (1) such that 
the unperturbed system (Ho) satisfies certain conditions. In a subsequent 
paper these conditions will be checked for the elliptic 3-body problem with 
E # 0. The results of this paper do not apply to the circular problem. 
Solutions of system ( H E )  correspond to critical points y : [to,tl] -+ 
D \ (0) of the action functional 
L(Y) = 6' 
LE(Y(t), ?(t),t, 
E )  dt, 
where LE is the Lagrangian. We call y an orbit of the system (HE). 
An orbit y : [to,tl] -+ D of system (Ho) such that $to) = y(t1) = 0 
and y(t) # 0 for t E (to,tl), will be called a collision orbit. Our goal is 
to find for small E > 0 almost collision orbits of system ( H E )  shadowing a 
chain of collision orbits of system (Ho). 
Fix m, n E N. Take any sequence to < . . . < t, such that t, = to + 2rm. 
Let II be the set of all periodic n-chains c = (ci)rzl of W1,' loops ci : 
[ti-l,ti] -+ D such that ci(ti-1) = ci(ti) = 0 and ci(t) # 0 for ti-1 < 
t < ti. The time moments tl < ... < t, are independent variables. Let 
W:"([O, 11,D) be the set of loops y : [0,1] 4 D with $0) = y(1) = 0. 
Then II can be identified with an open set in (W,"'([O, 11,D))" x R" via 
the map 
( 7 1 , .  . . ,Y,,tl,. . '  ,tn) 
(Cl,. . . ,cn), 
C i ( t )  = rz((t - ti-l)/(ti - ti-1)). 
Critical points of the functional 10 : II -+ R are periodic chains c = 
( C ~ ) Y = ~  
of collision orbits of system (Ho) with no breaks of the Hamiltonian: 
Ho(0, &(ti), ti) = Ho(0, & - 1 ( t i ) ,  ti) = hi for all i. 
(2) 
We say that c = ( c i ) Z 1  is a nondegenerate collision chain if it is a non- 
degenerate critical point of 10 : II 4 IR and at each collision the direction 
of the orbit changes. Then there is b > 0 such that the pair Ci-l(ti),&(ti) 
belongs to the set 

53 
Theorem 1.1. For any nondegenerate periodic collision chain c of system 
(Ho), there exists EO > 0 such that for any E E ( O ’ E O ) ,  there exists a 
unique 2nm-periodic orbit yE : E% -, D \ (0) of system (HE) which is O(E)- 
shadowing c. More precisely, IyE(t) - ci(t)l 5 
for ti-1 5 t I ti. 
The proof is based on variational methods and will be published else- 
where. An analog of Theorem 1.1 holds for collision chains which corre- 
spond to topologically nondegenerate critical points, but then the shadow- 
ing orbit will be non-unique in general. In a subsequent paper we will check 
the conditions of Theorem 1.1 for the elliptic non-circular 3-body problem. 
A result analogous to Theorem 1.1 holds for autonomous systems.’ 
Then nondegeneracy of a collision chain is defined for fixed Hamiltonian 
h in terms of the Maupertuis-Jacobi action functional. The corresponding 
shadowing orbits all lie in the same level HE = h, and the period T depends 
on h. Our Theorem 1.1 gives shadowing orbits with given period 2 n m  and 
doesn’t apply to autonomous systems: the nondegeneracy condition fails. 
The circular restricted 3-body problem with eccentricity E = 0 and small 
E > 0 has autonomous Hamiltonian HE of the form (1) in the rotating 
coordinate frame. In fact HE = J - the Jacobi integral. One can check the 
nondegeneracy conditions,’ and obtain for each h E (-312, &) an infinite 
number of orbits periodic with respect to the rotating coordinate frame and 
having the Jacobi integral J = h. See also earlier  publication^.^^^^^ 
Orbits of the circular problem obtained in these papers are periodic 
with respect to the fixed coordinate frame when Tl27r is rational. Then the 
periodic orbits fill a torus 72 c P. By Poincark’s Theorem,’ for 0 < E << E 
such torus disintegrates into at least 2 orbits of the elliptic problem which 
are periodic in the fixed coordinate frame.a 
On the other hand, Theorem 1.1 gives periodic solutions of the elliptic 
problem in the fixed coordinate frame when 0 < E << E. It is essential that 
Jupiter’s orbit is non-circular. 
2. Shadowing infinite collision chains 
Next we generalize Theorem 1.1 to include infinite collision chains c = 
( c ~ ) ~ ~ z .  
Let r be the set of all collision orbits y : [to,tl] + R’ (to < tl 
are not fixed) of system (Ho). Let A c I? be the set of orbits which are 
degenerate critical points of the functional I. for fixed to < t l .  Equivalently, 
aIf TI% is Diophantine, then KAM theory gives quasiperiodic solutions of system ( H E )  
near T2 for O < E << E .  

54 
y E A if t o  < tl are conjugate along y. Let y(t) = f(wo,to,t) be the orbit 
of (Ho) with y(t0) = 0, ?(to) = WO. Then we may identify r with 
{(vo,to,t1) : to < t l ,  f ( W O , t O , t l )  = 0) c R4, 
and A C I? is given by the equation det Dvf(w0, to, t l )  = 0. The projection 
7r : 
Let wk C R2, k E (1,. . . , N } ,  be open sets which are simply covered 
by open sets r k  c \ A, i.e. 7r : r k  -+ wk is a diffeomorphism. Without 
loss of generality we may assume that the sets wk are invariant under 
the translation ( t o , t l )  H (to 4- 27r,tl + 27r). For any ( t o , t l )  E wk the 
corresponding orbit y E r k  is unique and smoothly depends on (to, tl). Let 
 to, tl) = ?(to), vkf(to, tl) = ?(tl) and 
\ A --f R2, 
(WO, to, t l )  H 
( t o ,  t l ) ,  is a local diffeomorphism. 
h, (to, tl) = HO(0, ?(to), to), hk+ ( t o ,  tl) = HOP, ?(tl), tl). 
The action of y E r k  defines a translation invariant function Sk(t0,tl) = 
Io(y) on wk. By the first variation formula 
h,(tO,tl) = o t o S k ( t O r t l ) ,  hL(t0,tl) = -DttSk(tO,tl). 
(4) 
To obtain uniform estimates for s k ,  for each k we take a translation 
invariant open set u k  G wk such that tl - to is bounded in uk. For any 
N = ( I C , ) ~ G ~  
E C N  = {I,. . . , N}", let 
X ,  = {T =

The I ,  topology on X, is defined by the norm ~

Define the action functional on X, by 
A,(T) = C s k ,  ( t z - 1 ,  tz). 
ZEZ 
Although the functional is formal, the componentwise derivative A ~ ( T )  
E 
I ,  is well defined as a sequence 
DtzA,(T) = Dt,Sk,(tz-l,tz) $- Dt,Sk,+l(tz,tz+l), 
2 E Z. 
(5) 
The map A; : X, 
-+ 1, 
is C1. Any critical point T gives a chain c = (cz E 
r k , ) z g z ,  c, : [tz-l,t,] -3 D ,  of collision orbits of system (Ho). By (4) and 
(5), it satisfies (2). 
The derivative of A;(T) is a linear transformation A;(T) : I ,

Its matrix is 3-diagonal with entries

A critical point r E X ,  is called 6-nondegenerate if A:(r) has a bounded

Theorem 2.1. For any 5 > 0 there exists EO > 0 such that for any N E EN, 
any 6-nondegenerate critical point r of A,, and any E E (0, E O ) ,  system (HE) 
has a unique orbit yE : R 4 D \ (0) which is O(E)-shadowing the collision 
chain c corresponding to r. 
For periodic sequences: ki+n = ki, ti+n = t, + 27rm, a nondegener- 
ate critical point r of A, defines a nondegenerate periodic collision chain 
c. The shadowing orbit in Theorem 2.1 will be 27rm-periodic and we get 
Theorem 1.1. 
3. Twist map reformulation 
The problem of finding nondegenerate collision chains of system (Ho) can 
be reduced to the dynamics of compositions of area preserving maps. 
Suppose that the action s k  : wk 
-+ 
satisfies the twist condition: 
D:otlSk(tO, t l )  f o for all (toltl) E wk, and for each to the set I k ( t 0 )  = 
{ t l  - to : (t0,tl) E wk} is an interval. 
Let w k  be the quotient of wk under the translation, and let A = T x R  be 
the annulus. Define a map gk : wk -+ A by gk(to,tl) = (to, hi(to,tl)). The 
twist condition implies that gk is a diffeomorphism on its image V k ,  which is 
an annulus in A. Then define the map f k  : v k  4 by f k ( t 0 ,  ho) = (tl, hl), 
where ( t o ,  t l )  = gL'(t0, ho) and hl = h;(to, t l ) .  The symplectic map f k  is 
a twist map with the generating function s k .  The collision chain c = (ci) 
defined by a critical point r = (ti) E X, corresponds to an orbit of the 
composition: (tn,hn) = fk,, 0 ... 0 f k o ( t O ,  ho), where hi is given by (2). 
First we consider collision chains corresponding to trajectories of a single 
twist map f k  : v k  4 A. For any z E v k  set w:(z) 
= v z ( g ; l ( z ) ) .  
Theorem 3.1. Suppose that the map f k  : v k  4 A has a compact hyperbolic 
invariant set A C v k  such that (w;(z),wi(fk(x))) E QJ for all z E A. 
Then there exists E O  > 0 such that f o r  any E E ( O , E O )  system (HE) has a 
compact hyperbolic invariant set A, C P of almost collision orbits O(E)- 
shadowing collision chains represented by orbits of the map f k  : A -+ A. 
- 

56 
Indeed, there is 6 > 0 such that all trajectories of f k  : A -+ A define 
6-nondegenerate critical points of A,. 
Hence Theorem 3.1 follows from 
Theorem 2.1. 
The problem with applying Theorem 3.1 to the elliptic 3-body problem 
is that for the twist map arising from the Kepler problem it is hard to prove 
analytically the existence of a nontrivial hyperbolic invariant set. We avoid 
this difficulty by taking compositions fk,, 0 . . . o f k o  of a random sequence 
of maps. 
To simplify the notation we extend f k  : v k  -+ A to a diffeomorphism 
of the whole annulus A. Let 0 : C N  + CN be the Bernoulli shift. The 
dynamics of random compositions fk,o' . .o f k o  can be viewed as dynamics of 
a single skew product map 3 of C N  x A . ~ , ~  
For a sequence N = (k,),~a: 
E C N  
and x E A set 3 ( x , x )  = (a(x), fk,(Z)). 
Theorem 3.2. Suppose that 3 has a hyperbolic (in the A-direction) com- 
pact invariant set 
C C N  x 14 such that for all (N, 
x )  E A, we have x E Vk,, , 
fko(x) E v k l ,  and ( w ~ o ( x ) , w ~ l ( f k o ( x ) ) )  
E Q6. Then for small EO > 0 and 
all E E (O,EO) system (HE) has a hyperbolic invariant set AE c P of orbits 
O(E)-shadowing collision chains corresponding to orbits of 3 : A + A. 
The map 3 may have hyperbolic dynamics even when each map f k  is 
trivial. An example is given in the next section. 
4. Almost autonomous case 
Suppose that the maps f k  are almost autonomous: 
Sk(tO, t l )  = Sg(tl - to) + fSL(tOr tl - to) -k o(E2), 
with E a small parameter, and s: : 
this is the case for the elliptic 3-body problem with small eccentricity E .  
Legendre transform of Sk(tO,tl) with respect to tl: 
+ R, s: : T x Ik -+ R. For example, 
Let us represent f k  by the generating function Fk(t0, hl) which is the 
fk(t0, h0) = (tlthl), h0 = DtoFk(t0, hl), tl 
DhlFk(t0, hl). 
For an almost integrable map, 
Fk(t0, h l )  = tOhl + F:(hl) + EF;(tOr hl) + o(f2), 
where 8': : Jk -+ R, Fi : v k  = T X Jk + R, and Jk = Ds:(lk). Then 
f k  : vk 
-+ A has the form 
f k  = f: + E f i  + 0 ( E 2 ) ,  
f,"(t, h) = (t + Wk(h), h), 
Wk(h) = DF:(h). 

57 
By the twist condition, wh(h) # 0 in j k .  
For small E the map f k  is almost integrable. Hence establishing chaotic 
dynamics for f k  is a transcendental problem related to exponentially small 
splitting of separatrices.’ In fact f k  is integrable on a Cantor set of large 
measure. We can avoid this problem by using random compositions of the 
maps f k .  
Expand F i  in a Fourier series: 
F i ( t ,  h) = 
eintakn(h), 
h E Jk. 
nEZ 
For simplicity suppose that F i  is a Fourier polynomial (for the elliptic 3- 
body problem, there are 2 Fourier harmonics) and there are no resonances in 
Jk, i.e. if ukn(h) $ 0, then nwk(h) $! z 
for h E Jk (if there are resonances 
in Jk, we cut it in pieces). Then f k  has an approximate first integral 
@ k ( t ,  h) = h + E?+!“lc(t, h) such that @k o f k  = @k + 0 ( e 2 ) .  It is given by 
PoincarC’s formula: 
Theorem 4.1. Suppose there exist ( k ,  I )  E (1,. . . , N } 2  such that Jkl = 
Jk fl Jl # 8 and bk,(h) # bl,(h) for some n and all h E Jkl. Then for 
small E # 0 the skew product dynamical system on & x T x Jkl, obtained 
by composing f k  and fl has a nontrivial hyperbolic invariant set. 
Intuitively, the condition of Theorem 4.1 means that for small E # 0 the 
maps f k  and fi have no common rotational invariant curves in T X Jkl. 
By Theorem 3.2, orbits in Theorem 4.1 can be shadowed by orbits of 
system (HE) provided that the changing direction condition holds. Then 
system (HE) has a hyperbolic invariant set of almost collision orbits, peri- 
odic and chaotic. 
The next result is a simple version of “Arnold diffusion” for system 
( H E ) .  Let G be the set of pairs ( k ,  I )  E (1,. . . , N}’ such that the condition 
of Theorem 4.1 holds in Jkl. Suppose that an interval A = [a, b] is covered 
by the intervals Jkl, ( k , I )  E G. 
Theorem 4.2. There exist points 20 = (t0,ho) and 5, = (tn,hn) in A 
with ho < u < b < h, and a sequence H = ( k z )  with ( k z - l , k z )  E G for 
i = 1 , .  . . ,n such that fk,, 0 . .  . 0 fk,,(.o) 
= 5,. 
Hence there are orbits going from one boundary of T x A to the other. 
This is a more concrete version of known results on ergodic properties of 

58 
compositions of twist maps.4i6i7 Note that “diffusion” does not happen for 
each fk due to the existence of KAM invariant curves: it is necessary to 
use a random sequence of maps. 
Any orbit in Theorem 4.2 gives a shadowing “diffusion” orbit of system 
( H E )  for small E > 0 provided that the changing direction condition holds. 
The conditions of Theorems 4.1-4.2 hold for the elliptic almost circular 
3-body problem with small eccentricity E .  For this problem, hi corresponds 
to the value of the Jacobi integral at the collision at t = ti. In a subsequent 
paper we will show that every h E (-3/2,&) 
is contained in an infinite 
number of appropriate intervals Jkl such that the conditions of Theorem 
4.1 hold in Jkl. In particular, we get lots of periodic and chaotic shadowing 
orbits for 0 < E << E << 1, and “diffusion” of the Jacobi constant h in any 
subinterval A C (-3/2, &).

SIMILARITY REDUCTIONS OF AN OPTICAL MODEL

In this paper we obtain symmetry reductions of an optical model which is described 
by a system of two coupled partial differential equations, using the classical Lie 
method of infinitesimals. The reductions to systems of ordinary differential equa- 
tions are obtained from the optimal system of subalgebra. By using the classical 
Lie method, we derive new exact solutions for the optical model. 
1. Introduction

In 
the authors are interested in stationary phase-locked wave 
propagation and apply the following exact transformation: 
El 
= 
( k / m ) u e x p ( i D z  + in<) and EZ = (Ic/xa)wexp(ipz + 2iRc), where p 
and /32 = 2p + AIc are the nonlinearity-induced shifts of the propagation 
constant, (T = Iyll/ly21, Ic = P+61R+ylR2, and R = (61 - &)/(4y2 - 271). 
Now Eqs. (1) take the form 
59 

60 
Eqs. (2) correspond to a system of two differential equations in partial 
derivatives, with two independent variables, x and t, and two dependent 
complex variables, u = U I ( X ,  t )  + iu2(x, t )  and w = u3(x,t) + u4(x, t), being 
u* the conjugated of u, and where x, 0, p, and a are real constants, with 
showed the 
existence of an exact analytical solution to these equations when a = 1 and 
the constraints u = f i w  and p = u-' - 20 are fulfilled. 
In 
the authors find stationary solutions of Eqs. (2) for the particular 
values a = 2, u = 2, r = s = +1, p = 2 and u = 0. 
In this paper we apply the Lie group method of infinitesimals transfor- 
mations to Eqs. (2). The development of Lie group theory provides the 
systematic method to search for these special group-invariant solutions. 
The fundamental basis of this technique is that, when a system of differen- 
tial equations is invariant under a Lie group of transformations, a reduction 
transformation exists. For systems of partial differential equations (PDES) 
with two independent variables a single group reduction transforms the 
system of PDES into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODES), 
which are generally easier to solve. In order to find all invariant solutions 
with respect to s-dimensional subalgebras, it is sufficient to construct in- 
variant solutions for the optimal system of order s. The set of invariant 
solutions obtained in this way is called an optimal system of invariant so- 
lutions. The required theory and description of the method can be found 
in 6 .  By using the classical Lie method, we derive exact solutions for the 
optical model.

3. New exact solutions 
In the following we present exact solutions which can be extracted from the 
reduced system of ODES S1 which appears in Table 4. We are interested in 
the solutions of Eqs. (2) for real functions u(z, t )  and w(z, t). In this case 
u = hl(z) and 
= h3(z), then system S1 can be written as the following 
system of ODES, 
Ah', = 0, 
rhy + x (&hT + ph:) hi + hl(h3 - 1) = 0, 
Ash; = 0, 
Shi + ~ ( 2 a h ;  + ph;)h3 - ah3 + $h: = 0. 
(5) 
Stationary solutions of Eqs. (2) are described by the following Eqs. (6) 
where hl = hl(z) and h3 = h3(z). 
rh~+x(&h:+ph;)hl+hl(h3-1) = O ,  
Sh; + ~ ( 2 a h ;  + ph:)h3 - ah3 + $hq = 0.

Eqs. (6) can not be solved in general so we present four cases: 
Case 1. If x = 0, we obtain different solutions of Eqs. (6) depending on 
the following constants:

This paper deals with a class of singularly perturbed reversible planar vector fields 
around the origin where the normal hyperbolicity assumption is not assumed. We 
exhibit conditions for the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits and hetero- 
clinic cycles converging to singular orbits with respect to the Hausdorf distance. 
In addition, generic normal forms of such singularities are presented. 
1. Introduction 
We consider systems in the plane expressed by 
and f, 9 E C". 
Taking a setting similar to that of 
and 
we consider the family 
obtained from (1) after the time rescaling t = ET. Equation (1) is called 
the fast system and (2) the slow system. 
We call S = ( ( 2 ,  y) E R21f 
( 2 ,  y, 0) = 0) the slow manifold. We observe 
that for E = 0, S is a set of all singular points of (l), but the equation (2) 
defines a dynamical system on S called reduced problem.

Combining results on the dynamics of these two limiting problems one 
obtains information on the dynamics for small values of E. 
We observe that the system is normally hyperbolic at (x0,yo) if

# 0. Let p,q E S be normally hyperbolic points. A singu- 
d X  
lar orbit consists of 3 pieces of smooth curves: an orbit of the reduced 
problem in the unstable manifold WT (p), an orbit of the reduced problem 
in the stable manifold Wi (q) and a heteroclinic orbit of the fast problem 
connecting the two previous pieces. 
The main question in GSP-theory is to exhibit conditions under which a 
singular orbit can be approached by regular orbits for E 1 0, with respect to 
to the Hausdorff distance. The usual approach consists in considering sin- 
gular orbits along which the vector field XO 
is normally hyperbolic along S. 
We refer ', 
for related problems. A general question is what remains 
of this picture when the Normal Hyperbolicity assumption is dropped. 
Assume that (0,O) E S and that the non normal hyperbolicity of our 
and

system occurs at this point, that is -(O,

spect to the linear involution R(x,y) = (-x,y). It means that 
In our approach we assume that the system is time-reversible with re- 
(4 X ( R ( z ,  
Y > )  = --R(X(X, 
Y ) ) .  
(b) The phase portrait of X, is symmetric with respect to {x = 0). 
Let X, be a reversible singularly perturbed vector field and r be a singu- 
lar orbit. Summarizing, in what follows we give a rough all-over description 
of the paper: 
(1) Assume that X, is R-reversible. We give conditions on X ,  under 
which r is approximated by regular orbits (see Theorem A). More- 
over we exhibit conditions, under which X, possesses a periodic 
orbit or heteroclinic cycle rE converging to I'. We observe that in 
our previous work 
we already treated this convergence in a more 
general context. We note that in the case of the plane the result 
has a much simpler proof which will be presented here. 
(2) The main results contained in 4,5 are revisited. In these papers 
the planar systems presenting singular perturbation problems are 
classified via exhibition of three normal forms on neighborhoods of 
non-normally hyperbolic points and the dynamics near these points 
is analyzed. By means of the techniques developed in this paper, 
we prove variations of these results for the reversible case. 

69 
In section 2 we prove Theorem A and discuss the existence of infinitely 
many periodic orbits or heteroclinic cycles converging to singular orbits. 
Section 3 is devoted to giving a classification of our system in the reversible 
universe following the program stipulated by Krupa-Szmolyan. 
2. Singularly Perturbed Reversible Vector Fields on the 
plane 
In this section the dynamics of the system (1) is discussed. We follow the 
ideas and techniques of l .  
Definition 2.1. We say that a R-reversible vector field X ,  satisfies the 
QG-condition if 
(1) (z,y) E R2,€ 2 0 and f , g  E C"; 
(2) The slow manifold S = ((5, y) 1 f (z, y, 0) = 0} is a regular curve; 
(3) 0 E S fi F i x  (R) is a non normally hyperbolic point; 
(4) p and q are R-symmetric points on S and r is a singular orbit 
passing through 0 that is composed of 3 pieces: an orbit of the 
reduced problem in the unstable manifold Wy (p), an orbit of the 
reduced problem in the stable manifold W; (q), and a heteroclinic 
orbit of the fast problem that conects them; 
( 5 )  0 is the unique non normally hyperbolic point on r. 
Theorem A Suppose that X ,  given by (1) satisfies the QG-condition. 
There exists a neighborhood U c R2 of 0 as in (3), such that if I? c U 
then for each E > 0 there exists an orbit ro of X ,  that approaches r as 
E J. 0, with respect to the Hausdorff distance. 
Proof. Consider the auxiliary vector field X:(x, y , ~ )  = (f (z, y,e), 
E g ( z , y , E )  ,0) on R3. Take T = (0,yo) on r n Fix(R). Such a point 
exists because r connects R-symmetric invariant manifolds on S. Let 
1 = { ( x , Y , E )  : x = 0, y = yo, 0 I E < E O } ,  where €0 is some suffi- 
ciently small positive number. Thus 1 is a segment of a curve transverse to 
Fax (R) at r. 
Denote by Cl the saturate of 1, that is the closure of the union of seg- 
ments of orbits of X: through the points of 1 and taken between the first 
intersection of this curve with Fix (R) in negative time (Cy) and in posi- 
tive time (CT). The orbits on Ci are the orbits of X,. Ci crosses F i x  (R) 
transversally because the singular orbit r does. Finally, the reversibility of 

70 
Y 
X 
Figure 1. Singular Orbit J? and Center Manifold Cl 
X, implies that Cr n Fix (R) = C: n Fix (R) . To complete the proof it is 
0 
enough to choose rE to be any orbit contained on Ci. 
We observe that if p and q, as in the QG-condition, are hyperbolic 
singular points of the slow system then the family obtained in Theorem A 
is composed of heteroclinic cycles. Moreover if 
(0, 0,O) .% (0,0, 0 )  < 0, r 
is a singular orbit of Xo passing through (0,O) and connecting R-symmetric 
points on the slow manifold then there exists a sequence of periodic orbits 
Fa, of X,, that approaches I? for E j, 0. In fact, if X, is R-reversible then 
we have 
f ( Z ,Y ,E )  = 'p ( x 2 , Y , E )  
9 ( Z , Y , E )  = x1C,(x2,Y,E) 
for some smooth functions 'p and 1C, on R2. The singular points for E > 0 
are given by the equations: 
4-J 
(&Y,E) 
= 0 
'p (Z2,Y,E) = 0 
By the implicit function theorem there is a smooth function y = Y ( E )  pro- 
vided that 2 (O,O, 0) # 0. Moreover 

71 
Finally, the reversibility condition ensures that the singularity 
(0, y ( E )  , E )  is a center for X,. 
3. Fold, Transcritical and Pitchfork Singularities 
Consider the singularly perturbed ordinary differential equations given by 
Assume that (0,O) E S is a non-normally hyperbolic singular point. a 
generic classification of slow manifolds in 4,5 a generic classification is given 
by the exhibition of three normal forms: 
(1).

x’ = xy - x 
Yl = EL7 (x, 
Y )  
9 g(0,O) # 0. 
3- Pitchfork Singularity X, : 
These singularities have been analyzed by several authors in different 
contexts. We mention the works 495. 
If SO c S is a normally hyperbolic submanifold, then it persists for 
sufficiently small E > 0 as a nearby locally invariant slow manifold S,, for 
E 1 0. In 4,5, the case where SO contains non normally hyperbolic points 
was studied. The main question is to understand the behavior of S, at 
these points. This analysis is made by the inspection of the transition 
maps defined on transversal sections to slow manifolds at points where the 
normal hyperbolicity occurs. 
Theorem 3.1. (see 4 1 5 )  
a) Assume that (0,O) is a fold singularity and g(0,O) < 0. Let C,, i = 
1,2, be transversal sections to S at pi = (x,, 
y,) , with x1 < 0 and 2 2  > 0. 
Consider n : C1 + C2 the transition map and K c S a normal hyperbolic 
part of the slow manifold with pl E K. Then K,, invariant manifold of 
X, converging to K, 
crosses transversally C2 for E 1 0. Moreover the map 
n is a contraction with constant 0 (e-’) 
for some constant c > 0. (see 
illustration on figure %(a)). 
b) Assume that (0,O) is a transcritical singularity and g (0,O) > 0. Then 
X, is topologically equivalent to X(x, y )  = (-y2 + x2 + X E ,  E ) .  Moreover let 
C1 be transversal to y = x at pl = (51, 
XI) , with x1 < 0 and C2 transversal 
to y = -x at p2 = (xz, 
-x2) if X > 1, 2 2  < 0 and to y = 0 at pi = (x;, 0 )  if 
X < 1 and x; > 0. Consider n : C1 -+ C2 the transition map and K c S a 
normally hyperbolic part of the slow manifold with pl E K. Then as before 

72 
K, crosses C2 transversally for E 1 0. (see figure 2-(b)). 
Case I

Case h < 1

We recall that the cases treated are not reversible with respect to 
Extending Slow Manifolds with Reversibility: 
In our approach we treat the case when g (0,O) = 0. 
W z ,  Y) = (-7 
Y ) .  
Definition 3.1. (0,O) is a simple reversible singularity if it is either a fold 
or a transcritical singularity and 2 (0,O) # 0. 
If 2 (0,O) < 0 the dynamics is not interesting (see figure 3-(A)) and 
its analysis will be omitted. The next result is a immediate consequence of 
the Theorem A. 
Theorem B Let X, be given by X,(z, y) = ( f  (z, y), E g  (z, y ) ) .  Assume 
further that (0,O) is a simple reversible singularity with 
(0,O) > 0. Let 
C1 be a transversal section to S at p = (a,b) with a < 0, b > 0 and 
C2 = R(C1). Then either the a- limit set of p is {(O,O)} 
or the orbit of 
X ,  through p ,  O(p), satisfies O(p) n C2 = {R ( p ) }  . 
We observe that the pitchfork singularity is a degenerate singularity. Its 
generic canonical form is X(z, y )  = ( z y  - z3, 
+E). It is not R-reversible. 
We consider the generic reversible pitchfork singularity. It is represented 
by the following normal form X ( z ,  y )  = (-s2y + z4, 
E X ) ,  and all possible 
fast and slow dynamics are illustrated in figures 3-(E) and 3-(F). 
Figure 3 describes the dynamics of some situations that occur for re- 
versible singular perturbation problems. They are: 
(A) f(z, y )  = -y + x2 and g(0,O) < 0. 
(B) f (z, y )  = -y + z2 and A(0,O) > 0. 
(c) f ( z ,  y) = -y2 + z2 an2&(0,0) > 0. 
(D) f ( z , y )  = -y2 + z2 and &(O,O) < 0.

In what follows we give an example of a reversible singularly perturbed 
vector field XE,x possessing a 1-parameter family of singular orbits 
and 
a 2-parameter family of regular orbits rs,x having the following properties: 
(1) If X < 0, then re,x are periodic solutions and re,x + rx as E -+ 0. (2) 
If X > 0, then rE,x are homoclinic solutions and rE,x -+ rx as E -+ 0. 
Consider the following family of time-reversible singularly perturbed 
systems X ( z ,  y) = (-y3 + z2 + XY,EZ). 
This family is time-reversible with respect to the involution q5(z,y) = 
(-z, y). The slow system and the fast system are given, respectively, by

This note describes some homographic solutions of the N-body problem with pos- 
itive or negative masses. Some of them are natural generalizations of the solutions 
of the two-body problem with vanishing total mass. The configurations which gen- 
erate these motions are described in the case: N = 3. A case of integrability of the 
collinear three-body problem with vanishing total mass is shown. A similar case 
of integrability was known for four vortices satisfying Helmholtz's equations [j]. 
1. The vector of inertia 
Let us consider N bodies with masses ml, ...' m N ,  whose sum is M .  The 
mi do not vanish and may be positive or negative. Let us denote by 41, 
..., q N  the positions of the bodies. The qi(t) belong to a euclidean space, 
whose scalar product is denoted by (.I.). 
The Newtonian potential is defined by: 
Newton's equations are defined by: 
75 

76 
For M # 0, the center of inertia is defined by: 
For M = 0, the vector of inertia is defined by: 
N 
X(ql,...,qN) = x m i ( q i - Q ) ’  
i=l 
The definitions do not depend on Q. 
Whereas the motion of the center of inertia is uniform rectilinear for 
M # 0, taking the sum of Newton’s equations when M = 0 provides the 
following result. 
Proposition 1.1. For any solution of Newton’s equations with M = 0, the 
vector of inertia X is an afine function of time. 
It is known that for N vortices with vanishing total vorticity which sat- 
isfy Helmholtz’s equations ([’]), we can define, in the same way, a vector of 
vorticity. This vector is a first integral. 
Let us write: X(ql(t), ...,qN( t ) )  = tP+Q, where P and Q are constants. 
The previous result and Leibniz’s equality give the following relation: 
c 
1 <i<j <N 
mimj/Iqj(t) 
- qi(t)/I2 = --/lX(q~(t)~ 
...,qN(t))1t2 = -(ltP+ & / I 2  
= -llPll2t2 - 2(PIQ)t - 1 I Q 1 I 2 ~  
This relation was obtained by Dziobek as a particular case of Lagrange- 
Jacobi’s equality ( [3]). 
Let us now define a more general potential U,: 
( K l 1 2  = U is the Newtonian potential) and write Lagrange-Jacobi’s equa- 
lity for M # 0: 
where Ho is the energy with fixed center of inertia. For Jacobi’s poten- 
tial ( K  = -l), the same phenomenon occurs as for M = 0: the function 
Clli<jlN 
mimjllqj - qi1I2 quadratically depends on time. 

77 
2. The two-body problem with M = 0 
Let us suppose: ml = -7712 
= 1. Thanks to the previous result, the 
solutions of the two-body problem are given by the relation: 
Proposition 2.1. For ml = -m2 = 1, the solutions of the two-body prob- 
lem have the following expression: 
- For P = 0, q1 and q2 follow parabolas (which may be degenerate): 
1 
qz(t) = -t2- 
+ tGa(0) + qz(0). 
2 
1 1 Q 1 I 3  
- For P # 0, P = a& (a # 0): 
1 
Q 
a2 
1 1 Q 1 I 3  
qi(t) = -(at - ln(at + 1))- 
+ tqi(0) + qi(0). 
- If P and Q are not collinear, we can suppose: det(P,Q) > 0. Let us 
denote by P’ the element of vect(P,Q) such that (P/IIPII, P’) is a direct 
orthonormal basis. Let us define s(t) by: 
Thus we have: 
where ai, bi are constants. In a same translating frame whose origin follows 
a curve (r, ch(r)), the two bodies have uniform rectilinear motions. 
3. Central and complex central configurations 
Let us identify a plane with C and denote by uz, the product of two complex 
numbers u and w. A configuration (respectively a planar configuration) is 
said to be central (respectively complex central) if, and only if, there exists 
a real number 
(respectively a complex number E), which is called the 
multiplicator, such that, for all i, j :  
Yj(q1, ..., 4 N )  - “/i(411 . . . I  4 N )  = E(4j - 42) 
(1) 
If E # 0, there is exactly one point 0, which is called the center, such that, 
for all i: Ti(q1, ..., q N )  = [(qi - 0). 

78 
Complex central configuration with t $ R are also called “dizzy” con- 
figurations ([l]). 
Proposition 3.1. If M # 0, t = 0, the configuration is an absolute equi- 
librium, i. e. the yi vanish. If M # 0, t # 0, the center of the central 
configuration 52 is the center of inertia. If M = 0, t # 0, the vector of 
inertia X(q1, ..., q N )  vanishes. 
Writing Lagrange-Jacobi’s equality for the motion generated by an ab- 
solute equilibrium and vanishing velocities gives the following result. 
Proposition 3.2. For an absolute equilibrium: U(q1, ..., q N )  = 0. 
The fact that there is no absolute equilibrium with N positive masses 
or N negative masses can be seen as a consequence of this result. 
4. Some homographic solutions 
A N-body motion is said to be homothetic (respectively homographic) 
if there exists a time-dependant linear homothety (respectively a time- 
dependant linear similarity) s such that: 
For a homothetic motion, the configuration is central. If, for a homographic 
motion, the vector space generated by the configuration is a constant plane, 
the configuration is complex central. 
Proposition 4.1. Let us suppose that the configuration is central (respec- 
tively complex central) with multiplicator t at time 0 and that there exists 
a complex number (respectively a real number) SO such that: 
Let us denote by s the solution of the differential equation: S = E S / / S ~ ~  
(one 
fixed center problem, with center at the origin and complex mass -t) such 
that s(0) = 1 and s(0) = so. Then the motion is homothetic (respectively 
homographic), and we have: 
The motions obtained for E = 0 generalize the solutions of the two- 
body problem with A4 = 0. More precisely, if E = 0, the motion of each 
body is a solution of the two-body problem with M = 0 or a uniform 

79 
rectilinear motion. In a particular translating frame, all the bodies have 
uniform rectilinear motion. If the configuration at time 0 is an absolute 
equilibrium, all the bodies have uniform rectilinear motion. 
If 4: # 0, everything occurs as if each body underwent the action of a 
single body with a complex mass. 
In Figs. 1 and 2, solutions of the one fixed center problem with E $ IR are 
drawn. The center is at the origin, the initial position of the particle is (1,0), 
the initial velocity is (0.6,0.4). In Fig. 1, the mass is -E = exp(i0.001). In 
Fig. 2, the mass is -E = exp(i0.157). The corresponding orbit for -( = 1 
is an ellipse.

For M = 0, all the complex central configurations are central indeed. 
Proposition 5.1. Let us suppose M = 0. 
such that: X(q1, q 2 , q 3 )  = 0. For these configurations: ( # 0.

- m 2 4 2  -41 72(q1,q2,!73) -71(41,q2,q3) - 
- Y2(Ql,q2,Q3) -71(41,q2,43) 
m 3  q3 - 41 
q2 - 41 
q2 - 41 
Let us now consider a non collinear complex central configuration. Let 
us suppose 5 # 0. Then, according to Prop. 3.1, X(ql,q2,q3) = 0. So the 

81 
configuration is collinear, which is impossible. So E = 0, which entails: 
O =  
42 - 41 + 43 - 42 + 41 - 43 
1142 - 41Il3 
1143 - 42\13

Thus the configuration is equilateral. Conversely, we can easily check that 
the equilateral triangle is a central configuration with E = 0 and that it is 
not an absolute equilibrium. 
The next result follows from Props. 5.1 and 4.1. 
Proposition 5.2. A three-body motion with M = 0 and X(q1, 42, 43) = 0 at 
any time is homographic, and there exists E E W\ ( 0 )  and a time-dependant 
complex number s, which is a solution of: s = Es/1sI3, such that: 
4j(t) - 4iW = s(t)(qj(O) - d o ) ) ,  
For M # 0, we can have complex central configurations with (' $ R. By 
taking the cross products between Eqs. (1) and the qj - qi, we obtain the 
following proposition. 
Proposition 5.3. The equilateral triangle is a central configuration for 
any system of masses. 
For any non collinear non isoceles three-body configuration, there is ex- 
actly one system of masses (ml, m2, m3) (up to homotheties) such that the 
configuration is complex central with ( $ R. 
A non collinear and non equilateral isoceles configuration is complex 
central for no system of masses. 
6. A particular case of the three-body problem with M = 0 
Proposition 6.1. For a three-body motion with M = 0 and constant vector 
of inertia X (a. e. P = 0), the vector 42 - 41 is a solution of a three fixed 
center problem. 
Then the centers 
are on the same line, with positions 0, -m3(r-' + 1)X, m3(r + 1)X. Their 
masses are -m3, m3(r-l + I ) ~ ,  
m3(r + I ) ~ .  
We can take m3 E {-1,l) and r = mz/ml > 0. 
This phenomenon has been observed in the three-vortex problem (['I). 

82 
When X = 0, the three centers are equal, so 42 - q1 is a solution of a 
one fixed center problem. This is also a consequence of Prop. 5.2. 
In particular, we have just shown that for P = 0, the collinear three- 
body problem is integrable. As a matter of fact, for M = 0, the Poisson 
bracket {P,Q} vanishes, and for P = 0, Q = X does not depend on time 
and is a first integral. The same phenomenon occurs in the four-vortex 
problem, with vanishing total vorticity and vector of vorticity (I4], 
[ 2 ] ) .  As 
a consequence of our remark in Sec. 1, the collinear three-body problem 
with Jacobi’s potential and M # 0 is also integrable ([‘]I).

REMARKS ON CONFORMAL KILLING TENSORS AND 
SEPARATION OF VARIABLES

Properties of conformal Killing tensors employed in separation of variables theory 
are reviewed and new results concerning L-systems (Benenti-systems) are obtained. 
1. Conformal Killing tensors and separation of variables 
On a given Riemannian manifold (Q, G) a symmetric (contravariant) two- 
tensor K is a conformal Killing tensor (CKT) if 
(K,G] = X O G ,  
where [., .] denotes the Schouten bracket, 0 the symmetrized tensor product 
and X is a vector field on Q. CKT’s are widely used in mathematical 
physics; for instance, in spacetimes they are associated with first integrals 
of null geodesics quadratic in the momenta. Moreover, R-separation of 
variables of Laplace equation is geometrically characterized in terms of “. . . 
involutive families of conformal Killing tensors ... which can be extended 
to a family of commuting conformal symmetry operators...”’ 
We recall that two tensors K1 and Kz are in involution if [K1 , K2] = 0. 
Special classes of CKT’s are often considered in the literature, for example 
trace-free CKT’S.’~~ 
In particular, we recall the following r e ~ u l t : ~  
Theorem 1.1. For n > 2, the maximum number of linearly independent 
trace-free CKT’s is (n - l)(n + 2)(n + 3)(n + 4)/12 and it is attained in 
conformally flat manifolds. In these manifolds, all trace-free CKT’s are

reducible i. e., linear combination with constant coeficients of symmetrized 
tensor products of conformal Killing vectors (CKV). 
Moreover, CKT’s are used to characterize orthogonal separation of vari- 
ables for fixed values of the energy for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations 
associated with natural Hamilt~nians:~ 
Theorem 1.2. The HJ equation for the natural Hamiltonian H = 
$gajpipj + V is separable in orthogonal coordinates on H = E, for a fixed 
E E R, if and only if there exist n - 1 CKT’s (Ki) with real common eigen- 
vectors, pairwise in involution, such that (G, K1,. . . Kn-l) are pointwise 
independent and satisfy 
CKT’s satisfying (1) are called of self-gradient type. This means that 
they are KT’s for the conformal metric G/(E - V ) .  
In all the previous statements about separation of variables (as in the 
ordinary separation of variables theory for HJ and Schrodinger equations, 
see [5, 61 and references therein) orthogonal separable coordinates are de- 
termined by common eigenvectors of CKT’s in involution (or KT’s in invo- 
lution for ordinary separation). Indeed, up to a closed singular set of Q, the 
eigenvector Ei is orthogonal to the coordinate hypersurfaces q’ = constant. 
Since we are interested in CKT’s eigenvectors, an equivalence relation 
naturally arises between CKT’s: 
Definition 1.1. Let K1, K2 be CKT’s of order two; K1 and K2 are equiv- 
alent (K1 - K2) if K1 - K2 = f G for a (almost everywhere C”) function 
f on Q. 
Two equivalent CKT’s K1, K2 share the same eigenvectors and K1 has 
distinct eigenvalues if and only if K2 has distinct eigenvalues. This fact 
suggests that, instead of single CKT’s, equivalence classes of CKT should 
be used to characterize separation of variables in the above described cases. 
Unfortunately, involution is not compatible with -: 
the fact that 
[K1,K] = 0 does not imply in general [K2,K] = 0 for all K2 - K1. 
It follows that tensors equivalent to self-gradient CKT’s are not necessarily 
of self-gradient type. 
Following [4], we introduce the notion of conformal involution. 

85 
Definition 1.2. Two symmetric tensors K1 and Kz are said to be in con- 
formal involution if there exists a vector X12 such that 
[Ki, Kz] = Xiz 8 G. 
Conformal involution is compatible with the equivalence relation - . 
Indeed, CKT’s equivalent to CKT’s in conformal involution are in confor- 
mal involution. Moreover, properties of CKT’s in conformal involution are 
similar to those of KT’s in involution: 
Proposition 1.1. (a) All CKT’s simultaneously diagonalized in orthogonal 
coordinates are in conformal involution. (ii) If n independent CKT’s with 
common eigenvectors Ei are in conformal involution, then Ei are normal 
(i.e., surface forming). 
Hence, for instance, we can restate Theorem 1.2 as f01lows:~ 
Theorem 1.3. The HJ equation for the natural Hamiltonian H = 
igajpipj + V is separable in orthogonal coordinates on H = E, for a fixed 
E E R, if and only if there exist n- 1 CKT’s (Ki) with real common eigen- 
vectors, pairwise in conformal involution, such that (G, K1, . . . , Kn-l) are 
pointwise independent and equation (1) is satisfied by some K: - Ki. 
Any other (n - 1)-tuple of CKT’s equivalent to (K1,. . . , Kn-l) defines 
the same web; some of them are made of KT’s for the conformal metric 
G / ( E  - V )  and pairwise in involution. 
It is remarkable that3 a CKT is always equivalent to a trace-free CKT. 
Thus, by Theorem 1.1 we conclude that 
Theorem 1.4. In n-dimensional conformally flat manifolds (n > 2) the 
orthogonal coordinates characterized by CKT’s in conformal involution can 
be always characterized by using reducible CKT’s. 
We remark that we can use the eigenvalues of CKT’s for finding the 
associated  coordinate^,^ as shown for Killing tensors in [8]. 
2. Conformal Killing tensors and L-systems 
A further application of the equivalence relation - in separation of vari- 
ables theory concerns a special case of separable system, the L-systems (or 
Benenti-systems). 
We recall that5 a L-tensor L is a (1,l) CKT with vanishing Nijenhius 
torsion and pointwise simple eigenvalues. This means that there exist local 

86 
orthogonal coordinates (qi) such that 
= a/aqi are eigenvectors of L 
associated with eigenvalues ui = ui(qi) depending on a single coordinate. 
Moreover, in [9, 51 it is shown that a L-tensor generates a sequence of n 
(contravariant) KT’s pointwise independent and pairwise in involution: 
1 
KO = G, 
K, = -tr (Ka-lL) G - K,-IL, 
(u = 1,. . . , n  - 1). (2) 
which form a basis of the linear n-dimensional space of KT with common 
eigenvectors and in involution (KS-space); then the coordinates (42) are 
separable. An orthogonal separable system is a L-system if it admits n 
independent KT’s recursively generated by a L-tensor by means of (2). 
The presence of a term proportional to the metric tensor in each element 
of the sequence (2) suggests the possibility to construct a new sequence of 
tensors equivalent to K, in the sense of Definition 1.1. 
U 
2.1. K-sequences and C-sequences 
From a more general point of view, we consider a symmetric two-tensor L 
of type (1,l) on a n-dimensional Riemannian manifold (Q, G )  with (i) real 
eigenvalues (uz) and (ii) n independent eigenvectors (Ei). We remark that 
if the metric tensor is definite positive both requirements are satisfied by 
all symmetric tensors. 
By using L, we construct the sequences (K,) and (C,) made of (1’1) 
tensors in the following way 
KO = I, 
C1 = -L, 
K, = i t r  (K,-lL) I - K,-1L, 
Ca+l = ;tr (C,) L - C,L, 
(3) 
1 
where u = 1,. . . , n - 1 and I is the identity matrix. 
We call (K,) the K-sequence and (C,) the C-sequence generated by L. 
We remark that if L is a L-tensor then the K-sequence (3)1 (rewritten in 
contravariant form) coincides with (2). Therefore, in the following we shall 
use the same notation for the two sequences. 
The relation between the sequences (3) is given by the following 
Proposition 2.1. POT any u = 1,. . . ,n - 1, the elements of the sequences 
(3) satisfy 
1 
a 
K, 2 --h(C,)I+C,. 

a7 
Proof. By induction on the value a. 
0 
An alternative expression for K, and C, is based upon the algebraic 
invariants ai of L, which are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial 
det(L-XI) = (-l)"X"+C~==l(-l)iaiX"-i 
(in particular we have 01 = trL, 
an = det L). The functions ui are the elementary symmetric functions of 
the eigenvalues of L: ai = aa(uj) is the sum of all products of i distinct 
variables uj. We set 00 = 1. Further properties of the ai useful for our 
aims can be found in [9, 51. 
Proposition 2.2. For any a = 0, . . . , n- 1, the elements of the K-sequence 
(3)1 satisfy 
a 
K, = C(-l)ha,-hLh. 
h=O 
For any a = 1,. . . ,n, the elements of the C-sequence (3)2 satisfy 
a 
c, = E(-l)hO,-hLh. 
h=l 
(4) 
(5) 
Proof. Equation (4) is proved in [9]. Due to Proposition 2.1, equation ( 5 )  
follows. 
0 
Remark 2.1. Due to the Hamilton-Cayley theorem, it is immediate to 
see that both sequences (3) end after n steps. Indeed, we get K, = 0, 
C, = -(det L) I and K,+j, C,+j vanish for all j > 0. 
Proposition 2.3. (a) The tensors L, K, and Ca+l (a = 1,. . . ,n - 1) 
have the same eigenvectors. (ii) The tensors (KO,. 
. . , K,-1) are pointwise 
linearly independent i f  and only if L has distinct eigenvalues. (iii) The 
tensors ( ( 2 1 , .  . . , C,) are pointwise linearly independent i f  and only if L 
has distinct eigenvalues and det L # 0. 
Proof. Item (i) follows from (3). Let pk be the eigenvalues of the tensors 
K, and let XL be the eigenvalues of the tensors C, ( a  = 1,. . . ,n - 1). We 
have pb = 1 and A: 
= -detL for any i. According to [9], we have for 
any a = 0,. . . ,n - 1: p i  = a: where a: = a, 
that is the symmetric 
functions of order a over the n - 1 variables (uJ) with j # i and det(ak) = 
J J J , 2 ( ~ z - - u J )  which is different from zero if and only if the u2 are all distinct. 

aa 
Thus, item (ii) follows. Moreover, by Proposition 2.2 we have X i  = ui - 0,. 
Due to the properties of the determinants and being Xk = - det L we have 
det(Xd) = (-l)n+ldet(L)det(ai), 
( a =  1, ..., n) 
so that we get (iii). 
0 
Remark 2.2. In order to avoid the restriction detL # 0, we can set 
C, = I without loss of generality. Indeed, generalizing the above propo- 
sition, we have that for any function f # 0 both the sets of n tensors 
(f1, 
K1,. . . K,-1) and (f I, ( 3 1 , .  . . C,-l) are pointwise linearly indepen- 
dent if and only if L has simple eigenvalues. 
From Propositions 2.2 and 2.3, we get the analogous of a well-known 
property of the sequence defined by (2)5. For sake of simplicity we adopt 
the same notation for the tensors (K,) and (C,) written in (1,l) or in (0,2) 
form. 
Theorem 2.1. If the tensor L has simple eigenvalues and normal eigen- 
vectors then the tensors C1,. . . Cn-l, G are independent symmetric tensors 
simultaneously daagonalized in orthogonal coordinates. 
2.2. C-sequences and L-systems 
We assume now that L is an L-tensor. We recall that in this case the K- 
sequence coincides with (2) and generates the KS-space of the L-system. 
For the C-sequence we get the following result: 
Theorem 2.2. If L is an L-tensor for G then the tensors ((21,. . . Cn-l, G )  
defined by (3)2 are independent conformal Killing tensors in conformal in- 
volution with respect to any conformal metric G = f G  and with common 
normal eigenvectors. 
The proof of the theorem requires the two following straightforward 
properties. 
Proposition 2.4. If C is a CKT for G, then it is a CKT for any conformal 
metric G = f G  where f is a function on Q. 
Proposition 2.5. If C1 and C2 are in conformal involution with respect 
to G, then they are in conformal involution with respect to any conformal 
metric G = f G  where f is a function on Q. 

89 
Proof. Since L is a L-tensor, the K, are KT’s which generates a KS-space. 
Then, by Proposition 2.1 the C, are CKT’s equivalent to K,. Hence, by 
Proposition 1.1, the statement holds for the metric G. By Propositions 2.4 
0 
Example 2.1. The prolate spheroidal coordinates are obtained by rotating 
a planar elliptic-hyperbolic coordinate system around the line containing 
the foci. The three coordinate foliations are made of two-folded hyper- 
boloids, ellipsoids, and meridian half-planes, respectively. It is easy to 
check that the prolate coordinates are an L-system generated by the L- 
tensor L, = r @ r - k2n @ n, where r is the position vector, n is a unit 
vector parallel to the rotational axis and k is half of the focal distance. The 
corresponding sequences K, and C, are 
and 2.5, the theorem follows. 
K1 = r2 G - r @ r  + k2n@n+ k 2 G  
K2 = -k2(n x r) @ (n x r), 
c1 = -Lp, 
C2 = k2[(n x r) @ (n x r) + p 2  G] 
where p is the distance from the rotational axis. 
Example 2.2. The Six-spheres coordinates. Given a Cartesian frame 
(0, 
5, y, z), each coordinate foliation of the six-spheres coordinates is a fam- 
ily of spheres all tangent in 0 with centers on the same coordinate axis (see 
[lo]). The spheres are obtained by inversion of the Cartesian coordinate 
planes and are orthogonal to the three independent CKV (inversions) 
I, = ( - 2 2  + y2 + 2 2 ,  -22y, -22z), 
I, = (-2sy, 2 2  - y2 + 2 2 ,  -2yz), 
I, = (-222, -2yz, 2 2  + y2 - 22). 
We recall that in the Euclidean three-space the Cartesian coordinates are 
an L-system, with L-tensor given by L, = a, @ 8, + 28, @ 8, + 38, @ a,. Let 
us consider the tensor L, = I, @I, + 2 I, 8 I, + 3 I, @I,, whose eigenvectors 
are associated with the six-spheres coordinates. We get that L, is an L- 
tensor for the conformal metric G = fG, where G is the Euclidean metric 
and f = (z2 + y2 + z2)-’. The corresponding C-sequence is 
c1= -Ls, 
CZ = L: - (trL,)L,, 
C3 = G 
and the contravariant Cartesian components of C2 are 
[ 
,111 
I1 
5(x2+y’)’+z2(22z2+26y2+5z’) 1 
-411’ (z’ +5y2 +t2) --8(y’ fr’)’ 
22y(2’+7z2 -y2) 
-2x2(3z2 +5yz -32’) 
-9(x2+22)2-yz(14z2+9y2+2~2) 
-4y+(x2+2y2-2z2) 
c 2  = f-1 
We remark that in this particular case the C, are KT’s in involution for 
the conformal metric G.

3. Conclusion 
The introduction of C-sequences in L-system theory allows to build the 
tensors characterizing L-systems with n - 2 instead of n - 1 iterations 
(C, = -L). Moreover, being a C-sequence is a property compatible with 
the natural equivalence relation N between CKT’s. As seen in Theorem 
1.4, the use of the equivalence classes of CKT’s allows, in conformally flat 
manifolds of dimension greater than two, to characterize associated separa- 
ble coordinates by means of the finite dimensional linear space of reducible 
CKT’s. A C-sequence defined for G is a C-sequence for the whole family of 
metrics conformal to G. Example 2.2 suggests that, by using C-sequences, 
we can extend the notion of L-system, related to ordinary separable coordi- 
nates, to conformal L-system, related to conformal separable  coordinate^,^ 
defined by C-sequences of CKT’s and generated by some suitably defined 
conformal L-tensor. On this subject the work is in progress

A recent literature 4,’,6,7 
shows that a key role in the understanding of different 
kind of problems in nonlinear analysis, is played by functional class S introduced 
by the authors in connection with some optimal partition problems. The aim of 
this paper is to give a presentation of S and an overview of the regularity theory 
so far developed for its elements. 
1. The functional class 5 
The purpose of this paper is to present some recent results concerning the 
main qualitative properties of the solutions of several problems connected 
with optimal partition questions. The object of the theory is the so called 
class S, introduced by the authors in 
in the following manner. First, 
let N 2 2, R c RN be a connected] open bounded domain with regular 
boundary dR and let Ic 2 2 be a fixed integer. Then we consider the set 
of all the possible partition of R in k disjoint subsets which are supports of

( U 1 , .  . . , uk) E (H1(R))k : 
Here we prescribe di 2 0, di E H1/2(dR) and such that di . dj = 0 for 
i # j ,  almost everywhere on dR. Roughly speaking, the class S consists 
in that subset of U in which the densities ui are not general H’ functions 
but instead obey to a set of 2k differential inequalities. Namely, let us fix 
fi(z, s) : R x IK+ -+ EX, for i = 1,. . . , k  and define

i#i 
for U E U ,  and the corresponding procedure on the nonlinearities leads to 
if z E {ui > O} 
i 
-fj(z,uj) if z E {uj > 0}, j # i. 
Our plan is the following. First, we provide some motivations to a system- 
atic study of the elements of the class s, and we show that it appears in a 
natural way when studying different problems in nonlinear analysis, from 
population dynamics to optimal partition problems. Then we focus on the 
regularity and free boundary theory so far developed by the authors, and 
we present the main results which are proven in concerning the properties 
of the elements of S and their supports. To this aim, throughout the paper 
we always assume that 
fi(z, s) is Lipschitz continuous in s, uniformly in z and fi(z, 
0 )  G 0.

Let us consider the system of k reaction-diffusion equations 

93 
for i = 1,. . . , k (see ’). This system governs the steady-states of k compet- 
ing species coexisting in the same area 0. Here ui represents the population 
density of the i-th specie, whose internal dynamics is prescribed by fi; the 
positive constants w . aij determine the interaction between the population 
ui and uj, which is possibly asymmetric. This systems has been intro- 
duced in ’ 
as a model for studying the pattern formation driven by strong 
competition, see 8,9. It turns out that the presence of large interactions 
of competitive type produces, to the limit, the spatial segregation of the 
densities. In other words, in the limiting configurations all the popula- 
tions survive, but have disjoint habitats. As a matter of fact the limiting 
configurations as the competition term tends to infinity, belong to S. 
Theorem 2.1. Let (u+) be a positive solution of the above system. Then, 
there exists (ui) 
E S such that, up to subsequences, I(ui,+ - U ~ I I H I  
0 as 
w - - + m .  
Therefore, the class S is the natural framework where investigating the 
properties of the asymptotic limits of highly competing diffusion systems a. 
2.2. An optimal partition problem 
Let F,(q s) = 
Problem. Find the minimum of the functional 
fi(z, 
u)du and consider the following variational problem: 
J ( U )  = 
{ / (f @(x) 1 V ~ i ( x ) [ ~  
- Fi(z, ui(z)) 
i=l, ..., k ’ 
where U E ZA. 
(see 
We can think to J ( U )  as the sum of the internal energies of k 
positive densities ui having diffusions di and internal potentials Fi (x, 
s); 
a relevant assumption is that they interact solely through the boundaries 
of their supports. The minimizers of the problems can be viewed as a 
class of segregation states in population dynamics, which are governed by a 
minimization principle rather than competition-diffusion. In this perspec- 
tive, the following result explains the connection between the variational 
problem and the functional class S: 
Theorem 2.2. Let U be a minimum for J in 24. Then U E S

Remark 2.1. Under a suitable global Lipschitz continuity of the fi's it is 
possible to prove that the variational problem does have at least a minimizer 
U .  The question whether the minimizer is unique has in general a negative 
answer; on the other side, a sufficient condition to prove uniqueness of the 
minimizer consists in assuming that the Fi's are concave. 
3. The regularity theory for the elements of S 
As a first step in the study of the elements of S, let us list some regularity 
properties which follow as straightforward consequence of the validity of 
the Maximum Principle for elliptic equations (here it is crucial the locally 
Lipschitz continuity of the fi's). We first need a definition: 
Definition 3.1. The multiplicity of a point z E R is 
m(z)=#{i:meas({ui 
>O}nB(z,r))>OVr>O} . 
We shall denote by 
2 h ( U )  = {Z E R : m(z) 2 h} 
the set of points of multiplicity greater than or equal to h E N. 
Lemma 3.1. Let U E S and xo E R: then U satisfies the following prop- 
erties in a neighborhood of 20: 
(1) If m(z0) = 0, then 3r > 0 such that ui = 0 on B ( q , r ) ,  'di. 
(2) Ifm(z0) = 1, then 32, 3- 
> 0 such that uk = 0 for k # i and 
-Aui = fi(z, ui) 
in B(z0, r ) .  
Hence ui > 0 and ui E C'I"(B(z0,r)) (for every 0 < a < 1). 
setting fi,j(z, s) := fi(z, s+) - fj(z, s-) there holds 
-A(ui - uj) = fi,j(z, ui - uj) 
(3) If m(z0) = 2, then 3, j, r > 0 such that U h  E 0 for h # z , j  and 
in B(x0, r ) .  
Hence ui - uj E C'>"(B(zO,r)). 
Remark 3.1. 
- We can not exclude, at this stage, the occurrence of points of multiplicity 
zero, although this possibility will be ruled out at the end of Section 4.1, at 
least in two dimensions, under a weak non degeneracy assumption. Note 
that a{z E R : m(x) = 0) c 
2 3  u 6%. 

95 
- If m(z) = 2, as a consequence of assertion (3) in the previous proposition, 
it holds 
lim 
Vui(y) = - Fz 
Vuj(y) 
If, by the way, the above limit is not zero, it follows that the set {z : m(z) = 
2) is locally a C' manifold of dimension N - 1 '. 
Let us now come to our main regularity result. 
For any Ic-tuple 
(u1, . . . , un) E S, we consider the function 
11-S 
11€(*,>0> 
Y € ( U ) > O )  
n 
i=l 
and we wonder which is the best regularity for U .  As it is clear by the above 
discussion, due to the presence of double points, one cannot expect U to be 
more regular than locally Lipschitz continuous. In fact we can prove that 
this is always the case, as stated in the following. 
Theorem 3.1. Let M > 0, h > 0 a fixed integer and w c RN be an open 
bounded domain. Let us define 
ua 2 0, ui ' U j  = 0 i f  i # j  
(211,. . . , U h )  E ( H l ( W ) ) h  : - A u ~  5 M ,  -AGi 2 -M 
and let U E S&,k(w). Then U as Lipschitz continuous in w .  
The next result shows that the regularity of the elements of S can hold 
up to the boundary, provided that the boundary is regular enough and the 
boundary data are Lipschitz continuous. 
Theorem 3.2. Let dR be of class C 1 ,  U E S with uilan = da and di E 
W'@(dR) for every i. Then U E W',m(n). 
We conclude the section by pointing out that the proof of these results is 
based on a local analysis (blow up procedure) and requires as a key tool a 
suitable version of the celebrated monotonicity theorem by Caffarelli & al., 
see and in particular 3.

4. Further regularity in dimension N=2 
Our analysis proceeds in dimension N = 2 with the study of the local 
behavior of the elements U of the class S around multiple points, that is, 
z E R with m(z) 2 2. The main goal is to show that, near a multiple 
point, U and its null set exhibit the same qualitative behavior of harmonic 
functions and their nodal sets. We refer the readers to the fundamental 
papers of Alessandrini ' and Hartman Winter lo for the main results about 
the zero set of harmonic functions and, more in general, of functions in the 
kernel of a divergence type operator. From now we will assume the further 
regularity on f 
f E C1(R x W). 
Under this assumption, the first crucial result states the gradient of U is 
null at points of multiplicity three (or greater) and moreover it vanishes 
continuously 
Theorem 4.1. If ~0 E 2 3  then lVU(z)I + 0 as z -+ 50. 
We remark that the result is established through the application of a mono- 
tonicity formula with three or more phases in dimension N = 2, which is 
proven by the authors in '. Then the proof follows by a local analysis and 
exploiting topological arguments bases on the dimension two of the space. 
4.1. Local properties of the free boundary 
Let again N = 2 and consider an element U E S with the property that 
each component has connected support, i.e. 
U E S such that {ui > 0} is connected Vi. 
(1) 
Then we can go further with our analysis by providing a complete descrip- 
tion of the geometrical properties of the null set of U .  We already noticed 
in Remark 3.1 that the set of double points 22 = {z E R : m(z) = 2}, is 
locally a regular C' arc around those points where V U  does not vanish. In 
fact this is always the case 
Theorem 4.2. Let xo E Z 2 .  Then VU(x0) # 0 and 22 is locally a C1- 
curve through ZO. 
Let us now consider points of higher multiplicity. Our major result concerns 
with the topological structure of the set 2 3 .  As a matter of fact there holds 
Theorem 4.3. The set Z3 consists of a finite number of points. 

97 
We finally present an asymptotic formula describing the behavior of 
C ui in the neighborhood of a multiple point which is isolated in 2 3 .  
Theorem 4.4. Let xo E Z3 with rn(z0) = h. Then there exists 80 E (-r, 
7r] 
such that 
as r --f 0, where (r, 8 )  denotes a system of polar coordinates around xo 
It is worthwhile at this point to adopt a more geometrical perspective. To 
this aim, let us associate with the class S a family of partitions of the 
domain R in k subset, namely the set 
P = ( ( ~ 1 ,  ..., w k )  : wi = {ui > 0 )  for some U E S, wi connected } 
Then we obtain the following regularity theory for P: each wi is open (Th. 
3.1); the k-tuple (wi) constitutes a true partition of R, 
namely 
Indeed, having proved that the multiple points are isolated, the existence 
of points of multiplicity zero can be easily ruled in light of Remark 3.1. 
Finally, the set 
i#i 
is made up by a finite number of C1 arcs ending either at the boundary 
of 0 or at a finite number of possible internal points Zh. Each Zh is a 
multiple intersection point where at least three different subsets wi meet; if 
the number of these subsets is 1, then the angle around Zh is equally shared 
in 1 parts by half lines pointed at zh and cutting angles of 2r/l. 
We wish to remark another peculiar feature of the class of partitions P. 
If k 2 4, the occurrence of a point of multiplicity four (or greater) cannot 
be excluded. This shows the different nature of our problem, compared 
to other singular minimization problems involving discontinuities (in the 
functions and/or in their gradients) where minimizers are known to possess 
only triple junctions (e-g. the minimizers of the Mumford-Shah functional 
in image segmentation). To exhibit a point of multiplicity k = 4, let R 
be the unitary ball of EX2, and let d(8) = Isin(28)I. Let us now assume 
the Fi’s to be convex and consider boundary data +i(O) = 4(8) for 8 E 
[in/4, (i + 1)r/4], q5i = 0 otherwise. Then, in light of Remark 2.1, the 
minimizer U of the internal energy J ,  which is an element of S, is unique 

98 
and inherits the rotational symmetry of the data. Hence the origin is a 
point of multiplicity four for U .  
Conclusions. The regularity theory we propose applies to the elements of 
the class S. Hence, it is sufficient to prove that the solution of a certain 
problem belongs to this class, in order to have immediately a variety of 
properties for the solution itself. On the other side, our theory also pro- 
vides a tool for finding changing sign solutions to elliptic partial differential 
equations. For instance, let N = 1 and take fi = f for all i = 1,. . . ,Ic. 
Then, in light of Remark 3.1, to each eIement U E S correspond a changing 
sign solution of 
-Au = f(u) 
in a, 
namely the function u = ~ ~ = l ( - l ) i - l u ~ .  
we obtain a new enlighten on the struc- 
ture of the hEik spectrum for the Laplace operator and we prove possible 
variants and extensions of the already mentioned monotonicity formula by 
Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman 2. 
By exploiting this feature, in

LAMBDA AND MU-SYMMETRIES 
GIUSEPPE GAETA

gaeta@mat. unimi. it 
Lambda-symmetries of ODEs were discussed by C .  Muriel in her talk at SPT2001. 
Here we provide a geometrical characterization of lambda-prolongations, and a 
generalization of these - and of A-symmetries - to PDEs and systems thereof. 
Introduction 
Symmetry analysis is a standard and powerful method in the analysis of 
differential equations, and in the determination of explicit solutions of non- 
linear ones. 
It was remarked by Muriel and Romero” (see also the work by Pucci 
and Saccomandi14) that for ODEs the notion of symmetry can be somehow 
relaxed to that of lambda-symmetry (see below), still retaining the relevant 
properties for symmetry reduction and hence for the construction of explicit 
solutions. Their work was presented at SPT200111, raising substantial in- 
terest among participants. 
Here I report on some recent work4r6v7 which sheds some light on 
“lambda-symmetries” , and extends them to PDEs - and systems thereof - 
as well; as the central objects here are not so much the functions A, but 
some associated one-forms p, these are called “mu-symmetries” . 
The work reported here was conducted together with Giampaolo Ci- 
cogna and Paola Morando; I would like to thank them, as well as other 
friends (J.F. Cariiiena, G. Marmo, M.A. Rodriguez) with whom I discussed 
these topics in the near past. It is also a pleasure to thank C. Muriel and G. 
Saccomandi for privately communicating their work on A-symmetries and 
raising my interest in the topic.

1. Standard prolongations 
Let us consider equations with p independent variables ( X I ,  ..., zp) E B = 
Rp and q dependent ones, (ul, ..., uq) E F = Rq. The corresponding phase 
space will be M = B x F ;  more precisely, this is a trivial bundle ( M ,  
7r, B). 
a Lie-point vector field 
in M will be written as 
With the notation 8, := d/dxi and a, := 
x = tZ(z,u)& + Cp”(z,u)&, . 
(1) 
We also write, with J a multiindex of length IJI = j1+ ... +jq, 8,” := a/&:. 
Then a vector field in the n-th jet bundle J“M will be written (sum over 
J being limited to 0 5 IJI 4 n) as 
Y = tia, + Q”,daJ 
. 
(2) 
The jet space J”M is equipped with a contact structure, described 
by the contact forms 
8: := duy - u”Ji dzi 
(IJI 5 n - 1) . 
(3) 
Denote by E the Cm(JnM) module generated by these 8:. Then we 
say that Y preserves the contact structure if and only if, for all 29 E E ,  
Cy(8) E E .  
(4) 
As well known, this is equivalent to the requirement that the coefficients in 
(2) satisfy the (standard) prolongation formula 
Qy,i = DiQy - u”J,,(Dit”). 
( 5 )  
We note, for later reference, that for scalar ODES formula (5) is rewrit- 
ten more simply, with obvious notation, as 
Q k + l  = Dz Q k  - uk+l ( D z  t) . 
(6) 
We also recall that the vector field Y is the prolongation of X if Y 
satisfies (4) and coincides with X when restricted to M ;  X is a symmetry 
of a differential equation (or system of differential equations) A of order n in 
M if its n-th prolongation Y is tangent to the solution manifold SA c P M ,  
see standard references on the subject2i5~8~9~13,16~18. 
Note that condition (4) is also equivalent to conditions involving the 
commutator of Y with the total derivative operators Di; in particular, it is 
equivalent to either one of 
[D,,Y]A8 = 0 
W E E ;

with hy E C”(JnM) and V a vertical vector field in JnM seen as a bundle 
over J”-~M. 
2. Lambda-prolongations 
2.1. The work of Muriel and Romem 
In 2001, C .  Muriel and J.L. RomerolO, analyzing the case where A is a 
scalar ODE, noticed a rather puzzling fact. 
They substitute the standard prolongation formula (6) with a “lambda- 
prolongation” formula 
here X is a real C” function defined on JIM (or on JkM if one is ready 
to deal with generalized vector fields). Let us now agree to say that X is a 
“lambda-symmetry” of A if its “lambda-prolongation’’ Y is tangent to the 
solution manifold SA c JnM. 
Then, it turns out that “lambda-symmetries” are as good as standard 
symmetries for what concerns symmetry reduction of the differential equa- 
tion A and hence determination of its explicit solutions. As pointed out by 
Muriel and Romero, it is quite possible to have equations which have no 
standard symmetries, but possess lambda-symmetries and can therefore be 
integrated by means of their approach; see their works1°-12 for examples. 
2.2. The work of Pucci and Saccomandi 
In 2002, Pucci and Saccomandi’* devoted further study to lambda- 
symmetries, and stressed a very interesting geometrical property of lambda- 
prolongations: that is, lambda-prolonged vector fields in JnM can be char- 
acterized as the only vector fields in JnM which have the same character- 
istics as some standardly-prolonged vector field. 
We stress that Y is the lambda-prolongation of a vector field X in M, 
then the characteristics of Y will not be the same as those of the standard 
prolongation X(”) 
of X, 
but as those of the standard prolongation X(n) of 
a different (for X nontrivial) vector field 2 in M. 
This property can also be understood by recalling (4) and making use 
of a general property of Lie derivatives: indeed, for a any form on JnM, 
LAY(..) = XYAda + d(XY-Ia) = XLy(a) + d X A ( Y A a ) .  
(9) 

102 
2.3. The work of Momndo 
It was noted6-10 that lambda-prolongations can be given a characterization 
similar to the one discussed in remark 1 for standard prolongations; that 
is, with h r  and V as above, (8) is equivalent to either one of [Dz, 
Y ]  1 6  = 
X(Y 1 6 )  for all 6 E E ,  and [Dm, Y ]  = XY + hYD, + V .  
This, as remarked by Morando, also allows to provide a characterization 
of lambda-prolonged vector fields in terms of their action on the contact 
forms, analogously to (4). In this context, it is natural to focus on the one- 
form p := Adz; note this is horizontal for J"M seen as a bundle over B, and 
obviously satisfies Dp = 0, with D the total exterior derivative operator. 
Then, Y is a lambda-prolonged vector field zf and only zf Cy(6)+ (Y _] 6 ) p  E 
E for all 6 E E .  
3. Mu-prolongations; mu-symmetries for PDEs 
The result given above immediately opens the way to extend lambda- 
symmetries to PDEs'. 
As here the main object will be the one-form p, 
we prefer to speak of "mu-prolongations" and "mu-symmetries" . Let 
p := X i d ~ ~  
(10) 
be a semibasic one-form on (J"M, 7rn, B), satisfying Dp = 0. Then we say 
that the vector field Y in J"M p-preserves the contact structure if and 
only if, for all 6 E E ,  
CY(6) + ( Y J 6 ) p  E E .  
(11) 
Note that Dp = 0 means DiXj = DjXi for all i, j ;  hence locally p = D@ for 
some smooth real function @. 
With standard computations6, one obtains that (11) implies the scalar 
p-prolongation formula 
* ~ , i  = ( D i + k ) * ~  - u~,,(Di+xi)[". 
(12) 
Let Y as in (2) be the p-prolongation of the Lie-point vector field X (l), 
and write the standard prolongation of the latter as X(") 
= Fai + @ J @ ;  
note that 90 = 
= 'p. We can obviously always write 9 
J = @ J + FJ, 
and FO = 0. Then it can be proved6 that the difference terms FJ satisfy 
the recursion relation 
F J , ~  
= (Di + Xi)Fj + XiDjQ 
(13) 
where Q := 'p - u& is the character is ti^^^^^^^^ of the vector field X. 

103 
This shows at once that the p-prolongation of X coincides with its stan- 
dard prolongation on the X-invariant space I x ;  indeed, I x  c J"M is the 
subspace identified by D J Q  = 0 for all J of length 0 5 I JI < n. It follows 
that the standard PDE symmetry reduction ~ n e t h o d ~ ? ~ ~ , ' ~  
works equally 
well when X is a p-symmetry of A as in the case where X is a standard 
symmetry of A; see our work6 for examples. 
The concept of p-symmetries is also generalized to an analogue of stan- 
dard conditional and partial syrnmetries3,l, i.e. partial (conditional) p- 
symmetries4. 
4. Mu-symmetries for systems of PDEs 
The developments described in the previous section do not include the case 
of (systems of) PDEs for several dependent variables, i.e. the case with 
q > 1 in our present notation. This was dealt with in a recent work6, to 
which we refer for details. 
To deal with this case, it is convenient to see the contact forms 295, see 
(3), as the components of a vector-valued contact form17 2 9 ~ .  We will denote 
by 0 the module over q-dimensional smooth matrix functions generated 
by the 295, i.e. the set of vector-valued forms which can be written as 
77 = (R~)g29b, with RJ : JnM --f Mat(q) smooth matrix functions. 
Correspondingly, the fundamental form p will be a horizontal one-form 
with values in the Lie algebra g l ( q )  (the algebra of the group GL(q), con- 
sisting of non-singular q-dimensional real matrices) 17. We will thus write 
p = Aidx' 
(14) 
where hi are smooth matrix functions satisfying additional compatibility 
conditions discussed below. 
We will say that the vector field Y in J"M p-preserves the vector contact 
structure 0 if, for all 29 E 0, 
Cy(29) + (Y~(hi);29') 
dx' E 0 . 
(15) 
In terms of the coefficients of Y ,  see (a), this is equivalent to the re- 
quirement that the 
obey the vector p-prolongation formula 
where we have introduced the (matrix) differential operators 

1 04 
If again we consider a vector field Y as in ( 2 )  which is the p-prolongation 
of a Lie-point vector field X, and write the standard prolongation of the 
latter as X(n) = ti& + 
(with $; = @; 
= cp"), we can write \k; 
= 
@; + F,", with F$ = 0. Then the difference terms FJ satisfy the recursion 
relation 
where Q" := pa -@ti, 
and rJ are certain matrices (see ref.6 for the explicit 
expression). This, as for the scalar case, shows that the p-prolongation of 
X coincides with its standard prolongation on the X-invariant space I x ;  
hence, again, the standard PDE symmetry reduction method works equally 
well for p-symmetries (defined in the obvious way) as for standard ones. 
See ref6 for examples. 
5. Compatibility condition and gauge equivalence 
As mentioned above the form p, see (14), is not arbitrary: it must satisfy a 
compatibility condition (this guarantees the S$ defined by (16) are uniquely 
determined), expressed by 
[VzrVk] Dihk - Dkhi + [hi,&] = 0 .  
(19) 
It is quite interesting to remark4 that this is nothing but the coordinate 
expression for the horizontal Maurer-Cartan equation 
(20) 
1 
DP + 5 [P,PI = 0 .  
Based on this condition, and on classical results of differential 
geometry15, it follows that locally in any contractible neighbourhood A C_ 
J n M ,  there exists Y A  : A + GL(q) such that (locally in A) p is the Darboux 
derivative of Y A  . 
In other words, any p-prolonged vector field is locally gauge-equivalent 
to a standard prolonged vector field4, the gauge group being GL(q). 
It should be mentioned that when JnM is topologically nontrivial, or p 
present singular points, one can have nontrivial p-symmetries; this is shown 
by means of very concrete examples in our recent work4. 
Note that when we consider symmetries of a given equation A, the 
compatibility condition (20) needs to be satisfied only on Sa C J"M. 
When indeed p is not satisfying everywhere (20), p-symmetries can happen 
to be gauge-equivalent to standard nonlocal symmetries of exponential form; 
see again ref.4 for details.

In this paper we consider a class of (C-integrable) autonomous second-order evo- 
lution equations in (1 + 1) dimensions. These equations have been linearized in 
via generalized hodograph transformations. We prove that these equations admit 
an infinite number of potential symmetries. Consequently these equations can be 
linearized by a non invertible point mapping. 
1. Introduction 
In 
we observed that the well known nonlinear diffusion equation 
U t  = [(u-2u&. 
(1) 
can be linearised by using the invertible nonlocal hodograph transformation 
I ' Z  3, given by 
dX(5, E) = iidZ + ii-2ii, dE 
dT(5, E) = dE 
U ( X ,  T )  = Z 
We also observed that the linearization 
r2 : 
UT - uxx = 0 
i 
of (1) can also be achieved by the invertible contact transformation 
dx(X, T )  = UdX + UxdT 
u(x, t) = u-l 
(3) 
106 

107 
Moreover, we define autohodograph transformations, that is nonlocal trans- 
formations of hodograph type that transforms a given differential equations 
into itself. This autohodograph transformation for (1) is given by 
A = rl rz. 
In 
and 
N. Euler et a1 presented a class of (C-integrable) (1 + 1)- 
dimensional second order evolution equations which can be linearised using 
a generalised hodograph transformation as well as the recursion operators 
for this class of equations. 
Lie classical symmetries admitted by nonlinear PDE’s are useful for 
finding invariant solutions, as well as to discover whether or not the equa- 
tion can be linearized by an invertible mapping and construct an explicit 
linearization when one exists. 
Nevertheless an obvious limitation of group-theoretic methods based 
in local symmetries, is that many PDE’s, do not have local symmetries. 
It turns out that PDE’s can admit nonlocal symmetries whose infinitesi- 
mal generators depend on the integrals of the dependent variables in some 
specific manner. It also happens that if a nonlinear scalar PDE does not 
admit an infinite-parameter Lie group of contact transformations is not 
linearizable by an invertible contact transformation. However most of the 
interesting linearizations involve non-invertible transformations, such lin- 
earizations can be found by embedding given nonlinear PDE’s in auxiliary 
systems of PDE’s z. 
For a given PDE one can also find useful nonlocal symmetries by embed- 
ding it in an auxiliary ” covering” system with auxiliary dependent variables 
’. A point symmetry of the auxiliary system, acting on the space consisting 
of the independent and dependent variables of the given PDE as well as the 
auxiliary variables, yields a nonlocal symmetry of the given PDE if it does 
not project onto a point symmetry acting in its space of the independent 
and dependent variables. 
In 1,2 Bluman introduced a method to find a new class of symmetries 
for a PDE. By writing a given PDE, denoted by R{x,t,u} in a conserved 
form, a related system denoted by S{x,t,u,v} with potentials as additionals 
dependent variables is obtained. If u(z, t), w(z, t) satisfies S{x,t,u,v}, then 
u(z, t )  solves R{x,t,u} and w(z, t )  solves an integrated related equation 
Any Lie group of point transformetions admitted by S{x,t,u,v} induces 
a symmetry for R{x,t,u}; when at least one of the generators of the group 
depends explicitly of the potential, then the corresponding symmetry is nei- 
T{x,t,v). 

108 
ther a point nor a Lie-Backlund symmetry. These symmetries of R{x,t,u} 
are called potential symmetries. 
The nature of potential symmetries allows one to extend the uses of 
point symmetries to such nonlocal symmetries. In particular: 
(1) Invariant solutions of S{x,t,u,v}, respectively T{x,t,v}, yield solu- 
tions of R{x,t,u} which are not invariant solutions for any local 
symmetry admitted by R{x,t,u}. 
(2) If R{x,t,u} admits a potential symmetry leading to the linearization 
of S{x,t,u,v}, respectively T{x,t,v}, then R{x,t,u} is linearized by 
a noninvertible mapping. 
Suppose S{x,t,u,v} admits a local Lie group of transformations with 
infinitesimal generator

VS = P(x,~,u,v)- + q(z,t,u,w)- + r(z,t,u,v)- + s(s,~,u,v)-, (4) 
this group maps any solution of S{x,t,u,v} to another solution of S{x,t,u,v} 
and hence induces a mapping of any solution of R{x,t,u} to another solution 
of R{x,t,u}. Thus (15) defines a symmetry group of R{x,t,u}. If 
then (15) yields a nonlocal symmetry of R {x,t,u}, such nonlocal symmetry 
is called a potential symmetry of R{x,t,u}, otherwise Xs projects onto a 
point symmetry of R{x,t,u}. 
Potential symmetries were obtained in for the porous medium equation 
with absorption and convection 
U t  = [(u”),: 
+ f ( 5 ) U S %  + g(z)u”,

when it can be written in a conserved form. These symmetries lead to the 
linearization of the equation by non-invertible mappings. 
that (1) admits no linearizing point or contact sym- 
metries. However the associated auxiliary system 
It is well-known 
v, = u 
Ut = u%,, 
(7) 
admits potential symmetries leading to the linearization of (1) by a change 
of variables involving a non-invertible mapping. 
In this paper, we consider the quasilinear autonomous evolution equa- 
tions reported in 5,6 we prove that all these equations that admit recursion 

109 
operators riot depending on z admit an infinite-parameter group of poten- 
tial symmetries that allow us to linearize them by a noninvertible mapping 
1. Potential symmetries 
We consider the general second-order linearisable autonomous evolution 
equation, given by 
ut = a(u)u,, + b(u)u: + c(u),u, + d ( u )  
(8) 
We introduce the potential variable v and the equation can be written as 
(9) 
v, = f(u) + mt 
vt = g(u)u, + k ( U )  + nx, 
with 
a(u) = $$$ b(u) = 
c(u) = f (21) d ( u )  = 5 
(10) 
By requiring (9) to be invariant under the transformation with infinites- 
imal generator 
v = E(z, t,u,v)dz + T ( 5 ,  t , U , V ) &  + 4(x,t,U,V)du + +(x, t, u,v)dv. (11) 
one obtains an over determined, linear system of equations for the infinites- 
imals ((5, t, u, 
v), ~(z,t,u,v), 
+(z, t,u,v), 4(z,t, u , ~ ) .  
When at least one 
of the generators of the group depend explicitly of the potential , that is if 
(2 + .,”

then (11) yields a nonlocal symmetry of (1). A potential symmetry of (13) 
is a classical symmetry of the associated potential system (14) that satisfies 
In the following we list the quasilinear evolution equations which appear 
in 
and 
as linearizable via the extended hodograph transformation and 
that admit Lie-Backlund symmetries and recursion operators not depend- 
ing on x. In this work we are not considering the semilinear equations. We 
also list the associated potential systems obtained by introducing a poten- 
tial variable v as well as the corresponding nonlocal potential symmetries 
leading to the linearization of the potential systems and to the linearization 
of the corresponding equations by a non-invertible mapping.

infinite-parameter Lie group of point transformations with infinitesimal 
generator v,1,va2,v,3 and v,4

4 .  Concluding remarks 
In this paper we have considered a class of quasilinear autonomous second- 
order evolution equations in (1 + 1) dimensions. All of these equations 
have Lie-Backlund symmetries and recursion operators not depending on x 
and have been linearized in 
via generalised hodograph transformations. 
We have constructed nonlocal symmetries (potential symmetries) which are 
realized as local symmetries of the related auxiliary systems. We exhibit 
the infinite parameter Lie group of point transformations. Consequently 
these auxiliary systems can be linearised by an invertible point mapping. 
In turn these mappings lead to noninvertible linearising mapping of the 
original PDES.

PERIODIC SOLUTIONS FOR ZERO MASS 
NONLINEAR WAVE EQUATIONS

In a celebrated paper by Craig and Wayne existence of periodic solutions has been 
proved for nonlinear wave equations with a mass term. Later the result has been 
extended to quasi-periodic solutions, but always under the assumption that the 
mass is strictly positive. So far, in the case of zero mass and Dirichlet boundary 
conditions, existence of periodic solutions has been proved only for a zero-measure 
set of values of the frequencies and amplitudes. I shall discuss a recent result, 
obtained with V. Mastropietro and M. Procesi, in which the same result can be 
obtained for a set with large relative measure. 
1. Introduction 
1.1. The model 
Consider the one-dimensional nonlinear wave equation utt - u,, + Mu = 
p(u) with Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBC) u(t, 0) = u(t, 7r) = 0, where 
cp(u) = @u3 + 0(u5) is an odd analytic function and M is a real parameter 
(mass). We assume @ # 0, and, without loss of generality, we can set @ = 1 
(or Q, = -1). 
We look for analytic (in 2, t )  small amplitude solutions. This suggests 
naturally a rescaling u + &u, with E > 0, so that 
U t t  - u,, + MU = E+(u, 
E ) ,  
i 
u(t, 0) = u(t, 7r) = 0, 
with +(u, 
E )  = u3 + 0(&u5). 
the equation becomes 
(1) 
If E = 0 any solution of (1) can be written as superposition of linear oscil- 
lations with frequencies w, = d
m
.
 
In particular there are infinitely 
many periodic solutions. A natural question is under which conditions (if 
any) periodic solutions can be continued for E # 0.

1.2. The results 
Results for this kind of problems read as follows. For concreteness let 
us consider as unperturbed solution the function uo(t, x )  = w1 cos wlt sin x 
(more general statements can be obviously made). 
Theorem 1.1. One can fix M in a suitable subset M c R so that the 
following holds. There exist EO > 0 and a Cantor set E E [O,EO] of large 
relative measurea such that for all E E E there exists a solution u(t, x; E )  of 
(1) analytic in (t, x )  and 2r/w(~)-periodic in t, with ~ w ( E )  
- w11 < CE and 
Ilu(t, 2; 
E )  - uo(w(E)t, x)II < CE, for a suitable constant C. 
The first result of this kind was by Craig & Wayne', for M a full measure 
set obtained by requiring that M verifies the Diophantine conditions 1nw1+ 
w,I 
> Co/lnl' for all Iml, 1121 > 1 and for suitable positive constants CO and 
T
.
~
 
Later Bowgain* and Kuksin & Poschel'0~'2 extended the result to all 
M # 0; in this case one uses part of the nonlinearity to remove resonances 
between the frequencies w,. 
Here we consider the case M = 0, which was left out in literature: 
U t t  - uzz = .cp(., 
E ) ,  
{ u(t, 0 )  = u(t, 7r) = 0. 
Note that for E = 0 one has w, = Iml, so that this is a completely 
resonant case. Any solution for E = 0 can be written as 
The result which can be proved now is as follows." 
Theorem 1.2. Set W ( E )  = fi. 
Then there is an unperturbed solution 
uo(t, X )  = Vm (sn(%(t + x),m) - sn(Rm(t - x),m)) 
(4) 
with R, 
= 2K(m)/7r and V, = Om-, 
where sn(.,m) is the sine- 
amplitude function with modulus fi, 
K(m) is the elliptic integral of first 
kind, and m M -0.2554 is uniquely fixed, such that the following holds. 
There exist EO > 0 and a Cantor set E E [0, EO] of large relative measure 
such that for all E E & there exists a solution u(t,x;E) of (2) analytic in

The first result of this kind was by LidskiY & Shul'man'l, for the case 
with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) and y(u) = u3, but only for a set 
of values of E with zero-measure. Later on Bambusi & Paleari3 found the 
same result for the equation (2), but again for a zero-measure set, and the 
result was then extended to more general nonlinearities by Berti & Bollel. 
A large measure set was obtained by Bourgain5 in the case of PBC, which 
presents some simplifications with respect to the case of DBC, as we shall 
see. Here we discuss the main ideas of our proof for the case of DBC,d by 
referring to the original paperg for a more detailed exposition.e 
2. General scheme 
2.1. Lyapunov-Schmidt decomposition 
We start by a Lyapunov-Schmidt type decomposition, which consists in 
writing u(t, z) = v(t, x) + w(t, x), with 
(n,m)& 
lnlflml 
where we have set w = W ( E )  = fi. 
We can assume v, = -v-, and 
w , > ~  = - w , , - ~  by the parity properties of the equation. Note that v(t, x) 
has the same form of the unperturbed solution (3). Then we obtain two 
sets of equations, usually denoted the Q and P equations, 
The new difficulties with respect to the case M # 0 are: 
(1) The Q equation is infinite-dimensional, and this gives rise to two 
problems: 
dA similar result has also been announced by Berti & Bolle2. 
eNon-perturbative smooth solutions have been obtained through variational methods. 
We mention also that there are examples of nonlinear wave equations in which discon- 
tinuous periodic (generalized) solutions can be provided7. In both cases the periods are 
(sub-multiples of) 2 ~ .  

118 
(a) Which solution can be continued? 
(b) How can one avoid loss of regularity in solving the Q and P 
equations? 
(2) The frequency w is 1 plus order E ,  so that if one wants to impose a 
Diophantine condition like (wn&mm( 2 C O / ( ~ ( ~ ,  
how can one obtain 
a constant Co which is &-independent? 
The problem of loss of regularity is the following one. In the case M # 0 
the Q equation is one-dimensional: for instance if one looks for a solution 
with frequency close to w1 one has an equation for the amplitude u1. By 
considering u1 as a parameter one can solve the P equation and one finds a 
solution w(u1), 
which can be inserted into the Q equation and solved by an 
implicit function argument. In our case the Q equation involves all n E Z, 
hence it is an equation for a function w (determined by the collection of 
its Fourier components w,’s): if one takes u as a parameter the solution 
W(U) of the P equation will be less regular than the function u, so that, 
when inserting such a w into the Q equation one has the problem to find a 
solution with the originally assumed regularity of u. 
Note that the Q and P equation look very different: the latter yields 
a small divisors problem but can be treated by perturbation theory, while 
the first one has no small divisor problem, but the right hand side is not of 
order E .  Problem (2) reflects the fact that if Co is of order E then also the 
Q equation is not a perturbation equation any more. 
2.2. Zero-order solution 
For E = 0 one can take w = 0, so that the P equation disappears and 
the Q equation reduces to n2w, = [w3],,,. 
We can write ( 5 )  as w(t,x) = 
u ( [ )  + b(E’), with [ = wt + x and [’ = wt - x, and with b([) = -u(() (u and 
b involve the Fourier components with m = n and m = -n, respectively). 
Then the Q equation gives a = -u3 - (b2) u and b = -b3 - (u2) b, where 
the dots denote derivatives with respect to the corresponding arguments, 
and (.) denotes average (that is the Fourier component with zero Fourier 
label). 
Because of the relation between the functions a and b, the two equations 
above correspond to the only equation a = -u3 - (u2) a, which is a closed 
equation for a. This is an integro-differential equation, because of the 
average term: the only odd 2r-periodic solution is found to be the function 
(4) appearing in the statement of Theorem 1.2. 

119 
In the case of PBC the equation for a is simpler: it is the ordi- 
nary differential equation a = -a3, which admits (trivially) the solution 
a([) = sn(O[, 1/2). Such a function solves the full equation utt -uzz = &u3, 
for [ = wt+z. More generally the same argument shows that one can easily 
construct periodic solutions of the form u(t, z) = U([) for any nonlinear- 
ity cp(u), simply by taking as U the solution of the one-dimensional system 
with potential energy P(u, E )  du. Then in order to have non-trivial results 
in the case of PBC one needs corrections to the nonlinear term explicitly 
depending on z, for instance5 p(u, z) = u3 + a(z)u4. Hence the P equa- 
tion becomes (-d-n2 + m’)w,,, 
= ~~/~[a(z)u~],,,, 
and one can impose 
a Diophantine condition with CO = O(E), without destroying the pertur- 
bation character of the P equation. In this way both problems l(a) and 
2 are solved in the case of PBC, while in the case of DBC problem 2 still 
remains. 
2.3. Avoiding the loss of regularity 
The idea to solve problem l(b) is very simple: we try to solve both equations 
P and Q simultaneously, by using as zero-order solution (w, 
zu) = (WO, 0), 
with wo(t, z) = a([) + b([’), and writing w = wo + V = (a + A, b + B), with 
obvious meaning of symbols. 
Then we can write the Q equation as ii + A = G(a + A) + F(a, A, w, 
E ) ,  
where G(a + A )  is the part of [u3],,, depending only on w (what automati- 
cally defines also the function F ) ,  and we are explicitly using that b and B 
can be expressed in terms of a and A (by the symmetries of the equation). 
If G denotes the part of G which is at least of order two in A, then the 
equation Q can be solved formally by variation of constants. This means 
that we can write A([) as the first component of the vector 
where W ( t )  is the Wronskian matrix of the linearized system A = 
dG(a([))A and the initial condition x has to be chosen in such a way 
that X ( t )  turns out to be periodic: in other words it is used to eliminate 
the secular terms which in principle can arise from the equation. 
One has to be careful as G(a+A) depends on (A2), which is not known. 
A classical trick in dealing with problems of this kind is just to replace (A’) 
with a parameter C, and to work out the solution as a function A(E,C) 
depending on such a parameter. At the end one has to impose (A’(., C)) = 

120 
C, and in order to solve such an equation one has to check some non- 
degeneracy condition. In a general setting2 this could be obtained as a 
genericity condition on the dominant term of the nonlinearity; however in 
our case the latter is given, so that non-degeneracy has to be checked by 
explicit computation. 
3. Lindstedt series method 
3.1. Power series expansion 
So far the analysis is only formal. As a first attempt we try to find a 
solution in the form of a power series in E ,  that is 
which inserted into the equation (7) and in the second set of equations in 
(6) give recursive equations for the coefficients V ( k )  and w ( ~ ) .  
For instance 
wn,m = &(-w2n2 + m2)-1[~3]n,m 
+ . . . gives 
where . . . are the higher order terms, and the * denotes the constraints 
k1 + kz +kg = k - 1, nl + 122 +ng = n and ml +m2 +m3 = m, and of 
course ki 2 0 in u ~ , : ~ , ,  
while k% 2 1 in Wn,:m,. The quantity g(n,m) = 
1/(-w2n2 + m2) is called propagator. 
Then (9) admits a very natural representation in terms of tree graphs (or 
simply trees), which are given by a collection of points and lines connecting 
them without forming any cycles. One introduces some rules in order to 
associate to any tree a number, which is called the value of the tree; for 
instance to each line one associate two integers (n,m) and a propagator 
g(n,m). In this way each coefficient u , , ~  is given as a sum over trees of 
the corresponding values; we refer to the original paperg for details and 
pictures. 
( k  1 
’ 
( k )  
( k )  
3.2. Counterterms and resummations 
The problem is that to any order k there are trees whose value grows as a 
factorial k! to some power, and it is very unlikely that there are cancellations 
as in the case of maximal KAM tori for systems with finitely many degrees of 
freedom. Such trees look like self-energy graphs in quantum field theories, 
that is they are subgraphs G which can be represented as sets of lines 

121 
and nodes between two external lines such that (i) the external lines have 
the same propagators and (ii) the latter are larger than the propagators 
of all the lines of G. Analytically such subgraphs can be associated with 
numerical values of the form M('))n, m ) ~ ~ ,  
if g(n, m) are the propagators 
of the external lines, and they give rise to contributions to witk of the form 
g ( n ,  m)M('I)(n, m)wc2, 
with kl + IC2 = k - 1. 
Then we can try a different approach with respect to naive power series 
expansion (8). Write the P equation as 
(-u2n2 + 5:) 
wn,m = pvmwn,m + ~ [ + ( u ' ~ ) I n , m ,  
(10) 
where we have added and subtracted a term vmwn3,, inserted a factor 
p = 1, and written GL = w i  - v,; 
we call counterterms the quantities v,. 
Let us neglect for the moment the constraints p = 1 and LZIL = w; - v,, 
and look for a periodic solution analytic in p, by considering v, 
as free 
parameters. We expand also the parameters v, 
in powers of p, so writing 
(10) to order k as 
w p k  = g(n, m) c vgl'wiy$ + .[+(.., &)p;l), (11) 
kl+kz=k-l 
and obtaining a tree expansion analogous to the previous ones, with some 
obvious changes; for instance now the propagators g ( n , m )  are of the form 
g(n, 
m) = ( -u2n2 +WL)-'. Then we use vgl) to compensate the dominant 
contribution of the value M('l)(n,m) of the self-energy graphs: of course 
this fixes the counterterms as functions of p, E and {W,,},,. 
To really 
implement such a construction requires some work, and again we refer to 
the original paperg for an exhaustive discussion. At the end one finds 
that the power series expansion in p is convergent, provided the following 
Diophantine conditions (known respectively as first and second Mel'nikov 
conditions) are imposed for some positive constants CO and 7: 
Iwn*GrnI > C O J ~ J - ~  
vlnl # 
Jwn f 5, f 
Gm/J > CoJnl-' 
V'Jnl # Jm f 
m'J. 
(12) 
The radius of convergence is found to be of order of an inverse power of 
E :  this means that for E small enough one can take p = 1. 
As we said, the expansion turns out to be well defined only if the coeffi- 
cients vg' are chosen in a precise way. Hence one has to invert the relation 
6% = m 2  - V ~ ( { W ~ ~ } ~ ~ ) ,  
which is not a trivial implicit function problem 
as the frequencies W, have to be such that the Diophantine conditions (12) 
are satisfied. The inversion problem can be solved by following an iterative 

122 
scheme, that is by defining (;rE)2 = m2, W g ) 2  = m2 - v,({w~,},~), 
- (0) 
and so 
on: in general at step p one has W%l2 = m2 - v,({W~~~)},~), 
so that one 
has to eliminate some values of E by imposing Diophantine conditions like 
(12) with W2-l) replacing 5,. Then we have to show that the procedure 
converges, and that the Cantor set E of values of E which are left at the 
end has large relative measure in the interval [0, E O ] ;  see the original paperg 
for a discussion of these issues. Of course the larger is r the larger is the 
relative measure of admissible values for E (but of course the smaller is the 
value of E O ) :  what we found is that any value of r > 1 is allowed.f 
Finally, coming back to problem 2, we note that what emerges from the 
analysis is that the Diophantine conditions (12) have to be imposed only 
in certain cases. An important issue is that the first and second Mel’nikov 
conditions have to be imposed only when 1721 # Iml and 1721 # Im f 
m‘l, 
respectively. Furthermore when imposing the first Mel’nikov condition one 
has to use that both w and W, differ from integers by terms of order E ,  so 
that wnf(;r, can be small for 1721 # Iml only if 1721 and Iml are large enough 
(of order l / ~ ) ,  
and as a consequence one can choose CO of order 1 (in E ) .  
Analogous considerations allow us to deal with also the second Mel’nikov 
conditions, again with a constant CO independent of E .

This work is a further development of the invariant theory of Killing tensors 
(ITKT). We consider the vector space of Killing tensors of valence three defined 
on the Euclidean plane and present a complete solution to the problem of the de- 
termination of a set of fundamental covariants of the vector space under the action 
of the isometry group.

1. Introduction 
The invariant theory of Killing tensors (ITKT) is essentially a pseudo- 
Riemannian analogue of the classical invariant theory (CIT) of homo- 
geneous polynomials (see Olver' for more details). Its main goal is to 
study vectors spaces of (generalized) Killing tensors defined on a pseudo- 
Riemannian manifold ( M ,  g) of constant curvature under the action of the 
corresponding isometry group. Much work has been done recently in de- 
veloping ITKT (see Refs. 2-6 and the relevant references therein). 
For a given vector space of (generalized) Killing tensors the first task 
in the study is the determination of a set of fundamental invariants (co- 
variants) of the space (or an extension), which have the property that any 
other invariant (covariant) is an analytic function of them. 
Various methods can be used to solve the problem of the determination 
of a set of fundamental invariants (covariants), including the methods of 
moving frames, infinitesimal generators and undetermined coefficients. In 
this paper we study from this viewpoint the vector space of Killing tensors 
of valence three defined in the Euclidean plane lE2. More specifically, we 
consider the action of the corresponding orientation-preserving isometry 
group I(E2) on the extension of the vector space by the underlying manifold 
and solve the problem outlined above. Our notations are compatible with 
those used in Refs. 3 and 7. 
2. Invariant theory of Killing tensors (ITKT) 
Let ( M ,  g) be an m-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold of constant 
curvature. 
Definition 2.1. A symmetric contravariant tensor K of valence p defined 
on ( M ,  g) is said to be a generalized Killing tensor (GKT) of order n iff 
[[. . . [K, g], g], . . . , g] = 0 (n + 1 brackets), 
where [ , ] denotes the Schouten bracket. 
It follows immediately from the R-bilinear properties of the Schouten 
bracket that GKTs of the same valence and order constitute a vector space. 
Moreover, the GKTs of order zero are the standard Killing tensors which 
play an important role in differential geometry as well as various branches 
of mathematical physics, including general relativity, classical mechanics 
and field theory. We note that GKTs defined in flat pseudo-Riemannian 

126 
manifolds were originally introduced by Nikitin and Prilipko' and success- 
fully employed in the study of evolution equations in field theory (see Ref. 9 
for more details and references). Let ICP,(M) be the vector space of GKTs 
of valence p and order n defined on ( M ,  g ) .  Given that pseudo-Riemannian 
manifolds of constant curvature are locally flat, the dimension d of ICP,(M), 
according to the Nzkitin-Prilzpko (NP) formula, is given by 
d = dim ICg(M) = - 
We immediately recognize that for n = 0 the formula (1) reduces to the 
Delong-Takeuchi-Thompson (DTT) formula (see Refs. 3 and 4 as well as 
references therein for more details). 
A general element of ICP,(M) is represented by d arbitrary parameters 
al, . . . , ad with respect to an appropriate basis. The isometry group I ( M )  
of ( M ,  g) induces a corresponding action on ICP,(M), which in turn induces 
an action on the parameter space CP, determined by al, . . . , ud. The same 
applies to the extended space ICP,(M) x M and the corresponding extended 
parameter space CP, x M defined by al,. . . ,ad, xl,. . . , xm, where x1 . . . , xm 
are local coordinates on M .  More specifically, the isometry group action 
on CP, x M is represented by the transformation laws 
iil = iil(ul, . . . ,a d
1
 
,g , . . . ,gr), 
iid = iid(al,. . . ,a d
1
 
,g , . . . ,gT), 
31 = 3c'(x', . . . ,xm,gl,. 
. . ,gT), 
3" - 
- z 
-m (XI,. . . ,xm,gl,. 
. . ,gT), 
where gl,. 
. . , gr are local coordinates that parametrize the group I ( M ) .  
Note that T = am(, + 1). The formulas (2) can be derived explicitly by 
employing the standard tensor transformation laws3. 
Definition 2.2. An I(M)-covariant of the extended space ICK(M) x M ,  
p 2 1, is an analytic function C : CP, x M -+ R satisfying the condition 
c = F(a', . . . , ad,xl,. 
. . ,xm) = ~ ( i i l ,  
. . . , i i d , 2 . .  . 
(3) 
under the transformation laws (2) induced by the isometry group I ( M )  
acting on M .  

127 
Similarly, an I(M)-invariant of ICg(M) is a function defined on Eg that 
remains unchanged under the action of the group. The following Funda- 
mental Theorem of a regular Lie group action’ is employed to determine 
the number of fundamental invariants (covariants). 
Theorem 2.1. Let G be a Lie group acting regularly on an m-dimensional 
manifold M with s-dimensional orbits. Then, in a neighbourhood N of 
each point xo E M, there exist m - s functionally independent G-invariants 
A,, . . . , Amps. Any other G-invariant Z defined near xo can be locally 
uniquely expressed as an analytic function of the fundamental invariants 
through Z = F(A1,. . . , Am-s). 
Quoting Peter Olver: “While invariants are of fundamental importance 
... by themselves they do not paint the entire picture.”l Indeed, if the 
isometry group in question is not compact it is likely impossible to solve 
the equivalence problem (i.e., distinguish between the orbits of the group 
action) by means of (fundamental) I(M)-invariants only. Just like in CIT, 
in our study one can also employ both I(M)-invariants and covariants to 
solve the equivalence problem. The concept of an I(M)-covariant of a vector 
space of standard Killing tensors was introduced in Ref. 5 and successfully 
employed to solve the problem of classification of the orthogonal coordinate 
webs defined in the Minkowski plane. 
In the following section we present a complete solution to the problem of 
the determination of the I(E2)-covariants of the extended space Ki(E2) xE2 
for the open submanifold of E: xE2 where the isometry group acts regularly. 
3. The main result 
It is well known that any Killing tensor defined on a pseudo-Riemannian 
space of constant curvature is expressible as a sum of symmetrized prod- 
ucts of Killing vectors. Thus, the three-dimensional vector space of Killing 
vectors KA(E2) admits a basis generated by the following Killing vectors 
given in terms of Cartesian coordinates x2, i = 1 , 2  
where eij denotes the Levi-Civita symbol. We note the commutation rela- 
tions 
[Xi, 
Xj] 
= 0, 
[Xi, 
R] 
= ~’iXj, 
( 5 )  

128 
for i , j  = 1,2. In view of (4), the elements of the vector space Kb(IE2) have 
the general form 
Ki = U i j k X i  @ xj @ Xk + 3bijXi @ xj @ R +  
@ R @  R 
where Ki and KA are the general forms of the elements of K2(IE2) and 
K1(IE2), respectively. It is easy to check that the parameters that appear 
in (6) constitute four algebraic quantities, namely a = uijk, b = bij, c = ci 
and e = e, i , j ,  k = 1,2, whose components represent the dimension of 
the vector space Kg(IE2). Clearly a, b and c represent S3(N), S2(N) and 
S'(N), where S'(N) denotes the space of symmetric ( ~ ~ 0 )  
tensors defined 
over a manifold N of dimension two. It follows immediately from (6) that 
the parameters bij,ci,e and ci,e represent the dimensions of Kz(lE2) and 
K,$(IE2) respectively. Hence, we conclude, taking into account the symme- 
tries of the algebraic quantities a and b, i.e. uijk = a(ijk), bij = b(Zj), that 
dim Kg(IE2) = 10, dim Kg(IE2) = 6 and dim K,$(IE2) = 3, as expected ac- 
cording to the NP formula (1). Next, we find the infinitesimal action of the 
isometry group I(IE2) in the space of parameters Eg N RIO determined by 
uajk, bij, ci and e that appear in (6). In view of the standard parametriza- 
tion of the isometry group I(IE2), the transformation from one system of 
Cartesian coordinates xi to another system ?a is given by xi = A i j 2  + bi, 
where Aij E S0(2), 6a E R2, i , j  = 1,2. Since I(IE2) acts on Kg(IE2) as an 
automorphism, the induced action of the group on Eg is found by compar- 
ing the formula for the generic Ki given by (6) with KO 
given with respect 
to the coordinates 22: 
- 3  . 
e = e, 
where pi = €jkA'abk. We observe that the induced action of I(E2) on Eg 
is a subgroup of GL(lO,R), which is consistent with the result of Theorem 
3.5 of Ref. 4. Using (7) and standard techniques from Lie group theory, we 

129 
derive the infinitesimal generators of the group action in E::

As expected from Theorem 3.5 of Ref. 4, the generators (8) satisfy the same 
commutator relations as the Killing vectors (4), namely 
[Ui, 
Uj] = 0, 
[Ui, V ]  = EJiUj, 
(9) 
for i , j  = 1,2. The problem of the determination of the I(E2)-covariants 
of the extended space Ici(E2) x E2 amounts now to solving the system of 
PDEs 
Ui(F) + X i ( F )  = 0, 
V ( F )  + R ( F )  = 0 
determined by the vector fields (4) and (8), where F : 
-+ R is an analytic 
f~nctionl>~. 
We note that the group I(IE2) 
does not act regularly, but we can 
investigate the generic case by restricting attention to the open (invariant) 
submanifold where the group acts regularly and with three-dimensional 
orbits. Applying Theorem 2.1 on this open submanifold, we expect to 
derive nine fundamental I(IE2)-covariants that determine the space of all 
of the covariants of the extended space Ici(E2) x E2. Solving the system 
of PDEs by the method of undetermined coeficients (see Ref. 6 for more 
details), we arrive at the following result. 
Theorem 3.1. Let Ki(E2) x E2 be the eztended vector space of Ici(IE2). 
Any algebraic I(IE2)-covariant C defined over the open submanifold of I$ x 
E2 where the isometry group I(E2) acts freely and regularly with three- 
dimensional orbits can be locally uniquely expressed as an analytic function

Corollary 3.1. Any algebraic I(IE2)-invariantZ of the vector space IC2(IE2) 
defined over the open submanifold of E; where the isometry group I(IE2) 
acts freely and regularly with three-dimensional orbits can be locally uniquely 
expressed as an analytic functionZ = F(A1, Az, A3, A4, As, As, A7), where 
the fundamental I@')-invariants Ai, i = 1,. . . , 7 are given by the formulas 
(10). 
Corollary 3.2. Let Ki(IE2) x IE2 be the extended vector space of Kg(IE2). 
Any algebraic I(E2)-covariant C defined over the open submanifold of 
x IE2 where the isometry group I(IE2) acts freely and regularly with three- 
dimensional orbits can be locally uniquely expressed as an analytic func- 
tion C = F(A1, A2, A3, A,, As), where the fundamental I(IE2)-covariants 
A,, A,, A3, A, and A9 are given by the formulas (10). 
Proof. The result follows immediately from Theorem 2.1, the formulas (6) 
and (10). Note that here we have assumed the general element of ICg(IE2) 
0 
is written: @, = 3bijXi 0 
X j  +3ciXi 0 
R + e R  0 
R. 

131 
We note that the result of Corollary 3.2 is compatible with the corre- 
sponding result obtained in Ref. 5 by making use of the method of moving 
frames. 
4. Conclusions 
The results exhibited in the previous section constitute the first step in a 
comprehensive study of the vector space Icg(lE2), ultimately leading to a 
complete classification of its elements by I@’)-invariants and covariants. 
This has been done by determining reduced I@’)-invariants of Icg(lE2), 
which are the I(lE’)-invariants on the invariant submanifolds where the 
group orbits degenerate (i.e. are maximal). These results will be published 
elsewhere.

GLOBAL GEOMETRY OF 3-BODY TRAJECTORIES WITH 
VANISHING A N G U L A R  MOMENTUM

Let m = (ml,m2,m3) be the percentages of masses of a given 3-body 
system (thus having C mi = 1) and {al, a 2 ,  a3) be the triple of position vec- 
tors of its three particles. Fully utilizing the translation symmetry and the 
conservation of linear momentum, we shall always assume that C mzai = 0 
and call such a triple {ai} an m-triangle. The classical 3-body problem of 
celestial mechanics studies the global geometry of those trajectories of such 
m-triangles under the gravitation-force, which can be concisely represented 
by the Newtonian potential function 
Such trajectories are locally characterized by the Newton’s equation: 
Note that most problems in classical mechanics study the correlations be- 
tween “initial conditions” and “global geometric behaviors”, while the fol- 
lowing “boundary value problem” is certainly one of the simplest and also 
the most basic type of global geometric problem on trajectories, namely, 
for a given pair of points {P,Q} in the configuration space M ,  what are 
those trajectories going from P to Q? Inspired by the Fermat’s principle 
of least time of geometric optics, a kind of least action principle for classi- 
cal mechanics was proposed by Leibniz, Euler, Maupertuis and Lagrange, 
to characterize the above trajectories. The following precise mathematical 
formulation was due to Lagrange: 
Lagrange’s Least Action Principle: The solutions of the above bound- 
ary value problem are characterized by the extremality of the following

133 
action integral 
J1[7] = s, T d t ,  T = kinetic energy 
(3) 
among those virtual motions with the given pair of terminal points and the 
same constant of total energy. 
In 1840, again inspired by results in geometric optics, Hamilton formu- 
lated another least action principle, namely 
Hamilton’s Least Action Principle: The solutions of the above bound- 
ary value problem are characterized by the extremality of 
&[y] = 
(T + U)dt, (often written as 
Ldt) 
(4) 
s, 
I 
among those virtual motions with the given pair of terminal points and the 
same time interval. 
1. Jacobi’s reformulation of Lagrange’s least action 
principle, a profound geometrization of mechanics 
Jacobi first took the important step of introducing the concept of kinematic 
metric on the configuration space, namely, defining the metric ds2 in terms 
of the kinetic energy T by setting 
(p: total mass) 
( 5 )  
2T 
P 
ds2 = -dt2 
For example, in the case of an n-body system 
where mi (resp. (xi, 
yi, zi)) is the “percentage of mass” (resp. the Carte- 
sian coordinates) of the i-th particle. He then proceeded to reformulate 
Lagrange’s least action principle which amounts to a profound geometriza- 
tion of mechanics. Let U be the potential function. For each given constant 
of total energy h, set 
M(U,h) = {x E M ;  h + U(Z) > o}, 
d s i  = (h t U)ds2 
(7) 
Then 
dSh = d m d s  = a d s  

1 34 
Therefore, just in one stroke, Jacobi succeeded to transform the Lagrange’s 
least action principle into a simple geometric statement, namely, trajectories 
of a given h as its total energy are exactly those geodesic curves in the 
metric space (M(u,h), 
d s i )  of (7). Jacobi’s remarkable reformulation not 
only accomplished a complete geometrization of classical mechanics, but 
also initiated a new topic of geometric study of fundamental importance, 
namely, the study of global geometry of geodesics in certain metric spaces 
which is, nowadays, called Riemannian manifolds, while the study of this 
topic is often called the Morse theory of geodesics. The Jacobi equation 
along a geodesic curve remains to be the fundamental equation for analyzing 
the global geometry of geodesics. 
2. Conservation of angular momentum and the orbital 
geometry of ( S 0 ( 3 ) ,  M )  
The rotation group SO(3) acts isometrically on (M,ds2), and also on 
(M(u,h), 
d s i )  provided that U is SO(3)-invariant. Therefore, the orbital 
geometry of (S0(3), M )  plays an important role in both classical and quan- 
tum mechanics. 
(1) Tangential part: Let {e,, a = 1,2,3} be a chosen coordinate frame, 
S0(2), be the rotation subgroup with e, as the axis and K, be the Killing 
vector field generated by S0(2),. Then, along a given trajectory y 
<K,(y),+>= 
Cmi(e, x ai) . a i  = Ernie,. (ai x ai) = e, . R  
(9) 
where R = Cmiai x & is the angular momentum. Therefore, the conser- 
vation of angular momentum is just the Noether theorem which proves the 
constancy of < K ( y ) ,  +>. In the special case of vanishing angular momen- 
tum, the geodesic curve y is always perpendicular to the SO(3)-orbits. 
(2) Normal part: The normal part of the SO(3)-orbital geometry can be 
concisely organized into an induced metrics on the orbit space M/S0(3) 
(resp. M(u,h)/S0(3)) 
which measures the infinitesimal distances between 
nearby orbits, called the orbital distance metric. In the case of a 3-body 
system the orbit space % is exactly the moduli space of congruence classes 
of m-triangles, while ds2 provides a natural measurement of their differences 
in sizes and shapes. 
(3) The phase (i.e. connection) structure: Note that the lifting of a 
given closed curve in 
to a virtual motion with R = 0 (i.e. perpendicular 
to orbits) is, in general, no longer closed. This phenomenon is measured 

135 
by the kinematic phase (i.e. connection) structure whose understanding 
will play an important role in fully utilizing the conservation of angular 
momentum. 
3. Kinematic geometry of rn-triangles 
The following is essentially a summary of some of the results of two unpub- 
lished papers [Hsi-11' [H-SI3 on the kinematic geometry of m-triangles: 
(1) Basic invariants and basic formulas: An m-triangle is a triangle 
with a center (i.e. of gravity) fixed at the origin, which subdivides it into 
a triple of subtriangles. Set Ij (resp. Tj, 0,) to be the individual moment 
of inertia (resp. kinetic energy, angular momentum) and aj (resp. Aj) to 
be the centrial angles (resp. areas) of the subtriangles. Then, the classical 
Ceva theorem asserts that Aj = mjA and it is useful to retool the usual 
trigonometry into the following Ceva-type trigonometry, namely 
Ceva sine law:

Ceva Heron formula: 
Lemma 3.1. Suppose that x = {aj} is non-degenerate ( i e .  Q # 0). 
Set A0 2 A1 2 A2 to be the eigenvalues of (h@(x)), ha@(.) 
=< 
K"(x), K@(x)>. Then 
(13) 
Corollary 3.1. A1 = A2 when and only when x attains the maximal area 
among m-triangles with the same I. 
Lemma 3.2. Let w j  be the angular velocity of aj of a planary virtual mo- 
tion with 0 = 0. Then

Lemma 3.3. Set p = J? and M' 
to be the subspace of 
setting I = 1, da2 = ds2 I M * .  
Then

dS2 = dp2 + p2da2 (i.e. 
is the Riemannian cone of M')

(2) Basic Theorems on kinematic geomery of m-triangles: 
T h e o r e m  3.1. (Kinematic Gauss-Bonnet formula) Suppose that the shape 
curve y* of a virtual motion y with 0 = 0 constitutes the boundary of a 
domain D in M * .  Then l,

(19) 
T h e o r e m  3.3. Let bjk be the point representing the shape of ( j ,  k)-binary 
collision and 6* be a given point in M'. Set oi (resp. si) to be the distance 
between 6* and bjk in M *  (resp. the side-length of 6' 
opposite of the i-th 
vertex) and 
to be the distance between baj and bik in M'. Then 
Corollary 3.3. The poles relative to the equator of degenerate m-triangles 
(i.e. with A = 0 )  is given by ua = 2 (i.e. Ii = f ( l  - mi)), i = 1,2,3, 
which has the maximal area under the constraint of I = 1. 
It is convenient to identify M' with S2(1) by a magnification of factor 
2, thus representing points of M* by unit vectors. 

137 
Corollary 3.4. Let bi (resp. p) be the unit vector representing b j k  (resp. 
a given shape of m-triangle). Then 
4. Shape curves, cone surfaces and the geodesic equation of 
(M(U,h) 
7 ds;) 
Let y ( t )  be a trajectory with R = 0, y(t) be its image curve under the 
orbital projection p : M -+ m 
and y*(t) be the image curve of y(t) under 
the radial projection of %= cone of M* onto M*. Geometrically, ?(t) (resp. 
y*(t)) records the changing of both the sizes and shapes (resp. the shapes 
only). We shall call the former (resp. latter) the associated moduli (resp. 
shape) curve of y. 
It follows readily from the geometric meaning of R = 0 that y ( t )  is 
uniquely determined by y(t) up to a global motion of S 0 ( 3 ) ,  while y(t) 
is characterized by the geodesic equation of ( % ( ~ , h ) ,  ds;). Therefore, the 
study of global geometry of trajectories with R = 0 can be completely re- 
duced to that of the geodesics (namely, the Morse theory) on ( p ( ~ , h ) ,  
ds:), 
which is a conformal modification of (x, 
ds2) by the factor of h + U .  
Note that (m,di?) is a Riemannian cone of (M*,da2), while 
(M*,da2) 2 S2(a) (cf. Theorem 3.2). It is advantageous to introduce 
the cone-surface construction to facilitate the usage of the above geometric 
simplicity, thus further reducing the global geometric study to that of the 
shape curve y*. 
Definition 4.1. The associated cone surface of 7 is defined to be the cone 
over y* c M*, consisting of all those rays passing through y*(t), namely, 
- 
C(Y) = C(Y*) = {Oy*(t)). 
Set a to be the arclength parameter of y* and .(a) to be the value of 
U at ?*(a). 
Then (p,a) can be regarded as a polar coordinate system of 
C(y*), while the restriction metric on C(y*) is given by 
dS2 = h + - 
(dp2 + p2da2) 
( “”) 

138 
Theorem 4.1. The geodesic equation of (z(u,h), 
dg:) is given by 
where Q is the angle between 
the unit normal (resp. geodesic curvature) of y* in M'. 
Remarks: (i) The first ODE is just the geodesic equation of C(y*), while 
the second ODE means the normal sectional curvature of 7 c C(y*) is 
always zero. 
(ii) Note that both y(t) and y*(t) are originally given in terms of time, 
while the above ODE'S are in terms of the arclength parameter s. However, 
they are simply related by 2 = fl= Jm. 
Moreover 
and the tangent of 7, and u (resp. K * )  is 
and it follows readily from (23)2 that 
p3 = --u*/ 
I d  
dy* 
IE* 
2 du 
(25) 
thus providing a simple formula to reconstruct y(t) from the local geometric 
invariants of y* and &U*. 
Theorem 4.2. A 3-body trajectory y ( t )  with Cl = 0 and a given total energy 
h is uniquely determined up to congruence by the subset {y*(t)} (i.e. non- 
parametrized shape curve) and the initial speed 
5. Formula of VU* and a monotonicity theorem 
Set ki = 2(mjmk)$(l - mi)-i and Pi to be given by (20)3, 
Then, it follows from (21) that 
vu* = UT = u - (u. p)p, p E S 2 ( 1 )  
(27) 

139 
Corollary 5.1. Let po (resp. pb) be a minimal point of U*. Then {PO, pb} 
represent the pair of equilateral m-triangles with I = 1 and opposite orien- 
tations. Moreover 
Lemma 5.1. For a unit vector p other than {pa, pb}, set 
V(P) = P x [(P - Po) x (P - Pb)l 
(29) 
Then 
Corollary 5.2. u(p) . (p - pa) is always strictly positive for any p other 
than {Po, Pb) 
Note that the pair of minimal points {pa, pb} are no longer situated at 
the poles { N , S }  in the case of non-uniform mass distribution. However, 
there exists a unique Mobious transformation r which maps po to N ,  pb 
to S and the equator of degenerate shapes to itself. 
Definition 5.1. For a given m = (rnl,mn,ms), the m-modified latitude of 
p E S2(1) is defined to be the latitude of r(p) in radian. 
Theorem 5.1. Let y*(t), a 5 t 5 b, be a segment of the associated shape 
curue of a 3-body trajectory with R = 0, A,*(t) be the function record- 
ing the m-modified latitudes along y*[a, b]. Suppose that a < to < b is a 
critical point of A,* 
(i.e. A$ (to) = 0). Then A,* 
(to) must be a local maxi- 
mum (resp. minimum) when y*(to) is situated inside of the northern (resp. 
southern) hemisphere. 
[We refer to [Hsi-2I2 for the proofs of all the above results.] 
6. Some problems on global geometry of geodesics in 
(M(U,h) 
7 da;) 
The above discussion shows that the study of global geometry of 3-body 
trajectories with R = 0 can be completely reduced to that of geodesics of 
( = ( ~ , h ) ,  d S i )  which can be further reduced to that of the shape curves. We 
mention here some natural problems of such an approach in the following: 

140 
Problem 1: The existence (resp. uniqueness) problem on the shortest path 
in (x(u,h), 
ds;) linking a given point P to the base point 0. 
Problem 2: Let S be the set of those shortest geodesic segments in 
(ZTu,o), 
ds;) (i.e. h = 0) between p 6 F (eclipses) and 0, and S* be 
their associated shape curves. Is it true that S* covers MT \ {PO} simply? 
Problem 3: Let xo be a generic point of b%h, 
h = -1, and yzo be the 
geodesic curve starting at XO. How to provide simple and useful lower bound 
estimate of the distance between xo and the first focal point in terms of the 
geometric invariants of XO? 
Problem 4: Is it true that a 3-body trajectory with a closed non- 
parametrized shape curve necessarily periodic? 
Is a periodic trajec- 
tory already uniquely determined up t o  congruence by its associated non- 
parametrized shape curve? 
Problem 5: What is the minimal number of eclipse points on a closed 
shape curve (resp. periodic trajectory) ? Moreover, is any even number at 
least equal to the minimal number can be realized as such a number? 
Problem 6: What are those homotopy classes of closed curves in M* \ 
{bl, bz, b3) that can be represented by closed shape curves (resp. periodic 
trajectories) ? 
Definition 6.1. Let y* be the non-parametrized shape curve of a complete 
trajectory r[-m,m] with R = 0, and D(y*) be the closure of y*. We 
propose to define the area of D(y*) to be the chaoticity of y. 
Problem 7: What are the non-chaotic (i.e. 
trajectories other than those with closed non-parametrized shape curve? 
Problem 8: What are the realizable values of chaoticity? 
with zero area of D(y*))

THE RELATION BETWEEN THE TOPOLOGICAL 
STRUCTURE OF THE SET OF CONTROLLABLE AFFINE 
SYSTEMS AND TOPOLOGICAL STRUCTURES OF THE 
SET OF CONTROLLABLE HOMOGENUOUS SYSTEMS 
IN LOW DIMENSION 
ABDELOUAHABKADEM

In this paper, we establish the existence of a relation between the topological 
structures of the set of controllable affine systems denoted by C, 
and topological 
structures of the set of controllable homogeneous systems Ch. We consider the 
following affine system 
(1) 
X= AX + u(Dx + b) 
{ x E R 2 , b E R 2 ,  U E R .  
where u is a piecewise constant control with values in the subset 0 of R, bounded 
or not; A and D are two real 2 x 2 matrices. To (1) we associate the homogeneous 
system 
X= ( A  + uD)x 
It is known that if (2) is controllable in R2 - ( 0 )  and (1) has not a fixed point, 
then (1) is completely controllable in R2 z. It turns out that in certain cases (1) 
can be controllable but (2) is not controllable, but that these cases are marginal. 
The set of such pairs is the boundary of the set of controllable pairs, the interior 
being constituted by pairs for which (2) is controllable. It is also known on the 
one hand that the set C h  is connected and its boundary present two types of 
boundary points, on the other hand the set C, is connected. The question is: can 
one establish a relation between the boundary of C, and the one of Ch ?

1. Preliminaries and examples 
In this work we establish a relationship between the topological structures 
of the set of the controllable afine systems that we will note C, and the 
set of controllable homogeneous systems noted ch. 
141 

1 42 
We consider the affine system 
X= AX + U(DZ + b) 
X E R ' , ~ E R ' ,  
U E R .  
and the homogeneous system 
according to the technique of extensions 
instead of studying (l), we are 
going to study the finite family (A,f(D + b)), which is equivalent to (1) 
from the controllability point of view. We will therefore identify a system 
by the triplet (A, D, b) element of RIO provided with its usual topology. 
It is known that if (2) is controllable on R2 - (0) and (1) has not a fixed 
point, then (1) is completely controllable on R2 2. 
These systems, which are denoted by 9, form an open set in RIO and 
form also an open subset of the set of controllable affine systems; let us re- 
mind however that this last one is not open, i.e. that generally controllable 
affine systems do not remain such under the influence of arbitrarily small 
perturbat ions. 
It seems 
that in some given cases (1) can be controllable unless the 
system (2) be it also, but these cases are marginal. 
In RlO, the set of such pairs is the border of the set of the controllable 
pairs, the interior being constituted by pairs for which (2) is controllable. 
One can surmise that this result is true in general for the affine systems. 
We know on the one hand that the set of the controllable homogeneous 
systems is connected and its border presents two types of boundary points 
such as the border of its outside and the inside of its closing3; on the other 
hand, the set of affine controllable systems C, is connected '. 
In this work we establish a topological relationship between ch and c,. 
As motivation one is going to give some examples of the set of the 
controllable affine systems, or not controllable, having their part on the 
border of ch, but previously let us give a result of controllability. 
1.1. Proposition 
Let C be a trajectory of &(D + b); the affine system (1) is controllable 
on R2 if and only if the vector field A points to each of the two regions 
determined by the curve C. 

143 
1.2. Example: 
Consider 
A =  [ii] , D =  
; b = ( b l , b 2 )  , b 2 > 0 .  
Let z(t) be a point of a trajectory C. The tangent vector to C at z(t) is 
Dz(t) + b; an orthogonal vector to this one is J ( D z  + b), where 
the affine system (1) is controllable on R2 if and only if the expression 
< A(z(t), J(Dz(t) + b) > changes sign for t E R. 
In fact the trajectories of (D + b) are parabolas, their common axis is 
a straight line passing via the point (O,--bl), and parallel to the abscissas 
axis, their concavity is directed towards positive abscissas. 
All the trajectories of *(D + b) cross the abscissas axis; let (zo, 0) be a 
point of the abscissas axis and C is the trajectory of f(D + b) passing via 
this point. The equations of C are (t E R): 
q ( t )  = (b2/2)t2 + blt + 5 0  
{ q ( t )  = bat ; 
an orthogonal vector at s(t) E C is Dz(t) + b and has components 
An orthogonal vector to this one is T'(t) = J ( D  + b); it has as compo- 
nents (-b2, b2t + bl). The scalar product of 2 ( t )  and the vector Az(t) is 
equal to f(t) = -$tZ - blbzt - b2zo. 
The quantity A = bg(b? -2bzzo) can be made negative by a good choice 
of zo, and f(t) doesn't change sign; which means that the affine system (1) 
is not controllable on R2. 
As for the homogeneous system (2), it is not controllable on R2 - (0): 
as a matter of fact b = 0 means geometrically that the fields A and D have 
a proper axis in common; that is one has an invariant zone. 
(bat + bl, b2) 
1.3. Example: 
Let consider A = [ik] , D =  
, b =  (b1,b2), b 2 f O .  
To study the controllability of theaffine system (1) one is going to study 
the intersection of the trajectories of f(D + b) and the curve defined by 
< J ( D z  + b), Az >= 0. Actually the trajectories of f(D + b) which have 

144 
as equation: X I  = x:eXlt and 2 2  = b2t + x8. The trajectories of f(D + b) 
consist of (i) the ordinate axis; (ii) logarithmic curves with the ordinate 
axis as an asymptote. 
We have A’ = 0 and < J ( D  + b ) , A x  >= -b2x2. As each trajectory of 
f(D + b) cross the abscissa axis, the affine system (1) is controllable on R2. 
As for the homogeneous system (2), it is not controllable on R2 - (0): 
in fact bc = 0 means geometrically that the fields A and D have common 
proper axis; that is one has an invariant zone. 
So, we gave two examples of non controllable homogeneous systems 
leading to either a not controllable affine system (example l), or to a con- 
trollable affine system (example 2). 
2. The study of the boundary of the set of the controllable 
affine systems C ,  
The border of C, is constituted solely of affine systems having their homo- 
geneous parts at the border of Ch (i.e. the non controllable homogeneous 
systems). 
Let’s remind that the border of C, contains as well the controllable 
affine systems as not controllable affine systems; one can wonder to what 
type of border these systems belong knowing the type of border on which 
their homogeneous part is. 
Contrarily to what one would expect, three types of borders because 
C, is not an opened 
it appears in this border only two types of frontier 
points, which are: 
bl = FrC, = FrEzt(C,) where contains a controllable affine systems or 
not controllable; 
62 = FrC, n I n t c  which contains a not controllable affine systems for 
which the trajectories of D are cycles. 
Let us note that in both cases the corresponding homogeneous systems 
are of types Frl of ch ’. 
The inside of C, is constituted: (i) on the one hand of affine control- 
lable systems whose homogeneous part is controllable, i.e. systems S ;  (ii) 
on the other hand of affine controllable systems to which correspond non- 
controllable homogeneous system characterized by collinear fields (bounded 
spirals). 
Outside C, one finds the not controllable affine systems to which corre- 
spond homogeneous systems belonging to the outside of ch. 

145 
Finally, the set of affine controllable systems C, is described as being the 
disjoint union of (i) 9; (ii) the set of affine controllable systems belonging to 
the border of C,; 
and (iii) of system whose homogeneous part is constituted 
of bounded spirals. 
These last two parts being of empty interior, one deduces that systems 
9 are dense in C,. 
One will find in the table given in appendix all cases of border points 
of ch, to which correspond different situations of affine systems. 
In all these cases the homogeneous system is not controllable. 
2.1. Commentaries 
Among the homogeneous systems belonging to the border of ch one ob- 
serves three possible behaviors with regards to the passage to affine systems. 
These three behaviors correspond to different properties of the homo- 
geneous system (A, fD) 
of the start. 
These three types of systems are: 
- Systems of ”affine controllability ” i.e. for which Vb E R2-{O}, (A, f(D+ 
b)) is controllable; these systems are characterized by the adherence of the 
homogeneous system to the inside of the closing of ch. 
- ”Ordinary” systems, i.e. for which it 3 b E R2 - (0); these systems are 
characterized by the adherence of the homogeneous system to the border 
of the outside of ch and D singular. 
- Systems of ”affine non controllability” i.e. Vb E R2 - { 0 } ,  (A, f(D + b)) 
is not controllable; these systems are characterized by the adherence of the 
homogeneous system to the border of the outside of ch and regular D. 
3. Study of border cases 
Lemma 3.1. Let be the homogeneous system (A, fD) 
E F?-(EZt(Ch)) then

Proof. We have 
Then ( A ,  fD)

where 
UI = {(A’, fD’)

Moreover, 
V1 = {(A’, fD’) 
/ A(D’) > 0, [(A‘, Do2 - A(A’).A(D’) < 0} ‘. 
u(1) and v(1) are open subsets, u1 C ch, and v1 C Ext(Ch). 
Let us denote Ui = U1 n {(A’, fD’) 
invertible} x R2 - ( 0 ) .  Then Ui is 
open set of controllable systems in C,. In fact {(A’, fD’)invertible} is an 
open set (dense), the intersection with U1 is so open; furthermore Ui c C,, 
because any system belonging to Ui has controllable homogeneous part and 
has no fixed point, {(A’, 3 3 ’ )  invertible and b # 0 )  by application of the 
theorem of Jurdjevic-Sallet. 
Also V{ = V1 x R2 - ( 0 )  form an open set of not controllable system. 
Finally, by construction Ui = U1 x R2 and Vi = vl x R2, so (A, f(D +

Let us remind that so that one has controllability of the homogeneous 
system ( 2 ) on R2 - ( 0 )  it is necessary that the following 3 conditions 
are satisfied: (i) rank condition (i.e. that fields A and D are free); (ii) 
radial controllability (i.e. existence of incoming directions and outgoing 
directions); (iii) directional controllability. 
So, (A, fD) 
E Fr(Ezt(Ch)) is equivalent to A ( D )  2 0 and [ ( A ,  D)2 - 
A(A).A(D) = 0; these is turn are equivalent to stating that system (A, H I )  
does not verify the directional controllability condition (i.e. (A, *D) is not 
controllable in R2 - ( 0 ) )  ’. 
One arrives by generic perturbations at: 
{(A’, fD’) 
/ A(D’) 2 0, [(A’, D’)2 - A(A’).A(D’) # 0 }  ; 
let 
U1 = {(A’, 3 0 )  / A(D’) > 0, [(A’, D’)2 - A(A‘).A(D’) > 0} 
V1 = {(A’, +to’) / A(D’) > 0, [(A’, D’)2 - A(A’).A(D’) < 0 }  ‘ 
U1 and V1 are open sets, then (A,fD)

U1 = {(A’, &to’) / A(D’) 2 0, [(A’, D’)2 - A(A’).A(D’) 2 0} 
V1 = {(A’,&D’) / A(D’) 2 0,[(A’,D’)2 - A(A’).A(D’) 5 0 }  .

u1 is an open subset of ch , and v1 is an open subset of Ext(Ch) ’. 
Let us denote Ui = Uln{(A’, fD’)

of controllable systems in C, , In fact {(A’, fD’)invertible} is an open set 
(dense) the intersection with U1 is so open; furthermore Ui c C,, because 
any system belonging to Ui has the controllable homogeneous part and has

no fixed point, (A’, 4zD‘)inwertible and b # 0 by application of the theorem 
of Jurdjevic-Sallet. 
Also Vi = Vl x R2 - ( 0 )  form one open set of not controllable system.

Lemma 3.2. Consider the homogeneous system ( A , f D )  E (Fr(Ch) -

4. Main result 
Theorem 4.1. The set of controllable afine systems verify the following 
three properties: 
i) C, = S U K U K’ (disjoint). 
ii) Int(Ca) = S u K‘. 
zzz) Fr(C,) = Fr(Ezt(C,)) u (FT(C,) - Fr(Ga)) (disjoint). 
Here K denotes the set of controllable affine systems and of not con- 
trollable ones (to which corresponds homogeneous systems belonging to 
border outside ch), and K’ the set of controllable affine systems to which 
corresponds homogeneous system characterized by the bounded spirals. 
Proof. 
i) Immediate. 
ii) Int(Ca) = S U K’; as a matter of fact: a) S U K’ c Int(C,) because 
S c Int(C,) as S is open; K’ c Int(C,) by lemma 2. This implies that 
S U K’ c Int(Ca); b) Int(C,) c S U K’, because according to i), C, =

5. Conclusion 
Thus, by this study one got a satisfactory description of the set of affine 
controllable systems C, in dimension 2. It appeared a very strong relations 
between the topological structures of the set of affine controllable systems 
C, and of ch. 
In particular, the properties of FT(C,) and the connectedness of C, 
results directly from analogous properties for ch. The result that one ob- 
tained is that on the one hand C, makes appear two types of border points 
- while it could have had a priori three types of border points. 
The inside of its closing contains affine non controllable systems for 
which trajectories are cycles, the remaining cases are on the border of its 
outside; on the other hand the inside of C, is constituted solely of systems 
9 and affine controllable systems to which correspond the non controllable 
homogeneous systems characterized by collinear fields (bounded spirals). 
As far as applications are concerned, the most important result is the 
fact that 9 is a open and dense in C,. So, when modelling a controllable 
system by an affine system of type (l), one will be able to confine oneself 
to a system in 9. 
One can suppose that as in R2, the controllability of an affine system 
is nearly equivalent to the controllability of its homogeneous part. The 
central problem would therefore be the controllability of bilinear systems 
in R". 
It would be interesting to know how to establish in R" results analogous 
to those obtained in dimension 2 between sets C, 
and ch. 
Although one doesn't know how to describe ch, one can nevertheless 
put this problem. It is presumably a problem of method that puts itself 
since it doesn't seem reasonable to describe of in an exhaustive way Ch and 
a fortiori C,. 
The choice of adequate mathematical tools to demonstrate this conjec- 
ture remains an open problem.

ON PRESERVATION OF ACTION VARIABLES FOR 
SATELLITE LIBRATIONS IN ELLIPTIC ORBIT WITH 
ACCOUNT OF SOLAR LIGHT PRESSURE*

Planar librations of a satellite, with its mass center moving in the elliptic orbit, 
are considered. The force of Solar light pressure is assumed to act on the satellite 
besides the gravitational one. The rotation of a dynamically symmetrical satellite 
is examined as an unperturbed one. Direct application of the KAM-theorem is 
impossible because Hamilton’s function has only two continuous derivatives. The 
existence of invariant tori and the preservation of action variables near their initial 
values are proven through the reduction of the perturbed Hamiltonian system to 
the sequence of symplectic maps, and with the help of Moser’s theorem on invariant 
curves. Analysis of the limit case when the orbit eccentricity e is close to one is 
carried out. The order of perturbation in this case is supposed t o  be fixed. It turns 
that in this case the action variables also conserve their values for asymptotically 
large time intervals. 
1. Equations of motion 
Librations of an asymmetrical satellite in the plane of the elliptic orbit’ are 
examined. Orbital motion is considered as a given one. The light source, 
i. e. the Sun, is considered as a point at infinity, so that the luminous flux 
has the same direction at all points of the orbit. Using known expression for 
the torque of the forces of light p r e ~ s u r e ~ > ~  
the equations of planar librations 
of a satellite can be presented in the form4 
6 = cf(6) - p [ 1 +  e cos 4t)13 sin(6 - 2 4 t )  + 291,

Here the angle 6 defines the orientation of the satellite with respect to an 
inertial coordinate system, v(t). is the true anomaly, a known function of 
time, c is a constant embodying the reflecting properties of the spacecraft 
outer surface, 9 is the azimuth of the light source position. The values of 
e, p, c, 
are parameters of the problem, and the value of p characterizes 
the dynamic asymmetry of the satellite. We assume that 0 5 e 5 1. 
The contribution of the light pressure is given by the function 
f E CYR) 
1 - cosx for sin 2 0 
-1 + cosz for sing < 0 ' 
The obtained mechanical system having 3/2 degrees of freedom is de- 
fined by the kinetic energy 
T(&) 
= &2/2, 
and by the force function 
V(6, t) = U(S, v(t)) = CF(S) + p[1+ e cosv(t)13 cos(6 - 2v(t) + 29). 
Here cF(6) is the force function of the light pressure torque which is simply 
the antiderivative of cf (6). 
The nonautonomous second order ODE (1) can be represented in the 
form of an autonomous system of the third order by adding a differential 
equation for the true anomaly. Finally Eq. (1) can be represented as an 
autonomous Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. Indeed, 
assume q1 = 6, q2 = v, p l  = 6. The second generalized impulse p2 is 
defined as an additional variable, canonically conjugated to 42 = v. In this 
case Hamilton's function has to take the form 
H (41, q 2 , ~ 1 , ~ 2 )  
= ~ 1 / 2  
- u (41, q2) + (1 + e c0sq2)~ 
132. 
q i  = Hp,, pi = -Hpi (2 = 1,2).

The system of differential equations of motion takes the canonical form 
Let us examine the case where the parameter of dynamic asymmetry 
is small enough, p << 1. In the case of dynamic symmetry the satellite 
performs an unperturbed rotational motion under the action of the light 
pressure forces (LPF) only. Thus, the Hamilton function of the perturbed 
problem can be represented in the form 
H ( q , p )  = HO(4,P) + PHl(q). 
Here 
HO(4,P) = PT/2 - cF(q1) + (1 + ecosq2)2P2, 
pHl(q) = -p (1 + e cos q2)3 cos (41 - 242 + 29) . 

153 
2. Action-angle variables 
The unperturbed Hamilton function allows separation of variables. It is 
possible to present it in the form 
Ho(q,p) = H O l  (q1,pd + H02 (42rP2). 
Here Hol(q,p) = p2/2 - cF(q), Hoz(q,p) = (1 + ecosd2p. 
The planar attitude dynamics of a satellite under the action of LPF 
was investigated by Karymov2. However in analizing phase portrait of 
corresponding mechanical system he did not pointed out that in contrast, 
for example, to the pendulum case, the unstable equilibrium is a degenerate 
saddle and the separatrix is tangent to X-axis, see Figure 1. Detailed 
study of this problem, which corresponds to the canonical system with the 
Hamiltonian HOl(q,p), is performed by the author5. The corresponding 
phase portrait is presented in Figure 1. 
Let us examine the formulae for the evolution of the action-angle vari- 
ables for librations. The case of rotations is evident enough and we omit its 
investigation for brevity. The value of the energy integral hl = H O ~  
(q1,pl) 
is equal to zero on the separatrix. In the region of librations we have 
-27rc < hl < 0, while in the region of rotations the inequality 0 < hl < +m 
holds. 
Figure 1. Phase portrait of the system with an account the light pressure only. 
According to the general guideline8 and due to the symmetry property 
of integral curves in case of librations, action variable can be calculated by 
the formula 

154 
where qlrnin is a root of the equation cF(q) + hl = 0 and, hence, is an 
implicit function of hl and c. Then the variable I1 is a function of hl and 
To calculate the angular variable w1 consider the general procedure for 
constructing the action-angle variables. For this purpose let us use the 
generating function V, (41, Il), satisfying the Hamilton-Jacobi equation 
C. 
Here dependence of Vl (q1,Il) on action variable 11 is ensured in the 
form of composite function, by the implicit function hl (Il), defined in 
turn by equation (4). The canonical map ( ~ 1 ~ 1 1 )  
H 
(q1,pl) is defined via 
equations 
Pl = (Vdql , w1 = (Vl)I, ‘ 
Let us now determine the dependence between the coordinates q1 and 
w1. Along the solution the variable zu1 grows monotonically. Hence in both 
cases of librations and rotations the function w1 H q1 (w1) is one-valued. 
In case of librations the inverse correspondence q1 H 
wl(q1) is not uniquely 
defined. For future reference we should know how to calculate the function 
Using dependencies pl = 41 = li1. dql/dwl = (hl),, .dql/dwl = (Il)ill. 
41 (Wd. 
dql/dwl one can easily obtain from ( 5 )  the ODE 
From (6) we conclude that w1 E R is a variable uniformizing the curve 
in the plane of two variables (u, 
v). The curve is defined by the equation 
v2 - 2 ((11),1)2 (cF(u) + h,) = 0 
(7) 
so that u’ (w1) = v (w1) 
and the map w1 H (u 
(wl), u’ 
(w1)) is a surjection 
of R to the set of points of the curve (7). It is easy to see, by virtue of (6), 
that if Aq1 = 47r, then Awl = 27~. 
The differential equation (6) defines the variable w1 up to an additive 
constant. In case of librations, when an ambiguity occurs assume w1 = 2 k ~ ,  
k E Z at the lowest point of the librations contour: 
ql(2kr) = 2 r ,  Pl(2kT) = minw,~Rpl (w1). 
Then at the upper point of this contour one has 
41((2k + 1 ) ~ )  
= 27~, 
~ 1 ( ( 2 k  + 1 ) ~ )  
= maxw,ERm ( w d  

155 
Thus in view of the symmetry of the problem we obtain 
41 ((2k + 1/2) n) = minzul€R 41 (w1) 
> pl ((2k f 1/21 r) = O, 
41 ((2k + 3/21 r) = maXzu,~R 41 (w1) 
7 pl ((2lC f 3/2) n) = 
at left and right points of the librations contour. 
It is evident from the constructions produced that the function 
q1 (w1,II) is an analytical one in intervals of the form (kx, 
(k + 1)n) x { I I } .  
At points of the form (kn, 
11) analyticity is violated. Here smooth “sewings” 
are carried out, such that left and right derivatives of q1 (wl, 11) on w1 co- 
incide up to the second order. Derivatives of the third and higher orders 
have at these points an ordinary discontinuity. 
The canonical system with Hamilton’s function H02 (42, p 2 )  is also inte- 
grated in quadratures. The action variable 1 2  can be introduced according 
to the formula 
where T is the period of a satellite orbital revolution. In the elliptic case 
using the selected physical units we have T = 27ra3/’ = 27r (1 - e2)-3’z. 
Thus I2 = h2 (1 - e2)-3’z, and the generating function & (q2, IZ), used 
to transform to the action-angle variables with the aid of the canonical 
transformation, can be computed in the form 
v, (42,121 = (1 - e 2 y  12t (qz) , 
where t (42) is a function which yields the value of physical time, which in 
turn corresponds to the value of true anomaly 42, if zero time corresponds 
to an instant when the pericenter is crossed. Thus, the angular variable 
w2 is defined according to the formula w2 = (VZ), = (1 - ez)3’2 t (42) = I ,  
where 1 is the mean anomaly, and (1 - ez)3/2 = n is the mean motion. 
3. Existence of conditionally-periodic motions 
The canonical transformation (ql, qz,pl,p2) H (w1, W Z ,  
11, Iz) to action- 
angle variables allows to write down the Hamilton function as 
G(w, 1) = Go(1) + pGi(w, 1). 
Go(1) = H0(4(w,I),p(w7~)) 
= hl(11) + h2 (12) I 
(8) 
Here 

156 
Gl(W, I )  = Hl(41 (W1,Il) ,qz (wz, 1 2 ) )  ’ 
The frequencies of the unperturbed Hamiltonian system read 
To apply the results of KAM-theory one can use one of the examples 
given in the Markeyev paper7 and then carry out an analysis of the se- 
quence of symplectic maps “along” the fast angular variable w1 instead of 
examination of the continuous, but nonanalytic, dynamic system. We use a 
standard construction of the isoenergetic reduction’. We will perform the 
reduction in the vicinity of the unperturbed system torus, defined by the 
vector of action variables (Il0,Izo) = (11(0),12(0)). For this purpose let 
us switch from action variables to their deviations (11,Iz) H (J1,Jz) such 
that 1i = I;, + Jz, i = 1,2. 
The map, which generates cascade, will be constructed in “time” w1 E 
[0,27r]. In this case by virtue of the foregoing constructions the analyticity 
of the perturbation G1 (w, I )  is violated on the sets in phase space defined by 
equations w1 - k 7 ~  = 0, k E Z. Really there are only two of such “vertical” 
lines. They are defined respectively by the equations 
w1 = 0 (mod 27r), 
w1 = 7r 
(mod 27~). 
The Hamiltonian system under consideration has an analytical pertur- 
bation. We will conduct isoenergetic reduction separately in each of the 
enumerated phase space “strips”. Thus, within bounds of the analyticity 
regions the initial canonical system is reduced to the nonautonomous one 
W; = K j z ,  JL = -K,,, 
(9) 
with one degree of freedom (indeed, 3/2 DOFs). Here the Hamilton’s func- 
tion K (w1, w2, Jz) is defined implicitly, via the integral of energy for the 
source system from the transcendental equation 
G (w1, W 2 , I l O  - K, 120 + Jz) = h, 
where the constant of energy for the perturbed problem is to be calculated 
using initial conditions according to the formula h = G ( ~ 1 0 ,  
~ 2 0 , 1 1 0 ,  I~o), 
where, in turn, one should assume w10 = 0, or w10 = 7 ~ .  
It is clear that the function K depends analytically on the small param- 
eter p inside the region of analyticity. Then the formula of expansion 
K (
~
i
 
, wz, Jz) = KO (Jz) + pKi (wi , wz, 
Jz) + . . . 

157 
is valid in view of the implicit function theorem and the appropriate con- 
dition a h l / a I l  (11~) # 0 of monotonicity. Here the function KO (&) is 
implicitly defined by the LLunperturbed” 
transcendental equation 
hi (110 - KO) - hi (110) + w2 J2 = 0. 
Along the solution of the Hamiltonian system (9) in the segment w1 E 
[O, TI we obtain an analytic first return map (w2, J 2 )  H (w;, J;). In the 
segment w1 E [T, 27r] we have also an analytic map (w;, J . )  H (w;, J - )  
of the same type. The resulting map (w2, J2) H (w;, J l )  over the period 
w1 E [ 0 , 2 ~ ]  
is a composition of analytic maps. Therefore it is also an 
analytic one. Performing a new expansion on the small parameter p we 
obtain

w; = WZ + 2T Y ( J z )  + p f (w2, J2, p) 7 
c J; = 52+pg(w2,J2,p). 
It is easy to ascertain that Y (J2) = ( K o ) ~ ~  
(Jz). The function 52 - 
y(J2) is an analytic one and not identically equal to zero in a vicinity 
of the unperturbed torus. Indeed, if we represent the expansion of the 
unperturbed Hamiltonian in the form KO (Jz) = k152 + k2J; + k 3 J .  + . . . 
then it is sufficient for the map (10) to be twisting, if p is sufficient small, 
that among the coefficients kz, ks, . . . there are some not equal to zero. In 
this case by virtue of Moser’s theoremg the map (10) has an invariant curve, 
which corresponds to the torus swept by the trajectory of conditionally- 
periodic solution to the perturbed problem. 
In the simplest, typical case the condition k2 # 0 is equivalent to known 
isoenergetic nondegeneracy condition of the unperturbed system. After 
some tedious analytical computations one can verify that this condition 
is fulfilled in the region of (ql,pl)-phase space at some distance from the 
separatrix area and also far from stable equilibrium. 
Summarizing the results, one can say that the majority of the 
nondegerate tori for the unperturbed problem, which correspond to 
conditionally-periodic solutions, are preserved in view of the condition of 
nondegeneracy with sufficiently small p. As it is known”, according to 
dimensional reasons in this case stability takes place with respect to the 
action variables. They are preserved secularly, being only a little distorted. 
This phenomenon is correct in phase space in that measure, in which it is 
provided by the condition of a nondegeneracy. 
Since the manifold of constant energy divides phase space, it follows 
also from the obtained result that with sufficiently small p there exists 
an invariant vicinity of the equilibrium, stable in the unperturbed motion. 

158 
Thus all motions which have initial data in this vicinity, remain in it per- 
manently. This means that a satellite will permanently perform bounded 
librations near the azimuth of the light source. In fact, if the projection of 
phase point on the plane of variables (41, 
p1) begins to be moved away from 
vicinity of the equilibrium cited, then it will be unavoidable to approach a 
separatrix. This region, in view of nondegeneracy, is filled with an invari- 
ant two-dimensional tori, which separate the three-dimensional manifold 
of constant energy and therefore in such a way prevent further diffusion 
through phase space. 
In a limit case we fix the value of the perturbation parameter p suf- 
ficiently small and obtain estimates for the magnitude of the action vari- 
able 11 drift from its initial value 110 in dependence on eccentricity as 
e + 1. An analysis similar to the one performed by the author earlier5 
makes it possible to obtain the bound IIl(t) - 1101 5 const ‘ p ,  correct when 
t E [-const . p-’, const . p-’1 uniformly on eccentricity e in a vicinity of 
the limit case.

AN EXPLICIT SOLUTION OF THE (QUANTUM) ELLIPTIC 
CALOGERO-SUTHERLAND MODEL 
EDWIN LANGMANN

Dedicated to the memory of Ludwig Pittner 
We present explicit formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the elliptic 
Calogero-Sutherland (eCS) model as formal power series to all orders in the nome 
of the elliptic functions, for arbitrary values of the (positive) coupling constant and 
particle number. Our solution gives explicit formulas for an elliptic deformation of 
the Jack polynomials. 
1. Introduction 
The elliptic CalogercFSutherland (eCS) system is a quantum mechanical 
model of identical particles moving on a circle and interacting via a two- 
body potential given by the Weierstrass elliptic function p.19213 
It is defined 
by the 2nd order differential operator 
where N = 2,3,. . . is the particle number, -T 5 xj 5 T are coordinates on 
the circle, 
y = 2 q x  - l), x > 0, 
(2) 
is the coupling constant, and the two-body potential 
159 

160 
which is essentially equal to the Weierstrass elliptic function 
27r and iB." 
with periods 
The eCS system is known to be integrable in the sense that there exist 
differential operators of the form 
a" 
N 
Hn = X(-i)"- 
+ lower order terms 
8x7 
j = 1  
for all n = 1,2,. . . , N ,  which include the eCS Hamiltonian, H2 = H ,  
and which all mutually commute, [Hn, 
H,] 
= 0 for n, m = 1,2,. . . , N.3 
Moreover, in the trigonometric limit p = co where the two-body poten- 
tial reduces to a trigonometric function, the explicit solution of this model 
was found by Sutherland more than 30 year ago.2 In the two-particle case, 
N = 2, the eigenvalue equation of the eCS system is equivalent to the Lam6 
equation studied extensively at the end of the 19th century; see Ref. 4 for 
a review of the classical results. There has been quite some recent interest 
in the eCS ,ystem.5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 
In this paper we present a generalization of Sutherland's solution to the 
elliptic case without restrictions on parameters (see the Result in the final 
section). More specifically, we present explicit formulas for the eigenfunc- 
tions $(x; n) and corresponding eigenvalues &(n) of the eCS Hamiltonian, 
H$(x;n) =&(n)$(x;n), x =  (Xl,...rxN), 
(4)

(6) 
which are labeled by integer quantum numbers 
n = (721,. . . , n ~ ) ,  
n 1  2 722 2 . . . 2 n N ,  
and which are of the following form, 
$(x; n) = @(x; n)@(x) 
where 
@(x) = u qXj 
- x k )  x

essentially the Jacobi Theta function 1 9 1 . ~  The @ are symmetric functions 
of the variables zj = e‘“3, and they are in one-to-one correspondence with 
the plane waves 
N 
QESN j=1 
which provide a complete set of eigenfunctions in the non-interacting 
(9) 
case 
y = 0. It is important to note that our solution in the trigonometric limit 
reduces to Sutherland’s: the eigenvalues &(n) become equal to the well- 
known expressions 
j = 1  . 
and the functions @(x; 
n) reduce to the Jack polynomials playing a promi- 
nent role also in various other contexts in mathematics.l3s1* We also note 
that, for p < co, the functions @(x; n) are no longer polynomials, and also 
the eigenvalues &(n) become much more complicated. In particular, @ is 
not the ground state of the eCS Hamiltonian for < co. Correspondingly, 
our solution is by infinite series which, at this point, are only formal: we 
leave open the important but difficult questions of convergence and reso- 
nances (as discussed in more detail below). We only mention the results in 
Ref. 15 which suggest that our series solutions have a finite radius of con- 
vergence in the nome q of the elliptic functions, and our results suggest that 
there exists a resummation so that the resonances disappear.16 Moreover, 
in the trigonometric limit resonances do not appear,17 and all our infinite 
series collapse to finite ones. 
The present paper is based on our previous 
Our 
starting point is a Theorem obtained by quantum field theory techniques17 
and subsequently proven by direct computations.16 This theorem suggests 
to write the eigenfunctions @(x; n) as series of particular symmetric func- 
tions P(x; n) which are given by the following explicit formulas, 
bTo be precise: O(z) = 6 1 ( ~ / 2 ) / [ 2 q ~ ’ ~ n : = , ( l  
- q’”)]. 

162 
where

@(O = (1 - 0 n 
“1 - qZmr)(1 - 92m/E)l, 
(12) 
m=l 
and the integration contours are nested circles in the complex plane enclos- 
ing the unit circle, 
Cj : f = eEjeiY3, --K 5 yj 5 rr, 0 < E < PIN. 
(13) 
Note that the P(x; n) are symmetric functions of the variables zj = eiZj, 
and they can be expanded as Laurent series. A simple but important 
consequence of the above mentioned theorem is the following. 
Corollary: Let 
q x ;  n) = c 
a(p; n)P(x; n + p)

where the sum is over all 
PjkEjk with p j k  E z and (Ejk)e = dje - dke

(16) 
Then $~(x;n) 
defined in Eqs. (6) and (7) is an eigenfunction of the eCS 
Hamiltonian with corresponding eigenvalue E(n) provided that 
[EO(n+P) 
- -&(n)]a(&n) = Y ~ ~ s u a ( E - v E j k ; n )  (17)

so =o, s,= - 
and 
S-, = - 
for v > 0. 
(18) 
1 - q2v 
1 - q2v 
Note that S, 
= [l - S(v,O)]v/(l - q2”) for all integer v ,  but we prefer 
our somewhat less elegant definition which makes manifest that, in the 
trigonometric limit q = 0, S, 
= 0 for v 5 0. This implies that, for q = 0, 
Eq. (17) has triangular structure (in a natural sense explained in Ref. 17), 
which implies that the eigenvalue &(n) is equal to &o(n). Moreover, one 
obtains a simple recursion relation to compute all the non-zero coefficients 

163 
a(p;n) in in Eq. (14). It is interesting to note that this solution algorithm 
forq = 0 is different from Sutherland's, even though is yields the same 
s~lution.'~ 
We did not realize in Ref. 17 that it is possible to obtain an 
explicit solution of the recursion relations for the coefficients a(p; 
- n) as 
follows, 
with 
qp; 
- n) = &o(n +I) 
- &o(n), 
(20) 
where all sums are in fact finite due to the Kronecker delta and certain 
properties of the functions P(x; n) discussed in Ref. 17 (Eq. (19) is a sim- 
ple special case of our general result presented in the last section). This 
together with the results in Ref. 17 provides explicit formulas for the Jack 
polynomials. It is interesting to note that the recursions relations which 
one gets in Sutherland's algorithm are more complicated and, to our knowl- 
edge, have not been solved explicitly for general N (we are only aware of 
similarly explicit previous results for N = 321). It is also worth noting 
that, due to translation invariance, the dependence of the eigenfunctions 
on the center-of-mass coordinate z1 + . . . -+ X N  is trivial, and therefore the 
functions @(x; n) are of the form einN(zl+'.'mN)@(x; 
n) where i i j  = n j  - n N  
obeys iil 2 6 2  2 . . . i i ~ - 1  2 i i ~  
= 0. However, it seems that this is not 
manifest in our explicit formula for these functions, and we therefore seem 
to get an infinite number of different representations (labeled by n ~ )  
for 
each distinct Jack polynomial (this is true not only for q = 0 but also in 
the elliptic case). 
In the rest of the paper we discuss how to explicitly compute the coef- 
ficients a(p; n) and eigenvalues &(n) for the general elliptic case from the 
Corollary above. The strategy is to find a "good" expansion parameter, al- 
lowing to solve Eq. (17) recursively. The obvious parameter is the squared 
nome q2 of the elliptic fun~ti0n.l~ 
While this provides a possible solution 
algorithm, we were able to obtain the explicit solution only up to order 
(q2)7 for N = 2 with the help of MAPLE in this way.16 The formulas ob- 
tained are rather complicated and suggest that it is hopeless to find explicit 
expressions to all order in q2 in this way. However, this result motivates a 

164 
more efficient solution strategy by expanding in the coupling parameter y. 
As we show, the resulting solution algorithm is indeed simpler, and while we 
obtained the explicit solution up to order y6 without the help of MAPLE, 
it again seems hopeless to obtain explicit formulas to all orders in y in that 
way. However, this result gives a better understanding of the structure of 
the solutions, and it led us to a method of solution to all order. The key to 
this was to introduce a parameter q “by hand” which efficiently organizes 
the complexity of the solution, and this allows us to obtain the solution 
as a power series in q to all orders (without the help of MAPLE). From 
this our explicit formulas for &(n) and a(p; 
- n) of Eq. (17) are obtained by 
setting q = 1. 
In the next three sections we outline the explicit solutions obtained by 
expanding in q2, y and q, respectively. For simplicity in notation we restrict 
this discussion to the simplest non-trivial case N = 2. The generalization 
to arbitrary N is straightforward, but we only give the result in the final 
section. We plan to include a more detailed derivation of this in a future 
revision of Ref. 16. 
2. Expanding in q2 
For simplicity we restrict ourselves to N = 2. In this case p = pE12, and 
(17) simplifies to 
- 
where a(p; n) is short for a(pE12; n). To simplify notation we suppress the 
dependence on n in the following. We make the ansatz 
03 
03 
and with 
ae(0) = S(p, 0) 
and 
ae(p) = 0 for p < -l 
(23) 

165 
we obtain by simple computations (expanding the Su in geometric series 
etc.)

+y C v[ae-um(p - + ae-um(p + .)I

where b(p) = &o(n+pEl2)-&o(n). Using&o(n) = ( n l + A / 2 ) 2 + ( n 2 - A / 2 ) 2  
we get 
b ( p )  = 2p(P + p), p = n 1  - 722 + A. 
(25) 
It is important to note that Eq. (24) has triangular structure: for each e and 
p # 0 it determines a&) as a finite sum of terms involving only 
(p') and 
&p with el < e and ae(p') with p' < p, and the equation for p = 0 allows to 
determine the &e recursively. We also note that the conditions in Eq. (23) 
is essential for getting a simple recursion procedure. It is straightforward 
to implement the recursive computation of the a&) and Ee in a symbolic 
computing software like MAPLE or MATHEMATICA. We only give the 
results for the eigenvalues which we obtained using MAPLE,

We computed &e up to order e = 7 but for obvious reasons do not write 
down our full result. This result was previously obtained in Ref. 10 up to 

166 
e = 2 using a different method, and we convinced ourselves that our results 
agree. 
Remark: In the computations discussed above we implicitly assumed that 
b(p) is always different from zero, which is only the case if A, and thus P, is 
not an integer. If b(p) vanishes we have a resonance, and while it is possible 
to generalize the algorithm to allow for resonances16 we will not discuss 
this here for simplicity: Throughout this paper we ignore resonances. (As 
discussed in Ref. 16, we believe that resonances are not a serious problem.) 
We observe that the &e become more and more complicated with in- 
creasing e, and it seems that they are polynomials in the coupling constant 
y as follows, 
2e 
where Ej") become more complicated with increasing s. It is interesting to 
note that the formulas for the coefficients &is) become somewhat simpler 
when expanded in partial fractions. In particular, we found by inspection 
that all &i2) we computed can be written in the following simple form, 
(the sum is over all integer divisors k of e). We checked this formula up 
to e = 7, and by assuming it to be true for all d we obtain by a simple 
computation 
(this conjecture will be proven in the next section). This formula suggested 
to us that it is possible to obtain explicit expressions to all orders in q2 if 
one expands in the coupling parameter y. We now present an alternative 
and simpler solution algorithm motivated by this observation. 

167 
3. Expanding in y 
We now make the ansatz 
and by simple computations we obtain from Eq. (17) 
r=O 
U E Z  
which we can solve with the following ansatz 
This yields, in particular, 
U E Z  
The recursion relations in Eqs. (31) are much simpler than the ones in Eq. 
(24). By inspection we find that the following ansatz is consistent, 
and by straightforward computations, 

168 
etc. (it is useful to note that the variables vj can be permuted in each 
term). Using Eq. (33) we get 
I(") 
= - c sus ' .  . S u l f s - ~ ( V 1 , .  . . ,vs-l; -us), 
(36) 
u1 , . . . , u s  EZ 
in particular, &(') = 0 and 
which proves Eq. (29). With the formulas given above one can easily write 
down similarly explicit formulas for &(") for s = 2,3,4,5. 
Computing the functions fs up to s = 6 we observed the following 
simple patterns: it seems that the building blocks for the solution are the 
following expressions, 
M 
00 
d") 
= c(-l)'(. 
. .)S(s1+. . . s,, s)S(lcl+. . -+k,,r-l)Gt) . . .Gt') (40) 
where '(. . . )' are possible combinatorial factors which might appear at 
higher order but, up to s = 6, all are equal to 1. 
r=l 
We find that, for s > 6, nontrivial combinatorial factors in the formula 
above appear, and this destroys the hope that we can find a closed formula 

169 
for &("I for arbitrary s in this way. Still, Eq. (40) suggest that we can write 
& in a simple manner using the following quantities, 
W 
s=2 
and the formulas above suggest, 
where the dots are higher order terms. We will prove and extend this 
formula in the next section: We will obtain an explicit formula of the 
following kind, 
n=l 
T I , .  . . ,rn 
with certain combinatorial factor '(. . . )' which we will compute explicitly. It 
is interesting to note that 2, is of order q2n (since all G, are of order q2), and 
thus this formula allows to deduce in a simple manner the series expansion 
in q2. However, the term in contributes to all the (q2)m-terms m 2 n, 
which explains why our expansion in q2 yielded so complicated expressions. 
We stress that, since En = U(q2"), Eq. (43) still is an expansion the q2 and 
has, as we believe, a finite radius of convergence. 
4. Expanding in 77 
The results in the previous section led us to a more powerful solution strat- 
egy which we now explain. Defining an operator 9 as follows, 
% f ( P )  := C SVf(P - 
(44) 
V E Z  
we can write Eq. (17) as 
where 
& = & - & o .  
(46) 
Making the ansatz 
s=l 

170 
we get [b(p) - E]&(p) = StiS-1(p), and thus 
Setting p = 0 in Eq. (45) gives E = -ySa(O), which implies 
It is easy to see that the s = 0 term here vanishes, and by a shifting the 
summation variable we obtain the following equation determining 2, 
E = -G(E) 
(50) 
where 
We now observe that the functions G(E) has a Taylor expansion as follows, 
00 
k=O 
with 
Note that these are exactly the quantities which we found empirically in 
the last Section. To solve Eq. (50) efficiently we replace it by 
m 
k=O 

171 
where we introduce a parameter q serving as useful book keeping device (we 
set q = 1 at the end of the computation). It is straightforward to compute 
the Taylor series of 2 recursively: With the ansatz 
we get by simple computations 
- 
&1 = -Go 
etc. This suggests that 
M 
for all n = 1,2,. . . (we checked that using MAPLE up to n = 15). This 
result is, in fact, a classical theorem due to Lagrange:" the equation de- 
termining 2 is of the form 2 = -qG(E), and thus Lagrange's theorem as 
stated in Ref. 4, Paragraph 7.32, implies 
equivalent to Eq. (57). 
5. Conclusions 
It is possible to generalize the results of the previous two sections to arbi- 
trary particle numbers N .  We intend to give the details in a future revision 
of Ref. 16 and quote here only the result.

(14)-(15) with the coeficients 
m 
There is an even more explicit formula for the coefficients a(p) which 
- 
we plan to give elsewhere. 
We do not label this as theorem since we did not check the details 
of our computations carefully enough to be sure that there are no typos 
and/or (minor) mistakes.d The purpose of this paper was to make available 
the explicit solution of the eCS model which we announced in two recent 
meetings, and to describe the last part of a somewhat lengthy journey 
leading us to this result. We feel that we are not at the end of this journey 
yet: quite some work remains to be done to understand this result. 
Anyway, it seems fair to say that the eCS model is an exactly solved 
model now. 
dWe finished this paper under the pressure of a deadline.

Using the variational method introduced by Melnikov, we prove the existence of 
transversal homoclinic orbits in a particular collinear restricted three body prot- 
lem. As a consequence we can embed a Bernoulli shift on a suitable cross section 
of the flow, showing that this problem possesses chaotic dynamics. 
1. Introduction and equations of motion 
The classical restricted three body problem studies the motion of a massless 
particle m3 = 0, under the gravitational attraction of two masses ml and 
m2 called the primaries; they move uniformly in circular Kepler orbits 
around their center of mass. 
In this paper we consider another restricted three body problem, where 
the primaries are in a degenerate elliptic collision orbit, and the massless 
particle moves in the same line that rnl and m2. We must emphasize that 
this model does not correspond to the usual collinear restricted three body 
problem, here we avoid the rotation effect of the primaries, our goal is to 
show in this simple model, how the Melnikov integral method can be used 
to avoid long and tedious computations, even in models with singularities 
due to collisions, where of course, these singularities must be previously 
regularized. The classical restricted collinear three body problem, including 
the rotating effect of the primaries has been studied by the same authors 
in 5 .  
We consider three point masses ml = p, m2 = 1 - p and m3 = 0 with p 
175

sufficiently small, moving on a fixed (no rotating) straight line. The origin 
of coordinates is taken at the big primary, and we choose an orientation on 
the straight line of motion in such a way that the small primary is located 
on the negative half-axis of motion having coordinate - 2 1 .  The massless 
particle m3 is located on the positive half-axis of motion at a distance x of 
the origin. 
We suppose that the primaries are moving in a collision elliptic orbit. 
Choosing adequately the units of length, time and mass, we can assume 
that the length of the major semi-axis of the collision orbit is equal to 1, 
the time between two collisions of the primaries is equal to 2 ~ ,  
and the 
gravitation constant equals to the unity. Then, the equation of motion for 
the massless particle is given by

For p = 0, we get the well known integrable one-dimensional Kepler 
problem 
Where the dot denotes derivative with respect to the real time t. Equation 
(1.1) shows that our model can be written as the perturbation of an inte- 
grable system, where the mass 
of the smaller primary is the perturbation 
parameter. 
We first regularize the binary collision between the primaries by taking 
x1 = 1 + COSE, and 
where E is the eccentric anomaly, and at time t = 0 the primaries are lo- 
cated at their apo-center. The Hamiltonian of the onedimensional Kepler 
problem is given by 
t = E - sinE,

N(z,y) = -x2 - -. 
Let y = x, we can draw the orbits of the Kepler problem in the (x, y)- 
plane. The orbits escaping to infinity with zero limiting velocity correspond 
to W = 0, they are called the parabolic orbits. To analyze all the orbits 
going to, or coming back from infinity we use McGehee coordinates. Let 
-p = x = y.

x = -

177 
In these coordinates, system (1.2) goes over to 
Re-scaling the time variable in the form dt/ds = +q3, system (1.4) becomes 
4' = P, 
P' = 4, 
(1.5) 
where the prime denotes derivative with respect to the time s. 
In the above system, the origin is a hyperbolic saddle point. The stable 
and unstable manifolds associated to this point are the parabolic orbits; 
we observe that in the real time t they correspond to orbits ending in 
degenerate fixed points. 
The next step is to regularize the binary collisions between the mass- 
less particle m3 and the primary m2. To do that we use the Levi-Civita 
regularization 11, let 
x = (2, 
y = 776-1. 
After another time re-parametrization dt/dT = 2E2, equations (1.2) are 
transformed into 
E' = 77, 
77' = 2h(, 
(1.6) 
where now the prime denotes derivative with respect to T. The energy 
relation obtained by fixing h in Hamiltonian (1.3) is 
2E2h = v2 - 2. 
The homoclinic orbit necessary to apply the Melnikov integral method 
will be the collision parabolic orbit. In these variables, the parabolic orbits 
correspond to H = 0, in order to use the symmetries of the problem we 
choose the parabolic orbits 
((7)

q(7) = &h. 
After the regularization of the binary collisions we go back to the original

We fix a level of energy H = h. Changing to Levi-Civita's coordinates

The equations of motion for the perturbed problem in coordinates 
(El 7 , ~ )  
are the Hamilton equations defined by the Hamiltonian I?, which 
in what follows we continue denoting by H .  Then, we can write 
H(E,rI,r) = Ho(E97I) + P H l ( E , V , d ,

2. The main result 
Let p > 0 small enough, after the blow-up of infinity, the hyperbolic saddle 
point (which in the original equations is a degenerate singular point of 
equation (1.6)), is transformed into a 2vperiodic orbit y. The parabolic 
orbits approach this periodic orbit when t .+ +cm. Let c$$(.) be the flow of 
(1.9). We define a Poincark map as the function &(.); 
i.e. the %-time 
flow function. Without loss of generality, for such a Poincark map we can 
take the cross section r = TO with TO arbitrary. 
Now we use a nice result of R. McGehee ’ 
which states that the asymp- 
totic set of y is an analytic submanifold immersed in the respective energy 
surface, formed by the family of parabolic orbits of the perturbed problem, 
we call it the stable manifold of y, denoted by Wj(y). Using the same 
arguments for the orbits coming back from infinity we define the unstable 
manifold of y, denoted by W;(y). 

179 
Using the continuity of the global flow with respect to initial conditions 
is not difficult to prove the existence of a collision parabolic orbit (see 
6 ,  
and lo among others). By the reversibility of the flow we also have 
a parabolic capture collision orbit, since we have regularized the binary 
collisions, we get that Ws(y) and Wu(y) intersect along that parabolic 
orbit that we will denote by I?. Now we will prove that this intersection is 
transversal by using the Melnikov integral method. In and you can find 
a complete deduction on the Melnikov function defined as

M(ro) = L _ { H O ,

Finally we are in possibilities to state and prove the main result of this 
paper. 
Theorem 2.1. The Mellcinov function M(E0) has a simple zero at EO = 0. 
Proof. Let us observe that the function in the integrand of M(E0) is an 
odd function for E o  = 0, so we have M(0) = 0. 
Now we will show that M’(0) # 0. By direct differentiation we obtain

The last equality holds because the integrant function f ( E )  is even. We 
note that f ( E )  is continuous at 0 and takes the value -1/2. Moreover, the 
positive zeros of f ( E )  are 1.02431739382509.. . and I ~ T  for Ic = 1,2,. . .. The 
first zero is simple and the others have multiplicity 2. Therefore, f ( E )  2 0 
for E 2 T .  Then we can write

The first integral of the last equality can be estimated by dif- 
ferent numerical methods controlling its error. 
Thus, its value is

because E - sin E 2 E - 1 and 2 + 2 cos E 2 0; it follows that

where 
Here r denotes the incomplete gamma function. Then, we have that 
dE = -F(T) <_ 0.034 . 
Consequently, M’(0) is negative.

As a consequence of the above Theorem, for p small enough we have 
the existence of a transversal homoclinic orbit (see 3). Finally by using the 
Smale-Birkhoff Theorem (see 3, ’), we know the existence of an imbedding 
subsystem which is topologically equivalent to a Bernoulli shift, showing 
that the model describes a chaotic system.

We define a rather general family of Lax operators with rational dependence on the 
spectral parameter X and discuss the problem of reductions. We develop the re- 
duction group approach and study the associated infinite dimensional Lie algebras. 
This naturally leads to the concept of automorphic Lie algebras. Automorphic Lie 
algebras arise originally in the context of integrable systems but it is to believe 
that they are of mathematical interest on their own right. 
1. Introduction 
One of the fundamental tools in the theory of integrability is the spectral 
transform method - inverse scattering method for integrating nonlinear par- 
tial differential equations (PDEs) based on the Lax representation (see for 
example 1,2,3). In this setting, a nonlinear equation is equivalent to the 
compatibility condition of a pair of linear equations, called Lax pair. In 
general, given an integrable nonlinear equation, there is no algorithmic way 
to find its Lax representation. Some progress in this problem have been 
made by the Wahlquist and Estabrook method of pseudo-potentials and 
prolongation structures 4 1 5 , 6 ;  
in some cases the Painlev6 approach provides 
both integrability conditions and Lax representation (see for example '). 
A different approach to this problem consists in starting from a quite 
general Lax representation which yields to a rather big (but integrable) 
system of equations and explore integrable systems that can be represented 
by it. The general system has often too many degrees of freedom and is 
very complicated; however, it can contain smaller subsystems, relevant for 
applications: many famous integrable equations (such as the sine-Gordon 
equation and the Tzetseica equation) are the result of reductions of more

general integrable systems. This observation suggests to study and classify 
possible Lax representations and their reductions. 
The first attempt to study algebraic reductions of Lax representations 
has been made in 8,9,10 and later in ll. The principal observation in 8,9 was 
that reductions of integrable equations can be associated with a discrete 
symmetry group (reduction group) of the corresponding linear problems. 
The simplest example of such a symmetry is the conjugation for self-adjoint 
operators. 
This paper reports recent progress in the theory of the reduction group. 
The reader is referred to l2 and l3 for a complete account of all intermediate 
results and proofs. 
2. General rational Lax operators 
Let A be a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra over C and let { al, . . . , a N }  
be a basis of A such that [ai,aj] = C,"==,C,Tja,., C,Tj E C. Let X = 
{XI, 2 2 , .  . .} be a set of independent variables. With every variable xk 
we associate a divisor of poles r k  = ml . y1 + ... + m, . T,, 
i.e. a finite 
set of points r k  = (71,. . . , y,} 
on the Riemann sphere together with their 
multiplicities ml, . . . , m, E N. Let c(rk) denote a linear space of rational 
functions of the spectral parameter X such that the only singularities of 
these functions are poles at the points of the divisor with multiplicity equal 
or less than the multiplicity of the point. The dimension of this linear space 
is Mk = ml f . .  
. + m, + 1. Let .!(A), 
. . . , e b k  (A) be a basis in c(rk). 
With X k , r k  and A we associate a family of general Lax operators with 
rational dependence on the spectral parameter X 
. 
N 
M G  
Here ubp are smooth functions of variables X in a certain open domain, 
and if the set X is infinite, we assume that every function depends on a 
finite number of variables only. A set of such functions is denoted by 3. 
The Lax operator L k  is parametrised by N x k& functions u$. Any 
two Lax operators Lk,L, form a Lax pair and the commutativity con- 
dition [Lk,L,] = 0 is equivalent to an integrable (by the spectral trans- 
form method) system of partial differential equations for the functions 
In order to write this system of PDEs in explicit form we introduce a 
basis he(X) , (Y = 1,. . . , Mk+hf,-1 in C(rk+J?,) and expand the elements

defined by the choice of a simple Lie algebra A and two divisors r k  and rs 
(in some cases the divisors may coincide, cf. the Lax pair for the N-waves 
equation '). 
3. The problem of reduction and the reduction group 
The integrable system (2) is very general, the problem to find and classify all 
subsystems of a general system like (2) is known as the reduction problem. 
Let A be a finite or infinite dimensional Lie algebra over any field (or 
ring). Aut A denotes the group of all automorphisms of A. Let G c Aut A 
anddG t h e s e t d G = { a ~ d l ~ ( a ) = a , V ~ € G } .  
Lemma 3.1. AG is a subalgebra of A. 
This lemma is obvious (it follows immediately from the definition of auto- 
morphism), but important for our further applications. All classical semi- 
simple Lie algebras can be extracted in such a way from the algebra of 
matrices with zero trace. For example, the map 4(a) = --atr , where tr 
stands for transpose, is an automorphism of the Lie algebra sZ(N,C) of 
square N x N matrices; the invariant subalgebra in this case is so(N, C), 
i.e. the algebra of skew-symmetric matrices. 
Restrictions to subalgebras d c A are obvious reductions of (2), how- 
ever a straightforward application of Lemma 3. l to finite dimensional semi- 
simple Lie algebras does not lead to interesting results. Infinite dimensional 
Lie algebra with elements depending on a complex parameter X may have a 
richer group of automorphisms and Lemma 3.1 provides a tool to construct 
subalgebras of infinite dimensional Lie algebras in the spirit of the theory 
of automorphic functions 14115. 

186 
3.1. Reduction group and automorphic subalgebras 
Let R(r) be a ring of rational functions of X with poles at points of the 
divisor r and regular elsewhere. Fractional-linear transformations of the 
complex plane A, which map r into itself, induce automorphisms of the 
ring R ( F ) .  Let Aut R(r) denote the group of automorphisms of R(I'). In 
the rest of the article we assume that the set r is an orbit or a union of a 
finite number of orbits of a finite group B of fractional-linear transforma- 
tions. In this case the ring R(r) has a nontrivial group of automorphisms 
Aut R(r) E B. 
Let A be a finite dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra over @. We define an 
infinite dimensional (over C) 
Lie algebra as follows 
with standard commutator 
Automorphisms of the ring R(r) induce automorphisms of A(r) 
Definition 3.1. Let GR c AutA(F). We call the Lie algebra dGR(r) 
automorphic, if its elements a E AGR(I') are invariant - g(a) = a - with 
respect to all automorphisms g E GR. Group GR is called reduction group. 
Elements of the reduction group can be viewed as simultaneous automor- 
phisms, i.e. Lie algebra automorphisms and fractional-linear transforma- 
tions of the spectral parameter A. 
For example, in the case sl(N,C), 
the action of elements of the reduction group GR can be represented ei- 
ther as .(A) 
+ G-l~(~G(X))G 
or as .(A) 
-+ 
-H-'at'(a~(X))H, where 
G, H E GL(N, C) 
and gc(X), CTH(X) are the corresponding fractional-linear 
transformations of the X plane. If the elements G and H are X independent, 
then GR c Aut A x Aut R(r). The reduction group can be generalised to 
a semi-direct product, if there is a nontrivial homomorphism of Aut R(r) 
in the group Aut (AutA) (an example will be given in Section 4.1). The 
restriction of the general Lax operator to the subalgebra d G R ( r )  is a re- 
duction, with reduction group GR. Restrictions to invariant subalgebras 
are equivalent to require some symmetry conditions for the Lax operators.

4. DN-Reductions of sZ(2, @)-Lax operators with simple 
A complete study of DN-reductions of sL(2, C) Lax operators with simple 
poles can be found in 12, together with the corresponding integrable equa- 
tions. In this section we list the main results and present a new, up to 
the best of our knowledge, integrable system arising from the reduction 
procedure. 
The dihedral group DN is the group of rotations and reflections of the 
plane which preserve a regular polygon with N vertices. It is generated by 
two elements, s and r ,  satisfying the identities sN = r2 = id, r s r  = s-'. 
If N = 2 the group ID2 is abelian and isomorphic to Z2 x Z2. 
On the complex plane of the spectral parameter X the group DN 
can be 
generated by two fractional-linear transformations 
poles 
us : X ---f w X ,  
oT : X --f X-' , 
w = exp (227rlN) . 
( 5 )  
The orbit of the group DN of a point y is defined as the set of points 
When the point y is generic, i.e. y is not a fixed point of any (nontrivial) 
subgroup, the corresponding generic orbit has 2N points. Fixed points of 
the group transformations ( 5 )  belong to degenerated orbits. In the rest of 
this section we assume that N is odd. 
With every orbit D N ( ~ )  
we associate a linear space . l ( D ~ ( y ) )  
of rational 
functions with simple poles at the points of the orbit. Let y be a generic 
point and DN(T) the corresponding generic orbit. The general Lax operator 
corresponding to a generic orbit D,(y) is 
I 
2N+1 
where Uj' are 2 x 2 traceless matrix functions of independent variables (such 
as zY) 
and E?(X) are elements of a basis of rational functions in . l (D~(y )).  
We choose the basis in which the regular representation of DN splits into 
a direct sum of irreducible ones 12. Let L,(X) be another Lax operator, 
corresponding to another generic orbit D N ( ~ )  
and parametrised by matrix 
functions Uj". The condition [LY(X), 
L,(X)] = 0 leads to a nonlinear system 
of 4N + 1 matrix partial differential equations, which can be reduced to a 
smaller, well determined subsystem imposing the symmetry conditions 

Here h is a fixed integer 1 5 h 5 9 that enumerates all different irre- 
ducible representations, and 
gs : L-,(X) -+ S(h)-lL,(~s(X))S(h) 
and gr : Ly(X) + R-'L,(a,(X))R gen- 
erate a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of Lie algebra sZ(2, C) 8~ 
R(I[DN(~)). 
For every given h the subspace of invariant elements is three 
dimensional and the final result does not depend on the choice of the rep- 
resentation. We have shown that automorphic Lie algebras corresponding 
to different h are isomorphic 13. 
There are four basic types of DN-reduced d(2, C) rational Lax operators 
with simple poles. They are the following: 
0 Lax operator corresponding to a 2N-points generic orbit DN(Y), 
(2N poles)

dx-/ 
0 Lax operator corresponding to the two N-points degenerated orbits 
IIDN(+~) (N poles) 
0 Lax operator corresponding to the 2-points degenerated orbits 
D N ( O )  (2 poles) 
In (9), (10) and (11) qi, u: and p are functions of the independent variables. 
The commutativity condition of any two reduced operators leads to inte- 
grable systems. The complete list can be found in 12. As an example, let us 
188

189 
consider the case of L, and L+ as a Lax pair. The condition [L,, L+] = 0 
is equivalent to the following system of equations 
Ut = (cose)Z 
ut = (sine). 
(12) 
eZt = u cos8 + (yN+l)2 
2TN 
u sin8 
where x, = x, x+ = t and the explicit change of variables from qi, u+ to 
u, 
u, 8 can be found in 12. 
Equations corresponding to N and y coincide with equations corre- 
sponding to N1 and 71, provided y N  = y y .  For the case N even one 
would receive equivalent equations, reflecting the fact that the correspond- 
ing automorphic Lie algebras are isomorphic 13. 
4.1. Automorphic Lie algebras corresponding to twisted 
(A-dependent) automorphisms 
In the previous sections we assumed that elements of the group Aut A do 
not depend on the complex parameter A. The group Aut A is a continuous 
Lie group and we can admit that some of its elements depend on A. in 
this case, the transformations of a reduction group G can be represented 
by pairs (g, 
$(A)), where the first element of the pair is a fractional-linear 
transformation of the complex plane X while the second entry is a “A- 
dependent” automorphism of the Lie algebra A. The composition rule in 
this case is similar to the semi-direct product of groups 18119: 
( g 1 + ( 4 )  = (flZl+2(X)). (m,+1(4) = ( g 2  . a 1 , + 2 ( X )  . 0 2 ( + 1 ( X ) ) ) ’  
Let us consider a nontrivial example of a reduction group ID$ 2 ID3 with 
X dependent automorphisms of sZ(3, C) and the corresponding automorphic 
infinite dimensional Lie algebra. Let ID? be a group of transformations 
generated by 
gs : .(A) 
-+ Q U ( U - ~ X ) Q - ~ ,  
gt : .(A) + - T - ~ ( x ) ~ ~ ~ ( x - ~ ) T ( x ) ,  
where .(A) 
E sl(3, C) and 
Q =  (i%H) 
, 
T(X)= (-OX ’ ~ ’ ~ - ~ )  
. 
It is easy to check that g,”, g: = i d  and gs . gt . gs . gt = id. Thus, the group

Let us describe the space of I0-invariant 3 x 3 matrices with rational 
entries in X and with simple, double and third order poles at points (0, co}. 
A matrix .(A) 
is @-invariant if and only if 
.(A) = Q.(~-'X)Q-~ , 
.(A) = -T-l(X)~t'(X-')T(X).

Prop 4.1. The zero matrix is the only constant and ID-invariant. If a 
matrix is rational in X with poles at (0,oo) and ID; invariant, then it can 
be uniquely represented as a linear combination of 
We refer the interested reader to l3 for the proof.

i E {1,2,3}, j E {1,2}, n E Z , f  = A 3 + P 3  is a basis of the

(3) slD;(3,C;0,exp(xi/6)) is a direct sum of two subalgebras 
slD;(3,C;O) and slD;(3,C;exp(xi/6)). 
(4) The subsets { z ~ , y ~ , z ~ ) n  
2 0} and {zy,yy,zjn)n < 0) of the 
set at the point (1) are bases of subalgebras slD;(3,C;O) and 
slD; (3, C; exp(~i/6)), respectively. 
(2) slD; (3, C; 0, exp(~i/6)) is quusigruded: 
(5) slp(3,C;O) is generated by q(A),zz(A) and z3(X). 
Here slD; (3, C; y, p) denotes the infinite dimensional automorphic Lie alge- 
bra of all I@-invariant traceless 3 x 3 matrices, whose entries are rational 
functions of X with poles at D3(y) U D3(p); similarly, sZD; (3, C; y) indicates 
the infinite dimensional automorphic Lie algebra of all @-invariant trace- 
less 3 x 3 matrices, whose entries are rational functions of X with poles at 
D3(y) and with no other singularities.

In this article we formulate a comprehensive, geometric picture of what is know 
as Dirac reduction and Marsden-Ratiu reduction of a Poisson operator II on a 
foliation S not related with the symplectic foliation of II. As a consequence, we 
obtain a geometric method of reducing of any Hamiltonian system to a Hamiltonian 
system on the foliation S. Any such reduction depends merely on the choice of the 
distribution 2 along which the reduction takes place.

In his famous paper 
P.A.M. Dirac has shown how to reduce a given 
Poisson bracket to a submanifold defined by some physical constraints p. 
A geometric sense of this procedure has been studied in 
and later (in the 
Poisson context) in 3, 4, 
and 6. In this short note (a more complete paper 
on these issues will be published later) we present how to reduce a Poisson 
operator I2 to leaves of a foliation S along a transversal to S distribution 2. 
All our considerations are local. As a special case we obtain the classical 
Dirac reduction of Hamiltonian systems. Our construction is equivalent 
to the "transversal" case of reduction method proposed by Marsden and

Ratiu in ’. However, our approach is constructive and it is formulated in 
the language of Poisson bivectors not Poisson brackets. Some particular 
versions of the proposed scheme appeared recently in 
Suppose we have a smooth manifold M of dimension n and a foliation S 
of M consisting of the leaves S, where v is some (multivalued) parameter. 
Suppose also that we have a distribution 2 on M ,  such that it completes 
every T,S, to T,M in the sense that 
and ’. 
T,M =T,S, CB 2, 
(1) 
for every x in M (and a corresponding v). Then every vector field X on the 
manifold M has a unique decomposition X = X I I  + XI such that for every 
5 in M the vector ( X I ] ) ,  
E T,S, while (Xl), 
E 2,. This splitting induces 
the splitting T,’M =T,’Sv @ 2; of the corresponding dual space T,M, 
where T,’S, is the annihilator of 2, while the space 2; is the annihilator 
of T,S,. 
Thus, any one-form a on M has a unique decomposition a = 
a11 + C
Y
~
 
such that (all), E T,S (a11 annihilates the vectors from 2) while 
(al), E 2: 
( C Y ~  annihilates the vectors tangent to the foliation S ). We 
will write that X c TS if X = X I I ,  X c 2 if X = XI and similarly for 
one forms: CY c T*S if a = all, a c 2* if a = a l .  
Suppose now that we have a bivector II defined on our manifold M with 
the corresponding Poisson bracket {F, G}, = (dF, IIdG) on M ,  where (., .) 
is the dual map between T’M and T M .  A smooth real-valued function F 
on M is called 2-invariant if the Lie derivative LzF = 0 for any vector 
field Z c 2. We say that the operator II is 2-invariant if Lz {F, G}, = 0 
for any pair of 2-invariant functions F and G and every vector field Z c 2 .  
Let us now consider a 2-invariant Poisson operator II and define the 
following deformation of n: 
IIo (a, p) = n(all, PI,) for any pair a, ,B of one - forms. 
(2) 
This bivector occurred for example in 
in a more restrictive context. Ob- 
serve that it always exists and that it is uniquely defined once the foliation 
S and the distribution 2 are given (it is thus a purely geometric construc- 
tion). It can be easily proved that IIo(a) c TS for any one-form CY on 
M ,  i.e. the image of ITo is tangent to the foliation S. Thus, the deformed 
bivector IIo - considered as a mapping from one-forms to vector fields on 
M - can be naturally restricted to a bivector TR, on every leaf S, of S by 
simply restricting its domain: TR” = IIols,. 
Theorem 0.1. If II is 2-invariant then IID given by (2) is Poisson. 

195 
The proof is by showing that the bracket {., .}nD is Poisson. Natu- 
rally, HD also induces a new bracket for functions on M :  {F, G}nD = 
IID (dF,dG) = H((dF)II , ( C ~ G ) ~ ~ ) .  
Thus, given a foliation S on M and a 
transversal distribution 2 on M (such that (1) is satisfied) we can reduce 
any Poisson bivector II that is 2-invariant to a Poisson bivector TR, on the 
leaf S, of S by deforming Il to IID and then by restricting IID to S,. This 
construction yields the same operator TR,, as in the approach of Marsden 
and Ratiu ’. 
Our construction however differs from the construction of 
Marsden and Ratiu as it is directly computable and since it is performed 
on the level Qf Poisson bivectors. We should remark that in case when the 
foliation S coincides with the symplectic foliation of II we have of course 
that IID = II , since in this case II((dF)l) = 0 for any function F so that 
in this case TR, is the standard reduction of rI on its symplectic leaf S,. 
Usually the data of the reduction problem consist of a submanifold 
(or a foliation S) and a Poisson operator II that is to be reduced on S. 
There exists, however, no known to us algorithmic way of producing all the 
distributions 2 that make a given operator TI 2-invariant. 
Let us now suppose that the foliation S of M is parametrized by the set 
of k functionally independent real valued functions pi(.) so that its leaves 
have the form S, = {x E M : pi(.) = vi, vi E R, 
i = 1,. . . , k } .  Let us 
observe that independently of the choice of 2 the one-forms dcpi constitute 
a basis in 2”. Then, define k (possibly dependent) Hamiltonian vector 
fields Xi = Hdcpi. Let us denote a basis of 2 dual to the basis {dyi} in 2* 
by Zi, so that Zi(cpj) = 6ij. Our projections XII and all are then given by 
X I I  = X - CX(cpi)Zi and all = a! - Ca(Zi)dcpi 
k 
k 
i=l 
i=l 
Easy calculations show that the deformation 
can now be expressed as 
where cpij = { c p i , ~ j } ~  
= Xj(cpi) = II(dcpi,dcpj). In the case when all the 
vector fields Xi are transversal to the foliation S and are moreover linearly 
independent (it happens precisely when det(cpij) # 0 - the functions ‘pi 
are then ’second class constraints’ in the terminology of Dirac) they span 
a distribution 2 = Sp{Xi} that automatically satisfies (1) and makes II 
2-invariant. The vector fields Zi (the dual basis to {dpi}) can then be 
expressed through the vector fields Xi as 
k 
zi = c (cp-l)jixjl i = 1,. . . , k. 
j=1 

196 
Indeed, we have then Zj(cpi) = C~=l(cp-l),jX,(cpi) = C$=l(cp-l)sjcpi, 
= 
&j. Moreover, in this case the deformation (3) attains the form: 
i=l 
This operator defines the following bracket on C-(M) 
k 
{F, G)n, = {F, G)n - 
{F, cpi)rr(P-l)ij{cpj> G)n, 
( 5 )  
i,j=l 
which is just the well known Dirac deformation 
Let us now return to our general setting and consider a Hamiltonian 
vector field X = IIdH on our manifold M where H is some real-valued 
smooth function on M (a Hamiltonian). The corresponding IID defined 
by (2) is Poisson and has its image tangent to the foliation S, so it can 
be properly restricted on every leaf S, of S. Thus, the following definition 
makes sense. 
of the bracket {., .}n. 
Definition 0.1. We call the vector field X D  = HDdH the Hamiltonian 
projection of the Hamiltonian vector field X = IIdH. 
The vector field X D  lives on every leaf of the foliation in the sense that 
its restriction on the leaf S,, 
is tangent to S,. Moreover, on the leaf S, it 
coincides with the Hamiltonian vector field 7rRydh: 
nDdHIsv = TR,& 
where h = HIsv is the restriction of the Hamiltonian H to the leaf S,. 
There is a connection between X = IIdH and its Hamiltonian projection 
X D  = IIDdH. 
Theorem 0.2. (Dynamic reduction theorem) If X = IIdH, X D  = IIDdH 
and Xi = IIdcpi then 
The proof is by direct calculation. Observe that the difference between 
X D  and X I I  is the term Cf=lZi(H)Xi,ll that is tangent to the foliation S, 
as it should be. Since for the Dirac case Xi,ll = 0 (by definition) we have 
Corollary 0.1. In the Dirac case X D  = XI/, 
so that in this case the Hamil- 
tonian projection is just the natural projection (in the sense of direct sum) 
along the distribution Z. 

197 
The term X I I  in XD has a well-known physical interpretation: it de- 
scribes the evolution of the system X = HdH on which a holonomic con- 
straints given by ‘pi were imposed. The physical meaning of the second 
term in X D  is not clear for us yet.

CLOSED MANIFOLDS ADMITTING METRICS 
WITH THE SAME GEODESICS

The goal of this survey is to give a list of resent results about topology of manifolds 
admitting different metrics with the same geodesics. We emphasize the role of the 
theory of integrable systems in obtaining these results. 
1. Introduction 
1.1. Definitions 
Definition 1.1. Let g be a Riemannian metric on a manifold M n  
of di- 
mension n 2 2. A Riemannian metric ij on M" is called geodesically 
equivalent to g, if every geodesic of Q, considered as an unparameterized 
curve, is a geodesic of g. 
Trivial examples of geodesically equivalent metrics can be obtained by 
considering proportional metrics g and C.g, where C is a positive constant. 
Definition 1.2. A manifold M" is called geodesically rigid, if every two 
geodesically equivalent Riemannian metrics on M" are proportional. 
In other words, on geodesically rigid manifolds, unparameterized 
geodesics define the metric (modulo multiplication by a constant). 
1.2. History 
The theory of geodesically equivalent metrics has a long and fascinating 
history that goes back to the works of Beltrami, Dini and Levi-Civita. 
Beltrami2 was the first to observe that two nonproportional metrics 
(even on closed manifolds) can have the same geodesics. 
198 

199 
At the end of his paper2, Beltrami formulated the problem of describing 
all geodesically equivalent metrics (for surfaces.) It is not clear from the 
text whether he assumed the local or the global description; actually, his 
motivation came from a certain problem of cartography, which requires the 
global setting. Nevertheless, partially because of strong results of Dini, 
Levi-Civita, Weyl, E. Cartan and Eisenhart, the theory of geodesically 
equivalent metrics was mostly a local geometry. 
Locally, in a neighborhood of almost every point, a complete description 
of geodesically equivalent metrics has been given by Dini" for surfaces and 
Levi-Civita" for manifolds of arbitrary dimension. As a corollary of this 
description, one can show that, at least for dimensions two and three, every 
open manifold has non-proportional geodesically equivalent metrics. 
Later, geodesically equivalent metrics were considered by Weyl, E. Car- 
tan and Eisenhart. Weyl studied geodesically equivalent metrics on the 
tensor level and found a few tensor reformulations of geodesic equivalence. 
One of his most remarkable results is the constr~ction~~ 
of the projective 
Weyl tensor: if two metrics are geodesically equivalent, then their projec- 
tive Weyl tensors coincide. E. Cartans studied geodesic equivalence on the 
level of affine connections. He introduced the secalled projective connec- 
tion, which allows reconstruction of geodesics as unparameterized curves. 
In his book", Eisenhart systematically applied both methods and obtained 
a series of local results. 
It is clear that the classics such as Lie16, P a i n l e ~ k ~ ~ ,  
Levi-Civita and 
Eisenhart understood well the connection between integrable systems and 
geodesically equivalent metrics. But they did not use it, probably because 
they mostly were interested in the local aspects of geodesically equivalent 
metrics. 
Global aspects have been intensively studied since 50th, firstly by French 
(Lichnerowicz), Soviet (Rashevskii and Solodovnikov) and Japanese (Yano) 
geometry schools. But, probably because of the influence of earlier re- 
searcher, all known global results require fairly strong additional geometri- 
cal assumptions. 
Roughly speaking, one takes some geometric assumption written in ten- 
sor form, combines it with one of the tensor reformulations of geodesic 
equivalence and deduces some new object with global geometric properties, 
see the surveys of Mikes26 and Aminova 
Recently, it was found that integrable systems provides a very effective 
tool for understanding the topology of the manifolds admitting geodesi- 
cally equivalent metrics. We describe the connection between geodesically 

200 
equivalent metrics and integrable geodesic flows in Section 3.1. Roughly 
speaking, the existence of ij geodesically equivalent to g allows one to con- 
struct integrals for the geodesic flow of g ,  see Theorem 3.1 for details. If 
the metric g and ij are strictly-non-proportional, the geodesic flow of g is 
Liouville-integrable. 
2. Resent results 
Theorem 2.1. 24 Let M" be a closed connected manifold. Suppose two 
non-proportional Riemannian metrics g ,  
on M" are geodesically equiv- 
alent. If the fundamental group of M" is infinite, then there exist r E 
{ 1,2, ..., n - l}, a Riemannian metric 9 and foliations Br (of dimension r )  
and Bn-, (of dimension n - r) such that, in a neighborhood U ( p )  of every 
point p E M", there exist coordinates 
(573) =((21,22, '"> z r ) ,  ( ~ r 3 - 1 ,  
~ r + 2 ,  ..., Y n ) )  
such that the x-coordinates are constant on every fiber of the foliation 
Bn-,. 
n U ( p ) ,  the y-coordinates are constant on every fiber of the foliation 
B, n U(p), and the metric fj has the block-diagonal form 
r 
n 
i,j=l 
a ,j=r+ 1 
where the first block depends on the first r coordinates and the second block 
depends on the remaining n - r coordinates. 
Theorem 2.1 already gives us the complete list of all geodesically rigid 
closed surfaces": a closed connected surface is geodesically rigid if and only 
if its Euler characteristic is negative. 
More precisely, a closed connected surface of negative Euler characteris- 
tic has infinite fundamental group, and admits no one-dimensional foliation, 
so it is geodesically rigid. 
A closed connected surface of nonnegative Euler characteristic is not 
geodesically rigid: it is diffeomorphic to the sphere or the projective plane 
or the torus or the Klein bottle. Examples of nonproportional geodesically 
equivalent metrics on the sphere and on the projective plane were essen- 
tially constructed by Beltrami2. Since the geodesics of every flat metric are 
straight lines, every two flat metrics on the torus (or on the Klein bottle) 
are geodesically related (that is, there exists a diffeomorphism that takes 
the geodesics of the first metric to the geodesics of the second), so the torus 
or the Klein bottle are not geodesically rigid as well. 

20 1 
For dimension three, a direct corollary24 of Theorem 2.1 is 
Corollary 2.1. Suppose M 3  is a connected closed manifold. 
Suppose 
there exist nonproportional Riemannian metrics on M3 that are geodesically 
equivalent. Then, modulo the Poincare' conjecture, M 3  
is finitely covered 
by the sphere S3 or by the product F2 x S1, where F2 is a closed surface. 
It appears that Corollary 2.1 is t r ~ e ~ ~ v ~ ~  
also without assuming the 
Poincark conjecture: 
Theorem 2.2. Let nonproportional Riemannian metrics g and 
be 
geodesically equivalent on a closed connected three-dimensional manifold 
M 3 .  Then the manifold is homeomorphic either to a lens space or to 
a Seifert manifold with zero Euler number. Every lens space and every 
Seafert manifold with zero Euler number admits geodesically equivalent met- 
r i c ~  
which are nonproportional. 
Theorems 2.1,2.2 give us a complete list of closed connected manifolds 
of dimension two and three admitting nontrivial geodesic equivalence. It 
will be much more complicated to obtain such list in every dimension. But 
still, in every dimension TI 2 2, there exists infinitely many geodesically 
rigid r n a n i f ~ l d s ~ ~ , ~ ~ :  
Theorem 2.3. Every closed connected manifold admitting a Riemannian 
metric of negative sectional curvature is geodesically rigid. 
Note that in view of result of Bore17, in every dimension there exist infinitely 
many closed manifolds admitting metrics of negative sectional curvature. 
3. Methods and ideas 
3.1. Integrability fog. the geodesic flows of geodesically 
equivalent metrics 
New methods for the global (= on closed or complete manifolds) in- 
vestigation of geodesically equivalent metrics are based on the following 
obser~ation~'!'~-~~: 
the existence of g geodesically equivalent to g allows 
one to construct commuting integrals for the geodesic flow of g. 
Let g = ( g i j )  and 9 = ( g i j )  be Riemannian metrics on a manifold M". 
Consider the (l,l)-tensor L given by the formula 

202 
Then, L determines the family St, t E R, of (1, 1)-tensors 
St ef det(L - t Id) ( L  - t Id)-'. 
(3) 
Remark 3.1. Although ( L  - t Id)-' is not defined for t lying in the spec- 
trum of L, the tensor St is well-defined for every t. Moreover, St is a 
polynomial in t of degree n - 1 with coefficients being (1,l)-tensors. 
We will identify the tangent and cotangent bundles of M" by g. This 
identification allows us to transfer the natural Poisson structure from T* M" 
to TM". 
Theorem 3.1. If g ,  ij are geodesically equivalent, then, for every tl, t 2  E R, 
the functions 
Iti : TM" -+ R, Iti (w) ef g(St, (w), w) 
(4) 
are commuting integrals for the geodesic flow of g 
In other direction these theorem is wrong; a counterexample could be 
found in19. 
Theorem 3.2. l9 Suppose for every t E R the function It given by (4) is 
an integral for the geodesic flow of g .  If the Nijenhuis torsion NL vanishes, 
the metrics are geodesically equivalent. 
Theorem 3.3. 
torsion NL vanishes. 
Let g ,  tj be geodesically equivalent. Then the Nijenhuis 
3.2. What is special in these integrals? 
Definition 3.1. Two metrics g and 9 are strictly-non-proportional at 
5 E M", if all roots of P(t) := det(g - t g )  are simple. 
Let us assume that there exists a point where the metrics are strictly- 
non-proportional. Then, it is 
at almost every point, and the family It 
contains n integrals that are functionally independent almost everywhere. 
Hence, the geodesic flow of the metric is Liouville-integrable. 
Let us note that 
0 the integrals are quadratic in velocities, 
0 at every point 5 E M", the integrals (considered as quadratic 
forms) can be simultaneously diagonalizable. 

203 
Integrable systems with such propertieszg are known as Stackel systems. 
Locally, in a given coordinate system, it can be defined by using a (n x n)- 
matrix such that its columns depend on the corresponding coordinate only. 
Not every stackel system can come from geodesically equivalent metrics. 
The additional assumption is that the stackel matrix can be chosen to be 
a Vandermonde matrix. 
Stackel systems with such property were also intensively studied. One 
of the reasons for it that they satisfy Robertson'sz8 condition, which imply 
that its quantization is quantum-integrable as well. The second reasons is 
that all stackel systems coming from physics are of this type (or, a degen- 
eration of systems of this type). 
It is possible to showlg, that this extra-condition is also a sufficient 
condition for the existence of geodesically equivalent metrics. 
The systems with this condition appear independently and under dif- 
ferent names (L-systems, Benenti systems, quasi-bihamiltonian systems) in 
works of different  author^^^^^^^. 
3.3. If the metrics are strictly non-proportional 
Theorem 3.1 can be used most efficiently when there exists a point of a man- 
ifold where the metrics are strictly-non-proportional. Then, the geodesic 
flow of g is Liouville-integrable, and we can apply the well-developed ma- 
chinery of integrable systems. For example, the following theorem follows 
directly from Theorem 3.1 and Taimanov3'. 
Theorem 3.4. Suppose M" is a connected closed manifold. Let the real- 
analytic Riemannian metrics g and g on M" be geodesically equivalent. 
Suppose there exists a point of the manifold where the metn'cs are strictly- 
non-proportional. Then, the following statements hold. 
(1) The first Betti number bl(Mn) is not greater than n. 
(2) The fundamental group nl(M") is virtually Abelian. 
The integrals are quadratic in velocities. Combining this fact with topo- 
logical obstructions1* for the existence of quadratically-integrable geodesic 
flows on closed surfaces, we obtain Theorem 2.3 for dimension two18. 
Note that, in view of results31, Corollary 2.1 follows from Theorem 3.4 
under the additional assumption that the metrics are real-analytic and that 
there exists a point where the metrics are strictly-non-proportional . 

204 
3.4. Geodesic equivalence and zero entropy 
All results of this section are joint with Kruglikov; the proofs will be pub- 
lished elsewhere. 
It is expected, that an integrable geodesic flow has zero topological en- 
tropy. This is not always the case. There are  example^^,^ of integrable 
flows with non-zero entropy. But still it is possible to show that if the in- 
tegrals come from strictly-non-proportional geodesically equivalent metrics 
by applying Theorem 3.1, the topological entropy of the geodesic flow must 
be zero. 
Theorem 3.5. Suppose the Riemannian metrics g, ij o n  a closed con- 
nected M" are geodesically equivalent. Suppose there exists a point where 
the metrics are strictly non-proportional. Then, the topological entropy of 
the geodesic Pow of g is zero. 
Combining this theorem with the famous Yomdin's Theorem", we obtain 
Corollary 3.1. Suppose the Riemannian metrics g, g o n  a closed con- 
nected M" are geodesically equivalent. Suppose there exists a point where 
the metrics are strictly non-proportional. 
Then, the manifold is finitely 
covered by the product of a rational-elliptic manifold and the torus. 
3.5. General case 
We will sketch the proof of Theorem 2.1. Consider the (1,l)-tensor L given 
by the formula (2). All its eigenvalues are real. At every point x E M", let 
us denote them by A l ( x )  5 ... 5 A,(x). It appears that they are globally 
ordered23,24,25. 
Theorem 3.6. Let (Mn,g) be a connected Riemannian manifold. Sup- 
pose every two points of the manifold can be connected by a geodesic. Let 
Riemannian metric ij on M" be geodesically equivalent to g. 
Then, for every i E { 1, ..., n - l}, for all x, y E M", the following holds: 
(1) Xi(.) I 
Xi+l(Y). 
(2) If Xi(%) < Xi+l(x) f o r  some x E M", then Xi(.) 
< Xi+,(z) f o r  
(3) If Xi(.) 
= Ai+l(y), then there exists z E M" such that Xi(.) 
= 
almost every point z E M". 
Xi+l ( z ) .  
Thus, if g and 
on closed connected M" are geodesically equivalent, 
then the following two cases are possible: 

205 
Case 1: There exists r E (1, ..., n - 1) and a constant X E R such that, for 
every x E M" 
&(x) < < Xr+l(x). 
Case 2: The following two conditions hold: 
(i) For every r E (1, ..., n -  l}, the maximum maxcM-(X,(x)) is 
equal to the minimum minxEMn (Xr+l(x)). 
(ii) At least one of the eigenvalues of L is not constant. 
In the first case, it is possible to canonically construct24 the metric 4 
Let us explain where the foliations are coming from. At every point 
and the foliations B, and Bn-, as in Theorem 2.1. 
x E M", let us denote by Vr(x) 
(Vn-,(x), respectively) the sum 
r 
n 
B E " ,  ( @ Ex,, respectively) 
i=l 
i=r+l 
where Ex, E TxMn is the eigenspace corresponding to Xi. 
Under the assumptions of Case 1, V, and Vn-, are smooth distributions 
of dimensions r and n - r .  By Theorem 3.3, they are integrable. Then, 
they generate two foliations B, and Bn-,.. 
The construction of the metric ij from Theorem 2.1 is based on the 
classical Levi-Civita's Theorem 15. 
In the second case, it is possible to show that the fundamental group 
of the manifold is finite. The key instrument for it is Theorem 6 of the 
paper24 which, roughly speaking, tells us that every (closed) manifold with 
two geodesically equivalent metrics satisfying (i), (ii) has a closed submani- 
fold U with two geodesically equivalent metrics satisfying (i), (ii) such that 
the natural homomorphism Id, : nl(U) ---$ nl(Mn) is a surjection. Conse- 
quently applying this theorem, we come to one of the following subcases: 
SC 1: The dimension n of the manifold M" is q + 1, where q 2 1. The 
eigenvalues X1 = ... = A, 
= X are constant, the eigenvalue Xq+l is 
not constant and there exists z E Mq+l such that Xq+l(z) = A. 
SC 2: The dimension n of the manifold M" is 2. The eigenvalues X1 and 
A2 are not constant and there exists a point z E M 2  such that 
SC 3: The dimension n of the manifold M" is q + 2, where q 1 1, the 
eigenvalues X1 and X,+z 
are not constant and there exist z1,q E 
M" such that Xl(z1) = X,+z(z~). 
def 
Xl(2) = X,(z). 

206 
SC 4: The dimension n of the manifold M" is n = q + r + 1; q > 0, r > 0. 
The eigenvalues A1 = A2 = ... = A, 
and Xr+2 = X,+3 
= ... = A, 
are 
constant. The eigenvalue Ar+l is not constant. There exist points 
ZO, z1 E M" such that Xr+1(zo) = XI and X,+l(zl) = An. 
It is possible to 
that in all four subcases the fundamental group 
in finite.

A TRANSCRITICAL-FLIP BIFURCATION IN A MODEL 
FOR A ROBOT-ARM 
H.G.E. MEIJER

1. Introduction 
Nowadays it is almost a routine exercise to obtain a bifurcation diagram 
in two parameters given a specific model. In such a diagram, codimension 
two bifurcation points act as organizing centers of the bifurcation curves. 
Near such points bifurcations are rooted or they interact giving rise to 
complicated phenomena. The specific model may have a large number of 
coordinates such that in itself detecting the codimension two point is one 
step, the interpretation of the dynamics is the final goal. To this end normal 
forms are a useful tool in bifurcation analysis. It allows one to study the 
essence of the dynamical/topological changes when parameters are varied 
near their critical values. In generic examples one meets these changes on 
a low dimensional manifold, called the center manifold. At the codim two 
point we have a critical normal form. 
A priori it is not clear how one can relate normal form analysis to a 
specific model. In this paper we recall from how to perform the reduction 
of the map to the critical normal form in general. Then the algorithm for 
one codim 2 bifurcation is given as in 
and the unfolding for a specific 
example from 3,4 is studied. 
2. The method 
We consider a map x H F(x,a) with x E Rn,a E R". 
Without loss 
of generality the bifurcating fixed point is zo = 0 for Q = 0. Assuming 
sufficient smoothness of F ,  we write 
(1)

F ( z )  = Ax + -B(z, Z) + -C(Z,X, Z) + 0(11~11~),

where 1 1 ~ 1 1  = 
and the components of the multi-linear functions B and C are given by 
is the standard scalar product in R" and A = FZ(O) 
for i = 1,2, . . . , n. We want to describe the dynamics on the center mani- 
fold. In other words, we want a map G on the center manifold H such that 
G is the restriction of F to H .  We assume that G has been put into normal 
form up to a certain order. We write 
w I-+ G(w), G : IRnC -+ R"', 
x = H(w), H : IRnc -+ R", 
and 
where u is a multi-index. Since the critical center manifold is invariant, we 
obtain the following homological equation : 
H(G(w)) = F ( H ( w ) ) .  
(2) 
Now the coefficients of G and H can be found in an iterative way by ex- 
panding Eq. (2) in powers of w. In this way we obtain for each h, a linear 
system Lh, = R,, where L is a matrix defined in terms of the Jacobian 
matrix A and its critical eigenvalues. 
The R,'s of the linear systems depend on the coefficients of F, G and H 
of order less than or equal to IuI. When R, involves only known quantities, 
the equation has a solution, because either L is nonsingular or R, satisfies 
F'redholm's solvability condition (p, R,) = 0, where p is any null-vector of 
the adjoint matrix zT. 
If R, depends on a critical coefficient g ,  of G, then 
L is singular and the solvability condition gives the expression for g,. 
For codim two bifurcations we may need to find h,, while L is singular. 
Let the one-dimensional null-space of L and zT be spanned by q resp. p .  
Then we construct the bordered nonsingular (n + 1) x (n + 1)-system 
(j2) 
(:) 
= ($ 
(3) 
where s is a complex variable. We write x = LINVy. Since the vector at 
the right-hand side is orthogonal to the critical eigenspace of the eigenvalue 
0, we will find that s = 0.

3. Results for a Fold-Flip bifurcation. 
Here the formulas to compute the critical hypernormal,' form for a fold- 
flip(FF) bifurcation are given. Neimark-Sacker(NS) bifurcations of period 
2 fixed points may arise and stability of the invariant circle and period- 
doubled solutions can be determined by considering cubic terms as well. 
Then a model for the control of a robot arm is considered, where a 
transcritical-flip(TF) bifurcation is found. This example has also been con- 
sidered in 4, however there only quadratic terms were taken into account 
and the unfolding for a FF-bifurcation was considered, instead of the TF- 
unfolding. 
3.1. Fold-Flap 
We include here the results from ', where the formulas for center manifold 
reduction for the fold-flip bifurcation have been derived. This bifurcation 
is characterized by two simple eigenvalues on the unit circle. The Jacobi 
matrix A has the simple eigenvalues X l , 2  = fl. The critical hypernormal 
form is

3.2. An example 
We consider a simple robotic arm which is modeled as a planar double 
pendulum 3,4. Through two torques M1 and M2 the endpoint of the arm 
should be controlled to move on a circle. The equations of motion are

and M, = Ma,spec + AM, to measure deviations. 
To obtain stability the following control law was stipulated: AM1 = RI,!Jl 
and AM2 = R&/3. The above relations are inserted into the equations of 
motion and expanded in terms of I,!Ja, 4, 
and 4, 
for i = 1,2 up to third order. 
The third order approximation near the origin is enough to characterize 
almost all bifurcations of codimension one and two. This yields a four 
dimensional vector field with periodic coefficients as functions of 41 and 4 2  
and their derivatives. These can be expressed in terms of xg and yg. Then 
time was scaled such that the period is T = 27~. This affects the damping 
and control coefficients, see Eq. (6). 
Under variation of the control parameter R and the angular velocity w ,  
the stability of the origin, which is always a solution of the new system, is 
analyzed by considering the time-T map. This yielded a local bifurcation 
diagram with period-doubling and transcritical bifurcations, see Figure 1.

To conclude this example we interpret our results. The prescribed mo- 
tion is stable in region 1. It coexists with an unstable double period mode. 
If the input parameters for the robot are perturbed clockwise around the 
TF-point, the origin and the period-2 mode coalesce and the solution be- 
comes unstable. There is a nearby fixed mode, which is also of saddle type 
in region 2. The two saddles have a heteroclinic structure. We may say that 
the motion is completely unstable in region 2. If we go counterclockwise to 
region 4, the nearby mode becomes stable. Next in region 5, this nearby 
mode has lost stability by the flip-bifurcation and we have unstable modes 
and chaos again. In region 6 all modes coexist and are unstable. 
4. Conclusions 
We presented an efficient reduction to the critical normal form on the cen- 
ter manifold for a specific codimension 2 bifurcation. Other cases can be 
treated in a similar way, see ’. We also showed the power and limitations 
of critical normal forms. On the one hand we were able to characterize the 
dynamics, on the other we note that the unfolding was not generic. Here 
still more work can be done. 
In the example we performed the computations numerically. However, 
in general, there is no restriction to use symbolical expressions for the 
derivatives if they are available.

ALIGNMENT AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF 
LORENTZ-SIGNATURE TENSORS

We define the notion of an aligned null direction, a Lorentz-signature analogue 
of the eigenvector concept that is valid for arbitrary tensor types. The set of 
aligned null directions is described by a a system of alignment polynomials whose 
coefficients are derived from the components of the tensor. The algebraic properties 
of the alignment polynomials can be used to classify the corresponding tensors and 
to put them into normal form. The alignment classification paradigm is illustrated 
with a discussion of bivectors and of Weyl-type tensors. 
1. Introduction 
We consider the algebraic aspects of the equivalence and classification prob- 
lems in Lorentzian geometry. Let U be a representation of the Lorentz group 
G. The classification problem seeks a description of the orbit space U/G, 
and normal forms for the orbit representatives. The equivalence problem 
is the following question: given of u,ii E U ,  does there exist a g E G such 
that ii = g . u? 
In 4 dimensions, tensor classification is important for physical appli- 
cations, and in particular for the study of exact solutions of the Einstein 
equations6. Beyond the classical theory, there has been great interest in 
higher dimensional Lorentz manifolds as models for generalized field theo- 
ries that incorporate gravity8. The problem of tensor classification in higher 
 dimension^^>^ is therefore of interest. 
Rank 2 tensors are can be classified using eigenvalues and by considering 
the algebraic properties of the associated characteristic polynomial. In this 
paper we introduce the more general notion of an aligned null direction - 
a 
kind of Lorentzian eigenvector concept, but valid for arbitrary tensor ranks. 
In analogy with the characteristic polynomial, aligned null directions are 
21 5 

21 6 
the zeros of certain corresponding alignment polynomials. However , unlike 
the invariant , univariate characteristic polynomial, the alignment polyno- 
mials are multivariate covariants. The classification and equivalence analy- 
sis proceeds by considering the alignment polynomials’ invariant algebraic 
properties. 
Previously, alignment polynomials in 2 variables were used by Penrose 
and Rindlerg for the classification of maximally symmetric spinors in four 
dimensions. The Penrose-Rindler approach can be generalized by noting 
that the components of a Lorentzian tensor, of any symmetry type and 
in any dimension, can be naturally ordered according to boost weight. In 
essence, the n of the NP tetrad is counted with with weight 1, the t with 
weight -1, and the space-like components with weight 0. We will call a 
null direction t aligned with the tensor, if the components with the largest 
weight vanish along that direction. In 4D, the zero set of the Penrose- 
Rindler polynomial is just the locus of aligned null directions. 
We illustrate alignment-based classification by discussing bivectors and 
Weyl-type, rank 4 tensors. We provide a complete classification of bivectors 
in all dimensions, give normal forms. For Weyl-type tensors, we show that 
the 4D PND equation is equivalent to the alignment equations and hence 
has meaning in higher dimensions. However, we show that for N > 4, 
generically, these equations have no solutions. For more on the classifica- 
tion of higher-dimensional Weyl tensors see ‘. A discussion of some more 
theoretical aspects of alignment can be found in7. 
2. Alignment 
Our setting is the N-dimensional Lorentz-signature inner-product space. 
We define a null frame to be a basis .f = mo, n = ml, m2,. . . , m ~ - 1 ,  
satisfying eana = 1, miamja = d i j ,  with all other products vanishing. 
Throughout, Roman indices a, b, c, A, B, C range from 0 to N - 1. Lower 
case indices indicate an arbitrary basis, while the upper-case ones indicate a 
null frame. Space-like indices i, j ,  k also indicate a null-frame, but vary from 
2 to N - 1 only. We raise and lower the space-like indices using d i j ,  so that 
mi = mi. The Einstein summation convention is observed throughout. 
We let Q A B  denote a null-frame orthogonal matrix, and characterize a 
Lorentz transformation as a change of null-frame, riz, = mAQAB. 
The 
group of orthochronous’ Lorentz transformations is generated by null rota- 

21 7 
tions (l), boosts (2), and spins (3), which are transformations of form

'Let T = Tal...ap 
be a rank p tensor. For a given list of frame indices 
Al, . . . ,A,, we call the corresponding TA1...Ap 
a null-frame scalar. A Lorentz 
transformation QA, transforms the scalars according to 
In particular, a boost (2) transforms the scalars according to: 
~ A ~ . . . A ,  
= AbA1"'Ap TA,,..A~, 
b A  ,...A, = bA, f . . . + b,,, 
( 5 )  
where bo = 1, bi = 0, bl = -1. We will call bA1,..Ap 
the boost weight of the 
scalar TAI.,.Ap. 
Equivalently, the boost weight of TA1.,.Ap is the difference 
between the number of subscripts equal to 0 and the number of subscripts 
equal to 1. 
Let [k] = spank, kaka = 0 be a null direction and let t,n,mi, be 
an arbitrary null-frame such that t is a scalar multiple of k. We define 
b(k), the boost order along k, to be the maximum of all bA1,,,Ap 
for which 
TAl...Ap 
# 0. A null rotation about L fixes the leading terms of a tensor, 
while boosts (2)(5) and spins (3) subject the leading terms to an invertible 
transformation (4). It follows that the boost order does not depend on a 
choice of a particular null-frame, but rather on the choice of null direction 
spanned by k. Therefore, the definition of b(k) is sound; the boost order 
is the same for all null frames for which e E [k]. 
Finally, we let b,,, 
denote the maximum value of b(k) taken over all 
null vectors k, and say that a null vector k is aligned with the tensor T 
whenever b(k) < b,,,. 
In other words, an aligned null direction is one for 
which the leading boost-weight scalars vanish. The value of b,, 
depends 
on the rank and on the symmetry properties of the tensor T. Generically, 
for a rank p tensor, b,, 
= p.  However, if the tensor has some index 
skew-symmetry, then b,,, 
will be smaller than p. 
For example, for a bivector Kab = -Kba, we have b,, 
= 1; the corre- 
sponding boost weights are shown below. An aligned null direction corre- 
sponds to Koi = 0.

3. Alignment polynomials 
We now show that the set of aligned directions is a variety, the zero set of 
a finite number of polynomial equations. The set of all null directions is an 
N - 2 dimensional variety: 
PKN-2 = {[k] : k"k, = 2k0kl + kiki = 0). 
Affine coordinates zi = ki/kl are defined for every choice of null-frame. 
Over the real field, we regard [n] 
as a point at infinity, and identify IWPIKN-' 
with real extended space kNP2 
= RNP2 U {co}, the one point compactifi- 
cation of IWN-2 homeomorphic to the sphere SNP2. Complexified extended 
space CNP2 is the union of CNP2 with points at infinity having, respec- 
tively, the form [zzmi + n], and [zimz], 
where zizi = 0. 
Let T be a rank p tensor and mA a null-frame. For every choice of 
indices Al, . . . ,A, we define the polynomial 
P A ~ . . . A ~ ( z ~ )  
= T B ~ . . . B ~  
ABIAl(zi) ...ABP.,(zi), where 
(7) 
(8)

0 0  
A A B ( ~ i )  = ( - y z j  t ;;) 
is the matrix corresponding to a null rotation about n (c.f. equation (1)) 
with the parameters zi considered as complex indeterminates. 
By definition, a null vector k = t? - :CiCin + Cimi, is aligned with T if 
and only if zi = (i is a solution of the corresponding alignment equations 
~ A ~ . . . A ~ ( Z ~ )  
= 0, 
bA l . . . ~ p  = b a x .  
(9) 
Henceforth, we will refer to the pAl,,,Ap 
(zi), bA1.,,Ap 
= b,,, 
as the alignment 
polynomials corresponding to the tensor T. 
Of course, the alignment polynomials are only defined up to a choice of a 
null frame, and undergo a certain covariant transformation when the frame 
is changed. A Lorentz transformation riZB = mAQAB 
induces a change of 
afine coordinate, a birational transformation 
@(ii) = @A0 + @ A i  22 - ;@Al iiii. 
i - ; i z i z . i L  + 2riZi = q5 0 (&)a + &i)n + $hj(iZ)rnj. 
(11) 
The form for the transformation (10) follows from the relation 
(12) 

21 9 
A real transformation of form (10) is a conformal transformation of S", and 
is known as a Mobius transformation1. In terms of the affine coordinates, 
null rotations about n correspond to translations; null rotations about l? to 
inversions; boosts correspond to dilations; spins correspond to rotations. 
Proposition 3.1. Let mB = mAQAB 
be two complex null frames related 
by Lorentz transformation. The corresponding polynomials (7) are related 
by 
$ A ~ . . . A ~ ( % )  =

and where 4A,i denotes the partial derivative of 
Note that TAB = 0 for bB < b,, and hence $A,..,Ap depends only on pBl.,,Bp 
for which bB1...Bp 2 bAl.,,Ap. 
Hence, two sets of alignment polynomials, 
with respect to ii. 
P B ~ . . . B ~ ( Z ~ ) ,  
$ A , . . . A ~ ( & ) )  
~ A I . . . A ~

defined relative to different frames, are birationally related. Hence, on the 
open set of finite points, + o ( i i )  # 0, the zeros of 
and the zeros 
of the transformed $Al,,.Ap (&) coincide. 
4. Bivectors 
As per (7), the alignment polynomials for a bivector Kab are given by 
where 2, m j  are defined in (1). Expanding these expressions we obtain 
(15) 
1 i  
poj(Zi) = Koj + ziKij - zjKol - -2 ziK1j - zizjKi1. 
2 
Thus, the aligned null directions are the solution set of a system of N - 2 
quadratic equations in N - 2 variables. 
Proposition 4.1. The bivector alignment equations (15) admit a real zero. 
This follows because a complex null vector ka is aligned with K,b if and only 
if it is an eigenvector of the transformation Kab. Furthermore, in Lorentzian 

220 
signature, a skew-symmetric K a b  admits at least one real eigenvalue, and 
hence a real eigenvector. 
Henceforth, without loss of generality, we take n as an aligned real 
direction. Hence K 1 j  = 0, and the alignment equations assume a linear 
form: 
p o j ( ~ i )  
= Koj + ziKij - ~jKo1 = 0. 
(16) 
The attribute of consistency/inconsistency of system (16) partitions the set 
of bivectors into two classes; we will refer to these, respectively, as type I 
and type N bivectors,. Type I bivectors admit at least two real, aligned null 
directions. This is true if and only if equations (16) are consistent, or what 
is equivalent, Kol # 0, or K [ i j K k ~ O  = 0. Taking f2 and n as real, aligned 
null directions, and after performing a normalizing spin, type I bivectors 
admit the following canonical form: 
1NPI -1 
p= 1 
Type N bivectors admit only one real, aligned null direction. This is true if 
and only if Kol = 0, and K [ i j K k p  # 0. After a null-rotation about n and 
a spin, type N bivectors admit the canonical form: 
K a b  = Aon[,f!b] +

(18) 
p= 1 
The real scalar Ao, and the scalars A,, 
up to reordering, are invariants, and 
can be used to solve the equivalence problem. 
5. Weyl-type tensors 
we define a Weyl-like tensor Cabcd to be a traceless, valence 4 tensor with 
the well-known index symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor, i.e., 
Cabcd = -Cbacd = Ccdab, 
Cabcd f Cacdb + Cadbc = 0, 
Cabcb = 0. 
We let W, denote the vector space of N-dimensional Weyl-like tensors. It 
isn't hard to show that WN has dimension &(N + 2)(N + 1)N(N - 3). 
The maximal boost weight for a Weyl tensor is given by b,,, 
= 2. The 
Weyl alignment polynomials are given by

where 2, T?Zi are defined in (1). Since p0ioi = 0, the aligned directions are 
the solution set of a system of i N ( N  - 3) = i ( N  - 2)(N - 1) - 1, fourth 
order equations in N - 2 variables. 
In 4D, the principal null directions of the Weyl-like tensor are defined 
in terms of the so-called PND equationg: 
k b k [ , C a ] b c [ d k f ] k c  = 0, 
k"ka = 0. 
(20) 
It is easy to establish that the PND equations are just the homogeneous 
form of the alignment equations'. 
Proposition 5.1. For every dimension N ,  a null vector k" satisfies the 
PND equation (20) if and only if it is aligned with C a b c d .  
For N 2 4 we have $ N ( N  - 3) 2 N - 2, with equality if and only if 
N = 4. Thus, a four-dimensional Weyl-like tensor always possesses at least 
one aligned direction (see below). For N > 4, the number of equations is 
greater than the number of variables, and hence, generically, the alignment 
equations are inconsistent. 
Theorem 5.1. If N 2 5, then the subset of Weyl-type tensors possessing 
no complex aligned directions is a dense, open subset of W,. 
In other 
words, the generic Weyl-like tensor in higher dimensions does not possess 
any aligned null directions, not even complex ones. 
Let us now re-derive the well-known Petrov-Penrose classification of 
4-dimensional Weyl-like tensors using alignment. To facilitated the calcu- 
lations we switch to the NP tetrad: e = mo, n = ml m2, m21 = m2, with 
fana = 1, rn;m2la = -1. A null rotation about n now takes the form 
i = t+z' m2+z rnz,+zz' n, 
where zf = Z for a real transformation. Equation (19) gives the alignment 
polynomials, with p0202l = 0 because C a b & is trace-free. w e  also note that 
ai/az' = T?Zz, and aT?Z2/az' = 0. It follows immediately that dpo202/dz' = 
0. Hence, 
P0202(z, .') 
=P0202(z) = c0202(z - el)(. - c2)(z - c3)(z - c4) 
is a fourth degree polynomial of one complex variable. Furthermore, p02t02, 
is the complex conjugate of ~ 0 2 0 2 ,  and we deduce that, generically, there are 
- 
ii = n, riz2 = m2+z n, h2, 
= m2,+zfn, 

222 
16 complex aligned null directions: z = &,, z’ = 
, with p , q  = 1,2,3,4. 
The real aligned null directions correspond to z’ = 2. 
w e  also see that a real Cabcd is completely determined by the polynomial 
p0202(z), and that a change of null-frame transforms the latter by a Mobius 
transformation. The usual classification of the 4-dimensional Weyl tensor 
now follows by considering the root multiplicities of this polynomial. We 
have derived all this directly by means of the alignment paradigm; there 
was no need to invoke spinors.

We present a new scenario in the Renormalization Group Symmetry method, 
where we allow a Lie point symmetry operator which does not contain arbitrary 
functions. As a specific example, we give an exact solution for the adiabatic perfect 
gas dynamics. 
1. Introduction 
The explicit construction of exact solutions to a system of partial differen- 
tial equations (PDEs) of physical relevance is of great interest. Especially, 
when exact solutions contain arbitrary functions, these solutions may be 
used for solving general initial value problems. 
One of the most important tool to find an exact solution of a system of 
PDEs is the Lie group theory, which has been applied to solve a wide rage 
of problems in physics. If a system of PDEs is invariant under the action 
of an infinitesimal group of transformations, we can construct special solu- 
tions called similarity solutions or invariant solutions, which are invariant 
under the transformation admitted by the system. Invariant solutions can 
also be constructed for specific initial value problems. 
The renormalization group symmetry (RGS) method is introduced to solve 
an initial value problem for a system of PDEs. In this approach, construct- 
ing a special type of the Lie point symmetry called an RGS is the main 
ingredient. Initial value problems for some PDEs of physical interest were 
analyzed by means of the RGS method. All RGS operators obtained in the 
above studies depend on arbitrary functions, which support some arbitrari- 
ness of initial values through the (FSS) conditions (see below). However, 
except for relatively simple systems with good symmetries, it is rare to find 
an RGS operator with arbitrary function for the real system of physical 
223 

224 
interest. 
In this paper, we present another type of mechanism, which allows an RGS 
operator without arbitrary functions to support some arbitrariness of initial 
conditions. In our treatment, if possible, an RGS operator is determined so 
that the conditions of functional self-similarity become degenerate. Then, 
arbitrariness of initial conditions is ensured even by an RGS operator with- 
out arbitrary functions by virtue of the degeneracy condition. This scenario 
is illustrated for the dynamics of adiabatic perfect gas. 
2. RGS method to initial value problem 
The RGS method with Lie point symmetries consists of three steps. 
The first step is to calculate the Lie symmetries V admitted by the given 
partial differential equation. This step is carried out by “pr~longation”~ 
, 
where we consider a prolonged vector field on the manifold in the jet space 
that the differential equation refers to. 
In the second step, we restrict V on the solution of an initial value 
problem by imposing the invariant conditions called the FSS conditions. 
They are written as 
V(Ui - 02) 1 
= 0, 
- 
u;=ui 
where Ui is the j-th dependent variable and 0i is the solution of an initial 
value problem. 
The final step is to evaluate Eq.(1) at the initial time t = 0 and to find 
the desired RG-symmetries. If the Lie symmetries admitted by the given 
partial differential equation are expressed by an operator including arbi- 
trary functions, the RGS naturally contain arbitrary initial values 02 
’. 
Here, we consider the case that the Lie symmetries obtained in the first step 
do not include any arbitrary functions. The final step gives the following 
relations among initial values 0i 
:

If we can choose a Lie symmetry V so that Eqs. (2) are degenerate, 
we introduce some arbitrariness to the initial values and construct an exact 
solution corresponding to the initial values. In the next section, an explicit 
example of this approach is given for the gas dynamics.

We take the initial value problem for the equations that govern the motion 
of an adiabatic perfect gas. The equations of an adiabatic perfect gas and 
initial conditions are written in the following form

where p(t, x) is density, P(t, x) the pressure, v(t, x) = (u, w, w )  the velocity 
vector, t the time, x = (r, 8, z )  the cylindrical coordinates, y the adiabatic 
index. 
It is k n o ~ n ~ y ~ , ~  
that the Lie group of point transformation, that leaves 
system(3)-(5) invariant, constitutes a seven dimensional Lie algebra gener- 
ated by the following infinitesimal operators: 
if y =

projective group that is characterized by the infinitesimal operator:

4. Summary 
A new scenario in the RGS method is introduced to solve initial value prob- 
lems for a system of partial differential equations. The crucial step of our 
approach is to find a Lie symmetry admitted by the system, which satisfies 
a degeneracy condition for functional self similarity relations evaluated at 
the initial time. When we succeed in finding such Lie symmetry, an exact 
solution is constructed for an initial value problem including arbitrary func- 
tions even if the Lie symmetry itself does not contain arbitrary functions. 
As a specific example, we consider an initial value problem for the adiabatic 
perfect gas dynamics in the cylindrical geometry and obtain a solution con- 
taining an arbitrary function. This exact solution describes a contracting 
and expanding localized mass of gas.

REFINED COMPUTATION OF HYPERNORMAL FORMS 
JAMES MURDOCK 
Department of Mathematics 
Iowa State University 
Ames, IA 50011, USA 
This article is a short overview of 2. We first review the main ideas of 
hypernormal forms (also called unique normal forms and simplest normal 
forms), due primarily to Baider. Then we outline some new ideas based on 
”refinement.” Refinement does not result in normal forms that are different 
from Baider’s, but affects the method of calculation. For a thorough intro- 
duction to normal forms, see ’; section 4.10 concerns hypernormal forms. 
According to the Borel-Ritt theorem, a formal power series is the same 
thing as an equivalence class of smooth functions modulo flat functions. 
This means that “formal” calculations are actually “rigorous,” without be- 
coming involved with asymptotic series. 
A formal vector field on Rn with rest point at the origin is given by 
v(.) 
= 110(.) 
+ 111 (x) + v2(x) + . . . 
where v, belongs to the space Vi of homogeneous vector fields of grade i 
(degree i + 1). This grading is used because it adds under Lie bracket. 
A generator is a formal vector field starting with quadratic terms: 
g(.) 
= g1(.) 
+ . ‘ .  
(For the refined theory, we will want to classify generators by the grade j of 
their leading term, so that g = g3 + . . . with j 2 1.) The time-one map of 
a generator is a near-identity transformation that fixes the origin and has 
the identity as its linear term. The group structure on the near-identity 
transformations can be transferred to the generators in the form 
where [,] is the Lie bracket. This group of generators is called the Campbell- 
Hausdorfl group. Note that * is nonabelian but approximately equal to +: 
g * h = g + h + higher order terms. 
229 

230 
A consequence of this is that the group of generators has many abelian 
subquotients (that is, there are many pairs of subgroups, one a normal sub- 
group of the other, such that the quotient is abelian). One of the themes of 
normal and hypernormal form theory is to use actions of these subquotients 
whenever possible. 
The group of generators acts on the space of vector fields. We want to 
select a unique “simplest” element from each orbit and find the generator 
that moves a given vector field to the simplest one. But there is not always 
an obvious choice of what is simplest. A rule for picking the “simplest” is 
called a hypernormal form style. 
A vector field is normalized one degree at a time (or faster if quadrat- 
ically convergent algorithms are used). Therefore hypernormal form styles 
are presented as a family of subspaces of the vector spaces V,. 
A generator 
g = gj + gj+1 + ’ . ‘ 
starting with grade j acting on a vector field 
v = VO + v1 + .. . 
makes no change below grade j. The increment produced in grade j is 
If this is zero, the increment produced in grade j + 1 is 
[Sj , v11 + [Sj+l7 2101 
The same pattern continues up to the target term, the first term with a 
nonzero increment; if the target grade is k ,  the increment is 
[Sj, Vk-j] + . . ’ + [gk, 2/01. 
After the target term the increment becomes nonlinear in g. Since terms 
in g beyond grade k cannot affect the target term, the spaces rjk(v) of 
generators gi + . . . + gk that target the grade k in v are natural ones to 
consider. (In the Baider theory only j = 1 is considered.) 
Although the increment produced by a generator is always linear in v, 
and is linear in g up to the target term, the action of the group of generators 
on vector fields is a nonlinear action. 
The simplified action of generators on the target term is abelian and 
can be viewed as an action of an abelian group (and vector space) that is a 
subquotient of the group of generators (as discussed above). The term full 

231 
action will be used to distinguish the orginal nonabelian action from this 
simplified one. 
Generators that target grade k produce a vector space A k  C v k  of 
achievable increments (called the “removable space” by Baider). These can 
be used to move v k  into any subspace of v k  complementary to A k .  such’ 
a subspace is called a style in grade k and is a realization of the quotient 
The standard procedure for computing hypernormal forms involves two 
steps for each grade. In the first step, the simplified action is used to move 
the term of grade k into the desired style; the generator that achieves this 
is found by solving the linear system of equations 
Space V k / A k .  
[ g 1 , v o ]  = 0 
[a, 
011 + [gzvo] = 0 
[ g l , g k - Z ] + + . ” +  
[ g k - l , v O ] = O  
[gl , v k - l ]  f . ’ ’ + [ g k ,  W O ]  = old v k  - new v k .  
In the second step, the full action is used to compute the effect of this 
generator on terms of grade higher than k. 
The refined process breaks step one into a sequence of smaller substeps. 
First, a generator g k ,  homogeneous of grade k ,  is used to move Wk into its 
classical (not hyper) normal form (of some chosen style); the generator is 
selected via the classical homological equation of normal form theory. Next, 
the classical normal form is refined by using a generator g k - 1 - t  g k  of “lag 
one” that targets grade k. Next a generator g k - 2  + g k - 1  + g k  of lag two is 
used, and so on. At each substep the style space is refined, so that the new 
style space is a subspace of the previous one, and the space of generators 
to be used at the next stage is restricted so that (in addition to having the 
required target grade and lag) the admissible generators map the current 
style space into itself. This guarantees that what is accomplished in one 
substep is not undone later. 
It is clear that for this to be workable, there must be a way to compute 
the required spaces of generators for each substep. The generators g j  + 
. . . + g k  needed for grade k with lag k - j lie in a realization of a quotient 
space

(Here ?rjk : rj,k+l(v) + rjk(v) is the projection that drops the term of 
grade lc + 1.) The double quotient removes generators that have already 
been used, and ones that will not be used until later. The particular style 
choices that are made will affect the correct choice of realization of Fjk(w). 
(Recall that a realization is a complement of the denominator in the nu- 
merator .) 
Now the implementation of the method requires nothing but linear alge- 
bra. At first sight it would seem to require a great deal more linear algebra 
than the traditional method, which would be a step in the wrong direction, 
because there is already too much linear algebra to do effectively. This leads 
to the second new idea, the special row echelon form. It turns out that a 
modification of the standard row echelon form reduces the amount of linear 
algebra that must be done to determine the spaces GI!, used in the tradi- 
tional method, and at the same time permits determination of the Fjk(w) 
needed for the refined method without any additional row operations.

The following numerical example (which does not come from a normal
form problem) illustrates the notion of special row echelon form. The ma-
trix
already has its bands in reduced row echelon form, so step 1 has been done.
Step two results in
and then  a repetition of the steps produces

234 
This matrix is in special row echelon form; the pivot elements are marked 
by parentheses. 
In contrast to this example, an actual normalization problem is best 
done symbolically. A typical problem divides into many “cases,” charac- 
terized by the requirement that certain matrix entries are zero, others are 
nonzero, and the rest are unrestricted. (This sort of thing is familiar in 
bifurcation theory, where it is assumed that certain low order terms vanish, 
certain intermediate order terms that play a critical role are nonzero, and 
the remaining high order terms do not matter for the final result.) Once 
these assumptions are specified, it is possible to compute the special row 
echelon form, in particular (and most importantly) the positions of the 
pivot elements. From here the Fjh(w) and the hypernormal form can be 
determined. The familiar example of the anharmonic oscillator (or single 
center) is worked out this way in 2; this is one of the few examples that 
has been fully solved, and has repeatedly been used as a test case when 
new methods are introduced. It is hoped that the present methods will be 
helpful for problems not yet solved, and will be implement able in symbolic 
processing systems. 
Jan Sanders has shown, using homological algebra, that the computa- 
tions of hypernormal forms can be arranged into a spectral sequence. The 
ideas developed here allow a derivation of the Sanders spectral sequence 
without homological algebra (beyond a few definitions). It turns out that 
the Sanders spectral sequence involves some, but not all, of the refinement 
ideas described above. (It does not compute the smallest groups F’k(v) of 
generators.) There is also an easier (less detailed) spectral sequence gov- 
erning the original approach to hypernormal forms (without refinement). 
It is given in ’. 
Often the Lie algebra of vector fields is a direct sum of Lie algebras. 
In this case the notion of target t e r n  can be sharpened: a generator can 
have different target terms in different summands. This should lead to 
a “refined” theory of refinement; the way this works for the anharmonic 
oscillator is discussed in 2, but no general theory has been attempted. Al- 
ternative gradings of the Lie algebra have been used in this situation in the 
nilpotent case, but they do not work for the anharmonic oscillator. The 
relationship between alternative gradings and “refined refinement” should 
be investigated further.

NEW ORDER REDUCTlONS FOR 
EULER-LAGRANGE EQUATIONS

We present a generalization of the concept of variational symmetry, based on the 
new prolongations called A-prolongations. This will lead to new methods of re- 
duction for Euler-Lagrange equations. Some results related to the conservation of 
variational symmetries through successive order reductions are also presented. 
1. Introduction 
Most of well-known methods for obtaining exact solutions of differential 
equations are based on the existence of Lie symmetries. The knowledge of 
a Lie symmetry X of an ordinary differential equation 
A(x,u'"') = 0 
(1) 
implies that the order can be reduced by one, and we can recover the 
solutions of (1) from the solutions of the reduced equation by a quadrature. 
For special types of ordinary differential equations and symmetries (vari- 
ational symmetries) this reduction adopts a particularly simple form by 
associating with the symmetry a conservation law. This is done through 
Noether's theorem for differential equations that can be derived from a 
variational principle: 
L [ U ]  = 
L(z,u("))dz. 
(2) 
s 
It is well-known that there exists ordinary differential equations with- 
out Lie symmetries that can be reduced or integrated by using different 
methods. One of them, that explains a large variety of these processes, 
is based on the existence of C"-symmetries1-2. 
This concept arises 
from a new way of prolonging vectors fields. For a given vector field 
236 

237 
X = ((x,u)& + q(x,u)d, defined on M c X x U and for an arbitrary 
function A E C"(M(l)), the A-prolongation of order n of X, denoted 
by X [ ' I ( ~ ) ] ~  
is the vector field defined on 
by 
For this kind of prolongations it is possible to calculate a complete 
system of invariants by derivation of lower order invariants3. This is the 
key to construct new methods of order reduction, based on the existence of 
C" -symmetries'. 
The objective of this paper is to investigate the concept of variational 
symmetries when A-prolongations are considered. This leads us to intro- 
duce the concept of variational C" -symmetry and create new methods of 
reduction for Euler-Lagrange equations. In particular] we prove that a vari- 
ational C" -symmetry of a given Euler-Lagrange equation provides a re- 
duction by two; this is a "partial" reduction, meaning that a one-parameter 
family of solutions of the original equation is lost when the reduced problem 
is considered. 
Whereas a one-parameter variational symmetry group will, in general, 
alow one to reduce the order of the Euler-Lagrange equations by two, it 
is not true that a two-parameter variational symmetry group allow one to 
reduce the order by four4. In this paper we also show some applications of 
C"-variational 
symmetries to this problem. 
2. The concept of variational C" -symmetry 
Let us consider a variational problem (2) where the Lagrangian L(x, ~ ( ~ 1 )  
is defined on M("), for some open set M of the space of the variables X x U. 
Let 
n 
E[L] C(-D)'(&,L) = 0 
(5) 
i = O  
be the associated Euler-Lagrange equation] where D stands for the total 
derivative operator with respect to x. To simplify the notation, we will 
denote by A the space of smooth functions depending on x, u and derivatives 

238 
of u up to some finite, but unspecified, order and we write P[u] = P(z, u ( ~ ) )  
if we do not need to precise the order of derivatives that P depends on. 
Roughly speaking, a variational symmetry group of the functional (2) 
is a local group of transformations that leaves the variational integral C 
unchanged when u = f(z) 
is transformed by the action of the group. The 
infinitesimal criterion of invariance*, characterizes the infinitesimal genera- 
tors of connected groups of variational symmetries. They are the vector 
fields v = ((z, u)& + q(z, .)au such that 
v ( ~ ) ( L )  
+ LD(C) = 0. 
The hypothesis that the vector field X generate a group of variational 
symmetries is overly restrictive to deduce the existence of a conservation 
law. This motivates a generalization of a variational symmetry: the in- 
finitesimal divergence symmetries are the vector fields 21 such that 
v ( ~ ) ( L )  
+ LD(0 = D(B) for some B E A. 
This concept and the A-prolongation formula inspire the following gen- 
eralization of the definition of variational symmetry: 
Definition 2.1. A vector field X = ((x, u)& + q(z, u)& is a variational 
C"-symmetry 
of the functional C[u] = S L ( ~ , u ( ~ ) ) d z  
if there exists 
B[u] E A such that 
x[x!(n)I(L) 
+ L(D + A)(() = ( D  + A)(B), 
for some A E C"(M(l)). We also say that X is a variational A-symmetry 
to precise the function A for which (6) is satisfied. 
3. Order reduction through variational Cm -symmetries 
It is well-known that one-parameter symmetry groups of ordinary differ- 
ential equations allow us to reduce the order of the equation by one. Due 
to the special structure of an Euler-Lagrange equation, the knowledge of a 
variational symmetry allows us to reduce the order by two4. 
Since C"-symmetries, 
as well as Lie symmetries, have associated a 
method of reduction, we can expect new order reductions procedures for 
Euler-Lagrange equations arising from variational C" -symmetries. 
Theorem 3.1. Reduction of order 
Let C[u] = S L(z, ~ ( ~ ) ) d a :  
be an n-th order variational problem with 
Euler-Lagrange equation Eu[L] = 0, of order 2n. Let X be a variational 

239 
A-symmetry, where A E C"(M(l)). Then there exists a variational problem 
z [ w ]  = s z ( y ,  w("-l))dy 
A 
of order n - 1, with Euler-Lagrange equation of 
order 2n - 2, E, [L] = 0, such that a (2n - 1) -parameter family of solutions 
of EzL[L] 
= 0 can be found by solving a first order equation from the solutions 
of the Euler-Lagrange reduced equation E,[L] = 0. 
Proof. Let us introduce a change of variables y = y(x, u), a = a(%, 
u) 
such 
that X takes the form 2 = a, in the new coordinates. 
Let C[a] = s ?;(y, a("))dy be the corresponding variational problem in 
coordinates ( y , a ) .  It can be checked' that the vector field 
remains as a 
variational X-symmetry, where A is the function D,a.A in new coordinates, 
and the next relation holds: 
I 
--- 
Let us observe that [2fi>(")l,Dy] 
= AX[xi(")I, which applied to any 
function g provides: 
Let us consider any function A such that B = -&(A). Then the La- 
grangian 
2 = Z ( y ,  a(")) + D,(A) 
(9) 
and 
we get 
have the same Euler-Lagrange expression, E,[z], and by (7) and (8) 
jp?(")l(z) 
= 0, 
(10) 
Let w = w(y, a, 011) be a first order invariant for 2[',(')1, 
that is 
a,(w) + xa,, ( w )  = 0. 
(11) 
A very important property of A-prolongations is that a complete sys- 
tem of invariants for the n-th order A-prolongation can be constructed 
by successive derivations of lower order invariants3. In this case, by suc- 
cessive derivations of w with respect to y we get a system of coordi- 
nates { y ,  a, w, . . . , wn-l}, such that X[xr(")I = a,. Let us also denote by 
z(y, WJ(~-')) the Lagrangian 2 
in the (y, a, w("-')) variables, that by (10) 
does not depend on a. 
By means of the transformation { y  = y,w = w ( y , a , a l ) }  we get 
the following relation between E,[z] and the Euler-Lagrange equation of

(see Ref. 4, Exercise 5.49): 
Therefore, by (11): 
Ea[Q = ( D y  +X)[-dal,(w)Ew[ZlI. 
(12) 
Let us denote by w = H ( y ,  C1, . . . , &-2) 
the general solution of the 
reduced Euler-Lagrange equation Ew[z] 
= 0. When w is written in terms 
of { y ,  a, a1} we get the first order ordinary differential equation for a: 
w(y,a,a1) = H(Y,Cl,"' ,C2n--2). 
(13) 
From its general solution a = G(y, C1,. . . , Czn-l) we obtain a (2n - 
1) -parameter family of solutions 
a(x, U )  = G(Y(x, u), C I ,  
' '  ' , Gn-1) 
to the original Euler-Lagrange equation EU[L] = 0.

4. Conservation of variational symmetries by order 
reduct ions 
When an ordinary differential equation admits some r-dimensional symme- 
try solvable algebra S ,  the order of the equation can be reduced through r 
successive one-order reductions. Recently, the C" -symmetries theory has 
successfully been applied to carry out step by step methods of reduction 
that are even valid for non-solvable symmetry 
Since a variational symmetry allows us to reduce the order of Euler- 
Lagrange equation by two, one could think that two-parameter variational 
symmetry algebras (always solvable) allow us to reduce the order by four. 
This assumption is not true in general (see Ref. 4, Exercise 4.11). 
Motivated by the power of the Coo-symmetries theory in step by step 
methods of reduction, we can expect variational C" -symmetries become 
an important tool to solve this problem. This is proved in next theorem. 
Theorem 4.1. Conservation of variational symmetries 
Let C[u] = s L C ( ~ , u ( ~ ) ) d x  
be a variational problem that admits a two 
dimensional non-abelian algebra G of (strict) variational symmetries. Let 
X1 and X2 be two generators of 6 such that [Xi, 
X,] = cX1, c E R. For 

241 
v E R, let zv[w] 
be the one-parameter family of reduced variational prob- 
lems obtained by using X2. Any of them inherits from Xi a variational 
C" - symmetry. 
Proof. Let {y,a} be a system of local coordinates where X2 takes the 
form 8, and let Z(y, a l , .  . . , a,) be a Xz-invariant Lagrangian equivalent 
to L (see Ref. 4, pag. 257 for details). Since X I  remains as a variational 
symmetry under changes of variables, we get 
xp(z) + ZD,(Xl(Y)) = 0. 
(14) 
The one-parameter family of reduced variational problems obtained by 
v E R, where 
Xi"'(Z - va1) + (Z 
- ~/ai)D, 
(Xi (y)) = -vX~") (a1 ) - valD, (Xi (y)). (15) 
When both members of [Xp),D,] = -Dy(X1(y))Dy (see Ref. 7) are ap- 
plied to a, we get Xl"'(a1) - DY(Xjn)(a)) 
= -Dy(X1(y))al. Therefore, 
(1 5) becomes 
Xi"'(z - V ~ I )  + (Z 
- Val)Dy(X1(y)) = DY(Xin'(-va)). 
using X2 can be written as Lv[w] 
= s(Z(y, d n - l )  )-vw)dy, 
w = a1. For v E R and by (14), we can write 
(16) 
Let f be any function such that X2(f) = cf. In coordinates y, a}, we 
m E N. By Lemma 5.1 in Ref. 1, we also have fXi"' = (fX1)['?(")1, for 
the function X = -+ 
= -ca1. Relation (16) can be written as follows: 
can choose, for example, f(y, a) = eca. Then we get [fx,'"), 
Xi" \ ] = 0 for 
D f  
(17) 
(fXl)[',(,)l(Z - Val) + (Z 
- val)(Dy + X)(fXl(Y)) 
= (D, + X)(fXi"'(-va)). 
Since [fXi"',Xi"'] 
= 0 and fXi"' = (fX1)['~(")1, for m E N, the in- 
finitesimals of the vector field (fX1)['~(")l do not depend on a. Let us 
denote fX1 = C ( Y ) ~ ,  + v(Y)&. 
Let 7r, 
be the projection r,(y,a,... 
,a,) 
= (y,al;.. ,a,), 
for 
m E N. For any m E W, the vector field (fX1)['-(")1 is 7r,-projectable. 
Let us denote Y1 = (~1)*((fX1)['~(~)]). 
It is also clear that Yi-cal'(m)l = 
(7rm)*((fX1)[',(")]). If we set w = a1, (17) becomes 
(18) 
Y;-cw,(n)l(Z - vw) + (Z - vw)(D, - cw)(((y)) 
= ( 4 4  - CW)(-V77(Y)). 
This proves that Y1 is a variational (-cw)-symmetry 
of the corresponding 
reduced problem.

242 
4.1. An example 
It is well-known that any Lagrangian of the form L(z, 2) 
admits XI = 8, 
and X2 = .a, 
as (strict) variational symmetries (see Ref. 4, Exercise 4.11). 
It is clear that [Xl,Xz] = XI. The one-parameter family of X2-reduced 
problems are defined by the Lagrangians 
(19) 
W1 
L(Y, ; 
+ w) - vw, 
v E R, 
where y = x and w = a. 
According to Theorem 4.1 the inherited 
Cco-symmetry Y1 = -waw is a variational Cm-symmetry, for A = -w : 
Y p ) ]  
(L(y, 
+ w) - vw) = vw = ( D  - W)(-v). 
Now we use Theorem 3.1 to reduce again the order of the Euler-Lagrange 
equations associated to (19). A complete system of invariants of Yp,(’)l = 
-wa, + (w2 - wl)dw, is given by { z  = y,p = w + %,PI} and let us 
consider p = -ln(w). In terms of coordinates {z,P,p,pl,p2} the vector 
field Y/[x’(l)l becomes 8,. To construct the corresponding Y,[x’(l)l 
-invariant 
Lagrangians given by (9) we consider A = -up. In this case, (9) becomes 
L ( z , p )  - vp, for v E R, in coordinates {z,p,p,pl,p2}. The associated 
reduced Euler-Lagrange equation is given by 
L(OJ) ( z ,  p) - v = 0. 
(20) 
When this (algebraic) equation is solved, we get p = H ( z ,  v). By setting 
z = y and p = w+% we obtain the first order ordinary differential equation 
w + 2 = H(y, v). Let us denote by w = G(y, v, Cl), C1 E R, its general 
solution. Since w = %, by solving the first order ordinary differential 
equation u, = u. 
G(x, v, C1) we obtain a three parameter family of solutions 
to the original Euler-Lagrange equations. 
5. Conclusions 
In this paper we have obtained a generalization of the concept of variational 
symmetries for Euler-Lagrange equations based on A-prolongations. 
As well as standard variational symmetries, we have proved that varia- 
tional Cm-symmetries allows us to reduce by two the order of the Euler- 
Lagrange equations. This is a “partial” reduction, meaning that, in general, 
a one-parameter family of solutions can not be derived from the solutions 
of the corresponding reduced equation. It corresponds to solutions of the 
Euler-Lagrange equation for which the expression in the brackets of second 
member of (12) is neither null nor constant. In other words, in general, that 

expression is not a first integral of the Euler-Lagrange equations. This can 
also be interpreted in terms of the formulation of Noether's theorem when 
A-prolongations are considered, and we will be dealt with in a separate 
paper'. 
Finally, we have shown how the new theory provides a method to reduce 
by four the order of equations with 2-parameter non abelian variational 
symmetries.

Let G be a Lie pseudogroup acting on a manifold M .  In this paper we show 
that under a mild regularity condition the orbits of the induced action of G on 
the bundle J"(M,p) of nth order jets of p-dimensional submanifolds of hl are 
immersed submanifolds of J n  ( M ,  p ) .  
1. Introduction 
Lie pseudogroups, roughly speaking] are infinite dimensional counterparts 
of local Lie groups of transformations. The first systematic study of pseu- 
dogroups was carried out at the end of the 19th century by Lie, whose 
great insight in the subject was to place the additional condition on the 
local transformations in a pseudogroup that they form the general solution 
of a system of partial differential equations] the determining equations for 
the pseudogroup. Nowadays these Lie or continuous pseudogroups play 
an important role in various problems arising in geometry and mathemat- 
ical physics including symmetries of differential equations] gauge theories] 
Hamiltonian mechanics] symplectic and Poisson geometry, conformal ge- 
ometry of surfaces] conformal field theory and the theory of foliations. 
Since their introduction a considerable effort has been spent on develop-

ing a rigorous foundation for the theory of Lie pseudogroups and the invari- 
ants of their action, and on their classification problem, see e.g. Refs. [5], 
[6], [7], [8], [ Q ] ,  [ll] and the references therein. More recently, the au- 
thors of the paper at hand have employed a moving frames construction 
[3], [4] to establish a concrete theory for Lie pseudogroups amenable to 
practical computations. As applications, a direct method for uncovering 
the structure equations for Lie pseudogroups from the determining equa- 
tions for the infinitesimal generators of the pseudogroup action is obtained 
(see, in particular, the work [l] on the structure equations for the KdV- 
and KP-equations) and systematic methods for constructing complete sys- 
tems of differential invariants and invariant forms for pseudogroup actions 
are developed. Moreover, the new methods immediately yield syzygies and 
recurrence relations amongst the various invariant quantities which are in- 
strumental in uncovering their structure, the knowledge of which is piv- 
otal e.g. in the implementation of Vessiot's method of group splitting for 
obtaining explicit noninvariant solutions for systems of partial differential 
equations. 
Let 8 be a Lie pseudogroup (a precise definition will be given in Sec. 2) 
acting of a manifold M .  The action of 8 on M naturally induces an action 
of 4 on the extended jet bundle J"(M,p) of nth order jets of submanifolds 
of M by the usual prolongation process. Our goal in this paper is to prove 
that under a mild regularity condition on the action of the pseudogroup 6 
on M the orbits of 6 in J"(M,p) are immersed submanifolds for n suffi- 
ciently large. We were originally lead to the problem in connection of the 
research reported in Ref. [4] and the result is of importance in the the- 
oretical constructs therein. Interestingly, as we will see, the submanifold 
property of 8 orbits in J"(M,p) is closely related to local solvability of the 
determining equations for the infinitesimal generators of the pseudogroup 
action on M .  The proof of our main result relies on classical work [la] on 
the structure of the orbits of a set of vector fields originally arising in the 
study of the accessibility question in the context of control theory. 
In Sec. 2 we cover some background material on Lie pseudogroups and 
discuss the regularity condition for pseudogroup actions needed in our main 
result. Sec. 3 is dedicated to the proof of the submanifold property of orbits 
of the action of 6 on the extended jet bundles J"(M,p).

2. Tameness of Lie Pseudogroups 
Let D = D ( M )  denote the pseudogroup of all local diffeomorphisms of a 
manifold. We write jy'p for the nth order jet of 'p E V at z and dn) 
: 
D(") + M for the associated jet bundle, where d")(j,"'p) 
= z stands for the 
source map. We furthermore write d") 
: 2%") 
-+ M ,  ~(")(j;'p) 
= ~ ( z )  
= Z 
for the target map. 
Definition 2.1. A subset Q c V is called a pseudogroup3 acting on M if 
(1) the restriction idlu of the identity mapping to any open 0 c M 
(2) if (p, $J E Q, then also the composition 'p o $J E Q where defined; 
(3) if 'p E G, then also the inverse mapping 'p-' E Q. 
belongs to Q; 
A pseudogroup G is called a Lie pseudogroup if, in addition, there exists 
N 2 1 so that the following conditions are satisfied for all n 2 N :  
(4) G(") c D(") 
is a smooth, embedded subbundle; 
( 5 )  n:+' 
: G("+') + Q(") is a bundle map; 
(6) a local diffeomorphism 'p of M belongs to G if and only if z -+ ji") 'p 
is a local section of a(") : @") + M ;  
(7) Q(") = pr"-NQ(N) is obtained by prolongation. 
We call the smallest N satisfying the above conditions the order of the 
pseudogroup, and unless otherwise specified, we will assume that n 2 N in 
what follows. Note that by (1) and (2), the restriction 'pp of a transfor- 
mation 'p E Q to any open subset 0 of the domain of 'p is again a member 
of the pseudogroup. 
Fix local coordinates (zl,. . . , zm) about some p E M ,  and let ( z , Z )  = 
(z', . . . , zm, Z', 
. . . ,Z") denote the induced product coordinates about 
(p,p) E D(O) = M x M .  Due to conditions (4) and (6) above, pseudogroup 
transformations are locally determined by a system 
Fa(z,Z(n)) 
= 0, 
a = 1,. . . , k, 
(1) 
of partial differential equations, the determining equations for Q. Here 
n 2 N is fixed and ( z ,  Z(")) 
stands collectively for the coordinates of D(n) 
induced by ( z ,  2). 
By Definition 2.1 the above equations are locally solv- 
able, that is, given a jet g?) = (zo,Zp') satisfying (l), then there is a 
solution 'p E 4 of the equations so that j!y"p = g:"). 
Let X = X ( M )  denote the space of locally defined vector fields on M .  
Thus the domain U ( v )  c M of v E X is an open subset of M .  The vertical

lift V(") of a vector field v E X to D(") 
is the infinitesimal generator of the 
local one-parameter group a:") of transformations acting on D(") 
defined 
by @i"'(jp'cp) 
= j?)(at o cp), where at stands for the flow map of v. Note 
that the domain of V(") is d")-'(U(v)). 
Pick v = C~="=,u(z)&a E X and write V = Cr=lVa(2)&a 
for 
the vertical counterpart of v. Then V(") is simply given by the usual 
prolongation formula2, 
m 
a=l lJl<n 
where J = (jl, . . . , j p )  is stands for a multi-index of integers, DJ =

CT=l CIJllo 
Z y j d p ,  and where the 2: denote the components of the fiber 
coordinates on D(") 
induced by ( z ,  2). In particular, at the nth jet IF) of 
the identity mapping, Eq. (2) becomes 
v g  = c c 
~2Jv"(z)dz;, 
(3) 
a=l IJl<n 
where we have again used the obvious multi-index notation. 
We denote the space of n jets of local diffeomorphisms with source at a 
fixed z E M by D(")12. It is easy to see that D(n)~2 
is a regular submanifold 
of D("). 
Write Rh(,) for the right action of a jet h(") E D(") 
on the source 
fiber D(")IT(n)(h(n)) 
= ~ ( " ) - ~ ( d " ) ( h ( " ) ) )  
by Rhcn,g(") = jz(n)(h(n))(cp 
o +), 
where h(") = j,"c,,(hc,,)+, g(") = jm(n,(hcn))cp. Then, by differentiating the 
identity 
R,(,) @.t")(g(")) = a p  (R,c,,g(")), 
it is easy to see that V(") is Rh(,)-invariant, that is, 
Rh(,) *(V(")(g("))) = V(")(Rh(,)g(")), 
(4) 
whenever d")(g(")) = d")(h(")). Note that the action of R,(,) on 
V(")(g(")) is well defined since V(") is a vertical vector field. 
Next let G be a Lie pseudogroup. A local vector field v E X on M is 
a G vector field if its flow map at is a member of G for all fixed t on some 
interval about 0. We denote the space of G vector fields by X,. 
The infinitesimal determining equations La(z,jp)v) = 0 for G vector 
fields v can be obtained by linearizing the determining equations (1) for G 

248 
at I?), that is, 
d 
dt 
~~(z,j?)v) 
= --~~(z,j!n)a~)I~=~ 
= o for all z E ~ ( v ) .  
( 5 )  
By (2), this is equivalent to the condition 
( v ( " ) F ~ ) ( ~ , I ? ) )  
= o for all z E ~ ( v ) .  
As a consequence of our definition of a Lie pseudogroup, the infinitesimal 
determining equations completely characterize 9 vector fields. 
Proposition 2.1. A local vector field v E X is a G vector field zf and only 
if 
L,(z,j?)v) = 0 
for all z E U ( v )  with some n >_ N .  
(6) 
Proof. We only need to show that a vector field v satisfying (6) is a G 
vector field. First note that equation (6) implies that V(") is tangent to 
G(") at I?) for all z E U(v). Thus, by the right invariance (4), V(") is 
tangent to G(") at any g(") E G(") n ~ l ( U ( v ) ) ,  
and, consequently, 
Q ~ ) ( I ? ) >  E @") 
for all t .  
(7) 
But (7) implies that 
32 '(")at 
E @") 
for all t and z E U(v), 
and consequently, at E 
for all t sufficiently small and thus v is a G vector 
field. 
Recall that the lift !$in) of the flow of v E X to D(") 
is tangent to the 
fibers D(")12. We thus obtain canonical mappings" A,(,) 
from the space 
Tg(n)D(n)12 
of D(")12 at g(") by 
of n-jets X,"', 
( 
2 = d")(g(")), of local vector fields into the tangent space 
(8) 
A g ( 4 3 Z  
4") v ) == v ( " ) ( g ( " ) ) .  
Proposition 2.2. The mappings 
A,(,) 
: xP)

D
(

,
 
where z = a(")(g(n)), z = d")(g(")), 
are well defined. 

249 
Proof. We only need to show that if vl, v2 are two local vector fields so 
that jg)vl = jg)v2, then 
V p ' ( g ( " ) )  = VP'(g(")) for all g(") with d")(g(")) = 2. 
(9) 
By (3), Eq. (9) holds for g(") = IF). But then, due to the invariance (4) 
of Vp', VP) under the right translations Rg(n), Eq. (9) must hold for all 
0 
Let G be a Lie pseudogroup and write G(7'),z = G(") n 2)(")1,. Note 
that @")lz 
is a regular submanifold of G("). In fact, the source mapping 
dn) 
restricted to ($")I, 
is of maximal rank as is seen by observing that for 
'p E 6, the local section jp'y of @"I 
-+ M yields a local right inverse for 
d"). 
By the proof of Proposition 2.2, the mappings A,(,) 
for g(") E G(") 
restrict to mappings from the n-jets of G vector fields Xg' 
at 2 = d")(g(")) 
into the tangent space Tg(n)G(n)~z 
of the source fiber Q(")I, at g("). 
Definition 2.2. A Lie pseudogroup G is called tame at order n provided 
that the mappings 
g(") with d")(g(")) = 2. 
A,(,, 
: X;;L 
--f T,(,,G("),, 
are isomorphisms for all g(") E @"). 
Remark 2.1. By Eqs. (2) and (3), the mappings A,(,) 
are automatically 
monomorphisms. Thus, by the right invariance (4), 6 is a tame Lie pseu- 
Thus in particular, when G is tame, the dimension of the space of n jets of 
4 vector fields at z E M is constant in z. 
Proposition 2.3. A Lie pseudogroup G is tame at order n i f  and only 
if the nth order infinitesimal determining equations for 6 vector fields are 
locally solvable. 
dogroup provided that A,!,) 
maps XG;i 
( 
onto T,i,)G("$, for all z E M .  
Proof. We can use ( 5 )  to identify the solution manifold of the nth order 
infinitesimal determining equations with tangent vectors w E TI!,)@") 1,. 
By Remark 2.1, a Lie pseudogroup is tame if and only if any w E T,!,,)G(")lz 
can be represented by a solution of the equations, that is, provided that 
0 
the infinitesimal determining equations are locally solvable. 
Remark 2.2. While the local solvability of the determining equations for 
G is built into Definition 2.1 of a Lie pseudogroup, as far as we know, 

250 
the infinitesimal version of the equations does not necessarily possess this 
property. However, as of yet, we have been unable to construct an example 
of a Lie pseudogroup with infinitesimal determining equations that are not 
locally solvable. 
3. Regularity of Orbits 
Definition 3.1. Call g(") E G(") reachable by G vector fields if there are

Next let V be a set of locally defined vector fields on a manifold M .  An

We write J" = J"(M,p) for the nth order extended jet bundle consisting 
of equivalence classes of p dimensional submanifolds of M under nth order 
contact and IP : J" -+ M for the canonical projection. We denote the 
action of a local diffeomorphism 'p E V on a jet z(") E J" by 'p(") . z("), 
where z = ~ " ( z ' " ) )  is contained in the domain of 'p. This action factors 
into an action of the diffeomorphism jet bundle V(") 
on J" in an obvious 
fashion. 
The infinitesimal generators of the action of V on J" are, by definition, 
the prolongations2 to J" of local vector fields on M obtained in local coor- 
dinates by the usual prolongation formula. Similarly, for a Lie pseudogroup 
G the infinitesimal generators of the action of G on J" are, by definition, 
prolongations of G vector fields to J". We let g(") c X ( J n )  stand for the 
Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators of 9. 
We denote the g(") orbit of a point z(") E J" by Oz(n) and the orbit 
of z(") under the action of G on J" by Oi(n). Then Oz(n) consists of the 
points 
where each vi is a G vector field. So obviously Oz(n) c OL(,,). Moreover, 
the orbit O;,,, agrees with the orbit of z(") under the induced action of the 
pseudogroup jet bundle G("), specifically, 
We call a Lie pseudogroup G connected if the subbundle G(") c V(") 
is 
connected. 
Theorem 3.3. Let 6 be a tame Lie pseudogroup at order n acting on M .  
Then the orbits of the action of Q on J" are immersed submanifolds of J". 
Proof. First assume that

the prolongation formula, the Lie algebra g(") of infinitesimal generators is 
everywhere defined on J". Thus by Theorem 3.2, the g(") orbits Oz(n) are 

253 
immersed submanifolds of J". Hence, to conclude the proof of the Theorem 
for connected pseudogroups, we only need to show that OL,,, c Oz(,). 
For this, note that by Theorem 3.1, any jet g(") E G(") can be expressed 
as 
where the vi are G vector fields and z = d")(g(")). Consequently, 
which shows that O:,,,

Next assume that G is not connected and let Gp) be a connected com- 
ponent of G(") distinct from the connected component GL") containing I("). 
Write Gp)lz = Gin) nG(n)lz 
and pick gp) E @")~z. Since G is tame, we can 
proceed as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 to show that any g(") E G$")iz can 
be expressed as

In this paper we report and discuss some recent results obtained investigating 
with numerical methods the celebrated Fermi-Pasta-Ulam 
model, a chain of non- 
linearly coupled oscillators with identical masses. We are interested in the evolution 
towards equipartition when energy is initially given to one or a few modes. Using 
the spectral entropy as a numerical indicator there is a strong suggestion that the 
relaxation time to equipartition increases exponentially with an inverse power of 
the specific energy. Such a scaling appears to remain valid in the thermodynamic 
limit. 
1. Introduction 
In the last 50 years many studies have been devoted to the so called “FPU 
paradox”, which arose from the report of Fermi, Pasta and Ulam [8]. 
In one of the first numerical works ever made they studied a chain 
of non-linearly coupled oscillators with identical masses (see appendix for 
details). Quoting from the original words of their paper: “The ergodic 
behavior of such systems was studied with the primary aim of establishing, 
experimentally, the rate of approach to equipartition of energy among the 
various degrees of freedom of the system”. 
They were interested in looking how long does it take for the following 
limit to be actually reached: 
where Ej is the harmonic energy of the normal modes and E is the total 
energy, starting with an initial condition such that, e.g., El = E. 
Surprisingly, in their experiments they could not see equipartition at

the harmonic energy of the first eight normal modes. It is possible to see a sort of quasi 
periodic motion, with energy almost completely regained by the first mode at the end 
of the simulation. Right panel: Initial conditions (empty circles) showing all energy 
given at time zero to the first mode, and averages over the whole simulation (full circles)

all. Quoting again from their work: '(Let us say here that the results of 
our computations show features which were, from the beginning, surprising 
to us. Instead of a gradual, continuous flow of energy from the first mode 
to higher modes, all of the problems show an entirely different behavior. 
(. . .) Instead of a gradual increase of all the higher modes, the energy is 
exchanged, essentially, among only a certain few. It is, therefore, very hard 
to observe the rate of 'thermalization' or mixing in our problem, and this 
was the initial purpose of the calculation". 
In Fig. 1 it is possible to see a simulation comparable with those ex- 
plored by Fermi and collaborators. Further investigation has shown that 
the sharing of energy, if it happens, takes a very long time that, at low 
energies, becomes unobservable even with the most powerful computers. 
In the attempt of understanding the mechanisms leading to the phenom- 
ena briefly described above, also in order to check their possible persistence 
in the thermodynamic limit, different conjectures have been proposed. 
Izrailev and Chirikov [14] suggested that the practically ordered mo- 
tion observed by Fermi could be explained in view of the KAM theorem. 

257 
Precisely they conjectured the existence of a threshold in energy, below 
which there is no equipartition: FPU original experiments were performed, 
according to these authors, below the threshold. But they claimed that 
such a phenomenon should be irrelevant in the thermodynamic limit. For, 
the energy threshold must fall to zero due to the increasing number of 
resonances created among normal modes when the number of particles N 
grows. It should be stressed that the applicability of the KAM theory has 
been proved only recently by Rink [15], in the case of the periodic FPU 
@-model. 
A different conjecture was proposed by Bocchieri, Scotti, Bearzi and 
Loinger [3]. They conjectured the existence of a threshold in specific en- 
ergy E = E I N ,  whose relevance is discussed in [ll, 12, 6, 41. Such a thresh- 
old could be connected with the more recent interpretation of the FPU’s 
phenomena based on Nekhoroshev exponential stability. Below the thresh- 
old, the equipartition might be reached, but only in times that increase as 
exp(Eca), with some positive a, i.e. times which could become longer than 
the lifetime of physical system under analysis (see, e.g., [lo, 91). 
After the formulation of the model, we will discuss some recent result 
about the rate of thermalization of FPU systems and its dependence on N ,  
concentrating in particular on papers [7, 1, 21. 
2. Natural packets: Two time scales 
A very direct way to observe the approach to equipartition is to plot the 
distribution of energy among the modes, like in the right panel of Fig. 1, 
at increasing times. For sufficiently low energy one clearly observes that 
the energy, initially given only to the first mode, spreads quite rapidly to 
a few low frequency modes. This is the first time scale. Then the system 
enters a kind of metastable state, characterized by an extremely slow flow 
of energy towards the highest modes, until equipartition is possibly reached 
on a second and much longer time scale. 
In the paper by Berchialla, Galgani and Giorgilli [l] the idea of consid- 
ering packets of modes is introduced. A packet of lenght s is defined as the 
set of the first s modes, with harmonic energy Es = El + . . . + E,. Starting 
with all the energy on the first mode means that all packets have initial 
energy E. If the system relaxes to equipartition, then the time average of 
E, tends to sE/N, i.e., the packet s has lost a fraction ( N  - s)E/N of 
energy. A critical time for a packet may be defined as the instant at which 
the packet s has lost an energy y(N - s)E/N. A plot of the critical time

Figure 2. Natural packets phenomenon. N = 15, energy initially on the first normal 
mode. It is clear the presence of two time scale: The first one concerning the rapid 
formation of the natural packet, and the second and longer one, related to the time 
needed for its destruction. 
for different energies is reported in Fig. 2, where different symbols refer to 
different packets. 
From such a picture it is clearly possible to distinguish the two time 
scales: The first one, which appears to be of power law type, related to the 
creation of the natural packet, and the second one related to its destruction 
and thus to equipartition of energy among all modes. In paper [l] it is also 
shown that the maximal frequency involved in the natural packet scale 
with specific energy as w N 
with no dependence from N in the range 
7 - 1023 (see [l], Fig. 7 ) .  
3. Equipartition times 
An attempt to give a quantitative estimate of the second time scale related 
to the equipartition is given, e.g., in the paper by De Luca, Lichtenberg 
and Ruffo [7]. They find a power law dependence of the kind T N E - ~ .  
Similar considerations are contained also in a paper by Casetti, Cerruti- 
Sola, Pettini and Cohen [5].

3.1. Numerical indicators 
The numerical indicators used in the papers cited above were respectively 
the spectral entropy in [7] and Lyapounov exponents in [5]. We briefly recall 
the relevant definitions relative to the first one: Introduce the quantities 
ej := Ej/ C j  Ej and define S := - Cj=l ej In e j ,  and neff := e S / N .  The 
latter quantity varies in [0,1] and can be interpreted as an effective number 
of modes involved in the dynamics. Fig. 3 represents the typical time 
evolution of such an indicator, for different specific energies in a @-chain.

3.2. Exponentially long times t o  equipartition 
An estimate of the relaxation time to eqipartition in the light of Nekhoro- 
shev theory has been performed in a subsequent work by Berchialla, 
Giorgilli and Paleari [2]. In order to compare the results with those in 
Ref. [7], the FPU @-model has been considered, with @ = 0.1, initial data 
with energy equally distributed on a packet of modes [v, 
w], 
i.e., 
with fixed frequency range. The specific energy has been varied in the range 
[0.0089,7.7] for N E (255,511,1023). For every one of these conditions 25

data very well. 
different orbits have been integrated, changing randomly the phases of the 
oscillators: The indicator used is the average over these different orbits. In 
order to see the scaling of the relaxation time with the specific energy, we 
plotted, for every E the time at which n,ff overcomes a fixed threshold, that 
we choose equal to 0.4. 
The results are illustrated in Fig. 4. There is a numerical evidence 
supporting the exponential scaling of relaxation times to equipartition with 
respect to specific energy, with a possible law of the type T N exp(e-lI4). 
3.3. Thermodynamic limit 
In order to check the persistence of these phenomena in the thermodynamic 
limit we repeated the same calculation as before varying N E [63,32 7671 
for a couple of fixed values of specific energies E E {0.052,0.14}. 
In Fig. 5 one clearly sees that, after an initial decrease of the times for the 
first low values of N ,  the subsequent points reported in the plot relative to 
values of N greater than 1023 remains practically constant, thus showing a 
numerical indication of the possible persistence in the thermodynamic limit 
of the phenomena presented in paper [2].

4. Further explorations 
We did not mention up to now the content of the paper [5]. They study the 
problem of the relaxation times to equilibrium using the maximal Lyapunov 
exponent, since they consider it a more reliable indicator. They explot the 
different behaviour of such an indicator for the FPU system and for the 
Toda chain, which is an integrable system “close” in some suitable sense to 
the FPU one. In such a way they are able to introduce an estimate of the 
relaxation times, which they find to scale as a power law. They also claim 
that for increasing N any stochasticity threshold vanish, thus conjecturing 
that the FPU phenomena are not relevant in the thermodynamic limit. 
In a forthcoming paper [13] we will investigate the dynamics of the FPU 
system through the use of Lyapounov indicators in order to better compare 
and discuss the results presented here with those of [5].

We show that, for long-wavelength initial conditions, the FPU dynamics is de- 
scribed, up to a certain time, by two KdV-like equations, which represent the 
resonant Hamiltonian normal form of the system. The energy cascade taking place 
in the system is then quantitatively characterized by arguments of dimensional 
analysis based on such equations. 
1. Introduction 
The problem posed by Fermi, Pasta and Ulam (FPU) [l] concerns “in large” 
the dynamical characterization of the approach to equilibrium of nearly- 
integrable Hamiltonian systems with many degrees of freedom, which is 
obviously relevant to build up a meaningful statistical mechanics. FPU 
considered weakly nonlinear oscillator chains, for initial conditions with 
energy in the lowest Fourier mode (the longest wavelength mode) and nu- 
merically integrated the equations of motion paying special attention to the 
evolution in time of the modal energies. As is well known, the expected fast 
trend to energy equipartition among the Fourier modes was not observed, 
which is what is known since then as the FPU paradox. For references on 
history, consequencies and relevant results in the field see [2, 3, 41. 
The aim of the present contribution is to look at the FPU problem from 
a somehow new point of view, which allows us to give some quantitative 
estimate of physically relevant quantities characterizing the transfer of en- 
ergy from large spatial scales, where it is put initially, to small ones or, 
in other words, from low Fourier modes (large wavelength) to high (short 
wavelength) Fourier modes. We will refer to such a process as to the energy 
cascade, or simply the cascade. The term is borrowed from the theory of 
hydrodynamic turbulence, which actually displays a phenomenology similar 
to that of the FPU problem. 
263 

264 
In the present paper, in order to avoid technical difficulties of minor 
importance, in place of considering the FPU model itself, we study the 
simpler problem of a class of PDEs which are naturally related to it. 
The structure of the paper is the following. First of all it is recalled 
how certain PDEs arise in the study of the FPU problem. Then we endow 
such PDEs with a proper Hamiltonian structure and suitably simplify them 
by performing one step of averaging. Finally, through dimensional analysis 
we give an estimate of the effective number n,ff of degrees of freedom 
sharing the energy and thus actually involved in the dynamics. We also 
estimate the time 7 needed to reach this state of partial equipartition. As 
will be shown, such estimates turn out to be in agreement with some recent 
numerical results available in the literature. 
The presentation is quite informal; the material consists essentially of 
“snapshots” taken from a quite longer work in progress by the present 
authors. 
2. Boussinesq equations modeling FPU chains 
The equations of motion of a weakly nonlinear oscillator chain are 
?, 
= [A(T + grP-’)], , n = 0 , .  . . , L . 
(1) 
Here T, = qn+l - q,, where q, is the displacement of the n-th particle 
from its equilibrium position on the chain; A is the usual discrete laplacian 
([Af], = fn+l + fn-l - 2fn), while g > 0 is the coupling constant and 
the integer p 2 3 is the degree of nonlinearity (in the potential). We will 
suppose the chain to be periodic of period L, i.e. ~ ( t )  
= T L ( t ) ,  for any 
t 2 0 .  
Now, for long-wavelength initial excitations, which is the problem of 
interest in the present work, finite differences, such as T,+I - T,, are small; 
one can then formally expand the operator A = 4sinh2(d,/2) appearing 
in (1) in powers of 8, and retain the first few terms in the r.h.s. of the 
equation. Renaming the spatial independent variable n as 2, we get a PDE 
for the continuous field T ( Z ,  t), namely 
rtt = [. 
+ (1/12)Tzz + gTp-l]zz , r(0,t) = T(L,t) . 
Such a PDE is a generalized Boussinesq (gB) equation, and was considered 
as a starting point in approaching the FPU problem e.g. in [5] and [6]. 
In introducing a PDE, we pass from a system with a finite number 
(precisely L )  of degrees of freedom to a system possessing infinitely many 

265 
degrees of freedom. But of course the gB system is meaningful, i.e. it repre- 
sents a good approximation of the original system, only if finite differences 
remain small, that is to say only if long-wavelength Fourier modes take part 
in the evolution in a significant way. The consistency of the approximation 
breaks down when modes of wavelength of order one (the size of the lattice 
step of the original chain model) receive a significant amount of energy or, 
in other words, when a number of degrees of freedom of order L is excited. 
From now on, we will focus on the gB equation (2). 
3. Hamiltonian structure of the gB equation 
To our knowledge, the Hamiltonian structure of the gB equation (2) was 
pointed out first by Zakharov [6], in a famous paper where he showed 
that the (properly said) Boussinesq equation, corresponding to the case 
p = 3 is in fact integrable (in the Lax and in the Hamiltonian sense). 
Zakharov introduced an auxiliary field 
(periodic on [O,L]) thought of 
as the coordinate, while r was thought of as the corresponding conjugate 
momentum. Then, if one defines the Hamiltonian 
the corresponding pair of Hamilton equations associated to H, namely 
at = 6H/6r = r + ( 1/12)rxx + grp-' 
rt = -6H/6@ = aXx 
, 
(4) 
turns out to be equivalent to the second order gB equation. Notice that the 
flow of equations (4) preserves so r dx, which has to be set to zero, since 
in the original periodic lattice one always has CtZi r, = 0. 
Now, for our purposes, it is quite convenient to perform a noncanonical 
change of variables which is analogous to that used e.g. by Craig and Groves 
[7] in approaching the water wave problem. Let us introduce the change of 
variables ( r ,  a) H ([, v), where 
L 
Then, after substitution, the Hamiltonian (3) reads 

266 
while the equations of motion (4) transform into 
Et = [E + (1/24)([ + ~),x + (g/2””)(E + ~ ) ” - ‘ ] x  
(7) 
77t = -177 + (1/24)(E + 77)xx + (9/2”’”(E + 77)”-1]z 
The latter equations can be quite conveniently rewritten in Hamiltonian 
form, namely 
where C denotes the diagonal Pauli matrix diag(1,-1). 
It can be eas- 
ily checked that 28, is a degenerate Poisson operator. The correspond- 
ing Casimir invariants of the system are the linear functionals of the form 
Jt(cl[+c277) dx, with arbitrary constants c1 and c2. By the definition of the 
variables E and 77 given in (5) and by the geometric condition so r da: = 0 
one deduces that the physically meaningful Casimir leaf is the one defined 
by Jo E dx = so 77 da: = 0.

4. Averaging 
One has to keep in mind that a typical long-wavelength initial datum for 
equations (7) is 
E O ( Z )  = VO(a:) = &cos(2rx/L) 
I 
(9) 
where E plays the role of the specific energy (energy per degree of freedom) 
in the original FPU system. Indeed, substituting (9) in the expression of the 
Hamiltonian (6) yields If[&,, 7701 = E = EL+o(EL), the leading contribution 
EL coming from the first two terms of the Hamiltonian. Moreover, if one 
evaluates the r.h.s. of equations (7) on the initial datum (9), one realizes 
that the leading terms in the evolution equations for E and 77 are Ex and 
-qx, respectively. The other terms turn out to be small because both E 
and 1/L are supposed to be small quantities. As a consequence, one can 
regard the Hamiltonian (6) as being a perturbation of 
dx . 
According to a standard technique in perturbation theory [8], one can then 
average the whole Hamiltonian (6) over the flow generated by the unper- 
turbed Hamiltonian HO (lo), and thus simplify the dynamics. Such a flow, 

267 
acting on vector-valued fucntions periodic on [0, L], is given by 
at = ,pa, 
( & = @ = I ) ,  
(11) 
and the averaged Hamiltonian 
3 Jt H[W(E, q)]ds/L turns out to be 
L 
In the above expression, Cg = p ! / ( n ! ( p  - n)!) while (fj) = So f j  d x / L ;  we 
will refer to the latter as to the moment off of order j, or simply the j-th 
moment of f .  The equations of motion associated to 
are 
Et = Ex + (1/24)Exxx + (g/2"/2) c",; 
C;-'(qp-"-1 
) ( t " ) X  
' 
(13) 
{ Vt = -qx - (W4)VXXX - (9/2"/2) c::; 
c:-1(Ep-n-1)(7")x 
These are generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) equations. One can easily 
check that for p = 3 and p = 4 they yield, respectively, the KdV and the 
modified KdV equation, which are both integrable. 
Notice that now, as a consequence of averaging, the two moments of 
second order of E and q are constants of motion for system (13). Moments 
of order greater than two will be time-dependent, and as a consequence 
the above equations are actually coupled and of integro-differential type for 
P 2 6 .  
Up to this point we have shown that, for long-wavelength initial data, 
the gKdV equations constitute the resonant hamiltonian normal form of 
the FPU system (actually represented by the gB equation). We recall that 
in the case of short-wavelength initial conditions the resonant normal form 
has been shown to be constituted by nonlinear Schroedinger equations [9]. 
5. Dimensional analysis 
The fundamental role played by the KdV equation in the FPU problem (in 
the case p = 3) was pointed out first by Zabusky and Kruskal [lo]. In such 
a work they pointed out that the flow of such an equation displays two 
distinct regimes, which we recall here. Keeping in mind once again that 
initial data for the problem in study have the form (9), at very short times 
the derivatives will be small, and the dispersive terms txXx 
and qxxx can 
be neglected in the equations of motion (7); as a consequence one gets two 
generalized Hopf (or inviscid Burgers) equations whose flow would display 
singularities in a finite time. Anyway, in going towards the singularity 

268 
the derivatives increase and at a certain time the terms txxx 
and q,,, 
can 
no longer be neglected. Then dispersjon becomes important and a sort of 
balance between dispersion and nonlinearity prevents the shock formation, 
thus giving rise to solitons (for a recent aprroach to the FPU problem 
strongly based on solitons see [ll]). At this stage one expects a state 
of partial equilibrium to have been reached. So, there remains only to 
translate in quantitative terms what has been just said, and this is easily 
achieved through dimensional analysis. An enlightening treatment of the 
mat hematical foundations of dimensional analysis can be found in the book 
of Gallavotti [12]. 
If one denotes by M the typical value of the fields t and q at time t 
and by e the typical length-scale of variation of the same fields, one then 
estimates e.g. Ex - MI[. Analogously, if T denotes the typical time-scale 
of variation of the fields, then one has e.g. & - M / r .  
Now, in the equations of motion (7), following what pointed out by 
Kruskal, one can neglect the dispersive term if the ratio of the dispersive 
terms to the nonlinear ones appearing on the r.h.s. of the equations is less 
than 1, namely if 
One the other hand, if such an inequality holds, the dynamics is ruled by the 
a generalized Hopf equation, and this has the property that the maximum 
of its solution is a constant of motion. Thus, recalling (9), one can set 
M = &, which inserted in (14) yields 
The latter inequality must be interpreted as follows: emin gives the order 
of magnitude of the smallest spatial scale to which energy flows; at smaller 
spatial scales the dynamics is essentially dispersive and the corresponding 
Fourier modes of the system are almost frozen. The relaxation time ~~~l 
needed for the energy to flow up to the spatial scale emin is the one for 
which dispersion becomes important and & - txXx, 
namely 
It must also be stressed that if the minimal wavelength to which energy 
is transfered is X - emin, then the highest Fourier mode involved in the 
dynamics is the one corresponding to kmax/L - l/emin. Such a value of 
kmax/L of coincides with the fraction n,ff of degrees of freedom of the 
system actually sharing the energy. 

269 
6. Comments 
First of all it has to be pointed out that from the estimates (15) and (16) one 
realizes that the quantities characterizing the cascade are intensive: they 
depend only on the specific energy E = E/L. Thus, at least at a formal 
level, such estimates hold in the thermodynanlic limit E + 03, L -+ 00 
at E / L  fixed. Of particular significance is the fact that n,ff N E ~ ( P - ’ ) / ’ ,  
which is a small number if E is small, so that the system does not reach 
equipartition at least on time scales of order r,,~. 
The numerical results available in the literature are mostly concerned 
with the case p = 3. In such a case, the scaling k,,, 
N 
was observed 
both by Berchialla et al. [13] and by Biello et al. [14], while in reference 
[14] the scaling law r,,~ N E - ~ / ~  
too was measured. The agreement with the 
simple predictions given in the present paper seems thus to be promising.

ON BIRKHOFF METHOD FOR INTEGRABLE 
LAGRANGIAN SYSTEMS

We review Birkhoff method based on conditional integrals and apply the approach 
to find integrable two-dimensional Lagrangian or Hamiltonian systems with scalar 
and vector potentials. 
1. Introduction 
The configurational approach to the direct determination of additional in- 
tegrals in autonomous Hamiltonian systems has been shown to be quite 
effective in looking for integrable  system^.^,^,^ Configurational (or “condi- 
tional” or even “weak”) integrals hold for a specified particular value of 
the energy constant and were firstly investigated by Birkh~ff.~ 
Although 
they have been discussed several t i m e ~ , ~ ~ ~ > ~  
their use is still not very com- 
mon, probably for an understatement attitude. In this note we provide 
additional arguments to clarify matters, using the weak invariance condi- 
tion to explore conditional integrability and showing how the approach is 
a shortcut also towards standard ( “strong”) integrability, namely the case 
in which integrals hold for arbitrary values of the energy constant. 
2. Lagrangian approach 
To appreciate all the features of the generic behavior of dynamical systems 
it is enough to limit the attention to two-dimensional autonomous Hamilto- 
nian systems. These systems are in general non-integrable but it is enough 
to check the existence of one additional independent integral of the motion 
to determine a completely integrable system. In the case of a weak integral, 
this condition is satisfied on a fixed energy hypersurface.6 Many investiga- 
tions have been devoted to time-reversible systems; much less to irreversible 
systems, due to to the complexity of the set of equations ensuing from the 
271 

272 
invariance condition. Here we want to show how the case with a linear 
dependence on momenta, very interesting for its physical applications, can 
also be addressed with the configurational approach. 
In presence of gyroscopic terms, it is simpler to work in the Lagrangian 
framework. Moreover, since in two dimensions it turns out to be very 
useful to exploit conformal coordinate transformations, we will use complex 
coordinates and velocities defined by 
z = x + i y ,  Z = x - i y ,  
u=i, U = Z ,  
(1) 
with dot denoting differentiation with respect to ordinary time. Consider 
a Lagrangian of the form 
L = iuii - 28{@u} - w, 
(2) 
where W ( z ,  5) is the real scalar potential and @(z, 2) is a complex function. 
The equations of motion are 
?i + 2(iRU + Wz) = 0 
(3) 
R = 2 3 { @ z } ,  
(4) 
and its complex conjugate, where the real function 
will be referred to as the vector potential. A real phase-space function 
F ( z ,  2 ,  u, 
6) is an integral of motion if it is preserved along the flow, namely 
if 
( 5 )  
dF 
dt - 
= 2!J2{uFz - 2(Wr + ZRU)F!} = 0, 
along the solution of equations (3). 
A first integral of the system always exists, the Jacobi function, 
J ( z ,  Z ,  U ,  2L) = +uZl+ W(Z, 
Z). 
(6) 
With a slight abuse of language, referring to the constant value C of the 
function J on a given invariant hypersurface, we can speak of the ‘energy’ 
of the system: actually, only in the case of a constant R playing the role of 
an angular velocity, C is the energy in the rotating frame. 
The direct approach to find a second integral consists in making a suit- 
able ansatz on its form involving arbitrary functions, plugging it into the 
invariance condition ( 5 )  and solving for the unknown functions, including 
the potentials. The most common and useful ansatz is that of a polynomial 
in the velocities. Only the case of the linear integral 
F(l) = AU + A2L + B, 
(7) 

273 
can be solved in full generality4 and several examples of weakly-integrable 
systems can be found.' The case of quadratic integrals is instead still lacking 
of a general solution.9~10~11~12~13 
Recently, a general procedure concerning 
strong quadratic integrals14 has been presented and some new results on 
cubic integrals have also been pr0~ided.l~ 
Moreover, the challenging issue 
of the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been attempted.16 
Let us examine the quadratic case: 
F(') = +(Su2 + Su2) + +Quu + +(Ru + Ru) + P, 
(8) 
where P and Q are real functions and R and S are complex functions. 
Plugging F(2) inside eq.(5) provides a cubic polynomial in the velocities 
which must identically vanish: 
(9) 
d F ( 2 )  
dt 
= 8 { 'u 
.ci 2 S, + 4u3Sz + +u2uQz + ~(UUR, 
+ u2&) + UP,+ 
-2(Wz + iRu)(+Su + +uQ + +R)} = 0. 
The procedure to solve for the unknown functions is dictated by a possible 
constraint on phase-space variables. In practice there are two possibilities: 
no constraint which implies that each coefficient of the polynomial (9) must 
separately vanish; fixed 'energy' constraint, namely 
J ( z ,  z, u, 
u) = c, 
(10) 
and a corresponding extra link between the coefficients. We remark that 
the constraint-free approach must be reobtained from the constrained one 
by a suitable relaxation step. Comparing (10) with (6), the simplest way 
to impose the constraint above is that of writing 
uU = 2G, 
(11) 
where the 'Jacobi potential', G = C -  W ,  has been introduced. We observe 
that this condition implies the disappearance of any cross terms, namely 
terms with powers of uu both in the polynomial (9) and in the integral itself. 
The only coefficients which must separately vanish are those of uk, 
0 5 k 5 
3 and their complex conjugate, so that 
sz = 0, 
(12) 
Rz + 2iRS = 0, 
(13) 
Kz + SG, + +S'G + iRR = 0, 
(14) 
q ( R G ) , )  = o., 
(15) 
where, in (14) we have already exploited (12), that expresses the fact that 
S = S ( z )  is an arbitrary analytic function, and defined the function 
K = P + + GQ, 
(16) 

274 
which accounts for the disappearance of the uii term in the integral (8). 
Equations (12-15) express the conditions in order to F(2) of the form 
(8) be an integral at some given fixed C: if we are interested in a strongly- 
integrable system, in the end we must get a solution independent of C. 
To this purpose, we can write the integrability condition for K which, 
computing K,, = KEr from (14), is 
S{S”G + 3SG, + 2SG,, + 2i(RR),} = 0. 
(17) 
Now, using the definition G = C - W ,  we see that if (17) must be satisfied 
for every C, it turns out that 
S{S”(z)} = 0. 
(18) 
This result, valid even in the purely scalar case R = 0, is related with 
classical separating coordinates systems. In fact, the function S can be used 
to ‘standardize’ the integral expression through the conformal coordinate 
transformation w = w ( z )  = X + iY defined by 
so that 
F(2) = R{ + ( w ’ ) ~  + Ed} + K. 
(20) 
It can be shown’ that the coordinates systems compatible with condition 
(18), that can also be expressed as 
IS1 = A ( X )  + BW)’ 
(21) 
with A and B determined by the specific form of S ,  are the Cartesian, polar, 
parabolic and elliptical systems, so that we may grasp a first fundamental 
result connected with weak integrability: any conformal coordinate system 
in the plan allows for a family of weakly-integrable systems. 
3. Hamiltonian approach 
In the Hamiltonian framework, the Legendre transformation gives 
p = +u - a, H = 2(p+ a)@+ 6) + w, 
(22) 
so that 
d2) 
= s ( p  + 
+ s ( p  + 6)2 + R(p + a) + R(p + 6) + K. 
(23) 

275 
The Hamiltonian formulation of the weak invariance is the following ‘weak 
involution’ condition 
{ F ( M ) , H }  = f ( M - I ) ( H  - C), 
(24) 
where f(M-l) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree M-1 in the momenta. 
In the present case, M = 2, we may assume f(l) = %{+p} and follow a line 
of reasoning as above. The result is again given by the set (12-15). 
4. Strong integrability 
Recently,14 we have obtained a general procedure to solve this system in 
the arbitrary energy case. Under the conformal transformation, eq.( 13) 
transforms into 
R, + 2ifi = 0. 
(25) 
R = -4Ztw, 
(26) 
Since the conformal field is real, the solution of (25) is 
- 
where t is an arbitrary real function. In this way, the conformal vector field 
is given by 
R = 2tWW. 
At the same time, eq.(15) at arbitrary C implies 
R = - 4 i ~ z  
and 
w = W(V), 
(29) 
with v another arbitrary real function. Comparing (28) with (26) and 
taking into account of (21), we get the following differential equations for 
the functions q and E 
A’VY + B’VX - 2 ( A  + B)VXY = 0, 
A’ty + B’Ex + 2 ( A  + B)&yy = 0. 
(30) 
(31) 
Finally, putting all these results into the integrability condition (17), we 
obtain 
V X Y  
2 
fly 
flx 
W”(q) + 3-W’(V) 
= - 
- 
- - 
V X W  
A+.(, 
V X )  
Therefore, the strategy to find strongly integrable systems with scalar and 
vector potentials supporting quadratic invariants is: to chose a suitable S 

276 
in the class determined by condition (18) (and therefore A and B) and solve 
(30-31) to find q(X, Y) and [(X, Y); to solve (27) to find 
ti = 3"xx + t Y Y )  
(33) 
and use the conformal transformation to find 
c? 
O(X,Y) = - 
A + B  
(34) 
and, finally, try to solve (32) for W = W (q(X, Y ) )  
5. Examples 
In the general treatment14 we have obtained several solutions of this prob- 
lem. In order to solve eq.(32), it is natural to assume that in general the 
condition 
is satisfied, where Q, is arbitrary. Actually, it turns out that this condition 
is too restrictive in the particular case in which one can assume a linear 
dependence of the scalar potential on its argument, say 
w = iaq, 
(36) 
with a real constant. In this case we see that (32) can be written in the 
following form 
a(A + B)VXY = V X ~ Y  
- V Y ~ X ,  
(37) 
which can be satisfied using for example polynomial solutions of (30). We 
remark that in the cases we obtained so far,14 these solutions are irrational 
functions. In the following subsections we provide other solutions based on 
the linear ansatz (36). 
5.1. Polar coordinates 
In this case the coordinates are r = ex,O = Y and we have A = e2x = 
r2, B = 0, so that eq.(30) is solved by 
77 = eXg(Y) + f(X). 
20 = e-4x (f' - 2f') - e-3x (9'' + 9). 
(38) 
(39) 
Using (33) we get, 

277 
In order to solve (37) we can make the choice 
g = bcosY + csinY, 
Putting all together and using standard polar coordinates we get the fields 
a 
2 
a =  4p - -r2, 
24 
(43) 
5.2. Parabolic coordinates 
In this case the coordinates are such that x = X2 - Y2, y = 2XY and we 
have A = 4X2, B = 4Y2. A polynomial solution of eq.(30) is 
q = a(X2 + Y2)2(5(X4 + Y4) - 6X2Y2) 
E = -a [+(y6 
- x6) + x2y2(x2 
- Y')] 
(44) 
(45) 
so that 
and 
R = 6a(X2 - Y2). 
Putting all together and using standard Cartesian coordinates we get the 
fields 
R = 6ax, 
(47) 
w = -a2r2(5z2 + y2). 
(48) 
5.3. Elliptical coordinates 
In this case the coordinates are such that 
2A2 sinh2 X = r2 - A2 + J(r2 + A2)2 - 4A2y2, 
2A2 sin2 Y = r2 + A2 - d(r2 + A2)2 - 4A2y2, 
and we have 
A = A2 sinh2 X, B = A2 cos2 Y. 
A polynomial solution of eq.(30) is 
q = aA6(sinh2 X - cos2 Y)(sinh2 X + cos2 Y)2 

278 
so that 
A' 
16 
[ = -[[3(4cos2Y+cos4Y-3cosh2X+cosh4X)-16cos2 
Y sinh2X] (53) 
and 
f2 = 4A2[3(sinh2 X - cos2 Y) 
+ 21. 
(54) 
Putting all together and using standard Cartesian coordinates we get the 
fields 
f2 = 4a(3r2 - A2), 
W = -16a2(r2 - A2)[r4 + 2A2(z2 - y2) + A'].

After the seminal paper by Arnold', it is well known that the bifurcation diagrams 
of the simple singularities of type Ak (for k 2 I), Dk (for k 2 4), &, E7 and 
E8 are diffeomorphic to the manifolds of the non-regular orbits of the homony- 
mous Coxeter reflection group acting on the complex space. The extension of this 
connection to discover the rest of the finite reflection groups has stimulated deep 
research in singularity theory. We propose a simple method to identify the singu- 
larities which may be associated to general compact linear groups (including finite 
reflection groups). It is based on a particular equivalence relation which naturally 
appeared in the classification of real orbit spaces of compact (coregular) linear 
groups2. 
1. Introduction 
The behaviour of a smooth function in a neighbourhood U of the origin 0 of 
Rn may be studied through the notion of germ, i. e. through the equivalence 
classes of functions whose restrictions to U coincide. The natural equiva- 
lence relation to be imposed on the space of smooth germs of real smooth 
functions f at 0 is R-equivalence. Two germs of functions fl and f2 are 
R-equivalent (fl - f2) when there exists an invertible germ g : R" + R" 
with g(0) = 0 such that f2(z) = (fl o g ) ( z ) ,  for z belonging to the domain 
of f2. If a germ f is non singular at 0, that is Vf(0) # 0, it is equivalent 
to the germ IT : (XI,. 
. . ,zn) 
---t 21. If a germ f has a non degenerate criti- 
cal point at 0 and zero target, (2.e. f(0) = 0), Morse's lemma ensures its 
equivalence with the Morsian form -z1~--22~--.

A function in general position has only non-degenerate critical points.

In this note, we intend to show that the bifurcation diagrams (BD) of the 
smooth real functions (including boundary ~ingularities~) 
can be retrieved 
from the classification of orbit spaces of compact linear groups through ge- 
ometric invariant theory2i4. We recall that it was checked that the orbit 
spaces of all compact coregular finite groups5 (ie., the finite groups gen- 
erated by reflections) and all compact coregular simple Lie groups6 with 
less than 5 basic polynomial invariants are equivalent to a member of the 
classes reported in Ref. '. In this way, a natural correspondence between 
singularity theory and group representation theory is proposed. 
2. Classification of singularities 
In this section, we briefly expose the main ideas behind the classification of 
singularities under R-equivalence of smooth real functions. We essentially 
follow the line of Gibson7 and refer to it for omissions and details. 
Let us first examine the action C of a Lie group Q on a smooth finite- 
dimensional manifold M .  In fact, even if neither the manifold of smooth 
functions nor the group of R-equivalence are finite dimensional, the essen- 
tial results continue to hold true for them. Given y E Q and f E M ,  we 
shall denote by 7. f the image of the action of y on f .  For a point f E M ,  we 
consider the &orbit Rf = {h E M : h = y ' f , y E 8). The tangent space 
at f to the orbit Rf is the image of the tangent space at the unit element of 
the Lie group Q, Tn(Q), under the differential D of the map [f 
: Q -+ M 
defined by o ( y )  = y' f :  Tf(Rf) = Dn[f(Tn(Q)). Thinking of the tangent 
space at f to the variety M ,  Tf(M), we can define the codimension off 
as the codimension c of the vector subspace Tf(0j) of Tf(M). If c = 0, in 
finite dimensions, the inverse function theorem guarantees that there exists 
a neighborhood Uf of f in M such that g E Of, for all g E Uf. In that 
case, we shall say that g is equivalent to f and write g N f .  An element f 
of M is called stable if it is equivalent to every g in a suitable neighborhood 
Uf of f. In general, if c > 0, a perturbation of f with a y E B changes the 
equivalence class of f only if it lies in the transversal section to Of. Such 
a section (a c-dimensional submanifold of M )  can be parameterized by a 
deformation F o f f ,  that is by a map F : R" -+ M such that F(0) = f ;  
such a map is also called unfolding of f. The deformation directions of F 
are the elements 
belonging to Tj(Rf). 
Particular relevance have the transversal deformations of f, that is the 
ones whose deformation directions span all the cotangent space to the orbit 
Of: Tf(0f) @ DoF(Rd) = Tf(M). In fact, it can be shown that they 

281 
coincide with the class of versal deformations, i.e. with the deformations 
such that any other deformation H of f can be induced by F through a 
suitable re-parameterization. Sometimes, a versal deformation involving 
the minimal number of parameters is called universal. 
We note that the local data of the tangent space Tf are sufficient to 
write down versal deformations, which capture all possible behaviors of the 
singularity of f in a full neighborhood of it, according to the equivalence 
relation determined by the group G. 
Coming back to our problem, the manifold M is the set of C" (R", 
R) 
diffeomorphisms. The group G is the group of C" mappings on R", acting 
on elements of M by composition on the right. Owing to the cardinality of 
the spaces involved, the inverse function theorem cannot be applied in this 
case. Notwithstanding, the general attitude to reduce to finite dimensions 
is maintained, at least for the complement of the tangent space to the orbit 
of the infinite-dimensional group action. In this context, the notion of germ 
function and the determinacy problem, that is the possibility of using the 
jet-map, play a fundamental role. 
The space of (indefinitely) differentiable germs at the origin, denoted by 
En, is endowed with a real algebra structure. It is also possible to introduce 
the ideal of the germs with target 0 and the ideal of the (k - 1)-flat germs 
(i.e. the one composed of the germs whose derivatives at 0 vanish up to 
order k - l), denoted by M and Mk, respectively. 
It can be proved that M is the unique maximal ideal of En. Moreover, 
Mk coincides with the k-th ideal power of M :  Mk = M k .  In other words, 
Mk is generated by the monomials (in the coordinate) of degree k. By Tay- 
lor's theorem, the quotient algebra J," = &,/Mk+l is naturally isomorphic 
to the polynomial algebra in n variables whose degree is at most k. In the 
same way, the quotient Mk/Mk+l can be identified with the real vector 
space of homogeneous polynomials in n variables of degree k. We shall call 
k-jet of f at the origin 0, denoted by j k f ( x ) ,  the k-th order Taylor poly- 
nomial of f at x = 0. Loosely speaking, a germ function is k-determined 
when cutting away the contributions to the Taylor series expansions from 
the (k + 1)-th terms upwards does not alter its qualitative behavior. In this 
case, one is again dealing with a finite dimensional object. 
The generalization of the analysis of the action ( B , M )  to the infinite 
dimensional case proceeds through the individuation of the tangent space 
at f to the orbit under R- diffeomorphisms, represented by the Jacobian 
3.f 
ideal, Jf. The ideal Jf is generated by the partial derivatives - 
and its 
3Xi 

282 
codimension in En is identified with the codimension of f and denoted by 
cod f. A germ is said to be of finite codimension if cod f < 00. Orbits of 
positive codimension can form discrete stratifications or continuous families. 
In the former case the orbits are called simple. To be specific, a germ of a 
function f with critical point 0 E R” is simple if for sufficiently large k its 
orbit in the space of k-jets is simple and the number of confining orbits in 
the space of k-jets is bounded as k 4 00.

We cannot enter here the algebraic issues concerning ideal theory and 
the details of the classification of germ functions. We just recall that deter- 
minacy and codimension are intimately related. In fact, it can be proved7 
that a germ f E En is finitely determined if and only i f  the codimension of 
f is finite. Moreover, there is a criterium to test if a function is determined 
with respect to R-equivalence: near a @-isolated critical point, even i f  it is 
degenerate, a g e m  can always be reduced to polynomial normal form. 
3. The Orbit Space approach 
In this section, we give an overview of the study of Orbit Spaces (OS’s) 
from the point of view of Geometric Invariant Theory’. Invariant functions 
under the transformations of a Compact Linear Group (CLG) acting in 
R”, lK = R or C, can be expressed in terms of functions of a finite set of 
basic real invariant polynomials p ( z )  = (pl(z), . . . ,pq(z)), z E K”, 
which 
may be chosen to form a Minimal Integrity Basis (MIB) for the group G. 

283 
In the coregular case (which is the only case which is considered in this 
paper), i.e. when there are no syzygies among the elements of the MIB's, 
the 0s can be identified with the image p(Kn) of K" through the orbit 
map p .  For K = C, p(Cn) fills the whole of Cq, while for K = R the orbit 
space turns out to be a disjoint union of connected semi-algebraic varieties, 
whose defining relations can be expressed from (semi)positivity and rank 
conditions of a matrix pab(p(x)) = Cy=, -(x) 
-(x), 
which, through 
the Hilbert theorem, depends only on the MIB { p i , .  . . , p 4 } .  In order to 
classify the OS's of CCLG's, an axiomatic approach has been proposed 
which aims at determining the matrices p ( p )  exploiting only their general 
properties2. It has been shown that the p-matrices can be determined 
as solutions of a system of differential equations obeying convenient initial 
conditions. The equations can be derived in the following way. 
= p(Rn), and Z(o) the ideal 
formed by all the polynomials in p E RQ vanishing on g. Every f(p) E Z(a) 
defines in R" an invariant polynomial function f(x) = f(p(x)), and f(x) = 
0 for all x E Cf = p-l(a). The gradient af(x) is obviously orthogonal to 
C f  at every x E C f ,  but, it must also be tangent to C f  since f(x) is a 
G-invariant function. Consequently, it has to vanish on C f :

Relation (2) can be re-proposed in the form of a differential relation involv- 
ing only polynomial functions of p .  According to the Hilbert basis theorem, 
the ideal Z(u) is finitely generated. If a is a codimension one primary stra- 
tum of p@") c Rq, the ideal Z(a) has a unique irreducible generator, a(p), 
and (2) reduces to

where the Xa's, (like the Pab'S and a) are w-homogeneous unknown polyno- 
mial functions of p .  Eq. (3) will be quoted as Muster Equation (ME). The 

284 
ME holds true also if a(p) is the unique generator of the ideal I ( d S )  of the 
functions vanishing on the whole boundary dS of the orbit space. In this 
case, a(p) will be denoted by A(p) and called a complete active factor. 
4. Group theoretical interpretation of singularities 
Arnold established’ the connection between simple singularities and the 
manifold of non regular orbits of finite groups generated by reflections acting 
on P. 
That is quite clear for the singularity series Ak. Consider the 
action of the permutation group sk+1 on the (eventually complex) roots 
of the polynomial equation L(z) = zk+l + Csso (jzj = 0. Expanding the 
identity L(z) = n,”z:(z - zj), it is easy to realize that the coefficients 
E may be viewed as functions of the elementary symmetric polynomials 
s,(z1,. . . , zk+l) of the roots: 
jFrom the normal form of the singularity L(z), it is evident 
that the action of Sk+l is restricted to the hyperplane V 
= 
{z E Wk+’ I &(Z) = 
~j = o}. The polynomial invariants forming a 
MIB can be chosen to be p j ( z )  = (jIv for 1 5 j 5 k. In Ref. 
it is 
shown how to get an orthogonal representation of the real action of sk+l 
on V ,  i.e. of the group G = Ak, and to get the orbit space p(Rk) of the 
action of G on Rk as a subset of Rk. It is also possible to think of the 
boundary dS of the real orbit space as a subset of Ck. It is worth noting 
that dS is, in general, just a subset of the real polynomial discriminant 
C c Ck, 
as stressed in Remark 4.2 of Ref.g. In this spirit, in what follows 
we shall consider the notion of extended MIB transformations. It is just a 
generalization of the notion introduced in Refs. 214 in which we allow the 
coefficients of the transformation between MIB’s to be complex numbers 
(see Eq. 14 below). 
4.1. Bifurcation diagmms and classification of orbit spaces 
In this section, we show that the BDs of the singularities of the smooth 
real functions correspond to orbit space  solution^^!^ of the ME. For each 
normal form N ( z )  of the simple singularities appearing in Table 1, we shall 
construct the bifurcation diagram (BD), and we shall demonstrate that 
this equation can be viewed as a solution of the ME. In fact, we shall write 
down the correspondent p-matrix and XA term. Then, we shall give the 

285 
MIB (extended) transformation which transforms each solution in an 0s 
one. 
We just recall that, to get the BD’s (2.e. the discriminant varieties) it 
is sufficient to eliminate the zi in the system of equations N ( z )  = 0 and 
d 
-N(z) 
= 0. Then it is possible to identify the degree of the polynomial 
d X i  
invariants from some dimensional analysis. Think of N ( z )  as an homoge- 
neous polynomial and assign weight di to the coefficients ti, 
in such a way 
that any monomial containing ti shares the same total weight as the other 
ones. The values of the di’s are then to be compared to the ones obtained 
as solutions of the ME. 
To save space, in what follows we shall associate the polynomial invari- 
ants pi to the coefficients & of the normal forms, in such a way as to obtain 
the minimum number of different BD’s A ( p ) ,  and, when possible, that A ( p )  
is related to the complete active factor solution of the ME by a real MIB 
transformat ion. 
Singularity A2: From the normal form of Table 1, after identifying t o  = pl 
and 
= -pz, we obtain the BD A ( p )  = 27p: - 4p: = 0. Thinking of A ( p )  
as a complete active factor, it is possible to find the other ME terms, i.e.: 
It is well known that the orbit spaces of all CCLG’s with MIB formed 
by two invariants are isomorphic ’. With the MIB transformation given by 
g1 = - 4 p l ,  gz = p z ,  we get the ME solution for ( d l ,  d2) = ( 3 , 2 ) .

solution E2 (s = 2) for (dl, d2, d3,d4) = (6,4,4,2). 
4.2. Boundary singularities 
The classification of simple singularities do not exhaust the list of all the 
groups generated by reflections. Arnold extended the classification consid- 
ering the class of the functions defined on a manifold with boundary, i.e. 
a smooth manifold with a fixed smooth hypersurface. Two functions on 
a manifold with boundary are equivalent if they are R-equivalent under a 
diffeomorphism of the manifold which leaves the boundary invariant. Let 
us identify the boundary of the manifold with the hyperplane x1 = 0, and 
set F ( x )  = f(x) + t 2 1 ,  with t E R. It is easy to realize that the condition 
determining the singular points of a function f(q, 
2 2 ,  . . . ,x,) given at page 
101 of 
is equivalent to finding the solution of the following equations: 
i = l ,  ..., n .  
(15) 
d 
--F(z) 
= f(2) = t 2 1  = 0, 
8x2 
Eliminating q, . . . , x, and t in the equations above, for f chosen from 
Table 2, one finally gets the BD's for boundary singularities. Thus the 
same calculations as above can be carried on.

5. Conclusions and outlooks 
We have shown that every bifurcation diagram of the list of the simple 
function singularities (whose unfolding depends on less than 5 parameters) 
corresponds to a solution of the ME. That statement holds true also for 

290 
boundary singularities classified in ’. The main motivation is the follow- 
ing: the complete active factors entering the ME, once associated to a linear 
representation of a CLG, may be viewed as real functions A(x) = A ( p ( x ) ) ,  
x being a point in the real, n-dimensional, order parameter space. Any 
arbitrarily small neighborhood of x = 0 encodes all the information about 
the orbit space structure. In fact, since the isotropy subgroups at points 
lying in a line through the origin coincide, any typical point xo correspond- 
ing to some symmetry stratum can be moved arbitrarily close to the origin 
through a convenient re-scaling xo 4 pxo, for /-I E R. It is then apparent 
that there is a relationship between singularities of smooth functions and 
orbit space classification. We have shown that simple singularities do not 
even exhaust orbit spaces of finite reflection groups: it is necessary to re- 
sort to boundary singularities. As a consequence, the equivalence relation 
induced by the ME on the space of germ functions at x = 0 is finer than 
the standard R-equivalence. As a double check, the condition for determi- 
nacy (and finite codimension) for simple singularities we have mentioned at 
the end of $2 is not obeyed by boundary singularities. The phenomenon is 
essentially that a solution which is un-stable for some equivalence relation 
may become stable under a finer one, in this case an equivalence including 
the notion of symmetry (see for instance lo). Since the classification of orbit 
spaces is a framework naturally including symmetry, we propose that the 
restriction of R-equivalence should stem directly from the ME structure. 
The consequences of the conjecture above are under investigation ll.

1. Introduction 
The study of the dynamics of N particles in the plane R2 interacting 
through a potential of the form 
1 
with Q E (0,foo) 
xz - x j p  
i > j  
is called the planar N - body problem. The aim is to find the possible 
motions taking place in the configuration space M = R2N. To prove exis- 
tence of periodic orbits in a non-perturbed regime the calculus of variation 
and variational methods have a major role, for a general introduction to the 
modern approach one can refer to 
Very recently, in the gravitational case, 
new orbits have been found by combining extensively variational methods 
and symmetries of the system, symmetries have a crucial role to find those 
orbits in which each body follows the same curve according an appropriate 
phase shift, the so called choreographic solutions see 6 3 3 .  
More generally we 
can define symmetric orbits as follows: let G be a group and x + g-x be 
its action on the configuration manifold M ;  this action naturally extends 
to paths in M as follows: 
x ( t )  -+ (9 . x ) ( t )  = g.z(t) for every t.

We assume that G is symmetry group, namely the G-action preserves the 
dynamics and then we call z(.) a symmetric orbit if 
z(.) is a solution and there are T > 0 and g E G such that Vt 
( 9 .  z)(t) = z(t + T). 
Choreographic orbits can be recovered when the permutation group (bod- 
ies re-labelling) is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetry group G. In 
the study of the gravitational N-body problem only very recently a general 
strategy has been found in 5,8 to tackle systematically the problem of find- 
ing symmetric orbits. Among the interesting open problems we might ask 
ourself whether and which symmetric solutions may exist in other physi- 
cally interesting N-body systems. 
In this paper we shall consider symmetric orbits for a system of 3 parti- 
cles of equal masses in a plane interacting through a Lennard-Jones type 
potential: 
We present some general observations on the symmetric orbits, and we 
consider the circular relative equilibria, which are trivial choreographies and 
their variational structure. We show also that is possible to find easily some 
interesting symmetric orbits with rotational symmetry. Then we consider 
homotopy classes of choreographies and show the existence of choreographic 
solutions as mounting-pass critical points. Such analysis, inspired by '>', 
used the description of the space of choreographies in terms of Fourier series. 
2. Lennard-Jones potential and symmetries 
A system of equal particles in the plane interacting through a potential 
of type VLJ has the same symmetries of the usual gravitational N-body 
problem. In the considered case let z = (XI, 
z 2 , ~ )  
E M = IR2 x R2 x R2 
be a configuration, the dynamics can be prescribed by the Lagrangian: 
Note that L is not defined in the coincidence set K, = {z = (zl,z2,z3) 
E 
R6 : 3i # j ,  zi = zj} . The Lagrangian is invariant under a group containing 
a subgroup isomorphic to the permutations. Indeed the symmetry actions 
are: 

293 
0 Translations: x + x + a with a E R6. 
0 Rotations: x + Rx with R E SO(2) x SO(2) x SO(2). 
0 Re-labelling: z + ( ~ ( x )  
where (T is an element of the group 
of permutations of 3 elements Z3, in particular: (zl,x2,z3) + 
O((z1, x2723)) = (x27 z3,zl). 
2.1. Variational methods o n  symmet~% paths 
The equations of motion are given by the Least action principle applied to 
the functional 
We choose the domain of A[.] to be a suitable set paths/loops whose qual- 
itative property has been prescribed by symmetries. The standard choice 
is to consider paths in H' Sobolev class, so we define: 
Simple choreography space: A = { x ( t )  = (x1(t),xz(t),z3(t)) 
E 
H1([O, 2'1, R6) : x(t) $ K,, 
z(t + T/3) = o ( z ( t ) ) } .  For the given 
(T, it is known that for each z(.) E A we can find a loop z(.) valued 
in R2 such that x(t) = ( z ( t ) ,  z(t - T / 3 ) ,  z ( t  - 2T/3)). 
Rotational symmetric loops: C" = { z ( t )  = (q(t),zz(t),zS(t)) 
E 
H1([O, TI, R6) : z(t) 
z(t + 2') = ei " z ( t ) ) }  for some a E R 
(see '). 
We shall term A0 and Cg the paths/loops in which the centre of 
mass is the origin. 
K,, 
We want to find z*(.) in A0 or C: 
such that DA[x*] = 0. This is a criticality 
condition for x* (.) equivalent to solving the equations of motion. VL 
J has 
interesting properties: 
A is unbounded below on H1 
loops, 
0 A satisfies a form of the so called strong force condition, in fact the 
action diverges on any loop intersecting K,, this was introduced in 
'3'. 
This property allows us to prove that any critical loop does 
not cross the coincidence set K,. 
In fact one can prove: 
Proposition 2.1. The potential VL J satisfies following conditions: 
(1) lim,,Kc 
V L J ( ~ )  
= +m. 

294 
(2) The strong force condition: there exist U E C'(R6\Kc,R), a neigh- 
borhood A of the origin and c1 > 0 such that: 
lim U(z) = +03, 
VLJ(X) 2 IlVU(x)llZ - c1 
Vx E A\{O} 
x+K. 
(3) There exists m > 0 such that VLJ(X) 2 -m for all x E M .  
(4) For every x E M < VVLJ(X),~ >I 
c2 for some c2 > 0. 
Proposition 2.1 permits us to show that the action d satisfies Palais-Smale 
condition at any positive level: 
Proposition 2.2. If (x,(.)) such that d[x,] + c # 0 and Dd[x,] + 0 
then (x,(.)) converges up to a subsequence in A0 (or C,"). 
Proof. The proof can be reduced to a similar proposition in '1' 
using the 
0 
strong force condition and preservation of the centre of mass. 
3. Relative equilibria (trivial choreographies) 
The system has equations of motion given by: 
We look for circular solutions (critical points of d )  which are the simplest 
possible choreographic solutions in the form: xk(t) = p exp(i w (t + 2x(k - 
1)/3)) with w = 2x/T, x(t) E Ao. These are relative equilibria and p and 
T satisfy: 
For TO = 2~/@&) 
there are two coincident circular solutions with ra- 
dius pa = -& (w) 
. For T > TO there are two distinct circular 
solutions with radii p1 and p2 with p1 < PO < pz. 
3.1. Variational characterisation 
For each relative equilibria x*, we evaluate the Hessian D2d[x*](u,u), 
where u(.) is a tangent vector to x*(.). Writing u(.) 
in terms of its Fourier 

295 
expansion we have: 
00 
3T 
k,6 
k 
+G(p) / T  d t x ( <  zi(t) - xj(t), ui(t) - uj(t) >)2 
O 
i>j 
where G(p) is: G(p) = 
negative for p < po and positive for p > po. Then we cai deduce: 
(1) The circular orbit with radius p1 is a saddle point. Its negative 
directions are spanned by {exp(iwt),exp(-iwt)}. In fact G(p1) < 
0 and consider Fourier components k = fl. 
(2) The circular orbit with radius p2 is a local minimum, and moreover 
(3) Each critical point is degenerate along u(.) tangent to itself. This 
reflects the SO(2) symmetry. 
(4) At T = TO, the circular orbit po is a local minimum of 
the action, it is degenerate along SO(2) orbit and also along 
{ exp(i w t) , exp (-i w t) } . 
- m. 
G(p) is zero for p = PO, 
Abll > Ab21. 
The above conditions do not permit us to find any new critical points by 
studying the homotopies deforming the circular orbits one into the other. 
4. Simple non-trivial rotationally symmetric orbits 
We consider x(.) E Cz'3 wherezi(t) = p(t) exp(i4(t)+227r(z-1)/3), 
1,2,3. Then the dynamics in (p(t), 4(t)) is described by the Lagrangian: 
1 = 
L = ;(4(t) + P 2 ( t ) 4 2 ( Q )  - 3VLJ(P(t)) 
. The dynamics is integrable and we can

construct the integrals for p(t), $(t) and also 4(p). In particular:

We have z(t) = 
(z(t), z(t) ein/3, z(t) ei2a/3), with z(t) 
p(t) exp(ic$(t)). Along such solution the shape is preserved: llzi(t) - 
zm(t)ll = &p(t) 
and there is q E N such that: p(t + T/q) = p(t) and 
Ac$ = $(t + T/q) - $(t) = 2x/q,and zi(t + T/q) - q(t) = z(t) [ei"/q - 
11 exp(7r i(Z - 1)/3) with Z = 1,2,3, For an example see figure 1. 
5. Choreographies in Fourier space 
Planar choreographies are solutions determined by just one plane curve. 
For three bodies in the plane we write z(t) = (z(t),z(t-T/3),z(t-2T/3)), 
where z(.) is a closed curve in R2. This suggests to think of a choreography 
as a Fourier series: z(t) = CnEZ 
z, exp(i writ) where w, = 9, 
and SO as 
an element of the Hilbert Space: 
I 
X1 = z = (z,) : z, E @, with norm 1 1 ~ 1 1 :  = c ( 1  + w ; ) ) z , ~ ~  
{ 
nEZ 
here we consider z(t) E @ for every t. Note that fixing the canter of mass in 
the space for the choreographies is equivalent to choose zo for any z E X1. 

297 
Without loss of generality we can consider zo = 0. From now on we assume 
20 = 0. 
We would like to point out that the idea of using the basic loop to investigate 
choreographies has been also used recently in the gravitational N-body 
problem in '. 
In X1 the set of collision curves has a description in terms of bundle of 
hyperplanes. In fact for example the condition q.(t) - q ( t )  = 0 turns out: 
zk(t) - zl(t) = ~ k , l ( z , t )  = Cz,~,(k,~)exp(iw,t) = o 
here K,(k,Z) = [exp(2~i(k - l)/N)), - (exp(axi(1 - 1)/3)),]. The action 
functional on X1 can then be written as: 
nEZ 
Fourier description allows us to analyse the geometry of space of choreogra- 
phies and to carry on a variational study of Lennard-Jones potential similar 
to 1,7, showing that it is possible to fmd new solutions as critical points of 
A[.] with mountain pass geometry. 
Let 211(z) = CnEZ~zIzn12 
and consider the following subsets of X1: 
Br+,b = {Z E x1 : B[z] = u'((S(z))' - 2 b211(z) - r2 = 0) 
where 6(z) = mink,[ inft JRk,l(z, t)l. 
Proposition 5.1. There existsr such thatinftEBr,o,b 
d [ z ]  = CO(T,U, b) > 0. 
Proof. From the definition of Rk,l(z,t) we can show that 6(z) 5 
2 c  d
m
 
for some c > 0. Taking z E Br,a,b implies 6(z) 2 
Now for large r we have that v ( z )  < 0 and 
therefore d[z] 2 f C, W ~ J Z ~ ) ~ .  
The action is bounded from below in Br,a,b. 
0 
We define co = infgv,n,b 
A. 
In the next proposition we show how to choose a, b. 
Proposition 5.2. In any homotopy class of X1 it is possible to find 
Z A , ~ B  E x1 and Br,a,b such that ZA,ZB $! 
Br,a,b with ~ [ z A ]  < 0, 
and d[zg] = 0 < CO. 
Moreover the set of continuous deformations 

298 
Proof. For a given homotopy class in A, we take ZA E XI. It turns 
out from A[.] that we can choose Z A  Fourier components so small that 
~ [ z A ]  
< 0. This process does not change the homotopy class. Now we look 
for X such that d[AzA] = 0 < ~0 for any r,u, b. From A[.] this amounts to 
solve: 
here I ~ ( z A ) ,  
I2 ( z A ) ,  13 ( Z A )  are all positive numbers fixed by ZA. By conti- 
nuity in A, noting that ~ [ z A ]  
< 0 and limA+.+m d[AzA] = +oo, equation 
(2) can be solved and determines a A*. We define ZB = A* Z A ,  ZB and Z A  
are homotopic. Now we fk r large and a, b can be chosen solving: 
U4 (s(ZA))4 - 2 b2 I l ( Z A )  = 0 < T 2  
L * 4 a  ( 6 ( Z A ) ) ~  - 2 
b2 I1 (ZA) = 2 T 2  > r2 
these define completely Br,a,b. Now consider homotopies in I?, the function 
@(y(s)) is continuous w.r.t. s E [l,X*] with B[y(l)] < 0 and B[y(A*)] > 0 
therefore, by continuity, there will be S such that B[y(S)] = 0 and hence 
0 
y(S) E Br,a,b. This allows us to conclude max, d[r(s)] 2 Q. 
Theorem 5.1. In the homotopy class of loops Z A ,  ZB (Proposition 5.2) 
there exists a choreographic solution 2 for the 3-body problem with Lennard- 
Jones potential. 
Proof. By means of Proposition 5.2, two homotopic loops Z A  and ZB de- 
termines a mountain-pass structure for the action d[.]. We know that the 
action A[.] satisfies Palais-Smale and this guarantees the existence of a 
critical of a mountain-pass according to the general theorems in 'i7. 
6. Conclusions 
We explored symmetric solutions for the 3-body problem with Lennard- 
Jones type potential. Considering the problem in the space of choreogra- 
phies, the main result is the existence of solutions in each homotopy class 
in the space of choreographies. This mimics the known result (see 3, for 
systems with potential l/ra, a 2 2. In Lennard-Jones case, choreographies 
are not minimisers of the action but critical point of mounting-pass type. 
Details of the proof will be given in a forthcoming paper where also the

VARIATIONAL APPROACH TO SOLITON GENERATION

The conditions for the generation of spatiotemporal solitons called light bullets are 
considered using variational approach. The dynamics of such completely localized 
self-guided structures is governed by a (3 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger 
equation containing one propagation dimension and three “transverse” dimensions. 
The variational approach is also applied in order to study generation and dynam- 
ics of optical vortex solitons containing topological phase singularity and nonzero 
angular momentum. A stability analysis provides conditions for formation of sym- 
metric, stable, exceptionally robust self-guided pulses in the final stage of evolution. 
The simulations show that the pulse above critical energy is trapped provided its 
initial parameters belong to the range close to the analytically predicted one. 
1. Introduction 
Spatiotemporal solitons are characterized by a balance of diffraction and 
dispersion with respectively nonlinear spatial and temporal self-focusing. 
Due to their exceptional robustness and their low energy, spatiotempo- 
ral solitons, so-called light bullets, appear to be an excellent candidate 
for carrying the information that has to be treated in all-optical logic cir- 
cuits. The dynamics of such localized structures is governed by a ( D  + 1)- 
dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NSE). It turns out that these 
solitons are unstable for cubic nonlinearity in case of higher transverse 
dimensions ( D  = 2,3). However, NSE with the nonlinearity saturation 
admits multi-dimensional ( D  = 2,3) soliton solutions that are stable €or 
infinitely small perturbations [l]. Only recently it was shown numerically 
that under well defined conditions the multidimensional solitons are stable 
even for large perturbations; their dynamics resemble the ones of soliton 
solutions in integrable systems [2]. Taking into account that some of the 
materials currently used in optical systems exhibit weak saturation effects, 
300 

301 
their nonlinearity can be approximated with good accuracy by cubic-quintic 
model. Recent measurements show that the polydiacetylene para-toluene 
sulfonate (PTS) exhibits such a saturating nonlinearity with large nonlinear 
index of refraction [3]. This kind of nonlinearity has been widely applied 
in different domains of research not only in nonlinear optics but also in 
plasma physics as well as in the context of Bose super-fluid [4]. Recently 
an important development has occurred in the field of nonlinear optics con- 
cerning optical vortex solitons (OVS) [5]. These solitons in self-defocusing 
media are stationary beam structures with phase singularity and nonzero 
angular momentum proportional to an integer m defined as topological 
charge. An OVS is a dark spot, i.e., a zero intensity center surrounded by 
a bright infinite background. Self-focusing media support localized optical 
vortex solitons (LOVS) with phase dislocation surrounded by one or many 
bright rings. LOVS are unstable against symmetry breaking perturbations 
that lead to the breakup of rings into stable filaments [6]. Recently, we 
demonstrated the possibility to generate both LOVS and OVS in media 
with cubic-quintic nonlinearity [7]. 
We will study analytically and numerically the light bullets either with 
or without a topological charge as well as self-trapped singular beams in 
saturating nonlinear media.

fourth-order optical indices are, respectively, 722 = 2.2 x 10-3cm2/GW 
and n4 = -0.8 x 10-3~m4/GW2 [3].

+ A L E  + s- 
+ (lEI2 - IEI4)E = 0. 
The field envelope E is & redefined according to the cubic-quintic non- 
linearity under consideration, and s = fl corresponds respectively to the 
anomalous and normal GVD. For s = 0, the NSE reduces to a (2 + 1)- 
dimensional equation. 
General dynamical properties of nonstationary solutions of Eq. (2) are 
rather complex and numerical simulations are required. Variational ap- 
proach can serve as a guideline for simulations. In order to study the beam 
dynamics governed by NSE we first generalize the corresponding variational 
method for multi-dimensional (D = 2,3) saturating nonlinearities with ar- 
bitrary topological charge m. In the case of cylindrically symmetric pulses, 
the following Lagrangian density is associated to Eq. (2) 
where the radius T = ( ~ ~ + y ~ ) l / ~ .  
In the optimization procedure a Gaussian 
trial functions is chosen 
+ i (r2b + t2c + me + 4) 
with constant Al(z), beam width R(z) and temporal width T(z), wave 
front curvature b(z) and the “temporal curvature” corresponding to the 
chirp c(z), an integer m known as the topological charge of optical vortex 
and phase +(z) as parameters to optimize variational functional. Substi- 
tuting the trial function into Eq. (3) and integrating over T and t, the av- 
erage Lagrangian is obtained. It depends only on optimizing z-dependent 
parameters of this trial function. The condition that the variation of av- 
erage Lagrangian with respect to each of these parameters is zero, gives 
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. The equations for effective forces

In the case of the nonsingular light bullet (m = 0) the equilibrium curve e 
is given in Fig. 1.a. For the power larger than the critical one N,, follow- 
ing variational approach, the pulse is trapped inside the trapping curve t 
(dotted line in Fig. l.a) and it oscillates around its stable equilibrium e, as 
the numerical simulations confirm [8]. Light bullets are generated on the 
exact equilibrium curve n in Fig. 1.a obtained numerically. 
3. Filamentation 
An input pulse near the equilibrium undergoes damped oscillations around 
this curve before becoming light bullet; its “energy” N decreases due to 
radiative losses. A light bullet is an exceptionally robust pulse resisting 
to all perturbations. However, very far from equilibrium, a large input 
pulse (with a small amplitude) even thought in the trapping region may 
be subject to modulation instability. For instance, a pulse with amplitude 
A, 
= 0.4 and “energy” N = 3545 will first break into three cells in temporal 
domain, then the central cell breaks into two filaments in spatial domain, 
in order to merge back to the initial cell which finally disappears leaving 
only other two cells in temporal domain (see Fig. 2).

and N=3545 
4. Beam carrying phase singularity 
Let us consider now the nonlinear dynamics and stability of laser beams 
carrying phase singularity (m > 0) in media with cubic-quintic nonlinearity. 
Although PTS is self-focusing medium (ddn/dI > 0), at higher intensity, 
I > 0.510, it can exhibit features of defocusing media since the NIR has a 
negative slope ( d d n / d I  < 0). For the peak intensity I, > 0.510 the NIR 
becomes defocusing at the peak, while it remains focusing at the wings of 
the laser beam intensity profile. The NSE admits both LOVS and OVS 
solutions. 
In order to perform linear stability analysis of both OVS and LOVS the 
assumed steady state solution is perturbed 
E = (A(r) + [u'(~, z)ezp(ilQ) + a-(r, z)ezp(-iLQ)]) ezp(im8 +ipz) ( 8 )  
Substituting such a solution in Eq.(2) and linearizing with respect to 
where u* << A and azimuthal index L = 1,2,3, .... 
the perturbations the following coupled equations are obtained 
Q*u* + A2(1 - 2A2) (aF)* = 0 
(9) 
where the operator Q* reads 
If the constant p is smaller than the critical value 0.145, LOVS is stable 
for radial perturbation ( L  = 0) but not for azimuthal ones (maximal growth 

305 
rate r # 0 ). For ,b’ > 0.145 LOVS becomes stable (maximal growth rate 
r = 0). OVS is stable in whole studied range [9]. 
The switching from LOVS to OVS and vice versa may be used in infor- 
mation processing. Numerical simulations confirm the stability of such a 
novel kind of OVS. LOVS are stable to azimuthal perturbations only above 
breaking power NB = 160 on the equilibrium curve e in Fig. 1.b obtained 
from Eq. (7) when s = 0. This curve nearly coincides with the numerical 
curve n. Below this power the vortex soliton breaks into two stable bright 
solitons flying off tangentially to the initial ring and conserving the total 
angular momentum (MI = (mJN [7, 91. 
In realistic experimental conditions a singular Gaussian input beam is 
usually generated far from equilibrium, i.e., it differs substantially from the 
stationary vortex soliton. Even far from equilibrium (for instance, A, = 
0.5) input beam power well above the breaking one ( N B )  decreases due to 
radiative losses but will remain above the breaking one. 
Figure 3. Filaments for A ,  = 0.1 and N=300 
However, a new phenomenon occurs: the beam first breaks into four 
filaments coalescing subsequently into a ring. For the input amplitude 
A, = 0.4 at the same power, after resisting to the first splitting into four 
filaments, the beam finally breaks into two, since the power drops below 
N B .  An input beam with large width R and therefore, small amplitude 
(for instance, A, = 0.1) may be subject to the modulation instability that 

306 
usually leads to the beam breaking in multiple filaments (twelve in Fig. 3). 
Eight of them are coalescing and then splitting into four filaments running 
away tangentially together with four other. 
5. Summary 
Light bullets either with or without a topological charge as well as self- 
trapped singular beams in saturating nonlinear media are studied using 
variational approach. The simulations show that the pulse above critical 
energy is trapped provided its initial parameters belong to the range rea- 
sonably close to the one predicted by analytical approach. Thus, in spite 
of the initial asymmetry, in the final stage of evolution a symmetric stable 
pulse, i.e., a light bullet, will be formed. Light bullets are exceptionally 
robust self-guided objects that can be generated even far from stable equi- 
librium. However, very far from equilibrium filamentation occurs due to 
modulation instability. 
The nonlinear dynamics and stability of laser beams carrying phase 
singularity in media with cubic-quintic nonlinearity switching from self- 
focusing to self-defocusing and vice versa are also studied. In such media 
can be generated not only localized vortex solitons but also a novel kind of 
stable nonlocalized optical vortices. The stability properties of stationary 
vertices are examined using linear stability analysis. The stability in the 
defocusing regime is confirmed numerically. In the focusing regime LOVS 
break into filaments running away tangentially. Finally, the dynamics of 
a singular Gaussian beam is investigated using variational approach. Nu- 
merical simulations not only confirm analytical predictions but also show 
a new behavior of the Gaussian beam with input power much larger than 
the breaking one : either stable or finally unstable beam first breaks into 
filaments coalescing after. We can conclude that the vortex structure of the 
laser beam contributes in general, if not to suppress the filamentation, at 
least to distribute filaments symmetrically around the singularity in order 
to conserve the angular momentum.

DIFFERENTIAL INVARIANTS FOR 
INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL ALGEBRAS 
IRINA YEHORCHENKO 
Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine 
3 Tereshchenkivs ’ka Street, 01 601 Kyiv-4, Ukraine 
iyegorch@imath. kiev. v a  
We present an approach for construction of functional bases of differential invari- 
ants for some infinite-dimensional algebras with coefficients of generating operators 
depending on arbitrary functions. Some examples are presented, including invari- 
ants for algebras of equivalence groups for some PDE classes. 
1. Introduction 
Our studies in differential invariants (see e.g. Fushchych and Yehorchenko3) 
started from the problem of description of equations invariant under certain 
algebras.If we speak about single equations, we can say that all equations 
invariant under certain algebras can be presented as functions of absolute 
differential invariants. 
The theory and methods for searching differential invariants of finite- 
dimensional Lie algebras are well-developed. See for the relevant definitions 
e.g. the classical books7,’. 
All absolute invariants can be presented as functions of invariants from a 
functional basis. The number of invariants (of a certain particular order r )  
is determined as difference between the number of all derivatives up to 
the r-th order and both dependent and independent variables, and of the 
rank of r-th Lie prolongation of the basis operators of the algebra under 
consideration. 
The case of infinite-dimensional algebras is more complicated as their 
bases contain infinite (countable) number of operators (e.g. Virasoro and 
Kac-Moody algebras), or contain infinitesimal operators having arbitrary 
functions as coefficients. 
However, it appears that despite the name “infinite-dimensional” ranks 
of r-th Lie prolongations of basis operators are finite for each fixed r. Un- 
308 

309 
like finite-dimensional algebras these ranks do not stabilise, or do not reach 
any fixed value. Finiteness of such rank is discussed in Ref.'. Such finite- 
ness is obvious as the rank of the r-th prolongation of the basis operators 
cannot exceed the number of all derivatives up to the r-th order and both 
dependent and independent variables. 
Calculation of differential invariants for infinite-dimensional algebras 
is specifically interesting in application to equivalence algebras of classes 
of differential equations, as knowledge of such invariants gives criteria for 
equivalence of different equations from the same class with respect to lo- 
cal transformations of variables. In the case of ODE knowledge of such 
invariants gives both necessary and sufficient conditions of equivalence'. 
In a number of papers by N.H. Ibragimov and his coauthors (see 
e.g.  ref^.^,^) invariants for equivalence algebras of classes of differential 
equations are sought for directly. 
Here we suggest a systematic procedure that allows considerable simpli- 
fication of these calculations. Instead of arbitrary functions usually found 
in basis operators of equivalence algebras, we use expansions of these func- 
tions into Taylor series. We have to remember that we deal with arbitrary 
functions. Though they have to be infinitely differentiable (due to commu- 
tation condition in the definition of the Lie algebra), that does not mean 
that they are analytical. However, for the purpose of calculation of dif- 
ferential invariants of infinite-dimensional algebras we can reasonably limit 
our consideration by analytical functions in coefficients of basis operators, 
and with finite number of such arbitrary functions in coefficients of basis 
operators. 
Using expansion of coefficients into series allows replacement of opera- 
tors with arbitrary functions with infinite series of infinitesimal operators 
without such arbitrary functions. This approach allows much more straight- 
forward calculation of the prolongations' rank (in some cases the rank is 
equal to the number of variables and derivatives, and then it is easy to see 
without any further calculations that there are no absolute invariants of 
the respective order). 
Statement. For a fixed order r there is a functional basis of any Lie al- 
gebra, including infinite-dimensional algebras with finite number of such 
arbitrary functions in coefficients of basis operators or with countable infi- 
nite sequences of basis operators with no arbitrary functions.

2. Differential Invariants for Infinite-Dimensional 
Poincarb-Type Algebra 
We will illustrate our approach to searching absolute differential invari- 
ants of infinite-dimensional algebras by the example of infinite-dimensional 
Poincark-type algebra that is an invariance algebra of the eikonal equation. 
It is well-known that the simplest first-order relativistic equation - 
the 
eikonal or Hamilton equation, for n independent space variables x, and 
time variable 20, 
and scalar dependent variable u, 
u,u, = u; - us - ' ' ' - u; = 0 
(1) 
is invariant under the infinite-dimensional algebra generated by the opera- 
tors2 
X = (W'z, + .")ap + q(u)au, 
(2) 
-bp" 
= bvpr up, rl being arbitrary differentiable functions on u, 8, = d/dxp. 
Usual summation is implied over the repeated Greek indices: upup = ui - 
us - . . - ug. Equation (1) is widely used e.g. in geometrical optics. 
Here we construct differential invariants of orders 1 and 2. Instead of 
the operators (2), after expansion of the functions -bpw = bvp, ap, r] into 
Taylor series, we can consider the following sequences of operators: 
Jiw = uk(xpdv - swap), Pi = ukap, P," = .'au. 
(3) 
For the order 1 we have n+2 variables and n+l first derivatives, and the 
rank of the first prolongation of (2) is equal to 2 n t 3 .  There is no absolute 
invariants, and one obvious relative invariant upup. It is interesting to note 
that for the first order invariance under (2) implies invariance under the 
dilation operator D = xpap. 
The generating set of operators for the first prolongation will be Jpw = 
xrdw - xydp, D, P,", Pi, 
Rank of the first prolongation of this set is 2n+3, and invariance under 
prolongations of these operators is equivalent to invariance under the first 
prolongation of the algebra (3). 
Finding such simple generating set (with the rank and number of oper- 
ators equal to the rank of the first prolongation) makes finding invariants 
much simpler, and would allow using computer software to do so).

is covariant under the algebra (3) (for simplicity of the definition, we say 
that a tensor is covariant under a certain algebra, if all its convolutions are 
relative or absolute invariants of this algebra). 
Covariance can be checked directly by application of the Lie algorithm. 
Calculation of the rank of the second prolongation of (3) gives that there 
will be n second-order invariants: 
where sk = Q f i l ~ z Q f i z f i 3  . . . Qp,-tfil. 
Statement. The set (5) is a functional basis of second-order absolute 
differential invariants of the algebra (3). 
Here we can make a comment on sufficiency of consideration of analy- 
tical functions in (2) and correctness of the transition to algebra (3). 
We have found a set of functionally independent invariants using the 
algebra (3) and its rank; the rank of the second prolongation of (2) cannot 
be larger, as otherwise there would be only a smaller set of functionally 
independent invariants. 
3. Conclusion 
Here we present the steps for calculation functional bases of absolute differ- 
ential invariants for infinite-dimensional algebras with arbitrary functions 
in basis operators: 
1. Expand functions into Taylor series. 
2. Transform the set of operators with arbitrary functions into discrete 
infinite set without arbitrary functions. 
3. Find needed prolongations of the algebra. 
4. Calculate rank of the prolongation of the algebra. 
5. Find a minimal “generating set” of operators with the rank of their 
6. Find a functional basis using the “generating set”. 
prolongation equal to that of the prolongation of the algebra. 
Further research in this direction, beside calculation of invariants for 
other algebras, includes studying dependence of the ranks and orders of 
prolongations, and structures of the generation sets for the prolongations 
that may be of interest for study of the algebraic properties of invariant 
equations.
