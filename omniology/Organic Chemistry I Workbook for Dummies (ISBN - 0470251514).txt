Organic Chemistry I Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
O
rganic chemistry is a subject that blends basic chemistry, logic problems, 3-D puzzles,
and stick-figure art that looks like something you may find in a prehistoric cave. To say
that organic chemistry covers a pretty large amount of material is a bit like saying that
oxygen is pretty important for human survival. You’re probably somewhat familiar with an
organic chemistry textbook if you’re reading this workbook. I’d be proud to catch a fish that
weighed as much! Organic chemistry does cover a lot of material, so much that you can’t
possibly hope to memorize it all.
But good news! You don’t need to memorize the vast majority of the material if you under-
stand the basic concepts at a fundamental level, and indeed, memorization beyond the basic
rules and conventions is even frowned upon. The catch is that to really understand the con-
cepts, you have to practice at it by working problems. Lots of problems. Lots. Did I mention
the whole working problems thing? Mastering organic chemistry without working problems
is impossible — kind of like becoming an architect without bothering to draw up any plans.
This workbook is for getting hands-on experience. I’ve heard that organic exams are a lot like
a gunfight. You act out of instinct only if you’ve drilled the material you need to know.
Classmates who haven’t worked the problems will see the problems gunning at them on an
exam and spook. They’ll come down with a bad case of exam-block and start sucking their
thumbs and crying for Momma. You, on the other hand, having been to boot camp and prac-
ticed by drilling the problems every day, will stare the exam down like a cool-headed soldier
and get down to the serious business of whooping it up until it begs for its life.
About This Book
Ideally, you should use this book in conjunction with some other reference book, such as a
good introductory organic textbook or Organic Chemistry I For Dummies. This book doesn’t
cover the material in great detail; for each section, I give a brief overview of the topic 
followed by problems that apply the material.
The organization of this book follows the For Dummies text, which in turn is organized to
follow most organic texts fairly closely. The basic layout of this workbook is to give you
straightforward problems for each section to really drill the concepts and build your 
confidence — before spicing things up with a mischievous humdinger or two at the end of
each section to make you don the old thinking cap.
For added convenience, the book is modular, meaning that you can jump around to different
chapters without having to have read or worked problems in other chapters. If you need to
know some other concepts to get you up to speed, just follow the cross-references.

Conventions Used in This Book
As with all For Dummies books, I’ve tried to write the answers in a simple conversational
style, just as if you and I were having a one-on-one tutoring session, coffee in hand. Here are
some other conventions I’ve followed concerning the problems:
 At the beginning of each section, I present one or two example problems to show you
the thought process involved in working that problem type before you take a stab at
similar problems. You can refer back to the example while you’re working the other
problems in that section if you get stuck.
 Short answers appear in bold in the Answer Key, followed by a detailed breakdown of
how I solved each problem. This includes my personal thought process of how to solve
a particular problem type, such as where to start and how to proceed. Although other
thought processes may lead to the same answer, my explanation can at least give you a
guide for problems on which you get stuck.
 Sometimes, I discuss common mistakes that people make with a certain problem type.
My basic philosophy is that I’d rather over-explain than give too little explanation.
 In naming molecules, I’ve used official nomenclature of the International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, I made a few general assumptions about you, the reader. You proba-
bly meet at least one of these assumptions:
 You have a background in general chemistry, and ideally, you’ve taken a one- or two-
semester course in introductory chemistry.
 You’re in the midst of or are getting ready to enter your organic chemistry I class in col-
lege, and you need some extra help practicing the concepts.
 You took organic chemistry a few years ago, and you want to review what you know.
No matter where you stand, this book provides multiple chances to practice organic chem-
istry problems in an easy-to-understand (and dare I say fun) way.
How This Book Is Organized
I divide this workbook into five parts that cover the most important topics in first-semester
organic chemistry. Here’s an overview.
Part I: The Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry
Here’s where you first practice speaking the words of the organic chemist. You put charges on
structures, work with resonance, and draw structures using the various drawing schemes — all
2
Organic Chemistry I Workbook For Dummies 

the skills that you just gotta know to do well in the class. You also work with the functional
groups and do a bit of magic with acid and base chemistry, because these concepts are so
important when you work with organic reactions a little later in the course.
Part II: The Bones of Organic 
Molecules: Hydrocarbons
In this part, you enter the cemetery of the organic chemist and take a look at the hydro-
carbons. These are the bones of organic molecules that bind organic structures together, and
they consist of just hydrogen and carbon atoms. You first practice working with alkanes, the
sturdy carbon backbones that hold all the reactive centers on organic molecules in place and
keep things nice and stable. When you’re finally straight with these organic molecules, I take
you into the third dimension through stereochemistry. Stereochemistry is the way that
atoms can orient in space, and here you get to practice your 3-D visualization skills. You also
see how organic molecules can bend, flex, and pretzel themselves to form different confor-
mations, and you see how to predict the various energies of these conformations. Finally, you
get a first appetizer of organic reactions in the discussion of alkenes and alkynes, molecules
containing carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.
Part III: Functional Groups and Their Reactions
This is the part where you get the full entrée of organic reactions: the discussion of various
functional groups and their reactions, spiced up with a few healthy helpings of nomenclature.
Included are the alkyl halides, aromatic rings, and — my favorite! — the alcohols (of which
there are thousands more than the alcohol you find cheering up the local spirits and inspir-
ing karaoke singers in your favorite watering hole).
Part IV: Detective Work: Spectroscopy 
and Spectrometry
In this part, you put on your overcoat and fedora and break out the magnifying glass and
dusting powder. You practice your detective work in solving for unknown structures using
spectroscopy and spectrometry, instrumental techniques that let you nail down a structure
of an unknown molecule. You work on extracting the various parts of spectra (the data plots
coming out of these instruments) for clues to the identity of your molecule and then put all
the clues together, just as if you were in a cornball TV murder mystery trying to figure out
whodunit. So go get ’em, Sherlock.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In this part, I give you some tips on how to ace orgo exams. As an added bonus, I’ve included
the long-lost Ten Commandments of Organic Chemistry, which help you avoid committing
the common sins that lead organic chemistry students into the abyss. Disobey these com-
mandments at your own peril!

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
This book uses icons to direct you to important info. Here’s your key to these icons:
The Tip icon highlights orgo info that can save you time and cut down on the frustration
factor.
This symbol points out especially important concepts that you need to keep in mind as you
work problems.
The Warning icon helps you steer clear of organic chemistry pitfalls.
This icon directs you to the examples at the beginning of each set of problems.
Where to Go from Here
Organic chemistry builds on the concepts you picked up in general chemistry, so I strongly
suggest starting with Chapter 1. I know, I know, you’ve already taken a class in introductory
chemistry and have stuffed yourself silly with all that basic general-chemistry goodness —
and that’s all in the past, man, and you’re now looking to move on to bigger and better
things. However, winter breaks and days spent at the beach during summer vacations have a
cruel tendency to swish the eraser around the old bean, particularly across the places that
contain your vast, vast stores of chemistry knowledge. That’s why I suggest that you start
with Chapter 1 for a quick refresher and that you at least breeze through the rest of Part I. In
a sense, Part I is the most important part of the book, because if you can get the hang of
drawing structures and interpreting what they mean, you’ve reached the first major mile-
stone. Getting versed in these fundamental skills can keep you out of organic purgatory.
Of course, this book is designed to be modular, so you’re free to jump to whatever section
you’re having trouble with, without having to have done the problems in a previous chapter
as reference. Feel free to flip through the Table of Contents or the Index to find the topic that
most interests you.

Organic Chemistry I Workbook For Dummies 

Part I
The Fundamentals of
Organic Chemistry

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you discover the words of the organic
chemist — chemical structures. You start with drawing
structures using the various drawing conventions and
then see how you can assign charges, draw lone pairs,
and predict the geometries around any atom in an organic
molecule. With the basic tools under your belt, you get to
resonance structures, which are essentially patches you
can use to cover a few leaks in the Lewis structures of cer-
tain molecules. You also get to acid and base chemistry,
the simplest organic reactions, and begin your mastery
of showing how reactions occur by drawing arrows to
indicate the movement of electrons in a reaction.

Chapter 1
Working with Models and Molecules
In This Chapter
 Diagramming Lewis structures
 Predicting bond dipoles and dipole moments of molecules
 Seeing atom hybridizations and geometries
 Discovering orbital diagrams
O
rganic chemists use models to describe molecules because atoms are tiny creatures
with some very unusual behaviors, and models are a convenient way to describe on
paper how the atoms in a molecule are bonded to each other. Models are also useful for
helping you understand how reactions occur.
In this chapter, you use the Lewis structure, the most commonly used model for representing
molecules in organic chemistry. You also practice applying the concept of atom hybridiza-
tions to construct orbital diagrams of molecules, explaining where electrons are distributed
in simple organic structures. Along the way, you see how to determine dipoles for bonds and
for molecules — an extremely useful tool for predicting solubility and reactivity of organic
molecules.
Constructing Lewis Structures
The Lewis structure is the basic word of the organic chemist; these structures show which
atoms in a molecule are bonded to each other and also show how many electrons are shared
in each bond. You need to become a whiz at working with these structures so you can begin
speaking the language of organic chemistry.
To draw a Lewis structure, follow four basic steps:
1. Determine the connectivity of the atoms in the molecule.
Figure out how the atoms are attached to each other. Here are some guidelines:
• In general, the central atom in the molecule is the least electronegative element.
(Electronegativity decreases as you go down and to the left on the periodic table.)
• Hydrogen atoms and halide atoms (such as F, Cl, Br, and I) are almost always
peripheral atoms (not the central atom) because these atoms usually form only
one bond.

2. Determine the total number of valence electrons (electrons in the outermost shell).
Add the valence electrons for each of the individual atoms in the molecule to obtain
the total number of valence electrons in the molecule. If the molecule is charged, add
one electron to this total for each negative charge or subtract one electron for each
positive charge.
3. Add the valence electrons to the molecule.
Follow these guidelines:
• Start adding the electrons by making a bond between the central atom and each
peripheral atom; subtract two valence electrons from your total for each bond
you form.
• Assign the remaining electrons by giving lone pairs of electrons to the peripheral
atoms until each peripheral atom has a filled octet of electrons.
• If electrons are left over after filling the octets of all peripheral atoms, then assign
them to the central atom.
4. Attempt to fill each atom’s octet.
If you’ve completed Step 3 and the central atom doesn’t have a full octet of electrons,
you can share the electrons from one or more of the peripheral atoms with the central
atom by forming double or triple bonds.
You can’t break the octet rule for second-row atoms; in other words, the sum of the
bonds plus lone pairs around an atom can’t exceed four.
8
Part I: The Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry 
Q.
Draw the Lewis structure of CO3
2–.
A.
Most often, the least electronegative atom
is the central atom. In this case, carbon is
less electronegative than oxygen, so
carbon is the central atom and the connec-
tivity is the following:
Carbon has four valence electrons because
it’s an atom in the fourth column of the
O
C
O
O
O
C
O
O
2-
periodic table, and oxygen has six valence
electrons because it’s in the sixth column.
Therefore, the total number of valence
electrons in the molecule is 4 + 6(3) + 2 = 24
valence electrons. You add the additional
two electrons because the molecule has a
charge of –2 (if the molecule were to have a
charge of –3, you’d add three electrons; if
–4, you’d add four; and so forth).
Start by forming a bond between the central
carbon atom and each of the three periph-
eral oxygen atoms. This accounts for six of
the electrons (two per bond). Then assign
the remaining 18 electrons to the oxygens as
lone pairs until their octets are filled. This
gives you the following configuration:
O
C
O
O

Chapter 1: Working with Models and Molecules
The result of the preceding step leaves all
the oxygen atoms happy because they
each have a full octet of electrons, but the
central carbon atom remains unsatisfied
because this atom is still two electrons
short of completing its octet. To remedy
this situation, you move a lone pair from
one of the oxygens toward the carbon to
form a carbon-oxygen double bond.
Because the oxygens are identical, which
oxygen you take the lone pair from doesn’t
matter. In the final structure, the charge is

Predicting Bond Types
Bonds can form between a number of different atoms in organic molecules, but chemists like
to broadly classify these bonds so they can get a rough feel for the reactivity of that bond.
These bond types represent the extremes in bonding.
In chemistry, a bond is typically classified as one of three types:
 Purely covalent: The bonding electrons are shared equally between the two bonding
atoms.
 Polar covalent: The electrons are shared between the two bonding atoms, but
unequally, with the electrons spending more time around the more electronegative
atom.
 Ionic: The electrons aren’t shared. Instead, the more electronegative atom of the two
bonding atoms selfishly grabs the two electrons for itself, giving this more electronega-
tive atom a formally negative charge and leaving the other atom with a formal positive
charge. The bond in an ionic bond is an attraction of opposite charges.
You can often determine whether a bond is ionic or covalent by looking at the difference in
electronegativity between the two atoms. The general rules are as follows:
 If the electronegativity difference between the two atoms is 0.0, the bond is purely
covalent.
 If the electronegativity difference is between 0.0 and 2.0, the bond is considered polar
covalent.
 If the electronegativity difference is greater than 2.0, the bond is considered ionic.
Figure 1-2 shows the electronegativity values.

To determine the bond type, take the elec-

atoms in each bond. For the nitrogen-
potassium (N-K) bond, the electronegativity
value is 3.0 for nitrogen and 0.8 for potas-
sium, giving an electronegativity difference
of 2.2. Therefore, this bond is considered
ionic. For the N-H bonds, the nitrogen has
an electronegativity value of 3.0 and hydro-
gen has an electronegativity value of 2.2, 
so the electronegativity difference is 0.8.
Therefore, the N-H bonds are classified as
polar covalent.

Determining Bond Dipoles
Most bonds in organic molecules are of the polar covalent variety. Consequently,
although the electrons in a polar covalent bond are shared, on average they spend
more time around the more electronegative atom of the two bonding atoms. This
unequal sharing of the bonding electrons creates a separation of charge in the
bond called a bond dipole.
Bond dipoles are used all the time to predict and explain the reactivity of organic
molecules, so you need to understand what they mean and how to show them on
paper. You represent this separation of charge on paper with a funny-looking
arrow called the dipole vector. The head of the dipole vector points in the direc-
tion of the partially negatively charged atom (the more electronegative atom) and
the tail (which looks like a + sign) points toward the partially positive atom of the
bond (the less electronegative atom).

Determining Dipole Moments for Molecules
The sum of all the bond dipoles on a molecule is referred to as the molecule’s dipole moment.
Molecule dipole moments are useful in predicting the solubility of organic molecules. For
example, by using dipole moments, you can predict that oil and water won’t mix and will be
insoluble in each other, whereas water and alcohol will mix. Solubilities are important for
practical organic chemistry because it’s hard to get a reaction between two molecules that
don’t dissolve in the same solvent.
To determine the dipole moment of a molecule, follow these steps:
1. Draw the bond dipole vector for each of the bonds in the molecule.

Chlorine is more electronegative than
carbon, so in this bond, the bonding elec-
trons spend more time around chlorine
than around carbon. Therefore, the chlo-
rine holds a partial negative charge (the
symbol δ indicates a partial charge), and
the carbon holds a partial positive charge.
To draw the dipole vector, the head of the
vector points to the atom that has the par-
tial negative charge (the more electronega-
tive atom) — in this case, chlorine — 
while the tail points to the atom that has a
partial positive charge (the less electroneg-
ative atom) — in this case, carbon.

2. Add the individual bond dipole vectors using mathematical vector addition to
obtain the molecule’s overall dipole moment.
A simple method to add vectors is to line them up head to tail and then draw a new vector
that connects the tail of the first vector with the head of the second one.
You can generally ignore contributions to the molecular dipole moment from C-H
bonds because the electronegativity difference between carbon and hydrogen is so
small that the C-H bond dipoles don’t contribute in any significant way to the overall
molecule dipole moment.

Predicting Atom Hybridizations 
and Geometries
Organic molecules often have atoms stretched out into three-dimensional space. Organic
chemists care about how a molecule arranges itself in 3-D space because the geometry of a
molecule often influences the molecule’s physical properties (such as melting point, boiling
point, and so on) and its reactivity. The 3-D shape of molecules also plays a large role in a
molecule’s biological activity, which is important if you want to make a drug, for example.
To predict the geometry around an atom, you first need to determine the hybridization of
that atom.
You can often predict the hybridization of an atom simply by counting the number of atoms
to which that atom is bonded (plus the number of lone pairs on that atom). Table 1-1 breaks
down this information for you.

Making Orbital Diagrams
An orbital diagram expands on a Lewis structure (check out the “Constructing Lewis
Structures” section earlier in this chapter) by explicitly showing which orbitals on atoms
overlap to form the bonds in a molecule. Organic chemists use such orbital diagrams exten-
sively to explain the reactivity of certain bonds in a molecule, and the diagrams also do a
better job than Lewis structures of showing exactly where electrons are distributed in a mol-
ecule. Follow these three steps to draw an orbital diagram:
1. Determine the hybridization for each atom in the molecule.
Check out the preceding section for help on this step.
2. Draw all the valence orbitals for each atom.
Sp3-hybridized atoms have four valence sp3 orbitals; sp2-hybridized atoms have 
three sp2-hybridized orbitals and one p orbital; and sp-hybridized atoms have two

The oxygen has three attachments from the adjacent carbon plus the two lone pairs, making this
atom sp2 hybridized. Atoms that are sp2-hybridized have a trigonal planar geometry and bond angles
of 120° separating the three attachments. Note: Don’t take the oxygen’s double bond into account;
rather, simply count the number of attached atoms plus lone pairs. The carbon has two attachments
and so is sp hybridized with a linear geometry and 180° bond angles between the attachments. And

for constructing your orbital diagrams (where A represents the hybridized atom):
3. Determine which orbitals overlap to form bonds.
Single bonds are always sigma bonds — bonds that form from the overlapping of
orbitals between the two nuclei of the bonding atoms. A double bond, on the other
hand, consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond. A pi bond is formed from the side-by-
side overlapping of two p orbitals above and below the nuclei of the two bonding atoms.
A triple bond consists of two pi bonds and one sigma bond.

overlap to give rise to the bonds in acety-
lene. The C-H bonds form from overlap of
the hydrogen 1s orbitals with the sp orbitals
on carbon. Triple bonds consist of two pi
bonds and one sigma bond. The one sigma
bond comes from overlap of the two carbon
sp orbitals. The two pi bonds come from
overlap of the two p orbitals on each carbon,

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
Boron is the central atom because it’s less electronegative than fluorine (and in any case, 
halogens such as F almost never form more than one single bond). Boron has three valence
electrons, fluorine has seven, and the charge on the molecule is –1, so the total number of
valence electrons in this molecule is 3 + 7(4) + 1 = 32. Adding single bonds from boron to each
of the four fluorines (for a total of eight electrons, two per bond) and adding the remaining 24
electrons to the fluorines as lone pairs gives the Lewis structure shown. Each atom is happy
because it has a full octet of electrons, so there’s no need to make multiple bonds.
b
Carbon is the central atom because it’s less electronegative than oxygen. A hydrogen can never
be the central atom because hydrogens don’t form more than one bond.
Hydrogen has one valence electron, carbon has four valence electrons, and oxygen has six
valence electrons, so the total number of valence electrons is 2(1) + 4 + 6 = 12 valence electrons.
Adding a single bond from carbon to each of the two hydrogens and a single bond to the
oxygen and peppering the remaining lone pairs onto the oxygen gives you the structure in the
middle. Although oxygen is happy because it has a full octet of electrons, carbon isn’t faring as
well because it’s two electrons short of its octet. Therefore, you push down one of the lone
pairs from oxygen to form a double bond from oxygen to carbon. After that move is complete,
all the atoms are happy because each atom has a full octet of electrons. Note: You can’t give
any lone pairs to hydrogen because with one bond already, hydrogen has satisfied its valence
shell with two electrons (recall that the first shell holds only two electrons, and then it’s eight
in the second shell).
c
Nitrogen is the central atom in NO2
– because nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen.
Nitrogen has five valence electrons, oxygen has six, and the charge on the molecule is –1, so the
molecule has 5 + 2(6) + 1 = 18 valence electrons.

Part I: The Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry 

Making single bonds from N to both oxygens (for a total of four electrons, two per bond) leaves
14 electrons. Adding these electrons onto the oxygens until both oxygens have completed their
octet still leaves two electrons left over. Place these two electrons on the central nitrogen.
Examining this structure reveals that both oxygens have a complete octet, but nitrogen is still
shy two electrons. So a lone pair on one of the oxygens is pushed onto the nitrogen to form a
nitrogen-oxygen double bond. Last, add the charge to complete the final structure.
d
Ionic. Fluorine has an electronegativity of 4.0, and sodium has an electronegativity of 0.9, so the
electonegativity difference is 3.1, making this bond an ionic bond.
e
The C-C bonds are purely covalent; the C-Cl bonds are polar covalent. The C-C bond in hexa-
chloroethane is purely covalent because there’s 0.0 electronegativity difference between the
two atoms (because they’re the same). The C-Cl bonds are all polar covalent because the elec-
tronegativity difference between chlorine (3.0) and carbon (2.5) is 0.5.
f
Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, so oxygen is partially negatively charged and
carbon is partially positively charged. Therefore, the bond dipole vectors point toward the 
oxygens.
g
In methanol, the oxygen is more electronegative than either carbon or hydrogen. Therefore, 
the oxygen is partially negative charged and the carbon and hydrogen are partially positively
charged. As a result, both bond dipole vectors point toward the oxygen.
h
The two C-Cl bonds have dipole vectors pointing toward the chlorine (because chlorine is more
electronegative than carbon). Summing these two vectors gives the dipole moment vector
(vector c) for the molecule, which points between the two carbon-chlorine bonds.

i
Both C-Cl bond vectors point toward the chlorine because chlorine is more electronegative
than carbon. However, summing up the two vectors gives a net dipole moment of 0.0 — the two
individual bond dipole vectors cancel each other out. Therefore, although the individual C-Cl
bonds do have bond dipoles, the molecule has no net dipole moment.
j
The carbon has two attachments (one being the lone pair), making this atom sp hybridized.
The nitrogen has four attachments, making this atom sp3 hybridized. Sp-hybridizied atoms have
a linear geometry with a 180° bond angle between the two attachments. Sp3-hybridized atoms
have a tetrahedral geometry with a 109.5° bond angle between the four attachments.
k
Both the carbon and oxygen in this molecule have three attachments, so both atoms are sp2
hybridized. Sp2-hybridized atoms are trigonal planar and have bond angles of 120° between the
three attachments. Hydrogen is the one atom type that remains unhybridized.

Finally, show the orbital overlap. The C-H bonds are formed from overlap of two carbon sp2
orbitals with the two hydrogen 1s orbitals. This leaves one carbon sp2 orbital and one carbon p
orbital for forming the double bond. The carbon sp2 orbital and one of the oxygen sp2 orbitals
overlap to form a sigma bond. The pi bond is formed from overlap of the carbon p orbital and
the oxygen p orbital. Last, place the two oxygen lone pairs into the remaining unoccupied sp2
hybridized orbitals on oxygen as shown earlier.
n
This problem is admittedly pretty difficult. The first step is assigning the hybridizations of each
of the atoms. The outer carbons are sp2 hybridized, and the inner carbon is sp hybridized.
Next, show all the valence orbitals on each of the atoms. The tricky part is lining up the orbitals
from the middle carbon to the outer carbons so the orbitals can overlap to form one double
bond each. Each double bond consists of a sigma bond and a pi bond. Therefore, each of the
carbon-carbon sigma bonds must consist of an sp2-sp orbital overlap. Pi bonds are formed from
the p orbital overlaps. Therefore, you have to line up the p orbitals so it’s possible for the
orbitals to overlap with the central carbon.
Finally, show the orbital overlap. First, the C-H bonds are formed from the overlap between the
outer carbon sp2 orbitals and the hydrogen 1s orbitals. The sigma bonds in the two double
bonds are formed in both cases from the overlap between the central carbon sp orbital and the
two outer carbon sp2 orbitals. The pi bonds are then formed from the overlap of the two p
orbitals on the central carbon and the lone p orbitals on the outer carbons.
An interesting outcome of this orbital diagram is that the orbital diagram predicts that the two
hydrogens on the left will be coming into and out of the plane of the paper, while the two hydro-
gens on the right will be going up and down in the plane of the paper. As a matter of fact, this
turns out to be the geometry found experimentally. Chalk one up to orbital diagrams!

he language of chemistry isn’t a spoken language or a written language but a language of
pictures. Lewis structures are the pictorial words of the organic chemist, much like
hieroglyphics were the pictorial words of the ancient Egyptians. Organic chemists currently
use a number of different methods for drawing structures. You may already be familiar with
the full Lewis structure (if not, see Chapter 1), but organic chemists often like to abbreviate
Lewis structures by using simpler drawings to make speaking the language of organic chem-
istry faster and easier, much like you abbreviate words when text messaging your friends.
Two abbreviations to Lewis structures that you should become familiar with are the con-
densed structure and the line-bond structure, because you see these two structural abbrevia-
tions again and again throughout organic chemistry. This chapter familiarizes you with
drawing and interpreting these structural abbreviations (condensed and line-bond struc-
tures) and helps you understand what the structural abbreviations mean. Before you get
down to the dirty business of drawing structures, you practice determining formal charges
and the number of lone pairs on atoms in a structure, two skills that are essential to master-
ing organic structures.
Assigning Formal Charges
The following equation shows a down-’n’-dirty method of calculating the formal charge on an
atom. The dots are the non-bonding electrons assigned to an atom, and the sticks are the
total number of bonds attached to an atom (a single bond counts as one stick, a double bond
counts as two sticks, a triple, three):
Formal charge of an atom = number of valence electrons – dots – sticks

Of course, the secret is that no organic chemist actually calculates the charges on every
atom in every molecule he or she looks at. Instead, the chemist becomes familiar with the
structures of atoms with charges. For instance, neutral carbon has four bonds, but carbon is
positively charged when it has three bonds and is negatively charged when it has three
bonds and a lone pair.
Figure 2-1 shows the patterns of charges for common atoms. Do yourself a big favor and
memorize this table — or at the very least, master how many bonds and lone pairs are found
on common neutral atoms. For example, when neutral, carbon has four bonds, nitrogen has
three bonds and a lone pair, oxygen has two bonds and two lone pairs, and so on.

To calculate the formal charge for the nitro-

Nitrogen is in the fifth column of the peri-
odic table, so it has five valence electrons.
This atom has no dots because it doesn’t
have any non-bonding electrons, but it has
four sticks (one stick for each of the four
single bonds). Plugging these values into
the equation produces 5 – 0 – 4 = +1.
The oxygen has six valence electrons (sixth

one stick. Plugging these values into the

Chapter 2: Speaking Organic Chemistry: Drawing and Abbreviating Lewis Structures
Determining Lone Pairs on Atoms
Chemists are often lazy creatures (I would know; I am one!), and so many times in Lewis 
structures, the lone pairs of electrons on atoms aren’t drawn because it’s assumed that if the
charge is specified, you can figure out for yourself how many lone pairs are on a given atom.
Of course, to figure out how many lone pairs an atom owns, you can always plug the values
into the rearranged formal charge equation I provide in the earlier “Assigning Formal Charges”
section:
Dots = valence electrons – formal charge – sticks
But just as with formal charges, no organic chemist actually calculates the lone pairs on every
atom in a structure where they aren’t shown (did I mention that chemists are lazy?). Instead,
after some time working with these structures, organic chemists master all the different pat-
terns of lone pairs on atoms. For example, a negatively charged carbon has one lone pair of
electrons (two dots); an oxygen that’s neutral has two lone pairs (four dots); and so forth
(refer to Figure 2-1).

Abbreviating Lewis Structures 
with Condensed Structures
One of the most common structural abbreviations to Lewis structures is called the con-
densed structure. In a condensed structure, bonds to hydrogen from second- or third-row
atoms aren’t explicitly drawn; instead, these atoms are grouped into clusters (such as CH2 or
CH3 clusters), and the clusters are written in a chain to show the connectivity. The rules 
(and some additional quirks you should be familiar with) for drawing condensed structures
include the following:
 The bonds between the clustered atoms in a condensed structure can be shown, 
but they’re often omitted. The top condensed structure explicitly shows the bonds
between the clusters; in the bottom condensed structure, they’re omitted.
Chemists can instinctively look at a molecule and know how many lone pairs are on each
atom simply because they’ve memorized the patterns. And that’s exactly what you need to
do, because having this skill makes your life much easier and gives you a big advantage as
you go forward in this subject.

 Condensed structures are most commonly used to abbreviate the structure of simple
organic molecules connected in a linear chain. However, condensed structures can also
abbreviate more complicated molecules (such as complex molecules containing
branches or rings) if the connectivity of the atoms is made clear by explicitly drawing
the bonds between the clusters.
 You can show simple substituents off a linear chain by enclosing each substituent in
parentheses after you’ve written the atom to which it’s attached. However, if the sub-
stituent is just a single atom, such as a halide (like F, Br, and Cl), or is in a carbonyl
group (C=O group), you don’t need to put the substituent in parentheses; just place
this single atom after the atom to which it’s attached in the chain.
 Clusters that repeat in a straight chain (usually CH2 clusters) can be abbreviated fur-
ther by placing the repeating cluster in parentheses and using a subscript to show how
many times the cluster repeats itself down a linear chain.
 When two or more identical clusters connect to a single atom, you can use parentheses
along with a subscript to show the number of identical clusters attached to that atom.

Drawing Line-Bond Structures
The most common structural abbreviations of the full Lewis structure is the line-bond 
structure (also called a Kekulé structure or a line-angle structure). In a line-bond structure, 
carbons and hydrogen atoms aren’t explicitly shown; instead, a chain of carbons is repre-
sented by a jagged line, with each point (or node) on the jagged line representing a carbon
atom. All charges are assumed to be neutral unless a charge is shown, so it’s understood that
you can mentally figure out how many hydrogens a carbon has by making the total number
of bonds to carbon equal to four (you practice this concept in the “Determining Hydrogens
on Line-Bond Structures” section later in this chapter). Non-carbon atoms, however, must be
explicitly shown, and any hydrogens attached to atoms other than carbon are also explicitly
drawn.
Q.
Draw the line-bond representation for the following Lewis structure:
A.
As in all line-bond drawings, the carbon chain is represented by a jagged line. Note: The
ends of the lines (or tips of the lines) represent carbon atoms. The nitrogen and the hydro-
gens attached to the nitrogen are explicitly shown in the line-bond structure because the
only atoms in a line-bond structure that aren’t shown are carbon atoms and the hydrogen
atoms that are attached to carbons.

Determining Hydrogens 
on Line-Bond Structures
Line-bond structures assume you can mentally supply the number of hydrogens to each
carbon. You can accomplish this by adding hydrogens to a carbon until the carbon’s total
number of bonds equals four. Although this process is straightforward, you should still prac-
tice a few of these problems so you get the hang of it.

32
Part I: The Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry 
Q.
Determine how many hydrogens that aren’t
shown are bonded to each of the indicated
carbon atoms.
A.
The key is to determine how many bonds a
carbon already has and then see how many
hydrogens you need to add so the number
of bonds to carbon becomes four. Of
course, if the carbon already has four
bonds, then that carbon doesn’t have any
hydrogens.

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented earlier in this chapter.
a
The formal charges are as follows: boron –1, oxygen +1, and chlorine 0.
Boron has three valence electrons, no dots (no non-bonding electron pairs), and four sticks
(four single bonds), so plugging these values into the equation produces the following: Formal
charge on B = 3 – 0 – 4 = –1.
Oxygen has six valence electrons, two dots, and three sticks: Formal charge on O = 6 – 2 – 3 = +1.
Chlorine has seven valence electrons, six dots, and one stick: Formal charge on Cl = 7 – 6 – 1 = 0.
b
The formal charges are as follows: nitrogen –1, oxygen 0, and carbon +1.
Nitrogen has five valence electrons, four dots (two lone pairs), and two sticks, so plugging
these values into the equation produces the following: Formal charge on N = 5 – 4 – 2 = –1.
Oxygen has six valence electrons, four dots, and two sticks: Formal charge on O = 6 – 4 – 2 = 0.
Carbon has four valence electrons, no dots, and three sticks: Formal charge on C = 4 – 0 – 3 = +1.

Using the scanning method, look for atoms that have a number of bonds different from neutral
form. For example, carbon has four bonds when neutral, so look for carbons that have anything
other than four bonds. The left-most carbon has three bonds and a lone-pair, so this atom has a
charge. Looking at the patterns shown in Figure 2-1, this configuration is for a negatively-
charged carbon.
For nitrogen, the neutral configuration is three bonds and a lone pair. Therefore, the nitrogen
shown that has four bonds and no lone pairs must have a charge. This configuration is for a
positively-charged nitrogen. The other carbons have four bonds, so these atoms are neutral.
d
A neutral oxygen has two bonds and two lone pairs. Therefore, the right-most oxygen and the
oxygen double-bonded to the nitrogen are neutral because both of these atoms have that con-
figuration. However, the left-most oxygen has one bond and three lone pairs, the configuration
for a negatively charged oxygen. Nitrogen’s neutral valency is three bonds and a lone pair, but
the nitrogen in this structure has four bonds, a configuration matching a positively-charged
nitrogen (if you’re ever in doubt, plug the values into the equation to make sure). The carbon
atom has four bonds, so it’s neutral.
e
For determining lone pairs, check out the patterns for the common charged atoms in Figure 2-1.
For instance, a negatively charged nitrogen atom has two bonds and two lone pairs. A nega-
tively charged carbon atom has three bonds and one lone pair. Knowing these configurations
allows you to quickly add lone pairs without doing any math.
f
Knowing the common configurations in Figure 2-1 can help you supply the number of lone pairs
to all the atoms. Here, a positively charged oxygen has three bonds and one lone pair. A neutral
oxygen has two bonds and two lone pairs, and a neutral nitrogen has three bonds and one lone
pair.

Line up the clusters. You can show the bonds between the clusters if you like, although I’ve
omitted them. Because two identical groups (CH3 groups) are attached to the oxygen, you can
make a further abbreviation by placing the CH3 groups in parentheses with the subscript 2.
h
One way of condensing this structure is to simply line the clusters into a chain. Because a number
of repeating clusters exist, you can draw an even more condensed form that places the repeating
clusters in parentheses with a subscript to show how many clusters are repeated down the chain.
i
This structure is complex because it contains a ring and doesn’t consist merely of a linear chain

This molecule has a number of acceptable condensed structures. Perhaps the most obvious
one is to draw the bonds connecting the clusters at the right-hand side where the structure
becomes more complex. Alternatively, the two end CH3 clusters are both attached to the same
atom (nitrogen), so you can place these clusters in parentheses with a subscript. As another
alternative, you can show the oxygen substituent after the carbon to which it’s connected with-
out parentheses, because single-atom substituents don’t need to go in parentheses. You can
make further abbreviations by placing the repeating CH2 clusters in parentheses with a sub-
script to indicate how many of the clusters repeat in the chain. Any of these are acceptable
condensed structures.
k
Use a jagged line to represent the carbon chain, with each point representing a carbon atom.
Double and triple bonds, such as the carbon-oxygen double bond, must be explicitly shown.
Additionally, you should explicitly show atoms that aren’t hydrogen or carbon, such as nitro-
gen and oxygen.
l
You should explicitly draw all double bonds and triple bonds. Additionally, by convention, you
should draw all triple bonds in a straight line to show that these triple bonds adopt a linear
geometry.
m
The main thing to remember with this structure is that you have to show hydrogens attached
to any atom other than carbon. That means you have to explicitly draw the H attached to the
oxygen atom.

q
You can assume that each carbon has four bonds unless a charge is shown; therefore, to get the
number of hydrogens attached to each carbon, you determine how many bonds to carbon are
shown — the difference is the number of hydrogens that aren’t shown but are assumed to be
attached.
r
Just as in question 17, you find the difference between the number of shown bonds and the
number four to get the number of hydrogens not shown attached to each carbon atom.

T
he Lewis structure is really quite a simple model for such a very complicated thing as a
molecule, and sometimes this simple model gets it wrong. So what do chemists do?
Instead of adopting a more complicated model to describe a molecule (such as the complex
molecular orbital theory model I discuss in Chapter 14), chemists decided to patch the Lewis
structure so that it does describe the molecule better in the few instances that it fails —
much like a plumber may prefer to patch a few leaks in a cheap drain instead of installing a
more expensive one. These patches to the Lewis structure are called resonance structures.
Lewis structures do a good job of representing single bonds. Where Lewis structures make
their boo-boo is in molecules that contain lone pairs and double or triple bonds, because a
single Lewis structure often doesn’t accurately describe their electron distribution. For these
molecules, resonance structures give a better representation of where the electrons are
located in the molecule.
Keep the following rules for resonance structures in mind as you work through this chapter:
 Don’t move single bonds. Because Lewis structures describe single bonds correctly,
you don’t move single bonds, only lone pairs or double or triple bonds.
 Ensure that all resonance structures are valid Lewis structures. That means that you
can’t break the octet rule for any of the resonance structures (the sum of lone pairs and
bonds around a second-row atom can’t exceed four).
 Don’t move atoms. In resonance structures, the only thing that changes is the distribu-
tion of pi electrons (double bonds, triple bonds, and lone-pair electrons).
 Remember charges. In many cases, resonance structures have formal charges. Just
remember that the sum of the charges must be the same for each resonance structure
because each one describes the same molecule — you can’t lose any electrons in going
from one resonance structure to the next. Of course, the total number of charges may
change from one resonance structure to another, but the sum of the charges must
remain the same.

Keeping track of charges can be a bit tricky in this chapter because I switch between full
Lewis structures, condensed structures, and line-bond structures to give you further experi-
ence with each of these drawing styles (refer to Chapter 2). If you’re still a little shaky when
using these different drawings and determining formal charges, don’t worry; with enough
practice manipulating and interpreting all three, it should soon become second nature 
to you.
Seeing Cations Next to a Double Bond, 
Triple Bond, or Lone Pair
One pattern that indicates that more than one resonance structure exists for a molecule is a
cation situated next to a double bond, a triple bond, or a lone pair. A cation is organic-speak
for a positively charged atom; when a cation is located on a carbon atom, the charge is often
specifically referred to as a carbocation.
To draw alternative resonance structures matching this pattern, follow these steps:
1. Push the electrons from the double bond, triple bond, or lone pair toward the
charged atom.
Draw an arrow from the electrons you’re moving toward the positively charged atom.
2. Move the arrows correctly.
Arrows represent the movement of two electrons from where they started to where
they’re going, so make sure the arrow starts in one of these places:
• At the double or triple bond, to indicate the movement of these pi electrons
• From the lone pair of electrons
Then make the arrow point between the positively charged atom and the closest adja-
cent atom to indicate that these two electrons are being moved here in order to form a
new double bond.
3. Draw the resonance structure showing the new double bond, and check your
charges.
The positive charge should’ve moved either to one of the original double-bond or
triple-bond atoms (if you moved a double or triple bond) or to the atom that originally
contained the lone pair (if you moved a lone pair).

Move the double-bond electrons and 
push them to make a new double bond
on the other side. To do this, you start by
drawing an arrow originating from the
double bond (the electrons you’re going to
move) and point the arrow to the middle of
the adjacent C-C bond (where the electrons
are moving to). This change in the electron
distribution moves the positive charge
from the left carbon to the right carbon.
The actual structure of the molecule looks
like the hybrid of the two resonance struc-
tures. Thus, each C-C bond is expected to
be roughly 1.5 bonds (partial bonds are
indicated with the dotted line), and the
positive charge is expected to be shared
equally between the two terminal carbons
(+1⁄2 each).

draw an arrow starting from the lone pair
of electrons, with the head of the arrow
pointing to the C-C single bond (not point-
ing to the carbon atom because the elec-
trons are going to form the C=C double
bond). After you’ve drawn this arrow, you
can’t stop here, or the central carbon will
have five bonds and be pentavalent (five
bonds times two electrons each would give
ten electrons around the central carbon —
a big no-no). Therefore, you have to simul-
taneously move the existing double-bond
electrons and place them as a lone pair on
the right-most carbon. You do this by draw-
ing an arrow originating from the double
bond and pointing it to the right-most
carbon. This move has the effect of moving
the negative charge to the right-most
carbon.
Pushing Lone Pairs Next 
to a Double or Triple Bond
Another pattern you see that indicates that a molecule can be described by more than one
Lewis structure is an atom with a lone pair directly attached to a double bond or triple bond.
To draw alternative resonance structures matching this pattern, follow these steps:
1. Push the electrons from the lone pair toward the double bond or triple bond.
To accomplish this electron pushing, draw an arrow from the lone-pair electrons point-
ing toward the center of the adjacent bond. This move indicates that you’re using the
lone pair to form a new double bond.
2. Move the double- or triple-bond pi electrons onto the farthest atom as a lone pair.
Draw an arrow starting from the middle of the double or triple bond and move the 
electrons onto the farthest atom in the double or triple bond by pointing the head of
the arrow to this atom.
3. Draw the resonance structure and check your charges.
The atom with the initial lone pair becomes one charge more positive in the resonance
structure than what it started with, and the atom that received the double- or triple-
bond electrons as a lone pair becomes one charge more negative than what it started
with.

Pushing Double or Triple Bonds Containing 
an Electronegative Atom
If a double or triple bond contains an electronegative atom, such as oxygen or nitrogen, you
can draw a resonance structure in which the double bond moves onto the electronegative
atom as a lone pair. For neutral molecules, this leads to a resonance structure in which the
electronegative atom has a negative charge and the less electronegative atom is left posi-
tively charged.
To draw alternative resonance structures matching this pattern, follow these steps:
1. Push the pi bond electrons from the double or triple bond onto the electronegative
atom as a lone pair.
Start with an arrow from the middle of the double or triple bond and point it toward
the electronegative atom, showing how the pi bond electrons are reassigned as a lone
pair onto the more electronegative atom.
2. Draw the resonance structure and check the charges.
The electronegative atom, having accepted electrons as a lone pair, should’ve become
one charge more negative in the resonance structure than it began. Thus, if the elec-
tronegative atom started positive, it should become neutral in the resonance structure.
Likewise, the more electropositive atom should’ve become one charge unit more posi-
tive in the resonance structure than it began.

Oxygen is an electronegative atom
involved in a double bond, so a resonance
structure can be drawn for this molecule.
To start, draw an arrow originating from
the carbon-oxygen double bond and move
the electrons onto the oxygen as a lone
pair. This makes the double bond become a
single bond, because two of the electrons
have been moved. Additionally, the oxygen
has become negatively charged and the
carbon, positively charged. (Because the
molecule started with a net neutral charge,
the net charge in the resonance structure
must remain neutral.)

Alternating Double Bonds around a Ring
A very interesting resonance structure can occur when you have a molecule that has alter-
nating double bonds all the way around a ring. In such a molecule, you can make an alterna-
tive resonance structure by pushing each double bond one bond over all the way around the
ring. Note that stopping at any step and not coming full circle leaves an atom that breaks the
octet rule.
To draw these types of structures, follow these steps:
1. Push the double-bond electrons all the way around the ring to reform each of the
double bonds between different atoms.
Start by placing an arrow at the center of one of the double bonds and point it toward
the adjacent bond (the direction around the ring doesn’t matter). Continue this same
procedure all the way around the ring until you’re back where you started.
2. Draw the resonance structure, making sure you don’t break the octet rule.
When you draw the resonance structure, each of the double bonds is reassigned to a
different location on the ring. Make sure you don’t break the octet rule by stopping
before you’ve pushed the double bonds all the way around the ring to end up at the
atom that you started with.

Drawing Multiple Resonance Structures
Sometimes a compound has a number of resonance structures. Practicing on a few of these
molecules that need to be described with multiple resonance structures is a good idea so
you can get some more practice at spotting molecules that have resonance structures.
To draw multiple resonance structures, follow these steps:
1. Look for one of the patterns to find a first alternative resonance structure.
The four patterns are as follows:
• Cations next to a double bond, triple bond, or lone pair
• Lone pairs next to a double or triple bond
• Double or triple bonds containing an electronegative atom
• Double bonds alternating around a ring
2. After drawing the alternative resonance structure, look for additional patterns in
the new resonance structure.
Often, drawing a resonance structure leads to a structure that meets one of the preced-
ing patterns, in which case an additional resonance structure can be drawn. Repeat
this step until you can’t find any more alternative resonance structures.

another resonance structure, which has
another pattern — a cation next to a
double bond. From this resonance 
structure, you can push the double-bond
electrons over one bond and reform the
cation on the right-most carbon. In this
way, you can draw all three resonance
structures for this molecule.

Assigning Importance to Resonance Structures
A molecule with more than one resonance structure looks like the hybrid of all the resonance
structures — but not all resonance structures necessarily contribute equally to the overall
hybrid. In other words, if a molecule has two resonance structures, the actual structure may
look more like one resonance structure than the other.
Generally, resonance structures that correspond to stable structures contribute more to the
overall hybrid than do resonance structures that are less stable. So how do you determine
stability? Here are some general guidelines:
 Resonance structures with fewer charges are more stable than resonance structures
with more charges. For example, a resonance structure that has no charges con-
tributes more to the overall hybrid than a resonance structure that has two. This rule
comes as a result of the energy cost of separating charges.
 For those molecules that are charged, the most stable resonance structures are the
ones that place the charge on the best atom. Negative charges prefer to rest on elec-
tronegative atoms (like oxygen and nitrogen), and positive charges prefer to rest on
electropositive atoms (like carbon).
 Resonance structures that have all atoms with complete octets of electrons are more
stable than resonance structures that have atoms with incomplete octets. This rule
comes as a result of the desire of atoms to own a complete octet of electrons.
 The desire of a molecule to have all atoms with complete octets trumps the desire to
put the charge on the best atoms. (The following example demonstrates this rule.)

In this example, the right-hand resonance
structure is more stable than the one on
the left. In the right resonance structure,
all atoms own complete octets of elec-
trons, whereas in the left structure, the
carbon is two electrons short of an octet.
Thus, even though a positive charge
prefers to rest on carbon rather than
oxygen (because carbon is more elec-
tropositive than oxygen), the desire of a
molecule to have filled octets trumps the
desire to put the charge on the best
atoms. Therefore, the actual structure is
a mixture of the two resonance struc-
tures but looks more like the resonance
structure on the right than the one on
the left.

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
Start by moving the double-bond electrons to the adjacent bond. Doing so moves the positive
charge. The actual structure is a mixture of the two structures, with approximately half of the
positive charge residing on each of the two carbons that were charged in the resonance struc-
tures.
b
Start by moving the triple-bond pi electrons onto the adjacent bond, which results in the
charge being moved to what was once a triple-bond carbon. The actual structure looks like a
hybrid of the two resonance structures, with roughly half of the charge residing on each of the
two carbons shown having a charge in the resonance structures.
c
Draw the first resonance structure by moving the double bond adjacent to the cation over one
bond in the direction of the charge. This results in the formation of a new C=C double bond and
the cation moving two carbons to the left. You can draw a further resonance structure in a simi-
lar fashion starting from this new structure. By moving the adjacent double bond to the cation
in the direction of the charge and redrawing the charge another two carbons to the left, you
determine the final resonance structure. The actual structure looks like the average of the three
resonance structures, with roughly a third of the charge occupying each of the carbons that
held charge in the resonance structures.

Part I: The Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry 
d
Here you have an oxygen lone pair adjacent to the positive charge, so you can draw an alterna-
tive resonance structure by pushing the lone pair down to form a new C=O bond. The result of
this electron redistribution places the positive charge on the oxygen.
e
Here you have a double bond adjacent to a positive charge, so you can draw a resonance struc-
ture by pushing the double-bond electrons toward the positive charge to form a new double
bond. The result of this electron redistribution moves the charge two carbons to the right. In
this new resonance structure, you have a lone pair adjacent to a positive charge, so you can
draw another resonance structure by pushing the lone pair down toward the charged carbon
and forming a new C=N double bond. Doing so yields the final resonance structure, in which the
positive charge is on nitrogen.
f
Because the double bond is adjacent to the positive charge, you can draw an alternative reso-
nance structure by moving the double bond in the direction of the charge and reforming the
C=C double bond. The result of this move is that the cation moves two carbons to the left. This
leads to a new structure in which a lone pair is adjacent to the positive charge, so you can draw
a further resonance structure by pushing the lone pair down toward the charged carbon to
form a new C=O double bond. This move relocates the positive charge onto the oxygen and
gives the final resonance structure.
g
Here you have a lone pair adjacent to a double bond, so you start by moving the lone pair down
from nitrogen to form a C=N double bond. You can’t stop at this step, however, or the carbon
attached to the nitrogen becomes pentavalent, so you simultaneously move the double bond as
a lone pair to the adjacent carbon.
h
Start by moving the lone pair to form a double bond. Then move electrons from one bond of
the triple bond onto the adjacent carbon. Because two electrons move from the triple bond, it
becomes a double bond, and the negative charge moves to the right-most carbon.

i
This problem has two atoms with lone pairs adjacent to the double bond, so you have two
additional resonance structures. It doesn’t matter which lone pair you start with, but move one
of them down off the negatively-charged oxygen to form a C=O double bond, and move the elec-
trons from the existing C=O double bond to the oxygen as a lone pair. The oxygen atom that
received the lone pair becomes negatively charged. You can then repeat this process for the
other oxygen atom to obtain the other resonance structure.
j
You can move the lone pair adjacent to the double bond in the same way as with the other
problems in this section by forming a new double bond and pushing the existing double-bond
electrons as a lone pair onto the adjacent carbon. The new structure has a lone pair adjacent to
a double bond (the C=O double bond). Therefore, you can draw another resonance structure in
similar fashion, forming a new C=C double bond and pushing the C=O double-bond electrons
onto the oxygen, leaving the oxygen negatively charged.
k
Nitrogen is an electronegative element, so you can draw a resonance structure in which one of
the triple bonds moves as a lone pair onto nitrogen. This move makes the carbon positively
charged and the nitrogen negatively charged, which is okay because the net charge is still neu-
tral (the net charge has to stay the same in all resonance structures, but the number of charges
doesn’t).
l
The double bond contains an electronegative atom, which is oxygen. Therefore, you can draw
an alternative resonance structure by moving the double bond onto the oxygen as a lone pair.
As a result of this electron redistribution, the positive charge moves onto the carbon in the
alternative resonance structure.
m
In a similar problem to question 12, the electronegative atom in the double bond is oxygen, so
you can draw an alternative resonance structure by moving the electrons in one of the bonds of
the double bond onto the oxygen as a lone pair. The move results in a negative charge on the
oxygen and a positive charge on the sulfur atom in the resonance structure.

n
The nitrogen is the electronegative atom in the double bond, so you can draw a resonance
structure by moving the double-bond electrons onto the nitrogen as a lone pair and leaving the
carbon positively charged.
o
This ring has alternating double bonds all the way around, so you can draw an alternative reso-
nance structure by moving each of the double-bond pi electrons one bond over.
p
This one is a very large ring, but it works in the same fashion as problem 15. You start at one of
the double bonds and push the double-bond electrons onto the adjacent bond to reform the
double bond. You must do this all the way around the ring, because stopping at any point
before then results in a pentavalent carbon.
q
This fused ring system has two additional resonance structures. You can draw the first by
moving the double bonds in the left-most ring one carbon over. You can draw the next by start-
ing from this new structure and doing a similar move on the right-most ring system.
r
The trick to this problem is to pretend that the outside of this fused ring system is one giant
ring that contains alternating double bonds all the way around. Then you push the double
bonds all the way around the ring to determine the alternative resonance structure. There are
also a number of other resonance structures that you can find by moving the double bonds
around the individual six-membered rings.

s
The first pattern to notice is a lone pair adjacent to a double bond. You can move this lone pair
down to form a C=N double bond and push the other double bond as a lone pair onto the join-
ing carbon. This process leads to a resonance structure that has another lone pair adjacent to a
double bond, so you can draw another resonance structure, which leads to two more struc-
tures by a similar process.
t
Here you have two adjacent lone pairs next to the N=O double bond, so there are two addi-
tional resonance structures. It doesn’t matter which one you start with, because starting with
one or the other ultimately leads to the same resonance structures. Keep in mind that these
arrows are simply tools to help locate other resonance structures and don’t have any physical
meaning.
u
This one is a little tricky. The first step is the same: moving the carbon lone pair in the direction
of one of the C=O double bonds. Because there are two adjacent double bonds, two possible
resonance structures exist. You can get from the second resonance structure to the last by
drawing three arrows.
v
You have a lone pair adjacent to a double bond, so you can draw an alternative resonance
structure by moving the lone pair in the direction of the double bond and moving the double-
bond electrons as a lone pair onto the carbon atom. This leads to an alternative resonance
structure with a lone pair adjacent to a triple bond, so you can find a further resonance struc-
ture by pushing the lone pair toward the triple bond and moving one of the bonds in the triple
bonds onto the farthest carbon as a lone pair.

ost people — even those who’ve never taken a class in chemistry — have heard of
acids. But when most people think of an acid, they often attach a negative image —
the corrosive liquid found in car batteries, the stuff that causes your stomach to reflux after
you eat sausage pizza, the vat of goo that disfigured the face of the Joker in Batman, and so
on. But acids are in many other things, too. For example, acids make oranges, grapefruits,
and lemons taste sour; acids make soft drinks last; and acids such as cream of tartar help
cakes rise by reacting with baking soda (a base). Acids are even found in your genome (the
a in DNA stands for acid).
And here’s another little factoid you may find interesting: Nearly all the reactions that you
see in organic chemistry can be classified as acid-base reactions. Therefore, it’s essential that
you understand acid-base chemistry right away, arming you to deal with the reactions of
organic compounds that you see later on in organic chemistry.
In this chapter, you see the two most important classifications of acids and bases that you
deal with in organic chemistry — the Bronsted-Lowry and Lewis definitions of acids and
bases — and how these definitions differ. Additionally, you get the lowdown on how specific
structural elements on a molecule affect its acidity; then you use that knowledge to compare
the acidity of different acids. You work with a quantitative scale of acidity, called the pKa
scale, which you can use to predict the direction of an acid-base reaction at equilibrium.
Defining Acids and Bases
The definitions of an acid and a base have evolved over the centuries, but the two definitions
that organic chemists use widely today come in two flavors: the Bronsted-Lowry and the
Lewis:
 Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases: A Bronsted-Lowry acid (or Bronsted acid for short)
is a molecule or ion that donates a proton, and a Bronsted base is a molecule or ion
that accepts a proton.

 Lewis acids and bases: A Lewis acid is a molecule or ion that accepts a pair of elec-
trons to make a new covalent bond, and a Lewis base is a molecule or ion that donates
a pair of electrons to make a new covalent bond.
This section takes a closer look at these two types and shows you how to solve some basic
problems associated with them.
Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases
Chemists care deeply about the mechanism of a reaction, which is organic-speak for how a
reaction occurs. The complete mechanism of a reaction shows all the bond-making and
bond-breaking steps in a reaction, including the order in which those steps take place. You
depict the mechanism on paper by using arrows to show the movement of the electrons in a
reaction, taking the starting material into the product.
Figure 4-1 shows a schematic of the reaction between a Bronsted-Lowry acid and a 
Bronsted-Lowry base. Here, the Bronsted base (the proton acceptor) pulls the proton off
the Bronsted acid (the proton donor).
Always draw the arrow starting from the electrons and then “push” the arrow to where the
electrons are going. Acid-base reactions are the simplest organic reactions, so the mecha-
nisms of these reactions are simple — a good place to start practicing your arrow-pushing
skills. In the example in Figure 4-1, the lone pair of electrons then becomes the bonding elec-
trons in the base-H bond.
Never draw an arrow originating from an H+ in a mechanism (a common mistake), because an
H+ has no electrons.
Two pieces of organic-speak you should remember for Bronsted acids and bases: The 
deprotonated acid is referred to as the conjugate base, and the protonated base is called the
conjugate acid.

Q.
Label the acid and base in the following reaction. Then show the mechanism (arrow-pushing) of
the deprotonation reaction. Designate the conjugate acid and the conjugate base of this reaction.
A.
The proton donor in this reaction is HCl, so this molecule is the Bronsted acid in this reaction;
the proton acceptor is water, H2O, the Bronsted base. After water accepts the proton, it
becomes the hydronium ion, H3O+, the conjugate acid. After HCl gives up its proton, it becomes
the chloride ion, the conjugate base.
To draw the mechanism, start by moving the lone pair of electrons from the oxygen on water
and pushing it to the proton on H-Cl. This push represents a new bond forming between the
oxygen and the hydrogen. The bond between H-Cl is then broken (shown by another arrow) and
those two bonding electrons are then assigned to the chlorine as a lone pair.

Part I: The Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry 
Lewis acids and bases
The Bronsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases (described in the preceding section) is the
most popular definition of acids and bases in organic chemistry, but that definition isn’t all-
encompassing because it doesn’t consider reactions that don’t involve proton (H+) transfers.
A more all-encompassing definition of acids and bases is the Lewis definition, in which acids
are defined as molecules or ions that accept pairs of electrons in a reaction and bases are
defined as molecules or ions that donate pairs of electrons in a reaction. The result is the for-
mation of a new covalent bond. Figure 4-2 shows a general form of a Lewis acid and base
reaction. (Note: The base is shown negatively charged and the acid is shown positively
charged, but that isn’t always the case).
The Lewis acid and base definitions encompass the Bronsted-Lowry definitions, because any
molecule that pulls off a proton is necessarily donating electrons (a Lewis base) and any mol-
ecule that loses a proton (an H+) is accepting electrons (a Lewis acid). Therefore, Bronsted
acids and bases are also Lewis acids and bases. Chemists simply use the Bronsted-Lowry
definition because it’s easier to think of most acid-base reactions in terms of proton transfers
rather than in terms of electron transfers.

Chapter 4: Working with Acids and Bases
Comparing Acidities of Organic Molecules
Whether an acid-base reaction occurs depends on the strength of the acid. Because acid and
base reactions are so important in organic chemistry, being able to compare two acid struc-
tures so you can say which acid is stronger than another is a really important skill.
The secret to comparing the strength of two acids is this: Strong acids have stable conjugate
bases. Therefore, the more stable the conjugate base of an acid, the stronger the acid,
because an acid is more willing to give up a proton when doing so leads to a stable conjugate
base. Conversely, an acid with an unstable conjugate base is less willing to give up its 
proton because doing so leads to an unstable conjugate base.
The question then becomes this: What features on a molecule stabilize a conjugate base?
Because most acids are neutrally charged and upon deprotonation become negatively
charged in the conjugate base form, any structural features that help to stabilize this nega-
tive charge in the conjugate base leads to a stronger acid.
Contrasting atom electronegativity, 
size, and hybridization
Charges are more stable on some atoms than others. Here are a few rules:
 Negative charges are more stable on more electronegative atoms. Recall that elec-
tronegativity increases as you go up and to the right on the periodic table. Therefore,
any conjugate base that places the negative charge on a more electronegative atom is

64
Part I: The Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry 
more stable than a conjugate base that places the negative charge on a more elec-
tropositive atom.
 Negative charges are more stable on larger atoms. The size of atoms increases as you
go down the periodic table. Negative charges prefer to rest on larger atoms because
larger atoms allow the negative charge to delocalize over a larger space (electron delo-
calization is always a stabilizing feature).
 A negative charge is more stable on a larger atom than on an electronegative atom.
Of course, you sometimes face a dilemma. Would a negative charge prefer to rest on a
more electronegative atom or a larger atom that isn’t as electronegative? In these
cases, atom size trumps electronegativity.
 Negative charges prefer to rest on sp-hybridized atoms over sp2-hybridized atoms,
and they prefer sp2 over sp3 atoms. Negative charges prefer to be placed in orbitals
with more s character because s orbitals are closer to the atom nucleus. This means
that a negative charge prefers to rest on an sp-hybridized atom over an sp2 atom and on
an sp2 atom over an sp3 atom (refer to Chapter 1 to brush up on determining atom
hybridization).
Q.
Which acid is stronger, HF or HI?
A.
HI is the stronger acid. The strength of
an acid depends on the stability of the
conjugate base, so the first thing to do is
to deprotonate these acids and see which
conjugate base is more stable. The conju-
gate base of HF is F–, and the conjugate
base of HI is I–. Fluorine is more elec-
tronegative than iodine, but iodine is a
bigger atom because it’s three rows down
from fluorine on the periodic table. This
presents a dilemma, because although
negative charges prefer to rest on more
electronegative atoms, they also prefer to
rest on bigger atoms. However, atom size
trumps electronegativity, so I– is more
stable than F–, and HI is therefore a
stronger acid than HF.

Part I: The Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry 
The effect of nearby atoms
Electronegativity effects of neighboring atoms can play a role in determining a molecule’s
acidity. A charge becomes more stable the more it can be delocalized over as many atoms as
possible so that no one atom has to carry the full charge. Therefore, nearby electronegative
atoms that pull some of the negative charge away from the negatively charged atom and
delocalize the charge will stabilize it.

The molecule with the CF3 group is more
acidic because fluorine is a very elec-
tronegative atom, so this group pulls
electron density away from the negative-
charged oxygen in the conjugate base,
which helps to delocalize the charge and
stabilize it.

Resonance effects
Acids with conjugate bases that can delocalize the negative charge to other atoms through
resonance are more acidic than molecules lacking conjugate base resonance structures (for a
refresher on resonance structures, see Chapter 3). Resonance structures stabilize charges
because they allow a charge to delocalize over two or more atoms and don’t require just a
single atom to bear the full charge. As a general rule, the more resonance structures a mole-
cule has, the more stable the structure.

First, draw the conjugate base of both
acids and see which one is more stable.
The left-most conjugate base in this case
is less stable because this structure has
no resonance structures, so the negative
charge is localized on a single oxygen. In
the right-hand structure, on the other
hand, the charge can delocalize through
resonance over two oxygens, stabilizing
the conjugate base. Therefore, the right-
hand acid is the more acidic because it
has the more stable conjugate base. You
may find it helpful when finding alterna-
tive resonance structures to draw out

Chapter 4: Working with Acids and Bases
Predicting Acid-Base Equilibria 
Using pKa Values
Other problems in this chapter show the ways that different structural elements affect the
acidity of a molecule, but a quantitative scale of the acidity of a molecule is given by the 
molecule’s pKa value. The pKa value is a logarithmic measure of acidity based on the acid’s
equilibrium constant for dissociation in water. The bottom line is that the more acidic a 
molecule is, the lower its pKa value. In general, a reaction equilibrium favors the side 
with the lower-energy molecules, and because strong acids and bases are high in energy,
acid-base reactions favor the side with the weaker acids and bases.
For any acid-base reaction, if you know the pKa of the acid and the pKa of the conjugate acid,
you can determine the direction of the equilibrium. The equilibrium lies in the direction of
the side that has the weaker acid (that is, the acid with the higher pKa value).
I provide the pKa values in the following questions where needed, but keep in mind that if
you’re a student, your professor may require you to memorize a chart of these pKa values.
You can find tables of pKa values in Organic Chemistry I For Dummies (Wiley) by yours truly
or in most any introductory organic chemistry text.

Chapter 4: Working with Acids and Bases
Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
Methanol (CH3OH) picks up the proton in this reaction, so this molecule is the Bronsted base;
HI gives up its proton, so this molecule is the acid. Show the mechanism of this reaction by
drawing an arrow from a lone pair on the oxygen and pushing it to the hydrogen on HI. The
meaning of this arrow is that a new bond is forming between the oxygen and the hydrogen
using the oxygen’s lone-pair electrons. Then draw a second arrow from the H-I bond to the
iodine to show the breaking of this bond and the reassignment of these electrons as a lone 
pair on iodine.
b
This reaction is slightly different because a double bond rather than a lone pair is protonated.
However, the reaction works in the same way. Draw an arrow from the double bond to a hydro-
gen on the hydronium ion (H3O+). Then use a second arrow to show the hydronium ion O-H
bond being broken, with the bonding electrons placed onto the oxygen as a new lone pair.
c
AlCl3 is a powerful Lewis acid because aluminum doesn’t have a complete octet of valence elec-
trons. Therefore, a molecule with lone pairs of electrons (a Lewis base) readily adds to the alu-
minum. Draw an arrow from an oxygen lone pair and push the arrow to the aluminum to show
the formation of an O-Al bond. Don’t forget to compute the charges when you’re done.

In this reaction, hydride (H–) acts as the Lewis base and attacks the proton (H+), the Lewis acid.
Although you never draw an arrow starting from H+ (because this atom has no electrons, and
arrows always start from electrons), drawing an arrow that starts from H– is okay because this
atom does have a pair of electrons.
e HCl is stronger than HF. The conjugate base of HCl is Cl–, and the conjugate base of HF is F–.
Although fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, it’s also a smaller atom than chlorine
because chlorine is a row down from fluorine on the periodic table. Size trumps electronegativ-
ity, so Cl– is more stable than F–, and consequently, HCl is a stronger acid than HF.
f
NH3 is a stronger acid than CH4. The conjugate base of CH4 is CH3
–, and the conjugate base of
NH3 is NH2
–. Nitrogen and carbon are roughly the same size because both atoms are in the same
row of the periodic table, but nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon, so NH2
– is more
stable than CH3
–. Consequently, NH3 is a stronger acid than CH4.
g
H2S is more acidic than H2O. The conjugate base of H2S is SH–, and the conjugate base of H2O is
OH–. Oxygen is a more electronegative atom than sulfur, but sulfur is larger because it’s a row
below oxygen on the periodic table; therefore, SH– is more stable than OH–, and H2S is more
acidic than H2O.
h
CH3OH is a stronger acid than (CH3)2NH. The conjugate base of CH3OH is CH3O–, and the conju-
gate base of (CH3)2NH is (CH3)2N–. Oxygen and nitrogen are essentially the same size because
these atoms are in the same row on the periodic table, but oxygen is more electronegative than
nitrogen. Thus, CH3O– is more stable than (CH3)2N–, and CH3OH is a stronger acid than (CH3)2NH.
i
The left-hand structure is more acidic.
Negative charges (also called anions using organic-speak) are more stable on sp-hybridized
atoms than on sp2 hybridized atoms because sp orbitals have more s character (50 percent s
character) than sp2 orbitals (33 percent s character); therefore, the sp orbital places the lone
pair closer to the nucleus.

Part I: The Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry 

Anions are more stable on sp2 hybridized atoms than on sp3 hybridized atoms because sp2
hybrid orbitals have more s character (33 percent s character) than sp3 hybrid orbitals 
(25 percent s character).
k
Chlorine is more electronegative than bromine, so the conjugate base on the molecule contain-
ing the chlorine is more stable because more of the negative charge can be pulled away and
delocalized than that of the conjugate base with the bromine. Electronegativity increases as
you go up and to the right on the periodic table.
l
The difference between these two molecules is that the chlorine is closer to the negative
charge in the conjugate base of the right structure than on the left. The influence of electroneg-
ative atoms diminishes the farther they’re away from the acidic proton. Thus, the right-hand
molecule with the closer chlorine is more acidic than the left-hand molecule.
m
Oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, so oxygen is able to pull more of the electrons from
the conjugate base to stabilize it. Keep in mind that the size of the neighboring atoms is unim-
portant in terms of affecting the acidity: Size of the atom matters only when the charge is on
that particular atom. Therefore, the fact that sulfur is larger than oxygen isn’t relevant here —
only the fact that oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur.

Chapter 4: Working with Acids and Bases

Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen and is able to pull more of the negative charge
away from the conjugate base anion (negative charge) than nitrogen. Therefore, the left struc-
ture is more acidic than the right one.
o
In the conjugate base of the left-hand structure, the electrons are able to delocalize the negative
charge through resonance, which stabilizes the anion. In the conjugate base of the right-hand
structure, the charge is localized on a single atom. Therefore, the left structure is more acidic
than the right.
p
Both conjugate bases in this case are stabilized by resonance. However, the base of the left
structure has only two resonance structures, whereas the base of the right-hand structure has
four resonance structures. Typically, the more resonance structures a molecule or ion has, the
more stable it is. Therefore, the right structure is more acidic than the left.

In this case, resonance stabilizes both conjugate bases. However, the left structure has only

hink of your hands. Both have fingers connected in the same way, but your right and left
hands aren’t identical. They’re mirror images of each other, and you can’t superimpose one
hand upon the other. In a similar way, two molecules can have the same connections of atoms
but differ from each other by the orientation of those atoms in three-dimensional space. Such
molecules are said to have different stereochemistry, or differing spatial arrangements of atoms.
The study of stereochemistry is important for understanding the molecular basis of biology.
Stereochemistry has far-reaching consequences because nature often treats two molecules
with different stereochemistry quite differently. For example, a molecule with one stereo-
chemistry may smell like mint, while the same molecule with a different stereochemistry
smells like cinnamon; the first molecule may treat a disease, while the other is poisonous.
So how does stereochemistry manifest itself in molecules? Every carbon that has four differ-
ent attachments to it (called a chiral center) can have two different configurations, much like
a hand has two possible configurations, right or left. But organic chemists have a thing for
Latin, so they use the labels R and S, which stand for rectus (right) and sinister (left). The goal
of this chapter is to familiarize you with working with molecules of differing stereochemistry.
Part of that involves being able to assign whether a chiral center is of R or S configuration
and also to distinguish the relationships between molecules with different stereochemistry,
called stereoisomers. Also on the menu is working with a handy tool called a Fischer projec-
tion, which aids in quickly comparing the stereochemistry of molecules.
Identifying Chiral Centers and 
Assigning Substituent Priorities
Because stereochemistry can be conceptually challenging, I take a gradual approach in this
chapter to assigning the configuration of chiral centers as R or S. The basic procedure for
assigning the configuration of a chiral center is as follows:

1. Locate a chiral center.
A chiral center is a carbon atom with four different attached atoms or groups.
Often, spotting chiral centers by the process of elimination is easy: You just ignore
atoms that can’t be chiral centers. For example, all methyl groups (CH3 groups), meth-
ylene groups (CH2 groups), or carbons involved in a double or triple bond can’t be
chiral centers because these atoms can’t have four different groups attached to them.
2. Assign the priorities of each of the four groups attached to the chiral center using
the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.
Prioritize the groups from 1 to 4 based on the atomic number of the first atom attached
to the chiral center. The highest priority (1) goes to the group whose first atom has the
highest atomic number; the lowest priority (4) goes to the group whose first atom has
the lowest atomic number (usually hydrogen).
In the event of a tie — that is, two groups attach with the same atom type — continue
down the chain of both groups until the tie is broken. The tie can break in two ways:
• You reach a higher-priority atom on one of the chains, giving that group the
higher priority. Thus, a carbon attached to an oxygen has priority over a carbon
attached to another carbon because oxygen has a higher atomic number than
carbon.
• You find that a larger number of identical atoms are attached to one group
over another. Thus, a carbon attached to two other carbons has a higher priority
than a carbon attached to just one other carbon.
However, atom type trumps the number of groups, so a carbon attached to an oxygen
has higher priority than a carbon attached to two or three other carbons. Figure 5-1
shows some examples.
Double and triple bonds are treated somewhat strangely because they’re expanded
into an equivalent number of single bonds for each multiple bond. For example, you
treat a carbon-nitrogen triple bond as though the carbon were single-bonded to three
nitrogens, with each of the nitrogens in turn bonded to a carbon. You treat a carbon
double-bonded to nitrogen as though the carbon were two single bonds to nitrogen,
each of which would be bonded back to the carbon. The effect is that for identical
atom types, triple bonds have higher priority than double bonds, and double bonds
have higher priority than single bonds. Figure 5-2 shows an example.
3. Use a procedure for assigning the R or S designation to that chiral center using the
group priorities you assigned in the second step.
See the next section for more specifics.

lines indicate bonds in the plane of the paper. The easiest way to visualize a chiral center is
to draw two bonds in the plane of the paper (normal lines), one bond coming out of the

Compare the first atom of each of the four
groups attached to the chiral carbon; the
highest-priority substituent (designated
1) is the group whose first atom has the
highest atomic number. Here, chlorine has
the highest atomic number, so this sub-
stituent has the highest priority. Oxygen
has the next-highest atomic number, so
the OH group becomes the second-
priority substituent. The remaining two
substituents are attached with a carbon
atom, resulting in a tie.
To break the tie, go to the next atom 
in each chain and compare the atomic
numbers. In this case, the top sub-
stituent is next attached to a carbon, 
and the bottom substituent is attached
to an oxygen. The substituent attached
to the oxygen has the higher priority
because oxygen has a higher atomic
number than carbon.

Chapter 5: Seeing Molecules in 3-D: Stereochemistry
Assigning R & S Configurations 
to Chiral Centers
After you spot a chiral center in a molecule and assign priority of each substituent from 1 to
4 (see the preceding section), you can determine the configuration of that chiral center as R
or S in two steps:
1. Rotate the molecule so the fourth-priority substituent is in the back (on a dashed
bond sticking back into the paper).
If you have difficulty rotating the molecule in 3-D, use a molecular modeling kit (those
plastic balls and sticks that represent atoms and bonds) until you get the feel of doing
this kind of transformation.
2. Draw a curve from the first- to second- to third-priority substituent.
If the curve is clockwise, the configuration is designated R; if the curve is counter-
clockwise, the configuration is S. Tip: Remember this step in terms of driving and pic-
ture the curve as a steering wheel: If you steer clockwise, the car goes right (R); turn
the wheel counterclockwise, and the car goes left (S, which stands for sinister, or left,
in Latin).
If you have difficulty visualizing in 3-D — or want to save some time on an exam — I have a
trick you can use: Swapping any two groups inverts the stereochemistry (it makes the chiral
center go from R to S or S to R). Therefore, if you swap two groups to put the fourth-priority
substituent in the back, you can then continue in assigning the stereochemistry — so long as
you remember that you’ll get the opposite stereochemistry of the one you’re trying to 
determine!
Q.
Assign the chiral center in the following
molecule as R or S.
A.
The chiral center is S. Bromine has the
highest priority because this atom has
the highest atomic number; chlorine is
second, fluorine is third, and hydrogen
(as always) is last, in order of descending
atomic number.

the hydrogen (four) is already in the
back (it points back into the paper with a
dashed bond). Draw an arrow connecting
the first- to second- to third-priority 
substituents.
The curve is counterclockwise, so the

the OH is second because oxygen has a
higher atomic number than carbon.
Finally, the CH2CH3 group has higher pri-
ority than CH3 because in the former
group, the first carbon is attached to an
additional carbon, breaking the tie.

Working with Fischer Projections
Fischer projections are a handy drawing method for representing 3-D chiral centers in a 2-D
drawing. They’re particularly convenient for comparing the relationships between molecules
with more than one chiral center. Fischer projections frequently represent stereochemistry,
so become familiar with these projections.
By convention, a cross on a Fischer projection represents a chiral center, but don’t confuse a
Fischer projection with a Lewis structure. Even though Fischer projections look flat, by con-
vention, you assume that the horizontal bars indicate bonds coming out of the plane of the
paper (like wedged bonds) and the vertical bars indicate bonds going back into the paper
(like dashed bonds).
Figure 5-4 shows how to convert a 3-D projection (wedge and dash structure) into a Fischer
projection. You rotate a quarter turn around one of the bonds so that two of the bonds on
the chiral center are coming out of the plane of the paper and two bonds are going back into
the paper. The bonds coming out of the plane become the horizontal bars in the Fischer pro-
jection, and the bonds going back into the plane become the vertical bars.
Many people have trouble converting 3-D projections into Fischer projections because the
quarter turn is difficult to visualize, particularly in molecules with more than one chiral
center. Molecular models can help, but one trick so you don’t have to visualize the quarter
turn is to assign the configuration of the chiral center (R or S) in the 3-D projection and then
draw the Fischer projection so that it has the same configuration. However, trying a few
problems using the quarter-turn method can help give you a better understanding of what
the Fischer projection means. You can always assign the configurations to double-check your
work, ensuring you didn’t make mistakes during the conversion.
Here’s how to determine the R or S stereochemistry of a chiral center on a Fischer projection:
1. Assign the priorities to each of the substituents using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.
See “Identifying Chiral Centers and Assigning Substituent Priorities,” earlier in this
chapter, for the rules.
2. Draw the curve from the first- to second- to third-priority substituents.
If the fourth-priority substituent is on a vertical line (either at 12 o’clock or 6 o’clock), a
clockwise curve indicates an R configuration and a counterclockwise curve indicates
an S configuration.
However, if the fourth-priority substituent is on a horizontal bar (at 3 o’clock or
9 o’clock), just the opposite is true: A clockwise curve indicates an S configuration,
and a counterclockwise curve indicates an R configuration.

Chapter 5: Seeing Molecules in 3-D: Stereochemistry
Comparing Relationships between 
Stereoisomers and Meso Compounds
Stereoisomers are molecules that have the same atom connectivity but differ in the configura-
tion of their chiral centers. Just as the relationship of a right hand to a left hand is that of
mirror images, a molecule with a chiral center of R configuration is the mirror image of the
same molecule with the S configuration. Chemists call molecules that are mirror images of
each other enantiomers, so in orgo-speak, your right hand is the enantiomer of your left.
The problem with this analogy is that molecules can have more than one chiral center. Now
imagine an arm with two left hands attached (weird, I know). The mirror image of this arm
(its enantiomer) is an arm with two right hands attached. Similarly, the enantiomer of a mole-
cule with two R chiral centers is a molecule with two S chiral centers. The bottom line is that
the enantiomer of a molecule is a molecule with all the configurations switched (all R config-
urations go to S, and all S configurations go to R).
When you have more than one chiral center on a molecule, getting stereoisomers that aren’t
mirror images is possible. If you were to have an arm with two right hands and another arm
with one right hand and one left hand, the two arms would have a different relationship than
that of mirror images. Stereoisomers that aren’t mirror images of each other are in a diastere-
omeric relationship. One example of a pair of diastereomers is one molecule that has two R
chiral centers and a molecule with one R and one S chiral center. In other words, a diastere-
omer is a stereoisomer that doesn’t have each and every chiral center switched and is not a
mirror image.
With one exception, any molecule that has a chiral center is a chiral molecule. A chiral mole-
cule is a molecule that has a non-superimposable mirror image. What that means is that you
can’t superimpose the mirror image of the molecule onto the original molecule. A molecule
with an R chiral center isn’t superimposable on its mirror image, the enantiomer with an S
chiral center — the atoms simply don’t align, much like the fingers of your right hand don’t
align with the fingers on your left hand.
Molecules that have chiral centers are chiral molecules — with one exception. Meso com-
pounds are molecules that have chiral centers but are achiral (not chiral) as a result of having
a plane of symmetry in the molecule. A plane of symmetry is an imaginary line that you can
draw in a molecule for which both halves are mirror images of each other. Unlike chiral mole-
cules, meso compounds have mirror images that are superimposable on the original mole-
cule (that is, the mirror images are identical to the original molecule). Thus, being able to
spot planes of symmetry in molecules that have chiral centers is important for determining
whether the molecule is chiral or achiral.
Watch for rotations around single bonds. Anytime you can rotate around a single bond to
give a structure that has a plane of symmetry — in other words, when any conformation has
a plane of symmetry — the molecule is meso and achiral.

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The two starred carbons are chiral centers because they have four different substituents
attached. The carbon to the far right of the structure isn’t chiral because it has two identical
methyl group attachments.
b
This molecule has three chiral centers, each of which has four different substituents (remem-
ber to include any hydrogens not shown). Perhaps the most difficult carbon to assign is the
ring carbon attached to the chain. This carbon isn’t a chiral center because going one way
around the ring is identical to going the other way around the ring, so these substituents are
considered identical.
c
This molecule has two chiral centers. The ring carbon with the chain attached is a chiral center
because the top side of the ring is different from the bottom side of the ring. Unlike in problem
2, these two sides of the ring are considered different substituents.

Chapter 5: Seeing Molecules in 3-D: Stereochemistry
Starting with the right chiral center, prioritizing the substituents is reasonably straightforward.
The oxygen gets the highest priority because this atom has the highest atomic number. The
hydrogen gets the lowest priority because it has the lowest atomic number. Finally, the methyl
group and the complex substituent to the left both have first-atom carbons, but the methyl gets
a lower priority than the complex substituent because the complex substituent is attached to
an oxygen, breaking the tie.
For the ring-carbon chiral center, the oxygen substituent has the highest priority and the
hydrogen, the lowest, because these atoms have the highest and lowest atomic numbers,
respectively. Both of the adjacent atoms in the ring are carbons. The top carbon in the ring is
attached to three carbons and the bottom carbon in the ring is attached to just one other
carbon, so the top ring carbon has the higher priority (note that the number of attached atoms
matters only in the event of a tie).
d
The atom has only one chiral center: the carbon bridging the double bond and the triple bond
(no double-bond or triple-bond carbon can be chiral). Hydrogen has the lowest priority as
usual. Under the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog prioritizing scheme, carbon-carbon double bonds are
treated as though they represent two single bonds from the first carbon to the second carbon;
therefore, one of the second carbons has two single bonds to the first atom. Triple bonds repre-
sent three single bonds from the first carbon to the second carbon, so one of the second car-
bons then has three single bonds back to the first atom. The basic idea to remember is that
double bonds have higher priority over single bonds between the same atoms, and triple bonds
have priority over double bonds between the same atoms. Thus, the carbon-carbon triple bond
has priority over the carbon-carbon double bond, and the carbon-carbon double bond has pri-
ority over the carbon-carbon single bond.

The chiral center is R. First, determine the substituent priorities. The OH is first because
oxygen has the highest atomic number, and hydrogen is last. The CH2OH group has higher pri-
ority than CH3 because the carbon is attached to oxygen, breaking the tie (as in a). Because the
fourth-priority substituent is already in the back, you can draw the curve from the first- to
second- to third-priority substituent. The curve is clockwise, so the chiral center is designated
R (as in b).

Draw the curve from the first-priority substituent to the second to the third. This curve is coun-
terclockwise, so the configuration is S.
h
The molecule has two chiral centers, so take them one at a time. Starting with the left chiral
center, prioritize the substituents. Because the fourth-priority substituent is in the back, you
can draw the curve to obtain the configuration. In this case, the curve is clockwise, so the left
chiral center is R (see a). Now do the right chiral center. You can draw the curve after assigning
the substituent priorities because the fourth-priority substituent is already in the back. The

is attached to chlorine, which breaks the tie. The fourth-priority substituent is in the back, so
drawing the clockwise curve yields an R configuration.

Determine the configuration of the right chiral center in the same manner. The chlorine gets the
highest priority and the hydrogen, the fourth; the left-hand side of the ring gets higher priority
over the right-hand side of the ring because the first carbon on the left side of the ring is
attached to an OH, which breaks the tie. Drawing the counterclockwise curve yields an S config-
uration.
j
The first trick with this problem is to notice that the left-hand carbon that’s drawn in a 3-D pro-
jection isn’t a chiral center because this carbon has two identical CH3 groups. You can’t assume
that an atom drawn in a 3-D projection is necessarily a chiral center. The right-hand carbon
drawn in a 3-D projection is a chiral center, however. Prioritizing the substituents and drawing
the counterclockwise curve shows that this chiral center is S.
k
The configuration is R. First, prioritize the substituents (as in a). Then draw the curve from
first- to second- to third-priority substituents (as in b). Because the fourth-priority substituent

The configuration is S. Begin by prioritizing the substituents (as in a). Now draw the curve
from first to second to third (as in b). Because the fourth-priority substituent is on a horizontal
bar, the configuration is exactly the opposite of what you may expect. The curve is clockwise,
so the configuration is S.

To convert the 3-D projection to the Fischer structure, perform the quarter turn so that two
substituents come out of the plane on the horizontal axis and two substituents go back into the
plane on the vertical axis.
Double-check your work by making sure the configuration didn’t change. First, find the configu-
ration of the chiral center in the 3-D projection by assigning priorities to the substituents. The
fourth-priority substituent is in the back, so draw the curve from the first- to second- to third-
priority substituents; the curve is counterclockwise, so the configuration is S. Next, assign the
configuration to the Fischer projection. Because the fourth-priority substituent is on a horizon-
tal bar and the curve from the first- to second- to third-priority substituents is clockwise, the
configuration is S.
Note that you may have a Fischer projection that looks different from the one shown here. As
long as the configuration is correct (S), placing substituents in alternative locations is perfectly
fine.

Here you have two chiral centers. By convention, chiral centers in Fischer projections are
aligned vertically, so you first rotate the molecule so that the bond connecting the two chiral
centers is vertical. Then perform two quarter turns to get the molecule into the right orienta-
tion for the Fischer projection.
Even for people with excellent visualization skills, this is a difficult process. Molecules with
more than one chiral center are often easier to convert to the Fischer projection by bypassing
the quarter turn and 3-D visualization business: Assign the R or S configurations to the chiral
centers in the 3-D projection and then add the substituents to a Fischer projection to make sure
that the configurations remain unchanged.
First, assign the R or S configuration for each chiral center. Both chiral centers are R. Next,
make sure both chiral centers have R stereochemistry in the Fischer projection. After drawing
the Fischer projection with two crosses, one for each chiral center, add the substituents so that
each chiral center is R. (To keep the structure consistent with the quarter-turn method, I’ve
placed the methyl group on the top, but you don’t have to.) With the methyl on the top, the
hydrogen has to go to the right (at 3 o’clock) and the bromine needs go to the left (at 9 o’clock).
With these placements, the curve from first- to second- to third-priority substituents is counter-
clockwise, which indicates the chiral center is R because the fourth-priority substituent is on a
horizontal bar.
Next, add substituents to the second chiral center on the Fischer projection. For consistency,
I’ve placed the methyl (CH3) on the bottom at 6 o’clock. For an R configuration, the bromine
needs to go to the right at 3 o’clock and the hydrogen has to go to the left at 9 o’clock. With this
placement, the priority curve is counterclockwise, indicating an R stereochemistry because the
fourth-priority substituent is on a horizontal bar. Thus, both methods yield the same solution.
You can use whichever one works best for you.
You may have a Fischer projection that looks different from the one shown here, but as long as
the two chiral center configurations are correct (both R), placing substituents in alternative
locations is perfectly fine.

Enantiomers. These Fischer projections are mirror images of each other (you can draw a
mirror plane between the two Fischer projections). Moreover, switching the position of any two
substituents in a Fischer projection inverts the stereochemistry (takes it from R to S or S to R).
p
The two structures are identical. The two molecules look different, but don’t be fooled by this.
Assigning the stereochemistry to both structures shows that the chiral center is R in both
cases. Therefore, the two molecules have to be identical but merely drawn in a different way.
q
The two molecules are diastereomers. Two chiral centers are in the molecule, but only the top
one switches upon going from the left-hand structure to the right-hand structure. Therefore, the
two molecules aren’t mirror images of each other. Both chiral centers need to be switched to
make the molecules enantiomers (mirror images). Thus, these molecules are diastereomers.
r
The molecule is meso and achiral. Even though two chiral centers exist, a plane of symmetry
bisects the ring so that the top half is a reflection of the bottom half.
s
This molecule is chiral. This molecule has two chiral centers, but it doesn’t have a plane of
symmetry that bisects the molecule. Therefore, the molecule is chiral.
t
The molecule is meso and achiral. This problem is very tricky. Although the molecule as ini-
tially drawn has no plane of symmetry, you can rotate around the central bond to give a struc-
ture that does have a plane of symmetry, making the molecule meso and achiral.

ver wondered what octane is, the fuel you put in your car, or methane, the fuel in natu-
ral gas used to heat many homes? Those are the names of the organic molecules in
those products. And for chemists, knowing what to call different molecules is an important
part of keeping everyone on the same page. It’s important enough, in fact, that the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) formed a committee to create a
systematic set of rules for naming organic molecules so that every organic molecule would
have the same name all over the world.
In order for you to get in on the conversation, though, you need to know how to name
organic molecules yourself. The best place to start honing your skills is with the simplest 
of organic molecules, the alkanes. Alkanes, the bones of organic molecules, are organic 
compounds containing only carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen single bonds.
This chapter gives you practice with the naming, or nomenclature, of alkanes, and it lays the
foundation for the nomenclature of all organic molecules. In addition to giving proper names
to molecules, you see how to draw a structure from a given name. Such naming can appear
difficult at first, given that organic structures often have long, complex names — and frankly,
somewhat difficult-to-pronounce names — but with a bit of practice, this process is actually
quite straightforward (and kind of fun, too).
Understanding How to Name Alkanes
When you name straight-chain alkanes, use the four following steps:
1. Find the parent chain.
Identify the parent chain, which is the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms. 
Table 6-1 shows the parent names for compounds, based on the number of carbons in
the parent chain.

2. Number the parent chain.
Number the parent chain starting from the side that reaches the first substituent
sooner. (A substituent is an atom or group that attaches to the parent chain.)
3. Name each of the substituents.
You can name straight-chain substituents using Table 6-1, but you should also know the
names of the three common complex substituents shown in Figure 6-1. The dashed line
indicates where that substituent joins the parent chain.
4. Order the substituents alphabetically, using a number to indicate the position of
each substituent on the parent chain.
Additionally, when you have two substituents of the same kind — for example, two
methyl substituents on a molecule — they’re combined in the name as dimethyl to save
space. For example, instead of writing 2-methyl-3-methylbutane, you’d write 2,3-
dimethylbutane. The di- indicates two substituents of the same kind; for three like sub-
stituents, you use the prefix tri-; for four, tetra-; for five, penta-; and so on.

Chapter 6: The Skeletons of Organic Molecules: The Alkanes
Remember the following quirks concerning alphabetization and prefixes:
• Ignore tert- (t) and sec- (s). Tert-butyl (or t-butyl) and sec-butyl (or s-butyl) go
under the letter b.
• Ignore prefixes that specify the number of identical substituents, such as di-,
tri-, or tetra-. For example, dimethyl falls under m.
• Cyclo- or iso- prefixes are alphabetized under c and i, respectively. Cyclopropyl
goes under c, and isopropyl goes under i.
Don’t put a space between the final substituent name and the parent name.
Cycloalkanes, or alkanes in rings, are named in a similar way. The principal difference comes
in selecting the parent chain. For a cycloalkane, the parent chain is either the ring or a 
substituent attached to the ring. To determine which of the two is the parent chain, you
count the number of carbons in the ring and then count the longest continuous chain of car-
bons in the substituent. Whichever has more carbons is labeled the parent chain, and the
other is considered a substituent. Here’s how you indicate the ring:
 To indicate a ring in a name, add the prefix cyclo-. A three-carbon ring, for example, is
called cyclopropane.
 When naming rings as substituents, add the suffix -yl. A three-membered ring as a sub-
stituent would be called a cyclopropyl substituent.
Q.
Name the following alkane:
A.
4-ethyl-2-methylheptane. The parent
chain is the longer chain that goes from
left to right that consists of seven car-
bons. Because the parent chain consists
of seven carbons, the parent name is 
heptane (see Table 6-1). After you find
the parent chain, you can number the
parent chain in two possible ways. By
convention, you start numbering from
the end that reaches the first substituent
sooner. In this case, numbering from left
to right reaches the first substituent (the
one-carbon substituent) at the second
carbon, whereas numbering from right to
left reaches the first substituent at the
fourth carbon. Thus, the correct number-
ing in this case is from left to right.
1
2 3
4
5 6
7
Now name the substituents. You name
hydrocarbon substituents by taking the
parent name and replacing the suffix -ane
with -yl. Therefore, this one-carbon sub-
stituent is called a methyl substituent
(not a methane substituent), and the
two-carbon substituent is called an ethyl
substituent.
Finally, alphabetize the substituents in
front of the parent name (heptane), with a
number indicating the position. Because 
ethyl comes before methyl alphabetically,
the name is 4-ethyl-2-methylheptane. Use
dashes to separate the numbers from the
substituents, and don’t put a space
between the final substituent name
(methyl) and the parent name (heptane).

Q.
Name the following alkane.
A.
1-butylcyclopentane. The first step is to
find the parent chain. Because there’s
both a ring and a straight chain portion,
you count the number of carbons in
each. The ring has five carbons, and the
chain portion has four; thus, the parent
chain is the ring because it has more car-
bons. Because the ring has five carbons,
the parent name is cyclopentane.
Number the ring so as to give the lowest
number to the substituents. In this case,
you number so that the first carbon is
the carbon with the substituent.
Then name the substituent. A four-carbon
chain as a substituent is a butyl sub-
stituent. Lastly, place the substituent in
front of the parent name with the number
1 indicating the position of the sub-
stituent to give you 1-butylcyclopentane.

Drawing a Structure from a Name
Many times, you’re given a name and expected to know the identity of the structure. This
section gives you practice with converting a complex name to its structure.
To convert a name into a structure, read the name in reverse, starting from the right (the
parent name) and working to the left:
1. Draw the parent chain.
2. Number the parent chain.
3. Add the substituents to the appropriate carbons.
Q.
Draw the structure of 4-isopropyl-3,
4-dimethyloctane.
A.
Start with the parent name, octane.
Octane indicates a chain of eight car-
bons, which then needs to be numbered.
So you draw this structure first:
Next, add the two methyl groups to the 3
and 4 carbons, respectively (a methyl is a
one-carbon substituent).

Finally, add the isopropyl group to the

common name for a three-carbon sub-
stituent attached at the second carbon.
This complex substituent, which looks
sort of like a snake’s tongue, is one of 
the common substituents shown in
Figure 6-1 that you should memorize.

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
2,3-dimethylhexane. The longest chain is the six-carbon chain that goes from right to left.
Because the parent chain is six carbons long, the parent name for this alkane is hexane. Next,
number the carbons from the side that reaches the first substituent sooner. In this case, you
number from right to left so you reach the first substituent at the number 2 carbon (rather than
the number 4, if you were to number left to right) (see a). Next, name each of the substituents
(as in b). All four substituents are one-carbon groups, which are methyl groups.
a)
b)
Finally, order the substituents in front of the parent name. Wherever you have two or more
identical substituents, cluster them together and give them a prefix to show how many you
have. Here, there are two methyl groups, so add the prefix di- to methyl, with two numbers 
(separated by commas) to give the location of each methyl on the parent chain. Thus, the
proper name is 2,3-dimethylhexane rather than 2-methyl-3-methylhexane.
b
4-isopropyl-3-methylheptane. As is often the case, the trickiest part of this problem is simply
finding the longest consecutive chain of carbon atoms. In this molecule, the longest chain is
seven carbons long, giving you a parent name of heptane. Next, number the parent chain, which
looks like figure a. Next, name the substituents (like in b). The three-carbon substituent that
looks like a snake’s tongue is an isopropyl substituent (see Figure 6-1), and the one-carbon sub-
stituent is a methyl substituent.

Then alphabetize these substituents in front of the parent name, with a number to indicate the
position of each substituent on the chain. That gives you 4-isopropyl-3-methylheptane.
c
4-methyl-5-propyldecane. The longest chain of carbons is the chain that follows from left to
right and is ten carbons long. The parent name of a ten-carbon chain is decane. Next, number
the parent chain from left to right so you give the lower number to the first substituent (see a).
Then name the substituents (see b). The one-carbon substituent at carbon 4 is a methyl sub-
stituent, and the three-carbon substituent at carbon 5 is a propyl substituent.
a)
b)
Lastly, order the substituents alphabetically in front of the parent name, using a number to indi-
cate the position of each substituent. Doing so gives you the name 4-methyl-5-propyldecane.
d
1-t-butylcyclohexane (or tert-butylcyclohexane). Here you have two options for the parent
chain: One is the ring, and the other is the straight carbon chain. The parent chain is the one
that has the most carbons. In this case, the ring has six carbons, and the longest consecutive
chain outside the ring is three carbons, so the ring is the parent chain. Number the ring to give
the substituent the lowest number (number 1). Note: You can’t number so the parent chain
includes both the ring and the chain — the parent chain is either one or the other. Because the
parent chain is a six-membered ring (see a), the parent name is cyclohexane. Finally, name
the substituent (see b). In this case, the substituent is a tertiary butyl (t-butyl) group — one
of the common substituents from Figure 6-1 (it looks like a trident or a chicken’s foot). Thus,
the name is 1-t-butylcyclohexane (t-butylcycohexane, without the number, is also acceptable
because it’s assumed that if only one substituent is present, the substituent is at the number 1
carbon).

e
2-cyclobutyl-3-methylpentane. In this molecule, you have two possibilities — the ring or the
chain of carbons — for the parent chain. The ring has four carbons, and the longest chain has
five carbons. Because you choose the parent chain with the most carbons, the parent chain is
the straight chain of five carbons, so the parent name is pentane. Next, number the chain so
you reach the first substituent sooner, which you accomplish by numbering from left to right.
Next, name each of the substituents. A one-carbon substituent is a methyl substituent, and a
four-membered ring as a substituent is called a cyclobutyl group (don’t forget the cyclo- to 
indicate that this substituent is a ring).
Finally, place the substituents alphabetically in front of the parent name to give you 
2-cyclobutyl-3-methylpentane.
f
3,6-dimethyl-5-propylnonane. The longest chain of carbons is nine carbons long. Numbering
the chain so the first substituent gets the lowest possible number gives you the following:
Then name the substituents. The two one-carbon substituents at carbons 3 and 6 are methyl
substituents, and the three-carbon substituent at carbon 5 is a propyl substituent.

First, read the name from right to left, starting with the parent name, hexane. Hexane is a six-

T
he structure of a molecule on paper is a little misleading, kind of like a photograph of a
child who’s just gorged on candy — the picture makes the child look still and well-
behaved, but in real life, the kid’s jazzed up and going bananas, tearing things up and buffet-
ing around the house like a whirling dervish. Molecules are very much the same because
the little things appear motionless in drawn Lewis structures, but in reality, the atoms are
constantly moving and kicking about. This movement results because atoms are often
attached to each other with single bonds, and single bonds let atoms rotate freely — like
wheels spinning around a car axle. This ability to rotate allows a molecule to fold into a
number of different shapes, called conformations.
In this chapter, you see how chemists represent these three-dimensional folded shapes on a
two-dimensional piece of paper, and you find out how to predict the relative energies of these
different conformations.
Setting Your Sights on Newman Projections
One of the best ways to view the different conformations of molecules is through a Newman
projection. In a Newman projection, you focus in on the conformation around a particular 
C-C bond by sighting down the bond to see the arrangement of the atoms on the carbons 
relative to each other. Sighting down the bond is similar to sighting down the barrel of a rifle
(where the barrel is the C-C bond).
Before getting to Newman projections, though, here’s the key for decoding depictions of
bonds in three-dimensional space:
 Solid wedge: A bond coming out of the plane of the paper
 Dashed line: A bond that’s going back into the paper
 Normal line: A bond that’s in the plane of the paper

Figure 7-1 shows a Newman projection for the molecule ethane (CH3CH3).
The Newman projection attempts to recreate the view of atom orientations that you’d see if
you were to sight down the bond as the eye is doing in Figure 7-1. Here are some conventions
of the Newman projection:
 The point where the three lines intersect in the front of the Newman projection repre-
sents the first carbon of the bond you’re looking down; the three lines represent bonds
coming off that carbon.
 The big circle in the back represents the back carbon, and the three lines coming off
the big circle represent the bonds coming off the back carbon.
 The bond that you’re looking down isn’t explicitly shown; rather, you simply assume
that this bond exists.
 For the purposes of this book, I use bold subscripts to number the atoms. Subscripts
that aren’t bold still indicate the quantity of atoms, per standard conventions.
On the first carbon in the ethane molecule in Figure 7-2, H1 is sticking straight up, so you put
this hydrogen straight up on the first carbon of the Newman projection; H2 is sticking down
and to the right and H3 is sticking down and to the left, so you put H2 down and to the right
and H3 down and to the left in the Newman projection. You add bonds attached to the second
carbon in the same way.
If you have difficulty viewing objects in three dimensions, molecular models (those plastic
balls and sticks) can be a big help for you to see how these Newman projections work. Some
professors may even let you bring them to your exam.

You need to worry about two primary types of conformations when performing conforma-
tional analysis of alkanes (see Figure 7-3):
 The staggered conformation: In the staggered conformation, the bonds are offset from
each other by 60°.
 The eclipsed conformation: In the eclipsed conformation, the atoms on the adjacent
carbons are in the same plane when viewed down the bond, although on paper, the
back bonds are tilted slightly to allow the back atoms to be seen.

In your mind’s eye, sight down the C1-C2
bond as the eye is doing. You can start
the Newman projection by adding the
hydrogens onto the first carbon: One
hydrogen atom sticks straight up and
toward the viewer, one sticks down and
to the right, and one sticks down and to
the left. Then add the substituents to the
second carbon. All the hydrogens on the
back carbon line up with the hydrogens
on the front carbon, so this is an eclipsed
conformation. As in all eclipsed confor-
mations, you tilt the atoms on the back
carbon slightly so you can see the atoms.

Comparing Conformational Stability
Some conformations are more stable than others. The conformation that puts the atoms or
groups as far as possible from each other is the staggered conformation; it’s generally lower-
energy and more stable. The eclipsed conformation places groups on the adjacent carbons in
direct contact, and it’s the highest-energy conformation. (Note: The Newman projection for
the eclipsed conformation rotates the bonds slightly away from each other so you can see all
the atoms on paper, but it’s assumed the atoms are aligned.)
When you have two big groups or atoms attached to the two carbons you’re sighting down in
a Newman projection, not all eclipsed or staggered conformations are equal in energy. In gen-
eral, if you have two big groups (such as two CH3 groups) or big atoms on each carbon, the
lowest-energy conformation puts these two groups as far from each other as possible. Here
are the conformations you need to worry about, from most to least stable (see Figure 7-4):
 Anti conformation: The staggered conformation with the big groups opposite each
other; it’s the lowest-energy conformation
 Gauche conformation: The staggered conformation with the big groups positioned
next to each other; it’s slightly higher in energy than the anti conformation
 Eclipsed conformation: This basic eclipsed conformation doesn’t put the big groups
on top of each other; it’s the most stable eclipsed conformation but is less stable than
the gauche or anti conformation
 Totally eclipsed conformation: The eclipsed conformation with the big groups on top
of each other; it’s the most unstable conformation

puts these groups as far away from each

Choosing Sides: The Cis-Trans 
Stereochemistry of Cycloalkanes
Like carbon chains, rings can exist in different conformations. But rings have a separate
important feature: A ring has two distinct faces, a top face and a bottom face. Therefore, if
you have two substituents on a ring, two configurations for the substituents are possible.
You can have both substituents point off the same face of the ring (called the cis configura-
tion), or you can have the substituents point off opposite faces of the ring (called the trans
configuration).
Unlike straight-chain molecules, you can’t rotate around a carbon-carbon bond constrained
in a ring without breaking any bonds, so you can’t convert a cis configuration to a trans
configuration simply by rotation. You can try this rotation on a molecular model of a ring to
prove this to yourself. A chemical reaction needs to take place to convert a ring in a cis
configuration to one in a trans configuration.

Getting a Ringside Seat with Cyclohexane 
Chair Conformations
The most common ring that you see in organic chemistry is cyclohexane, a ring of six car-
bons (C6H12). Cyclohexane is often drawn as a flat hexagon on paper, but the lowest-energy
conformation of a cyclohexane ring isn’t flat but rather is folded into a conformation called 
a chair (because this conformation looks like a lounge chair — sort of; see Figure 7-6). 
When a cyclohexane molecule is in the chair conformation, you have two distinct types 
of hydrogens:
 Axial hydrogens: Hydrogens that stick up and down roughly perpendicular to the
plane of the ring
 Equatorial hydrogens: Hydrogens that point out roughly in the plane of the ring 
(or around the belt or equator of the ring)
Because bonds in a ring can’t rotate all the way around like they can in a straight-chain 
molecule, the way a chair can change conformation is by undergoing what’s called a ring flip.
I show this in Figure 7-7, with all but one of the hydrogens omitted for clarity. To perform a
ring flip, you push the nose of the chair down and lift the tail of the chair up, as shown by the
arrows, giving a new cyclohexane conformation. (To really appreciate this ring flip, try per-
forming it with molecular models.) Upon undergoing a ring flip, all axial bonds become equa-
torial, and all equatorial bonds become axial.

Drawing a chair is hard at first, but with a
bit of practice, it’ll soon become second
nature to you. First draw two slightly
separated parallel lines that are slightly
tilted from the vertical, and then com-
plete the chair by adding the nose and
the tail. You then add the bonds attached
to the chair. I like to draw the axial bonds
first; if the carbon on the chair points up,
draw the axial bond up on that carbon,
and if the carbon on the chair points
down, draw the axial bond sticking
straight down on that carbon. After
you’ve drawn the axial bonds, adding the
equatorial bonds around the equator of
the chair is a fairly straightforward task.
Then add the atoms, making sure to put
the CH3 in one of the equatorial bonds 
(it doesn’t matter which one because
they’re all the same in this case).

Predicting Cyclohexane Chair Stabilities
When a cyclohexane has substituents, the two possible chair conformations often have 
different stabilities. To minimize strain, cyclohexanes prefer to exist in a chair conformation
that places the large substituent groups in the equatorial position rather than the axial 
position.
To predict which of the two chair conformations is lower-energy, do the following:
1. Draw the cyclohexane ring in the chair with the substituents in the proper orienta-
tion to each other.
2. Find the other conformation by performing a ring flip.
3. Determine which of the two conformations is lower-energy by seeing which confor-
mation places the large substituents in the equatorial position.

to each other, not cis). I’ve arbitrarily
numbered the cyclohexane ring carbons,
but of course, you can start numbering
anywhere. The bromine on the first
carbon can go either axial or equatorial
on the first carbon (I’ve arbitrarily
placed it equatorial), but the next
bromine has to be trans relative to the
first bromine. The first bromine is up rel-
ative to the hydrogen on the same
carbon, so to make a trans configuration,
the next bromine needs to go down rela-
tive to the hydrogen on carbon 2, which
is also an equatorial position. This gives
a diequatorial conformation. Performing
the ring flip to get the other conforma-
tion leads to a diaxial conformation
because all equatorial bonds become
axial (and all axial bonds become equato-
rial). Because the lower-energy confor-
mation is the one in which you place the
substituents in the equatorial position,
the diequatorial conformation is the
more stable.

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
In your mind’s eye, sight down the C1-C2 bond as the eye is doing. You can start the Newman
projection by adding the hydrogens onto the C1: One hydrogen atom sticks straight up and
toward the viewer, one sticks down and to the right, and one sticks down and to the left. Then
add the substituents to C2. The CH3 group sticks straight down, and the other two hydrogens
stick up and to the right and up and to the left.
b
The first thing to do is to visualize your eye looking down the C1-C2 bond as shown. Then draw
the Newman projection. On C1, hydrogen is sticking straight up, and the other two hydrogens
are sticking down and to the right and down and to the left. C2 has a CH2CH3 group sticking
straight up, so you draw this group straight up, eclipsed with the front H. Note that the bonds
in the Newman projection are tilted slightly to the side to allow the atoms to be shown, but you
assume that the bonds are eclipsed.

c
Looking down the C2-C3 bond as shown by the eye in the figure shows that the C2 CH3 is sticking
straight up and that the other two hydrogens on C2 stick down and to the right and down and
to the left. The groups on the back carbon, C3, are identical and eclipsed with the front groups,
so you tilt the projection slightly so viewers can see the groups on the back carbon.
d
Looking down the C2-C3 bond as demonstrated by the eye in the figure shows that the CH3
group on C2 sticks straight down and that the other two hydrogens stick up and to the left 
and up and to the right. The CH2CH3 group on C3 sticks straight up, and the other two back
hydrogens stick down and to the left and down and to the right.
e
First draw out all the substituents on each of the two carbons you’re sighting down — in this
case, the C1-C2 carbons. Next, draw the staggered conformation Newman projection, because
staggered conformations are lower in energy than eclipsed conformations. Add the C1 sub-
stituents and then the C2 substituents. In this example, you don’t need to worry about where
you place the substituents in the Newman projection because there’s only one non-hydrogen
group (the CH3), so you can’t have gauche or anti conformations.

f
The first thing I recommend is to draw all the substituents on the two carbons that you’re sight-
ing down, as shown. That drawing shows you that you have two H’s and a CH3 that need to be
attached to both C2 and C3. Because you want the highest-energy conformation, draw an
eclipsed conformation. To give the highest-energy eclipsed conformation, you eclipse the two
CH3 groups (shown here both sticking up).
g
The first thing to do is draw out the structure of pentane to show what groups are attached to
the two atoms you’re sighting down in the Newman projection (C2 and C3). You want the least-
stable staggered conformation, so you want to put the two big groups (the CH3 and the CH2CH3)
as close as possible to give a gauche conformation.
h
Drawing out all the atoms attached to both carbons tells you which groups you need to attach
to the Newman projection. Because you want the most stable conformation, you need to draw a
staggered conformation. After you’ve added the front atoms (the two Br’s and the H), you need
to place the back Cl to make the most stable structure. The lowest-energy arrangement places
the Cl so that it neighbors only one Br and is not stuck between the two Br’s.

i
Two ways of drawing this structure are possible, but the key is that the two groups are cis, so
you need to attach them to the same side of the ring. You can draw the canted ring that shows
both isopropyl groups sticking up (or both sticking down). An isopropyl group is a three-carbon
substituent that looks like a snake’s tongue. Alternatively, you can draw a flat three-membered
ring and use two wedges (or dashes) to show that the two isopropyl groups are on the same
side of the ring.
j
The groups are trans, so the two groups need to come off opposite sides of the ring. You can
draw the canted six-membered ring that shows one group going up and one going down, or you
can draw the flat ring and use a dash and a wedge to show that the groups are on opposite
sides of the ring.
k
The first order of business is to draw a cyclohexane chair. Next, add the chlorine to one of 
the equatorial positions. Performing the ring flip moves the chlorine atom from an equatorial
position to an axial position because on ring flips, all axial bonds become equatorial and all
equatorial bonds become axial.

After you draw a chair cyclohexane, you have to add the substituents. I’ve arbitrarily chosen
bottom right carbons on the chair, but you can add the substituents anywhere on the chair you
want. It doesn’t matter where you place the first substituent, but I’ve placed the first chlorine
equatorial on the first carbon. For clarity, I’ve omitted the other hydrogens, but you can draw
out all the atoms if you want. The key is that after you place the first substituent, you have to
place the second one so that you get the correct stereochemistry (trans in this case). The chlo-
rine in the equatorial position is up relative to the hydrogen on that carbon, so to make the
stereochemistry trans, you have to place the methyl (CH3) group down relative to the hydrogen
on the second carbon. This down position turns out to be the equatorial position. Performing
the ring flip switches both groups from equatorial to axial. The most stable conformation is the
conformation that places the substituents equatorial.

After you draw the chair, the next step is to add the substituents so they have the right stereo-
chemistry (trans in this case). I’ve arbitrarily numbered the carbons starting from the bottom
right carbon, but you can start anywhere on the ring you’d like. It doesn’t matter which posi-
tion (axial or equatorial) you choose for the ethyl (CH3CH2) substituent on the first carbon, so I
show it in the equatorial position. The key is that the next ethyl group you add has to be trans
to the first substituent. In the equatorial position, the ethyl group on the first carbon is up rela-
tive to the hydrogen, so on the fourth carbon, the other ethyl group needs to go down relative
to the hydrogen, which is also an equatorial position. Doing the ring flip changes all equatorial
bonds to axial (and all axial bonds to equatorial), so the ring flip structure has both ethyl
groups axial. Because the lower-energy conformation places the groups in the equatorial posi-
tion, the first conformation I drew is the lower-energy conformation.

After drawing the chair and numbering it, place the first methyl arbitrarily (I show it in the
equatorial position) and make sure that the next methyl group you add to C3 is on the same
side as the first methyl. Because the first methyl in the equatorial position is up relative to the
hydrogen, the next methyl group needs to be up relative to the hydrogen, which in this case is
the equatorial position. Undergoing the ring flip converts both equatorial methyl groups to
axial methyl groups. Axial placement of big groups raises the energy, so the diaxial conforma-
tion is the conformation that’s the higher in energy and the less stable.

Chapter 7: Shaping Up with Bond Calisthenics and Conformation

First, draw a chair. Then place the substituents on the chair with the correct configuration (that
is, you want to place the substituents on the ring trans to each other, not cis). The methyl (CH3)
group on the first carbon can go either axial or equatorial on the first carbon (I arbitrarily place
it equatorial), but the next methyl group has to be trans relative to the first methyl group. The
first methyl group is up relative to the hydrogen on the same carbon, so to make a trans config-
uration, the next methyl group needs to go down relative to the hydrogen on carbon 2, which is
also an equatorial position. This gives a diequatorial conformation. Performing the ring flip to
get the other conformation leads to a diaxial conformation because all equatorial bonds
become axial (and all axial bonds become equatorial). Because the lower-energy conformation
is the one in which you place the substituents in the equatorial position, the diequatorial con-
formation is the more stable.
p
After drawing and numbering the chair, you add the t-butyl group to the first carbon 
(the t-butyl group is a four-carbon substituent that looks like a trident). I’ve arbitrarily added
the t-butyl group to the equatorial position, which is up relative to the hydrogen, so to make
the cis isomer, you need to place the methyl up relative to the hydrogen on the fourth carbon.
Up on the fourth carbon turns out to be an axial position. Performing the ring flip switches the
t-butyl group from equatorial to axial and switches the methyl from axial to equatorial. The 
conformation that’s lower in energy is less clear-cut here because both conformations have one
substituent axial and one equatorial. However, the lower-energy conformation places the larger
group equatorial, and t-butyl is larger than methyl, so the first conformation is lower in energy.

C
arbon-carbon double bonds, or alkenes, are one of the most important functional
groups of organic molecules. The reactions of this functional group provide the first
introduction to the reactions of organic compounds for most students. And for the majority
of the reactions you encounter in organic chemistry, you’re expected to know how to do at
least two things:
 Predict the product of the reaction given the starting materials and the reagents
 Show the mechanism of the reaction
The mechanism of a reaction is the step-wise process of how the starting material changes
into the product; it shows which bonds are formed and broken and in what order. You also
include any intermediate molecules formed along the way in the reaction in a mechanism. On
paper, you show how bonds are formed and broken by using arrows to show the movement
of electrons in a reaction. Getting the hang of drawing mechanisms, or arrow-pushing, takes
practice, and in this chapter, you begin to master the drawing of mechanisms and predicting
reaction products. But before getting to the alkene reactions, I first take you on a quick
detour to show how to name alkenes.
Giving Alkenes a Good Name
For the most part, the nomenclature of alkenes is a fairly straightforward extension from the
naming system of alkanes (see Chapter 6). Instead of ending with the suffix -ane, however,
the names of alkenes end with the suffix -ene. The most challenging aspect of naming alkenes
comes from the possibility that the double bond will have stereochemistry.

Here’s how the alkene-naming process works:
1. Identify the parent chain.
With alkenes, the parent chain is the longest chain of carbons that contains the carbon-
carbon double bond. Table 8-1 lists the parent names for alkenes.
Table 8-1

10

2. Number the parent chain, starting from the side that reaches the double bond first.
Add a number to the parent name to indicate the first carbon of the carbon-carbon
double bond. In a ring, the double bond has to contain the number 1 and number 2 
carbons, and after including the double bond as the first two carbons, you number to
give the substituents the lowest possible number.
3. Add the substituents.
Alphabetize the names of the substituents and place them before the parent name. Use
numbers to indicate the location of each substituent.
4. Use a prefix to indicate any stereochemistry of the alkene.
Double bonds may have stereochemistry. If identical substituents stick off the double
bond, use the cis-trans system (see Chapter 7 for details):
• Cis stereochemistry: The identical substituents stick off the same side of the
double bond.
• Trans stereochemistry: The identical substituents stick off opposite sides of the
double bond.
If the two double-bonded substituents aren’t identical, use the E/Z system. Divide the
double bond in half with a line. Taking one half at a time, determine which substituent
(the top or the bottom) has higher priority using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules
(which also determine priority in R/S nomenclature; see Chapter 5). Basically, under these
rules, the substituent attached to the alkene by the atom with the higher atomic number
has higher priority. Here’s how the naming works:
• Z stereochemistry: The high-priority substituents are on the same side 
(“ze zame zide” — top or bottom) of the double bond.
• E stereochemistry: The high-priority substituents are on opposite sides of the
double bond.
Draw out any hydrogens that aren’t shown when assigning stereochemistry to double
bonds. You don’t need to name the stereochemistry of double bonds in small rings
because trans and E double bonds in rings are unstable, but you can if you want to.

Q.
Name the following alkene:
A.
trans-5-methyl-2-hexene. Begin by iden-
tifying the parent chain, the longest
chain of carbons that contains the
carbon-carbon double bond. In this case,
you number the alkene from right to left
to give the first carbon of the alkene
group the lowest number possible (as in
a). Because the parent chain is six car-
bons long, the parent name for the mole-
cule is 2-hexene, with the 2 indicating the
position of the carbon-carbon double
bond on the parent chain and the -ene
suffix identifying the molecule as an
alkene.
a)
Next, add the substituents. As in b, the
only substituent is a one-carbon group 
(a methyl) at the 5 carbon. Adding the
substituent to the name gives you 
5-methyl-2-hexene. Finally, indicate the
stereochemistry. In this case, the double
bond has two identical groups (the
hydrogens) sticking off opposite sides of
the double bond, giving the double bond
trans stereochemistry.

Q.
Name the following alkene.
A.
Z-1-chloro-1-fluoro-1-pentene. Find and
number the parent chain, giving the lowest
number possible to the double bond (as in
a). The parent chain is a five-carbon
alkene with the double bond at the first
carbon, so the parent name is 1-pentene.
a)
For substituent halogens, you replace 
-ine with -o, so fluorine as a substituent 
is called fluoro and chlorine as a sub-
stituent is called chloro; both attach to
the number 1 carbon. After placing the
substituents alphabetically in front of the
parent name, you get 1-chloro-1-fluoro-
1-pentene. Now the tricky part — the
double bond stereochemistry. You can’t
use the cis-trans nomenclature because
you don’t have two identical substituents.
Thus, you have to use the E/Z system.
Divide the double bond in half with a
dashed line and then determine priority
on each side of the double bond. On the
left side, chlorine has higher priority than
fluorine because chlorine has a higher
atomic number; likewise, the carbon
chain gets higher priority on the right side
of the double bond because carbon has a
higher atomic number than hydrogen (see
b). In this case, the highs are on the same
side, so the alkene has Z stereochemistry.

Markovnikov Mixers: Adding 
Hydrohalic Acids to Alkenes
A common reaction of alkenes is their addition reaction with the hydrohalic acids (such as
HCl and HBr) to give you a halogenated molecule. As with most all reactions you see, you
need to be able to predict the product of the reaction as well as draw the mechanism of the
reaction.
Begin the reaction by protonating the carbon-carbon double bond. In other words, use the
electrons from one of the bonds in the double bond to form a bond to the proton in the
hydrohalic acid. One of the carbons of the double bond gains the proton while the other
carbon becomes positively charged (a positively charged carbon is called a carbocation). 
You can attach the proton to either of the carbons in the double bond; however, carboca-
tions always strive for stability, and stability increases as you increase the number of
attached carbons.
Markovnikov’s rule states that the proton prefers to attach to the less-substituted carbon so
that the positive charge will go on the more-substituted carbon. This rule is a consequence
of the increasing stability of carbocations on more highly substituted carbons. A tertiary car-
bocation (R3C+) is more stable than a secondary carbocation (R2CH+), which in turn is more
stable than a primary carbocation (RCH2
+).
As a consequence of this tendency for the carbocation to form on the more-substituted
carbon, the halide winds up on the more-substituted carbon in this reaction.
Figure 8-1 shows the mechanism of the reaction. You show the protonation of the double
bond by drawing an arrow from the center of the double bond and then showing the head of
the arrow attacking the acid — the H-X proton (where X is the halogen, such as chlorine or
bromine). At the same time, break the H-X bond by drawing a second arrow from the center
of that bond onto the X. This arrow indicates that as the bond breaks, the bonding electrons
are being reassigned as a lone pair onto the X. The result of this reaction is the formation of a
carbocation and a halide ion. Lastly, the halide ion (X–) adds to the carbocation to form the
halogenated product. 
The overall effect is that you add the H and X atoms to your former alkene. Remember that
adding a hydrohalic acid to an alkene involves Markovnikov addition.

For carbocations, the stability increases as you increase the number of attached carbons.
Therefore, the left-hand structure, which is tertiary (3o), is the most stable carbocation, and

HBr addition to an alkene involves a Markovnikov addition of hydrogen bromide.
Markovnikov addition indicates that the larger atom (bromine) adds to the more-substituted
carbon and that the hydrogen adds to the less-substituted carbon (the left-most carbon).
Begin the mechanism of the reaction by protonating the double bond. Draw an arrow from
the center of the double bond, with the head of the arrow attacking the H-Br proton. At the
same time, break the H-Br bond by drawing a second arrow from the center of the H-Br bond
onto the bromine. This arrow indicates that the two H-Br bonding electrons are being reas-
signed as a lone pair onto bromine and that the H-Br bond is being broken.

You have two possibilities of where to put the proton, but Markovnikov’s rule states that the
proton prefers to attach to the less-substituted carbon because doing so leaves the more-
substituted carbon with the positive charge.
Add the bromide ion to the carbocation to generate the product, completing the mechanism
of the reaction. Note that the mechanism explains why bromide prefers to add to the more-
substituted carbon. The carbocation prefers to be generated on the more highly substituted
carbon, where it’s more stable; bromide, which is negatively charged, then hooks up with
that positively charged carbon.

Adding Halogens and Hydrogen to Alkenes
The halogenation (addition of Br2 or Cl2) and hydrogenation (addition of H2) reactions of
alkenes are two significant addition reactions that you see for alkenes. Both of these reaction
types add two identical atoms across the double bond, with one atom attaching to each of
the double-bond carbons (see Figure 8-2, in which X represents a halogen).

Hydrogenation reactions occur by adding two hydrogen atoms across the double bond in the
presence of a metal catalyst. Similarly, halogenation reactions occur by addition of a halogen
(such as Cl2 or Br2) to an alkene, which adds two halogen atoms across a double bond.
The halogenation and hydrogenation reactions introduce an important concept of organic
reactions: stereochemical control (Chapter 7 explains trans and cis stereochemistry):
 Hydrogenation and cis products: In a hydrogenation reaction, the reaction occurs when
the alkene interacts with activated hydrogen atoms on the surface of the catalyst, so the
hydrogens add to the same side of the double bond (called syn addition), resulting in a cis
product.
 Halogenation and trans products: In a halogenation reaction, as a result of the reaction
mechanism, the two halides add to opposite sides of the double bond — called anti 
addition — to give the product a defined trans stereochemistry.
The mechanism of this reaction involves a strange intermediate, a three-membered ring
called a halonium ion (specifically, a bromonium ion if it’s bromine, chloronium ion if it’s
chlorine). You reach this intermediate by simultaneous attack of the double bond on one of
the halogen atoms and attack of the same halogen atom on one of the double-bond car-
bons. At the same time, the X-X bond breaks and X– is expelled. The next step is attack of
the newly formed halide ion (X–) on one of the halonium ion carbons, breaking the C-X
bond. Because the positively charged halogen atom blocks attack of the halide ion from the
front, the halide ion must attack the carbon on the other side of the halonium ion (called
backside attack), which results in the halides’ adding on opposite sides of the double bond.
Thus, for these reactions, in addition to giving the structure of the product, you often need to
show the stereochemistry of the product.
This reaction has a twist when run in H2O solvent rather than in CCl4 solvent. In H2O solvent,
the second step is water addition to the halonium ion rather than halide (X–) addition. Thus,
the product in water is a halohydrin (a molecule with one halide and one alcohol [OH] group)
rather than a dihalide (a molecule with two halide groups).

A.
Br2 adds to alkenes by adding one bromine to each carbon of the double bond. The
bromines add to opposite sides of the double bond, resulting in a trans product. The prod-
uct is two trans stereoisomers (enantiomers) because it’s equally likely for the bromide ion
to attack the bottom carbon of the bromonium ion (shown here) as it is to attack the top
carbon (not shown), which would lead to the other enantiomer (in which the top bromine
sticks down and the bottom bromine sticks up).

Just Add Water: Adding H2O to Alkenes
Addition of water to alkenes comes in two main flavors — Markovnikov addition, in which 
the OH adds to the more-substituted double-bond carbon, and anti-Markovnikov addition, in
which the OH adds to the less-substituted carbon.
Markovnikov addition of water to alkenes is accomplished by the oxymercuration/demurcura-
tion reaction like the one shown in Figure 8-3. In this reaction, mercuric acetate, or Hg(OAc)2,
is added to the alkene in water, followed by addition of sodium borohydride (NaBH4), to give
the Markovnikov alcohol product. Here’s what happens:
1. The double bond attacks the mercury acetate, and the mercury likewise attacks the
double bond, kicking off acetate ion (AcO–).
This forms a three-membered mercury intermediate called a mercurinium ion (reminis-
cent of the halonium ions formed from the addition of halogens to alkenes in the pre-
ceding section).
2. Water attacks the most highly substituted carbon of the mercurinium ion, and the
three-membered ring is opened (just like opening a halonium ion ).
This action results in anti addition, with the water and the mercury on opposite sides
of each other.
3. Sodium borohydride is added, which replaces the mercury acetate (HgOAc) with
hydrogen by a mechanism you probably don’t need to know.
The end result is that the hydroxyl (OH) group is added to the most-substituted carbon
of the double bond.
Conversely, anti-Markovnikov addition of water to alkenes is accomplished by the hydrobora-
tion reaction (Figure 8-4). In this reaction, borane (BH3) in THF solvent is added to the alkene,
followed by addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), to give the anti-Markovnikov alcohol prod-
uct. The mechanism of borane addition to the alkene is a concerted mechanism, meaning that
all the steps occur at one time. The alkene attacks the borane, and a hydride is transferred to
the more highly substituted carbon, adding the borane to the less-substituted carbon of the
double bond. Because this occurs in a concerted fashion, the H and BH2 add to the same side
of the double bond (called syn addition).

to the alkene. That means that the OH adds to the more-substituted carbon of the double
bond. The first step is forming a three-membered mercurinium ion. In the next step, water
attacks the more highly substituted carbon. Loss of a proton from the oxygen then leads to
a mercury-substituted alcohol. Addition of NaBH4 in the final step removes the mercury and
replaces it with an H.

This hydroboration reaction results in the anti-Markovnikov addition of water to the alkene
(the OH adds to the less-substituted carbon). The double bond attacks the boron, and the
hydride transfers from the boron to the more-substituted carbon in the same step. This
leads to a BH2 unit attached to the less-substituted carbon and an H attached to the more-
substituted carbon. Because this all happens at once, the BH2 and the H add to the same
face of the double bond (syn addition). Addition of peroxide (H2O2) replaces the BH2 with
OH. Because it’s equally likely for the borane to add to the top or bottom face of the double
bond, the enantiomer is also formed by attack of the borane on the bottom face of the
double bond (not shown).

Seeing Carbocation Rearrangements
Carbocations (positively charged carbons) are mischievous reaction intermediates. These
intermediates rearrange when doing so leads to a more stable carbocation. The stability of
carbocations increases as you increase the number of carbons attached to the charged
carbon. Here are the classifications of carbocations, from least to most stable:
 Primary (1o): Carbocations with just a single attached carbon atom; they’re quite
unstable and rarely formed
 Secondary (2o): Carbocations attached to two other carbons; these cations are more
stable than primary but less stable than tertiary carbocations
 Tertiary (3o): Carbocations attached to three other carbons; these are the most stable
of the three
Carbocations rearrange principally for two reasons:
 To obtain a more stable carbocation: The most frequent cause of carbocation
rearrangements is to form a more-substituted (stable) carbocation — for example, if
possible, a secondary carbocation rearranges to a more stable tertiary one. This can
be accomplished by either a hydride shift or an alkyl shift (see Figure 8-5):
• In a hydride shift, a hydrogen on an adjacent, more highly substituted carbon
moves to the cationic carbon, taking the hydrogen and the two electrons in the 
C-H bond with it. A hydride shift is preferred over an alkyl shift.
• If no hydrogens are on the adjacent carbon, an alkyl shift can occur, in which an 
R group (such as a methyl) moves over to the positively charged carbon, taking
the two electrons in the C-C bond with it.
 To relieve ring strain: When next to small rings (principally three-, four-, and five-
carbon rings), carbocations can also undergo ring expansions to relieve ring strain (see
Figure 8-6). These ring expansions are often challenging to work through, but you can
manage them if you take them one step at a time.

To perform a ring expansion, move the electrons from the adjacent C-C ring bond to the car-
bocation. This increases the ring size by one carbon and moves the carbocation to a ring
carbon. I recommend that you number all the carbons during these ring expansion mecha-
nisms so you can keep track of where atoms and bonds end up.

Part II: The Bones of Organic Molecules: The Hydrocarbons 
Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
2-ethyl-1-pentene. The key to this problem is to find the parent chain. The parent chain is the
longest continuous chain that contains the double bond. Therefore, the parent chain is the
one that follows from left to right, even though a longer consecutive chain of carbons exists
that doesn’t encapsulate the double bond. In this case, the parent chain is five carbons long,
and the alkene is situated at the 1 carbon, so the parent name is 1-pentene. The one sub-
stituent is the two-carbon (ethyl) group attached to the second carbon. Thus, the name is 
2-ethyl-1-pentene. There’s no stereochemistry on this double bond because two identical
groups are on one carbon (the two hydrogens on carbon-1).
b
3,3-dimethyl-1-cyclopentene (or 3,3-dimethylcyclopentene). The challenge in this problem is
to find the parent chain. In rings, the double-bond carbons have to be number 1 and number
2 in order to give the double bond the lowest possible number. Then you number the ring to
give the substituents the lowest possible number. Thus, you number the cyclopentene ring
going clockwise in order to give the methyl substituents a lower number than if you were to
number the other way around the ring. This is a five-membered ring, so the parent name is 
1-cyclopentene (or just cyclopentene, because it’s assumed that the double bond is at the
number 1 carbon). Two one-carbon groups (methyls) are at the number 3 carbon, giving the
name 3,3-dimethylcyclopentene.
You often don’t indicate the stereochemistry of double bonds in rings because having a trans
double bond in a small ring is generally impossible (because the ring would become too
strained); however, if you gave the prefix cis to the name to indicate the stereochemistry, you
wouldn’t be wrong.
c
cis-1-chloro-2-heptene. To number the parent chain, start from left to right because doing so
reaches the double bond sooner.

Chapter 8: Doubling Down: The Alkenes
This is a seven-carbon alkene with the double bond at the second carbon, giving a parent 
name of 2-heptene. The only substituent is a chlorine at the first carbon (a chloro), giving you
1-chloro-2-pentene. Finally, identify the stereochemistry. The two identical substituents (the
hydrogens) are pointing off the same side of the double bond, so the stereochemistry is cis.
The full name is cis-1-chloro-1-pentene.
d
3,3-dichloro-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene. Start with numbering the alkene. Remember that in a
ring, the double bond has to contain the number 1 and number 2 carbons. After including the
double bond as the first two carbons, you number clockwise, giving the substituents the
lowest possible number.
Next, name the substituents. Chlorine as a substituent is chloro, and the one-carbon group is 
a methyl substituent. Put the two chlorines together to give you dichloro, and then put the 
substituents alphabetically in front of the parent name (ignore numerical prefixes such as di-,
tri-, tetra-, and so on, so alphabetize dichloro under the letter c). This gives you 3, 3-dichloro-
1-methyl-1-cyclohexene. Note that you don’t need to specify the stereochemistry of double
bonds in small rings (because trans or E double bonds in rings are usually unstable), but you
can if you want to.
e
(3E,5E)-4,6-diethyl-3-methyl-3,5-nonadiene. This is a tricky one because this molecule has
two alkenes (making the molecule a diene). The parent chain is the longest chain that con-
tains both alkenes. You then number the parent chain, giving the two double bonds the lower
numbers (right to left in this case). Nine carbons are in the parent chain, and the double
bonds come at carbons 3 and 5, so the parent name is 3,5-nonadiene. Note that instead of
using the suffix -ene, you use the suffix diene to indicate the number of double bonds in the
molecule.
Next, name the substituents. The two two-carbon substituents at carbons 4 and 6 are ethyl
groups, and these are clustered together to make a diethyl (still alphabetize under the letter
e). The one-carbon group at carbon 3 is a methyl group. Alphabetizing the substituents in

front of the parent name gives you 4,6-diethyl-3-methyl-3,5-nonadiene. Lastly, name the stere-
ochemistry. You can start with the right-most double bond and divide the double bond in half
(shown with the dashed line). Then prioritize the substituents on the right side using the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. Here, the bottom gets higher priority over the top because
a two-carbon chain gets priority over a one-carbon chain. On the left side, the double bond
gets higher priority over the two-carbon chain. Because the two high priorities are on oppo-
site sides of the double bond, the stereochemistry of this double bond is E.
Next, consider the second double bond. Here on the right side of the double bond, the carbon
chain has priority over the hydrogen. (Tip: Draw in any hydrogens that aren’t shown.)
On the left side, the three-carbon chain has higher priority than the two-carbon chain.
Because the highs are on opposite sides of the double bond, this double bond has E stereo-
chemistry. Finally, add the stereochemistry to the name by placing the two double-bond con-

f
all-trans-2,4,6-nonatriene (or 2E,4E,6E-2,4,6-nonatriene). First number the parent chain,
giving the double bonds the lowest numbers possible.
The parent chain is nine carbons long and has three double bonds (making it a triene) at the 2,
4, and 6 positions. The parent name is 2,4,6-nonatriene. Next, determine the stereochemistry.

In each case, the two identical substituents (hydrogens) are on opposite sides of the double
bond, making each double bond have trans stereochemistry (alternatively, using the E/Z
nomenclature, each double bond has E stereochemistry). The final name is all-trans-2,4,6-
nonatriene (alternatively, you can specify each double bond individually as trans).
g
1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene. This is a cyclic alkene that contains four double bonds, making it a
tetraene. Because all the carbons are identical, where you start numbering it doesn’t matter,
so long as the first two carbons encompass a double bond. The parent ring has eight car-
bons, with alkenes at the 1, 3, 5, and 7 carbons, giving the name 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene. As
with most double bond–containing rings, you don’t have to specify the stereochemistry
because all double bonds are assumed to be cis.
h
(2Z,4E)-2-chloro-5-fluoro-4-methyl-2,4-heptadiene. This is a tough one, though you can work
it out if you tackle it systematically. First, find the parent chain and number it. In this case, it’s
the seven-carbon chain containing the two double bonds. Numbering the chain from right to
left gives the lowest possible numbers to the double bonds. The parent chain is seven car-
bons long, and it has two double bonds at the 2 and 4 carbons, and so the parent name is 
2,4-heptadiene.
Next, add the substituents. The chlorine and fluorine are called chloro and fluoro, respec-
tively, and the one-carbon group is a methyl. Alphabetizing the substituents in front of the
parent name gives you 2-chloro-5-fluoro-4-methyl-2,4-heptadiene.
Last, do the stereochemistry. Four different groups are coming off double bond, so assign the
double bonds using the E/Z system. Starting with the right double bond, cut the double bond
in half and then assign the priorities (making sure to add the not-shown hydrogen), which
gives you the following:

The two highs are on the same side, so the stereochemistry is Z. Prioritizing the substituents
to the left side gives you the following:
The two highs are on opposite sides of the double bond, indicating E stereochemistry.
i
The reaction of the alkene with HCl yields addition of the H to the less-substituted carbon
and addition of the chlorine to the more-substituted carbon of the double bond
(Markovnikov addition). The mechanism of the reaction occurs in two steps. In the first step,
show the protonation of the double bond by drawing an arrow from the double bond to the
proton on H-Cl. The hydrogen adds to the less-substituted carbon, which places the positive
charge on the more highly substituted carbon (where the charge is more stable). Finally, the
chloride adds to yield the product.
j
HI adds in Markovnikov fashion to the double bond, which means that the H adds to the less-
substituted carbon and the I adds to the more-substituted carbon. The mechanism involves
the protonation of the double bond to give the carbocation on the more highly substituted
carbon, followed by attack of the iodide ion onto the cationic carbon to give the product.

k
The circled alkene reacts the fastest with HCl because upon protonation, you obtain the most
stable carbocation (tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary).
l
This is a challenging problem. Protonation of the double bond, as usual, leads to the carboca-
tion; however, addition of the chloride ion at this point doesn’t lead to the correct structure.
Nonetheless, this cation has a resonance structure in which you place the cation on a ring carbon
and move up the double bond. Addition of the chloride ion to this carbocation yields the product.
m
The reaction of the alkene with chlorine leads to the trans-dichloride. The mechanism proceeds
through a three-membered chloronium ion intermediate. Because the positively charged chlo-
rine blocks frontside attack, the chloride ion undergoes backside attack to give the trans dichlo-
ride. You also obtain the other trans enantiomer, which results from the chlorine’s attacking the
bottom side of the double bond to form the chloronium ion sticking down rather than sticking
up as shown here.

Chlorine adds to form the chloronium ion. Then the chloride ion attacks from the side away
from the cyclic chloronium ion attack (called backside attack) to give the dichloride. One little
difference (trick) to this problem is that the product is meso, so the products of the two poten-
tial directions of attack yield the same compound. You can verify that idea by rotating around
the central carbon-carbon bond and drawing the plane of symmetry. Thus, instead of obtaining
two enantiomers as is usually the case, you obtain just the meso compound (because the
mirror image of a meso compound is the same compound).
o
Addition of bromine to the double bond forms the bromonium ion. In the second step, the 
bromide ion attacks the bromonium ion to yield the trans dibromide. As usual with halogen 
(or hydrogen) addition to alkenes, you obtain two enantiomers because you can add the
bromine to either side of the flat double bond, giving the bromonium ion sticking up or down.

Here, you add bromine to the double bond in the presence of water to obtain a bromohydrin (a
molecule with a bromine and an OH group). The mechanism goes through the bromonium ion
intermediate, followed by the water’s attack on the more highly substituted carbon. Loss of a
proton on the oxygen gives the product.
q
When you add chlorine in the solvent water (instead of in the solvent CCl4), you get a chlorohy-
drin (a molecule with a chlorine and an OH group) instead of obtaining the typical dichloride.
You can see why from the mechanism. Chlorine adds, as usual, to give you the chloronium ion.
But then, instead of the chloride ion’s attack, water attacks the more highly substituted carbon.
Loss of a proton on the oxygen gives the product. A key point to remember is that the water
adds to the more highly substituted carbon of the chloronium ion.
r
Addition of hydrogen in the presence of a Pd, C catalyst adds the hydrogens across the double
bond in a syn fashion (meaning that both hydrogens add to the same side of the double bond).
You don’t get an enantiomer in this case because the product is meso (which is superimpos-
able on its mirror image and therefore doesn’t have an enantiomer).

Oxymercuration of a double bond leads to addition of water in a Markovnikov fashion (the OH
adds to the more-substituted carbon of the double bond). First form the mercurinium ion. In
the next step, water attacks the more highly substituted carbon. Loss of a proton from the
oxygen then leads to a mercury-substituted alcohol. Addition of NaBH4 in the final step
removes the mercury and replaces it with an H.
t
Reacting borane (BH3) with an alkene leads to addition of water across the double bond in an
anti-Markovnikov fashion (the OH adds to the less-substituted carbon). The double bond
attacks the boron, and the hydride transfers to the more-substituted carbon in the same step.
This leads to a BH2 unit attached to the less-substituted carbon and an H attached to the more-
substituted carbon. Addition of peroxide (H2O2) and base replaces the BH2 with OH. The enan-
tiomer is also formed by attack of the borane on the bottom face of the double bond.
u
Hydroboration of the cyclic alkene yields the anti-Markovnikov addition of water, with the OH
adding to the less-substituted carbon. Remember that the H and the OH add to the same face of
the double bond because the mechanism is concerted (happens all at once).
v
Addition of acid and water across a double bond yields the same product as the oxymercuration
reaction: the Markovnikov addition of water. The mechanism is different, however. In the acid-
catalyzed addition of water, the first step is protonation of the alkene to yield the carbocation
(on the more highly substituted carbon), followed by addition of water to the carbocation and
then loss of a proton on the oxygen to give the product (which looks like a stick figure).

The only stable carbocation is the one circled. In the left-most structure, the carbocation is
adjacent to a small ring, which can undergo a ring expansion to relieve strain. The two middle
structures can both undergo hydride shifts to the adjacent carbons to yield a more-substituted
(and thus more stable) carbocation.
x
Addition of HCl leads first to the carbocation. Attack of the carbocation at this point, however,
doesn’t lead to the correct product. Instead, the molecule undergoes a hydride shift, moving
the carbocation from the secondary carbon to the more stable tertiary site. Addition of chlo-
ride ion then yields the product.
y
First, add HCl to give the carbocation. The next step is a methyl shift from the adjacent carbon
to yield the more stable tertiary carbocation. In the last step, the chloride adds to the

Tripling the Fun: Alkyne Reactions 
and Nomenclature
In This Chapter
 Naming alkynes
 Making reactions with alkynes
 Practicing with some multistep synthesis problems
T
he reactions and nomenclature of alkynes are very similar to the reactions and nomen-
clature of the alkenes. As a result, you’re sitting pretty if you understand alkenes
because many parts of this chapter may feel like déjà vu. (If you’re not confident with alkene
nomenclature and reactions, you may want to check out Chapter 8.)
Alkynes are molecules that contain carbon-carbon triple bonds. The big concept introduced
with alkynes is the addition of simple multistep synthesis problems. A multistep synthesis is a
sequence of two or more individual reactions that converts a starting material into a desired
product with a more complicated structure. Of course, you can’t practice multistep synthesis
until you understand the reactions, so this chapter starts with individual reactions of alkynes
and then progresses to ordering reactions you already know into sequences in multistep syn-
thesis problems.
Playing the Name Game with Alkynes
Naming alkynes is a lot like naming alkenes, only simpler because you don’t have to worry
about the stereochemistry around a carbon-carbon triple bond as you do around a carbon-
carbon double bond.
To name alkynes, follow these steps:
1. Locate the parent chain.
The parent chain is the longest chain of carbons that contains the carbon-carbon triple
bond. The parent name of an alkyne ends with the suffix -yne. (See Chapter 8 for more
on parent names.)
If you have both an alkene and an alkyne in the molecule, the parent name is -enyne,
with a number in front of the parent name to indicate the location of the alkene and 
a number in front of -yne to indicate the location of the alkyne. For example, 
1-penten-3-yne indicates a double bond at carbon 1 and a triple bond at carbon 3.

2. Number the chain to give the alkyne the lowest possible number.
3. Name the substituents.
Hydrocarbon substituents end with the suffix -yl, and halogen substituents end with
the suffix -o (as in chloro, fluoro, iodo, and so forth).
4. Place the substituents in alphabetical order in front of the parent name.
Use numbers to indicate the positions of the substituents on the parent chain.
166
Part II: The Bones of Organic Molecules: The Hydrocarbons 
Q.
Name the following alkyne.
A.
1-chloro-3,3-dimethyl-1-pentyne. After
you first locate the parent chain, number
the chain to give the alkyne the lowest
possible number. In this case, the num-
bering starts from left to right, giving you
a five-carbon parent chain. Because the
alkyne comes at the first carbon, the
name of the parent chain is 1-pentyne.
The chlorine is named chloro as a sub-
stituent, and the two methyl groups are
clustered together to make dimethyl.
Place the substituents alphabetically in
front of the parent name, with numbers
indicating their position on the parent
chain.

Q.

is the five-carbon unit containing the
triple bond (not the four-carbon ring,
because the parent chain needs to con-
tain the triple bond). Number the parent
chain to give the alkyne the lower
number. In this case, the parent chain is
five carbons long and the alkyne comes
at the second carbon, so the parent
name is 2-butyne. The only substituent is
the four-membered ring, which as a sub-
stituent is called a cyclobutyl. Placing this
substituent in front of the parent name
gives you 4-cyclobutyl-2-pentyne.

Adding Hydrogen and Reducing Alkynes
One of the simplest reactions of alkynes is the addition of hydrogen (H2), typically in the
presence of a catalyst. Because alkynes are more reactive than alkenes, adding just one
equivalent of H2 is possible with the right catalyst. That is, stopping the addition of hydrogen
is possible after the alkyne has been reduced to an alkene without totally reducing the alkyne
to an alkane. Of course, whether the alkene formed is of cis or trans stereochemistry depends
on the reagents used.
Three common reagents and catalysts can reduce alkynes:
 H2/Lindlar catalyst: This catalyst, which is a “poisoned” palladium catalyst, reduces
alkynes to cis-alkenes. Poisoned here just means that the additives lead acetate and
quinoline make the palladium catalyst less reactive in order to stop the reduction at
the alkene stage.
 Na/NH3: These reagents (which, unlike the other two, don’t contain H2 gas) reduce
alkynes to trans-alkenes.
 H2/Pd (or H2/Pd(C) or H2/Pt): These catalysts are highly active and reduce alkynes to
alkanes, not stopping at the alkene stage.

Adding Halogens and Hydrohalic Acids 
to Alkynes
Halogens and hydrohalic acids add to alkynes in much the same way these reagents add to
alkenes (check out Chapter 8). The main difference is that these reagents add two times
rather than just once because each alkyne contains two reactive pi bonds, compared to just
one pi bond in alkenes.
Figure 9-1 shows the addition of halogens and hydrohalic acids reactions. In the case of the
halogenation reaction, the product is a tetrahalide (four halides). In the hydrohalic acid reac-
tion, the product is a dihalide, with both halogen atoms attached to the same carbon (not
one halogen to each carbon).

The cation prefers to rest on the more-

more stable. The bromide (Br–) then
attacks the cation to form a bromine-
substituted alkene. The next step is pro-

new carbocation (again, on the more-
substituted carbon). Lastly, the bromide

Adding Water to Alkynes
Water adds to alkynes in similar fashion (and with similar reagents) to how it adds to 
alkenes — but with a twist at the end. The addition goes as you may expect at first, produc-
ing the alcohol-substituted alkene, called an enol. However, enols are unstable and rapidly
rearrange through a process called a tautomerization, giving you a carbonyl compound.
Essentially, a tautomerization reaction is simply a reaction in which a proton transfer and a
double bond shift take place: The proton on oxygen transfers to the adjacent carbon while
the double bond changes from a C=C double bond to a more stable C=O double bond.
As with alkenes, an oxymercuration reaction leads to Markovnikov addition of water across
the alkyne, and a borane reaction gives anti-Markovnikov addition of water across the alkyne.
The reagents are slightly different structurally from those used for alkenes, but they serve
the same purpose. Figure 9-2 shows these reactions.

Thus, these water-addition reactions to alkynes employ two steps:
1. Add water across the triple bond to form the unstable enol.
Whether the hydroxyl (OH) group adds to the more-substituted carbon or to the less-
substituted carbon depends on whether you added Markovnikov reagents (oxymercu-
ration) or anti-Markovnikov reagents (borane).
2. Perform the tautomerization that converts the enol into the carbonyl form.

Creating Alkynes
To make alkynes, you have two principal reactions. The first is a double-elimination reaction
similar to the one you may have seen for making alkenes (more technically called a double
dehydrohalogenation reaction, for those who enjoy tongue twisters). Figure 9-3 shows this
reaction.
The other one is new chemistry, using acetylide ions (deprotonated alkynes) to form new
alkyne-carbon bonds (see Figure 9-4). These reactions require terminal alkynes, which 
are alkynes at the end of a chain with a proton attached. Protons attached to alkynes are
weakly acidic, so a very strong base, such as NaNH2, can deprotonate the alkyne to generate
an acetylide ion. This acetylide ion is a powerful nucleophile that adds to primary alkyl
halides (R-CH2-X) via an SN2 reaction to give an internal alkyne, an alkyne in the middle 
of a molecule (for a briefing on SN2 reactions, see Chapter 10). This reaction is especially
important because it forms a carbon-carbon bond.

cules of HBr to make the alkyne. This
reaction occurs through the E2 mecha-
nism (refer to Chapter 10) in similar fash-
ion to the elimination of a single halide to
give an alkene, except you have to elimi-
nate twice to make an alkyne.

Terminal alkynes are weakly acidic. In

pulled off to generate an acetylide ion.

Back to the Beginning: Working 
Multistep Synthesis Problems
In multistep synthesis problems, you’re asked to give a sequence of reactions that takes a
starting material and turns it into a product in two or more reaction steps. These problems
are often challenging, but one of the best ways to work these problems is by working back-
ward (called retrosynthesis), much like you may try to solve a maze by starting at the end and
working back.
To work through a multistep synthesis problem, keep these two tips in mind. Remember that
no mechanisms are required in multistep synthesis problems.
 Compare the carbon skeleton of the starting material and the product. If more car-
bons are in the product than in the starting material, you know that you need a carbon-
carbon bond-forming reaction at some point along the way. For now, the acetylide
reaction of alkynes is your principal source for adding carbons to a molecule.
 Use retrosynthesis. Look at the product and think of how you can work back from the
product toward the starting material. If you see a particularly striking functional group
in the molecule, ask yourself how you can use the reactions you know to make that
group. Then show that reaction and the starting material you need. Repeat the process,
keeping the structure of the starting material in the back of your mind to make sure
you’re heading back in the right direction.
Q.
Outline a multistep synthesis to convert
the shown starting material into the
desired product.
A.

You have four carbons in the starting
material and four in the product, so you
can rule out carbon-carbon bond-forming
reactions. The functional group that
stands out in the product is the alkyne,
so you want to think of ways to make an
alkyne. Because you’ve ruled out the
acetylide reaction (which adds carbons),
the alternative to making an alkyne uses
a double dehydrohalogenation reaction.
To perform a double dehydrohalogena-
tion reaction, you need to start with a
dibromide and add two equivalents of
strong base, such as NaNH2. Next, work
backward again from this intermediate
and brainstorm all the ways you know of
making a dibromide. Addition of Br2 to an
alkene accomplishes this conversion —
and of course, the starting material is the
very alkene that you need.

of the steps is to lengthen the carbon
chain by using a C-C bond-forming reac-
tion. Working backward, brainstorm all
the ways you know of making an alde-
hyde: There’s only one — anti-
Markovnikov addition of water to an
alkyne by using a borane reagent fol-
lowed by peroixides.
Working back again, think how you
could’ve made that alkyne. Double elimi-
nation or acetylide chemistry are both
possible, but because the starting mate-
rial has fewer carbons than the product,
using acetylide chemistry seems the best
route. The starting alkyne is acetylene
(ethyne), and you want to add a three-
carbon chain; to do this, you first add the
strong base (NaNH2) to deprotonate the
alkyne and then add a three-carbon halide
(I use a bromide here, but you could
choose a chloride or iodide as well).

180
Part II: The Bones of Organic Molecules: The Hydrocarbons 
Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
2,2-dimethyl-3-hexyne. First, number the parent chain to give the alkyne the lowest possible
number. Numbering right to left or left to right gives the alkyne the same number, so the tie
goes to the side that gives the first substituent the lowest number. In this case, that occurs by
numbering from right to left. The alkyne comes at carbon 3 and the parent chain is six carbons
long, so the parent name is 3-hexyne. Cluster the two identical methyl groups to make a
dimethyl unit in the name and then place it in front of the parent name with two numbers to
indicate the position of the two methyl groups.
b
3,3-dimethyl-1-cyclooctyne. When an alkyne is in a ring (unusual in small rings), you number
the alkyne so the first two carbons encompass the carbon-carbon triple bond. In this case,
number toward the substituents to give them the lower number. Because the ring is eight 
carbons, the parent name is 1-cyclooctyne. Adding the two methyl substituents with numbers
to indicate their position provides the full name.
c
2-methyl-1-penten-3-yne. The nomenclature gets a bit tricky when you have both alkenes and
alkynes. In those cases, look to give the lowest number to the first alkene or alkyne as you
number the parent chain. In this case, you get the lowest number for the first alkene or alkyne
by numbering left to right, because the alkene comes at carbon 1 (numbering the other way
gives the first alkene or alkyne at carbon 3). A compound containing a double and a triple bond
has a parent name with the -enyne suffix. Because the alkene comes at carbon 1 and the alkyne
comes at carbon 3 and the parent chain is five carbons long, the parent name is 1-penten-3-yne.
Adding the methyl substituent provides the full name.

d
cis-3-hexen-1,5-diyne. This problem is challenging. Numbering is straightforward because it
doesn’t matter whether you number left to right or right to left. A molecule that contains one
alkene and two alkynes is called an -endiyne (one -ene two -ynes). In this case, the alkynes are at
positions 1 and 5, the alkene is at position 3, and the parent chain is six carbons long, so the
parent name is 3-hexen-1,5-diyne. The double bond is of cis (or Z) stereochemistry, so add the
stereochemistry as a prefix of the parent name.

Hydrohalic acids such as HCl add twice to alkynes to give a dihalide (on the same carbon). The
mechanism first involves protonation of the double bond, followed by attack of the resulting
chloride onto the newly formed carbocation. Repeating this process gives the dihalide again.
j
In this case, you can get two dibrominated products because both sides of the alkyne are
equally substituted (thus, there’s no preference for addition to the left or right side). You get a
mixture of HBr addition to the left and right side of the alkyne. Note, though, that the two
halides always add to the same carbon.

Halogens add to alkynes twice to give the tetrahalogenated product (product with four 
halogens).

The mechanism goes through a bromonium ion following attack of the alkyne on the bromine.
Addition of bromide leads to the dibrominated alkene. Addition of a second molecule of Br2
through another bromonium ion intermediate produces the tetrabrominated product.
l
Because the alkyne is symmetrical, each side of the triple bond is identical, so you get only a
single product. In other words, regardless of whether the two chlorine atoms add to the left
carbon or the right carbon of the triple bond, you obtain the same product.
m
Mercury sulfate (HgSO4) and sulfuric acid add water in a Markovnikov fashion (in which the OH
adds to the more-substituted carbon) to make an enol (an OH on a double bond). Enols are
unstable and undergo a rearrangement (tautomerization) to give the carbonyl compound.
Because the OH adds to the more-substituted carbon, the carbonyl (C=O) ends up on the more-
substituted carbon, producing a ketone.

Hydroboration adds water in an anti-Markovnikov fashion across the triple bond, with the OH
ending up on the less-substituted carbon. As in problem 13, the resulting enol is unstable and
undergoes the tautomerization to form the carbonyl compound. Because the OH added to the
less-substituted carbon, the carbonyl group ends up on the less-substituted carbon, giving you
an aldehyde.
o
Oxymercuration adds water in Markovnikov fashion across the double bond. However, because
both carbons on the alkyne are equally substituted, there’s no preference for addition to either
side, so you obtain two products.
p
This problem’s challenging. The addition of bromine in water produces a brominated ketone.
You can see why this reaction happens from the mechanism. The first step is addition of
bromine to make the bromonium ion. In the second step, water adds to the bromonium ion 
to make an enol (an OH on a double bond). Unstable enols rearrange to the corresponding 
carbonyl compounds — in this instance, a ketone.

q
Two equivalents of base eliminate two molecules of HCl to make the alkyne.
r
Two equivalents of strong base eliminate two molecules of HBr to form the alkyne.
s
This reaction is an acetylide reaction. First, the base deprotonates the alkyne to form the
acetylide; second, the acetylide undergoes an SN2 reaction with the alkyl halide. In this case, the
halide is one carbon long, so the alkyne is extended by one carbon.
t
The key to this problem is to remember that acetylide chemistry works only for primary alkyl
halides. Therefore, the carbon chain that you add to the alkyne has to have an initial CH2
unit. The only way to make this product is to cause a reaction between the t-butyl alkyne and
NaNH2 and then add a two-carbon halide to give the product. The other possibility — starting
with an ethyl alkyne and adding a t-butyl halide — doesn’t work because the halide wouldn’t be
primary.

u
After comparing the number of carbons in the starting material and product, work backward.
Here, you notice that four carbons are in the starting material and six carbons are in the prod-
uct, so somewhere along the way, you need to add two carbons. The product is a tetrabromide.
Working backward, this can come from an alkyne by addition of two molecules of Br2. Next,
think about how to make that alkyne. Because you need to add two carbons, use the acetylide
chemistry in which you add a two-carbon halide.
v
A quick carbon count shows that the product has two more carbons than the starting material.
The product is a cis-alkene. At this point, acetylide chemistry is likely the only reaction you
know for forming carbon-carbon bonds, so you may expect that this product was formed from
an alkyne.
Alkynes are reduced to the cis alkene by using H2 and the Lindlar-catalyst. Working backward,
you can make that alkyne by using acetylide chemistry with a two-carbon halide. Because the
starting material isn’t an alkyne, the way to prepare this functional group is through double
elimination of halides (such as Br) by using NaNH2. You can make this dibromide from the start-
ing material by reaction with bromine (Br2).

In this part . . .
T
his is the part where things really get interesting
because this is where you get to the heart of organic
chemistry: the reactions of organic molecules. These
reactions show you how to transform one molecule into
another.
The cool thing about functional groups is that you can pre-
dict their reactivity. Functional groups tend to react in the
same way from one molecule to the next, so if you uncover
the reactions of a single functional group, you essentially
discover the reactions of many thousands of specific com-
pounds that contain that functional group. The functional
groups included in this part are the alkyl halides, the alco-
hols, and the aromatic compounds, each of which has its
own interesting and unique chemistry.

and Elimination of Alkyl Halides

 Looking at SN1 and SN2 reactions
 Comparing E1 and E2 reactions
 Predicting products of substitution and elimination reactions
T
he substitution and elimination reactions are two of the most important classes of reac-
tions that you cover in organic chemistry. Substitution reactions are reactions in which
an incoming group takes the place of a portion of a molecule that’s given the boot, called
the leaving group. Elimination reactions are reactions in which a leaving group is expelled
from a molecule. In relationship terms, an elimination reaction is akin to dumping your sig-
nificant other. A substitution reaction is when you dump your significant other and replace
him or her with someone else.
In this chapter — which you can think of in terms of a molecular soap opera if it helps you get
into the spirit of the thing — you see how to distinguish among the different types of substitu-
tion and elimination reactions, both of which come in two flavors. Finally, you put everything
you know together and predict the product of reactions in which all four reactions are possible.
The Replacements: Comparing 
SN1 and SN2 Reactions
Substitution reactions come in two flavors, called the SN1 and SN2 substitution reactions.
These two reactions replace one group (the leaving group) with another (a nucleophile).
Although these two reactions accomplish essentially the same task, the reactions occur by
different mechanisms.
Substitution reactions are very important in organic chemistry because they provide a way
to synthesize a large variety of molecules. Because these reactions are so important to the
organic chemist, most orgo classes cover the particulars of these reactions in all their gory
detail. The general mechanism of the SN1 and SN2 reactions are shown in Figure 10-1. In the
SN1 reaction, the first step is loss of the leaving group to form an intermediate carbocation. 
In the second step, the nucleophile attacks the carbocation to form the product. In the SN2
mechanism, the reaction occurs in a single step: The nucleophile attacks at the same time
that the leaving group is given the boot.

The structure of the molecule and the reaction conditions (solvent, nucleophile, and so on)
dictate the mechanism by which the reaction occurs. Table 10-1 shows some of the struc-
tural preferences and reaction conditions that favor each of the two mechanisms.

Here’s how to determine the mechanism:
1. Look at the substrate.
If your substrate is tertiary — that is, the leaving group is attached to a tertiary 
carbon — the substitution has to proceed via the SN1 mechanism; if the substrate is
methyl or primary, the substitution has to proceed via the SN2 mechanism.
2. For secondary substrates, look to the solvent and nucleophile.
Secondary substrates are slippery ground because both substitutions can occur, so
look to the solvent and the nucleophile to see which mechanism will be favored.
The strength of a nucleophile generally parallels basicity, so strong bases (such as
OH–) are usually strong nucleophiles. Generally, negatively charged nucleophiles are
strong. A few exceptions: Halides (Cl–, Br–, I–), thiols (R-SH), cyanide (CN–) and azide
(N3
–) are generally considered weak bases but good nucleophiles.

Q.
Draw the mechanism for the following
reaction.
A.
This substitution reaction occurs by an
SN1 mechanism. The big giveaway is that
the substrate is a tertiary halide (the
halogen is connected to a tertiary
carbon, a carbon attached to three other
carbons). SN2 reactions don’t occur on
tertiary substrates, but SN1 reactions do.
The first step in an SN1 reaction is loss of
the leaving group to form a carbocation
intermediate (a positively charged
carbon). In the second step, the nucle-
ophile (in this case, CH3CH2OH) adds to
the carbocation. Loss of a proton forms
the product.

Q.
Order the following substrates from best
to worst for their ability to react in an
SN2 reaction. 
A.
SN2 reactions work best with the least
sterically hindered substrates. In the SN2
mechanism, the nucleophile attacks the
carbon that contains the leaving group,
displacing the leaving group. Attacking
the carbon with the leaving group is
easier if you have less steric crowding
around that carbon. Therefore, methyl
substrates (CH3X) react the fastest in an
SN2 reaction, followed by primary sub-
strates (RCH2X), followed by secondary
(R2CHX). Tertiary substrates don’t react
via the SN2 mechanism because there’s
simply too much crowding around the
carbon with the leaving group for the
nucleophile to approach.

Chapter 10: The Leaving Group Boogie: Substitution and Elimination of Alkyl Halides

Kicking Out Leaving Groups 
with Elimination Reactions
The two elimination reactions are called the E1 and E2 reactions (see Figure 10-2). In these
reactions, a base abstracts a proton from a carbon adjacent to the leaving group to form an
alkene. This can occur in two steps (E1 mechanism) or in one step (E2) mechanism, depend-
ing on the specific reaction conditions.
A common mistake among students is to pull off a proton from the carbon containing the
leaving group rather than a proton on an adjacent carbon. Deprotonation always occurs on a
carbon adjacent to the leaving group (in the E2 mechanism) or on a carbon adjacent to the
positive charge (in the E1 mechanism).
Table 10-2 shows the preferred reaction conditions for the two elimination mechanisms.

E2 mechanisms are more likely when you have a strong base (a base with a negative charge);

antiperiplanar to undergo the E2 reaction — in other words, the leaving group and the proton

have to be on opposite sides of the intervening bond (anti stereochemistry) and in the same
plane (planar). E1 mechanisms occur with weaker bases, secondary or tertiary substrates,
and a protic solvent (one containing OH or NH bonds).
When attempting to determine which elimination mechanism is dominant, keep these steps
in mind:
1. Look to the substrate.
E1 eliminations occur only with tertiary (3o) substrates or with secondary (2o) 
substrates. E2 works with all substrate types.
2. Look to the base.
If the base is strong (negatively charged), the E2 mechanism is favored; with weak
bases, the E1 mechanism is favored.
3. If you still don’t have a satisfactory answer, look to the solvent.
E1 reactions occur only in protic solvents (solvents with NH or OH bonds). Conversely,
the E2 reaction can occur in all solvents.

Q.
Draw the mechanism of the following
reaction.
A.
This elimination reaction can occur by
either the E1 or the E2 mechanism. For
the E2 mechanism, you need a strong
base. Here, the base (MeOH) is weak. E1
eliminations require either a tertiary or
secondary substrate, as well as a protic
solvent. Here, the substrate is tertiary
and the solvent (MeOH) is protic
because it contains an OH bond, perfect
for the E1 mechanism. The first step is
loss of the leaving group to form a carbo-
cation. In the second step, the solvent
also acts as the base to pull off an adja-
cent proton to form the double bond.

Putting It All Together: Substitution 
and Elimination
Here you put the different types of reactions together. Because E1, E2, SN1, and SN2 reactions
can occur on very similar substrates, you need to be able to predict which mechanism and
what product will form. Figure 10-3 provides a rule of thumb reaction tree for determining
what mechanism will occur given the substrate and reaction conditions. You can use this as
a guide until you get the feel for the conditions that lead to different products.
To use this reaction tree, start at the top and work down the branches until you’ve identified
the mechanism. The first step is to identify the substrate as methyl, primary (1o), secondary
(2o), or tertiary (3o). Each of these choices leads down a different branch, which asks further
questions until you’ve identified the reaction type. As you can see from the reaction tree, sec-
ondary substrates are harder to predict than the others, and so this branch has the most
questions to identify the reaction mechanism. Under some conditions, two mechanisms may
be operating to give a mixture of products.

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The substrate here is primary, meaning that the leaving group is attached to a primary carbon
(a carbon attached to just one other carbon), so this reaction goes through the SN2 mechanism.
In general, primary substrates don’t go through the SN1 mechanism. In the SN2 mechanism, the
nucleophile attacks the carbon from the backside of the carbon that contains the leaving group,
displacing the leaving group in a single step.
b
Tertiary carbocations, or positive charges on tertiary carbons (carbons attached to three other
carbons), are more stable than secondary carbocations. Secondary carbocations are positive
charges on secondary carbons (carbons attached to two other carbons), which in turn are
more stable than primary carbocations (positive charges on a primary carbon — see Chapter 8
for more on carbocations). This stability comes as a result of the electron-donating ability of
adjacent R groups. These groups can donate some electron density to the carbocation, thereby
stabilizing it by delocalizing the charge across more of the molecule. Therefore, the more 
R groups attached to the cationic carbon, the more stable the charge.
c
This is a tertiary substrate, so the substitution is via the SN1 mechanism. The first step is loss
of the leaving group (OTos–) to form the carbocation. In the second step, the nucleophile adds
to the carbocation. Loss of a proton gives the product.

Chapter 10: The Leaving Group Boogie: Substitution and Elimination of Alkyl Halides

The best substrates for the SN1 reaction are those that form stable carbocations after the leaving
group leaves. Tertiary (3o) carbocations are more stable than secondary (2o) carbocations, and
secondary carbocations are more stable than primary (1o) carbocations, so the order is tertiary >
secondary > primary. Additionally, adjacent double bonds or aromatic rings stabilize the carbo-
cation through resonance (for more on resonance, see Chapter 3). Thus, the tertiary double 
benzylic substrate reacts the fastest, followed by the tertiary substrate, followed by the primary
allylic (which is about as stable as a secondary carbocation), followed by the primary substrate.
e
Any solvent that’s polar protic is a good solvent for the SN1 reaction. Any solvent that’s polar
but aprotic is a good solvent for the SN2 reaction. Most of the acronym solvents (DMSO, DMF,
THF, and so on) are polar aprotic solvents.
f
Rate = k[(CH3)3CCl]. This reaction is an SN1 reaction because the substrate is tertiary (SN2
mechanisms don’t occur on tertiary substrates). The rate equation of an SN1 reaction includes
just the substrate. Thus, changing the concentration of the nucleophile has no effect on the
rate of the SN1 reaction.
g
In this mechanism, you have a leaving group (Cl) on a tertiary carbon. Therefore, the first step
is loss of the leaving group to form a carbocation. At this point, the OH group at the end of the
molecule can attack the carbocation to form a ring. Loss of a proton yields the neutral product.
h
Most of the time, basicity parallels nucleophilicity, but basicity refers to the ability of a mole-
cule to abstract a proton, whereas nucleophilicity refers to the ability to attack a carbon.
Because (CH3)3CO– is a highly sterically hindered base, it’s difficult for this molecule to
approach a carbon in order to do nucleophilic attack because of the bulky methyl (CH3) groups
attached. Therefore, this molecule is highly basic but a poor nucleophile. Thus, whenever you
see this ion in a reaction, its function is usually as a base and seldom as a nucleophile.
i
This is an elimination reaction, so it can conceivably go through either the E1 or E2 reaction
mechanisms. The substrate is tertiary, the base (H2O) is weak, and the solvent (also H2O) is
protic because it has an OH bond. All of these factors favor E1 elimination. In E1 elimination,
the first step is loss of the leaving group to form the carbocation. In the second step, water
pulls off an adjacent proton to form the double bond.

j
This problem is challenging. The elimination is E2 because the base (OH–) is very strong (E1
eliminations occur with weak bases). In the E2 reaction, the stereochemical requirements are
that the leaving group and the proton to be pulled off have to be antiperiplanar. As drawn, how-
ever, the leaving group and the adjacent proton aren’t anti to each other. Thus, you have to
rotate around the carbon-carbon bond to make them anti. Doing the elimination from this
geometry leads to the two methyl groups appearing on opposite sides of the double bond.
k
Potassium tert-butoxide — tBuOK — is a powerful base. Whenever you see this reagent, you
can almost bet that you’ll see E2 elimination as a result of its high basicity and poor nucle-
ophilicity. For an E2 elimination to occur, the leaving group and proton have to be antiperipla-
nar. On a cyclohexane ring, the only time such a geometry occurs is when both the leaving
group and the adjacent hydrogen are axial. Thus, the proton to the left can’t be eliminated
because it’s equatorial, but the proton to the right can be eliminated because it’s axial. Pulling
off this proton leads to the alkene product.
l
This problem is tough because the product’s double bond is in a location that you wouldn’t
expect. The reaction conditions are ripe for E1 elimination because the base is weak (E2 reac-
tions generally require strong, negatively charged bases). So the first step is loss of the leaving
group to form the carbocation. If you perform the elimination at this point, however, you don’t
obtain the shown product. However, you have a secondary carbocation adjacent to a tertiary
carbon, so the cation badly wants to get to that tertiary carbon, where it’s more stable. 
Thus, the molecule performs a hydride shift so that the secondary cation becomes tertiary.
Elimination of a hydrogen adjacent to the cation leads to the correct product. (See Chapter 8
for problems on carbocations and hydride shifts.)

m
The substrate is tertiary and the base is strong, so you get E2 elimination.
n
Methyl substrates always give SN2 products because they can’t do elimination reactions 
(no adjacent protons!) and methyl cations are too unstable to form.
o
The substrate is secondary, and the solvent is protic. In general, negatively charged nucle-
ophiles/bases are strong, with a couple of exceptions. Halides (such as Cl–, Br–, and I–) are weak
bases/nucleophiles, and azide (N3
–) and cyanide (CN–) are good nucleopiles but weak bases.
Thus, this reaction favors SN1 chemistry (E1 products may result as a minor product). SN1 reac-
tions lead to racemic products — a rough 50:50 mixture of the two stereoisomers.
p
The substrate is secondary, the solvent is aprotic, and CN– is a stronger nucleophile than a
base, so you predominantly obtain an SN2 product, in which the stereochemistry of the product
is inverted (due to the backside attack of the nucleophile in the SN2 mechanism).

SN2 reactions lead exclusively to inversion of stereochemistry in the product. In SN1 reactions,
you get a roughly 50:50 mixture of inversion and retention of the stereochemistry.
r
The substrate is primary, but the powerful bulky base tert-butoxide forces the reaction to
undergo an E2 reaction (tert-butoxide is generally too bulky to efficiently undergo SN2 
reactions).
s
This problem is challenging. The substrate is secondary, and the base is the powerful tert-
butoxide. This reagent almost always forces E2 elimination. For the molecule to undergo E2
elimination, however, the hydrogen and the leaving group have to have an antiperiplanar
geometry (they need to be on opposite sides of the connecting bond [anti] and in the same
plane). In a cyclohexane ring, the only way for such an antiperiplanar geometry to occur is if
both the hydrogen and the leaving group are axial. Because the leaving group as shown is equa-
torial, you have to perform a ring flip to make it axial (Chapter 6 explains ring flips). After you
do that, only one adjacent hydrogen is also axial and can undergo this elimination. Thus, this
hydrogen undergoes the elimination to give the double bond via an E2 mechanism.
t
This substrate is secondary, and the solvent is polar aprotic (most of the acronym solvents,
such as DMSO, THF, and DMF, are polar aprotic). Generally, negatively charged species are
strong nucleophiles and strong bases, but the halides are good nucleophiles but poor bases.
Thus, this is an SN2 reaction, which gives inversion of stereochemistry.

ost people — and in particular, college students — are familiar with the alcohol in
beer, wine, and other strong drinks. This alcohol is ethanol (CH3CH2OH), which is a
byproduct of fermentation, the breakdown of sugars into alcohol by yeast enzymes. You
may also know some other alcohols, such as wood alcohol, also called methanol (CH3OH),
which is the alcohol that makes people go blind from drinking poorly distilled moonshine.
There’s also rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol — (CH3)2CHOH — which is often used to
sterilize skin before you get an injection.
But there are many thousands of alcohols that have been made, and in fact, alcohols, or 
molecules that contain a hydroxyl (OH) group, are one of the most versatile and important
functional groups in organic chemistry. Not only are alcohols found in many useful end prod-
ucts such as drugs and organic materials, but they’re also useful intermediates in synthesis
because they’re easily made and transformed into other functional groups. The chemistry of
alcohols, therefore, plays a key role in synthetic organic chemistry.
This chapter covers the most important reactions of alcohols, with a wee bit of nomenclature
thrown in so you can be clear about the structure of a molecule indicated by a given name.
Name Your Poison: Alcohol Nomenclature
Naming alcohols follows along a similar line to the nomenclature of other organic molecules,
except that the names of alcohols end with the suffix -ol. The primary difference between
naming alcohols and naming alkanes (Chapter 6) is in the numbering of the parent chain. 
For alcohols, you start numbering from the end that gives the alcohol the lowest possible
number rather than the end that reaches the first substituent soonest.

To name an alcohol, follow these steps:
1. Identify the parent chain.
The parent chain of an alcohol is the longest chain of carbons that contains the
hydroxyl (OH) group.
2. Number the parent chain.
Start at the end that reaches the hydroxyl group sooner to give the alcohol the
lowest possible number.
3. Name the substituents and place them alphabetically in front of the parent chain.
Be sure to use a number to indicate the position of any substituents along the parent
chain.
4. Assign stereochemistry (if applicable).
If a chiral center is shown (see Chapter 5), assign the stereochemistry of the chiral
center and place this designation in the front of the name. Include a number to indi-
cate the location of the chiral centers if the molecule has more than one.

The names of alcohols end with the

ecule is 3-heptanol (or heptan-3-ol if you
prefer). In this case, the only substituent
is the isopropyl group (which looks like a
snake’s tongue) at the 4 carbon. Thus,
the full name is 4-isopropyl-3-heptanol.

Beyond Homebrew: Making Alcohols
You may have seen some of the reactions to make alcohols in the reactions of alkenes (see
Chapter 8). You can also make alcohols through reduction reactions of carbonyl com-
pounds such as ketones, aldehydes, esters, and carboxylic acids. You should know two
reducing agents:
 Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4): This one is the stronger reducing agent of the
two. It reduces esters (RCOOR), carboxylic acids (RCOOH), ketones (RCOR), and
aldehydes (RCHO) to alcohols.
 Sodium borohydride (NaBH4): Sodium borohydride is a less powerful reducing
agent. It can only reduce ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. This reagent leaves
esters and carboxylic acids intact.
Figure 11-1 shows how these two agents work.

The biggest reaction newcomer, though, is the Grignard reaction, an important alcohol-
making reaction that forms a carbon-carbon bond in the process. When working with
Grignard reactions, you start with an alkyl halide (usually bromide or chloride). This alkyl
halide reacts with magnesium metal to form the Grignard reagent.
Grignard reagents react like carbanions. When predicting products of Grignard reactions,
you may want to cross off the MgX portion of the Grignard reagent and make it an anionic
carbon, as shown in Figure 11-2, to make the reactivity clearer.
The next step is to react the Grignard reagent with a carbonyl (C=O) compound. Because
Grignard reagents act like disguised carbanions, you can draw the Grignard reagent acting
as a nucleophile by attacking the carbonyl carbon and pushing the C=O double bond onto
the oxygen as a lone pair. This leads to a negatively charged oxygen, which is protonated in
the final step by shaking the reaction with dilute acid to yield the alcohol product.
Reactions of Grignard reagents with ketones yield tertiary alcohol products (the OH group
on a tertiary, thrice-substituted carbon). With aldehydes, they yield secondary alcohols (an
OH group attached to a twice-substituted carbon). Reactions with formaldehyde (H2C=O)
yield primary alcohols (OH group on a monosubstituted carbon).

Transforming Alcohols (without 
Committing a Party Foul)
The alcohol functional group has some amazing transformational powers — besides turning
your usually shy roommate into a die-hard disco enthusiast. Reactions can easily convert
alcohols into other functional groups, including ethers and carbonyl compounds. This trans-
formational power makes alcohols a versatile and important functional group for performing
the synthesis of useful molecules.
One of the most important functional group transformations of alcohols is their oxidation to
carbonyl (C=O) compounds using oxidizing agents. You should know two oxidizing agents:
 PCC (short for pyridinium chlorochromate) converts alcohols into carbonyl (C=O) com-
pounds. PCC is milder; it oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes.
 Jones’ reagent (CrO3, H2SO4) and other oxidizing agents (in some textbooks you see
Na2Cr2O7 or KmnO4, which accomplish the same transformation as Jones’ reagent) 
oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.
Secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones with all the oxidizing agents.
Tertiary alcohols can’t be oxidized.
Figure 11-3 compares these two oxidizing agents.
Another important reaction of alcohols is the Williamson ether synthesis, which converts
alcohols (R-OH group) into ether functional groups (R-O-R). This reaction works by first turn-
ing the weakly nucleophilic alcohol (OH) group into a strong nucleophile by deprotonating it
to make an alkoxide (negatively charged oxygen). This deprotonation is accomplished using
sodium metal (Na) or sodium hydride (NaH). In both cases, hydrogen gas is the byproduct of
the deprotonation reaction (meaning you have to careful with these reactions in real life or
you’ll have an explosion on your hands). In the next step, a primary alkyl halide is added to
the solution and undergoes an SN2 substitution reaction to give the ether product.

One requirement of Williamson ether synthesis is that the alkyl halide be primary, meaning
that the halide has to be attached to a primary carbon (a primary carbon is a carbon
attached to only one other carbon). This requirement exists because SN2 substitutions work
best with primary alkyl halides. See Figure 11-4.

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
4,5-diethyl-3-methyl-2-octanol. First, number the longest chain containing the alcohol, starting
with the end that reaches the hydroxyl group sooner. This gives you an eight-carbon parent
chain with the hydroxyl group at the 2 carbon, so the parent name is 2-octanol.
Next, name the substituents. Ethyl groups are at the 4 and 5 carbons (which you cluster
together to make a diethyl), and a methyl group is at the 3 carbon. Placing the substituents
alphabetically gives you 4,5-diethyl-3-methyl-2-octanol.
b
3-t-butyl-2-cyclopropyl-1-cyclopentanol. The five-membered ring is the parent group because it
contains the hydroxyl group. Number the ring, giving the hydroxyl group number 1 and giving
the next substituent the lower number (in this case, number in a clockwise fashion).
Thus, the parent name is 1-cyclopentanol (you can omit the 1 if you like because it’s assumed
to be at the 1 position). Next, name the substituents. You have a cyclopropyl substituent at
carbon 2 and a t-butyl substituent at carbon 3. Placing the substituents alphabetically in front
of the parent name gives you 3-t-butyl-2-cyclopropyl-1-cyclopentanol. Recall that you alphabet-
ize t-butyl under b (because you ignore tert, or t), but you alphabetize cyclopropyl under c.
c
R-3-methyl-2-butanol. Numbering the longest chain of carbons gives you a four-carbon chain
with the hydroxyl group at the 2 carbon. The parent name is 2-butanol.

The only substituent is a methyl at carbon 3. Of course, you can’t forget the stereochemistry
(see Chapter 7 for a refresher). To assign the R/S designation of carbon 2, you first prioritize the
groups. First priority goes to the OH group because O has a higher atomic number than C. The
right carbon gets second priority because this carbon is attached to two other carbons (the 
left carbon is attached only to hydrogens). The left carbon gets third priority, and hydrogen (of
course) is fourth priority. Because the hydrogen is in the back, you can draw a curve from first-
to second- to third-priority substituents. Because the curves are clockwise, the configuration is
R. Thus, the total name is R-3-methyl-2-butanol (or 2R-3-methyl-2-butanol).
d
2R-1,2-hexanediol. This molecule has two hydroxyl groups and is therefore considered a
diol. Numbering the parent chain to give the lower number to the hydroxyl groups gives you
the following:
Because the chain is six carbons long, the hydroxyl groups come at carbons 1 and 2; the
parent name is thus 1,2-hexanediol.
Next, determine the stereochemistry. Prioritizing the substituents and drawing the curve
yields R stereochemistry for the chiral center because the curve goes clockwise (the fourth-
priority substituent is in the back, so you don’t need to rotate the molecule).
The name is therefore 2R-1,2-hexanediol (or simply R-1,2-hexanediol, because there’s only
one chiral center).

Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a weaker reducing agent than lithium aluminum hydride
(LiAlH4). This reagent can reduce ketones and aldehydes to alcohols, but it’s not strong
enough to reduce more-difficult carbonyl compounds such as esters or carboxylic acids.
Thus, in this molecule, the NaBH4 can only reduce the ketone to the alcohol, leaving the ester
untouched.

Addition of magnesium (in ether solvent) forms a Grignard reagent. In the second step, the

Williamson ether synthesis reactions work only when you react an alkoxide (deprotonated 
alcohol) with a primary halide (a halide attached to a primary carbon). When you react an
alkoxide with a secondary or tertiary halide, you get an E2 elimination instead (see Chapter 10)
because alkoxides are good bases in addition to being good nucleophiles.
Another way to make the compound is to try the reverse reaction. Take the tertiary alcohol
and form the alkoxide and then react the alkoxide with a primary halide to produce the ether.

 Working back to the starting materials of a Diels-Alder reaction
I
solated functional groups each have a unique set of reactions, and the chapters on
alkenes (Chapter 8), alkynes (Chapter 9), and alcohols (Chapter 11) cover these for some
important functional groups. But sometimes when you put two functional groups next to
each other, you get different reactivity entirely than when the functional group is by itself.
That’s the case with conjugated dienes, or alternating double bonds (two double bonds sepa-
rated by a single carbon-carbon bond). Some very important reactions that don’t occur
with isolated double bonds — or double bonds separated by more than one single bond —
occur with molecules containing conjugated double bonds. In this chapter, you see two
interesting reactions of conjugated dienes:
 The addition of hydrohalic acids (such as HBr and HCl) to conjugated dienes: This
reaction is similar to the reactions of isolated alkenes (Chapter 8) — but with a bit of a
twist, now that two double bonds are involved.
 The Diels-Alder reaction: This reaction is a most interesting and unusual reaction, 
and it’s one of the most powerful reactions you see in organic chemistry for forming
carbon-carbon bonds.
This chapter provides you plenty of help in getting you up to speed on working with both of
these reactions.
Seeing 1,2- and 1,4-Addition Reactions 
to Conjugated Dienes
One type of reaction of conjugated dienes is the addition of hydrohalic acids. Adding HBr (or
HCl) to a conjugated diene leads to one of two products:
 The 1,2-addition product: Hydrogen adds to the first carbon, and the halide adds to
the second carbon.

 The 1,4-addition product: Hydrogen adds to the first carbon, and the halide adds to
the fourth carbon.
Figure 12-1 shows examples of these two reactions.
To draw the mechanism of this addition reaction, follow these steps:
1. Protonate one of the double bonds.
After you protonate the double bond by taking the electrons from the double bond to
form a new bond to hydrogen (from the acid H-X), a positive charge forms on one of
the carbons, creating a carbocation intermediate. The positive charge prefers to reside
on the carbon closer to the other double bond so resonance can stabilize the charge
(see Chapter 3 to brush up on resonance structures). Thus, the hydrogen goes on the 
1 carbon, and the positive charge goes on the 2 carbon.
2. Add the halide.
• To obtain the 1,2-addition product: The halide adds to the carbocation formed
on carbon 2 to yield the 1,2-addition product. This is the usual product you see
from the reaction of isolated alkenes (Chapter 8).
• To obtain the 1,4-addition product: Draw the resonance structure for the carbo-
cation by moving the double bond toward the cation, which reforms the double
bond and moves the charge onto the number 4 carbon. The halide then attacks
the carbocation to yield the 1,4-addition product. You don’t see this product in
reactions of isolated alkenes.
Often, one of these products, called the thermodynamic product, is lower in energy. The other,
called the kinetic product, forms more quickly as a result of having to climb a smaller barrier,
or energy hill, to get to the product. In such cases, you can change the product distributions
by altering the reaction temperature:

Part III: Functional Groups and Their Reactions 

 To obtain a kinetic product, lower the reaction temperature so that the reaction has
only enough energy to go over small energy hills.
 To obtain the thermodynamic product, heat the reaction so it has enough energy to go
over large hills. At equilibrium, the thermodynamic product is favored because it’s
lower in energy.
Very generally speaking, 1,4-additions tend to yield the thermodynamic product (lower
energy) and 1,2-additions yield the kinetic product (faster forming product with the lower
energy barrier to formation). Thus, in most cases, you lower the temp to obtain a 1,2-addi-
tion product and raise the temp to obtain a 1,4-addition product.
A useful way of visualizing the energetics of the 1,2- and 1,4-addition reactions is through a
reaction coordinate diagram, a plot of the reaction progress versus the energy. In Figure 12-2,
the first step in this reaction is the same for both the 1,2- and 1,4-addition reactions, and it
yields the carbocation intermediate. Because two resonance structures describe a single
intermediate ion, going from one resonance structure to another isn’t a reaction but merely 
a way of showing that in the actual structure, half the charge resides on carbon 2 and half is
on carbon 4 (the actual molecule looks like an average of all the resonance structures). In the
second step, the reaction with the lower barrier leads to the kinetic product, whereas the
product that yields a lower-energy product is the thermodynamic product.

Q.
Draw the two products of the following reaction. Then draw the mechanism leading to those
two products. Finally, state which product will likely be the kinetic product and which will
likely be the thermodynamic product.
A.
The first step is to protonate one of the double bonds. Both of the double bonds are identi-
cal, so which one you choose doesn’t really matter. Protonation places a carbocation on the
number 2 carbon (the carbon you protonate is considered the 1 carbon).
At this point, one of two things can happen. The first is that the bromide can attack the 
carbocation to give the 1,2-addition product. Alternatively, you can draw a resonance struc-
ture by moving over the adjacent double bond to reform the carbocation on the primary
(number 4) carbon. Attack at this position by bromide yields the 1,4-addition product.
Generally, you predict 1,2-addition products to be kinetic and 1,4-addition products to be
thermodynamic.

Q.
Why might the 1,4-addition product from
the previous example be more stable
than the 1,2-addition product? That is,
why is it the thermodynamic product?
A.
Attaching substituents stabilizes double
bonds. Often, 1,4-additions yield double
bonds that are more highly substituted
than 1,2-additions (more R groups are
attached to them). More highly substi-
tuted double bonds are more stable than
less-substituted double bonds, so 1,4-
additions tend to yield more stable
alkenes than 1,2-addition reactions. In
the first example, the 1,4-addition prod-
uct double bond is disubstituted,
whereas the 1,2-addition product is
monosubstituted. As a result, the 1,4-
addition product is more stable than the
1,2-addition product, so the 1,4-addition
product is the thermodynamic product.

Dienes and Their Lovers: Working Forward 
in the Diels-Alder Reaction
The Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most interesting reactions in organic chemistry, but it’s
also somewhat difficult to visualize initially. In this reaction, a conjugated diene (a molecule
with two alternating double bonds) reacts with a dienophile (a “diene-lover” — an alkene,
with one double bond). Two new bonds form simultaneously in this reaction, and the result
is a six-membered ring. See Figure 12-3 for an example.

To work these types of problems, follow these steps:
1. Orient the diene and the dienophile correctly.
Dienes should be in the s-cis orientation, with both double bonds sticking off the same
side of the bond connecting them (dienes in rings react quickly because they’re locked
in this s-cis conformation). The two double bonds should point toward the dienophile.
2. Number the diene and dienophile.
I generally begin at the top of the diene and go counterclockwise, numbering its first
four carbons. Thus, 1-2 and 3-4 are the double bonds, and 2-3 is a single bond. I continue
counterclockwise, labeling two carbons on the dienophile so that its double bond lies at
5-6. Numbering helps you keep track of all the atoms and provides a visual aid so you
can see where bonds form and break. It’s particularly crucial when the diene is in a ring.
3. Work the reaction by arrow-pushing.
Simultaneously make three arrows, starting by forming bonds between carbons 4-5 and
6-1 by moving the double bonds; also move the double bond at 1-2 between carbons
2-3. The result is new bonds between carbons 4-5 and 6-1 as well as a new double bond
between carbons 2-3. All the arrows should move in the same direction, either all clock-
wise or all counterclockwise.
4. Make sure you have the correct stereochemistry.
When you have two substituents on the dienophile, if the substituents have cis orienta-
tion on the double bond, they end up with cis orientation in the product; if they start
trans, they end trans in the product.
If the diene starts in a ring, you get a bicyclic product — a fused ring system that takes
some practice to draw correctly. In this case, any substituent on the dienophile prefers
to orient down relative to the bridge, giving you what’s called the endo product (in the
exo product, the substituent sticks up relative to the bridge). Figure 12-4 shows an
example. Here, when you have a substituent (X) on a dienophile, the down orientation
relative to the bridgehead is preferred to give the endo product.
One more note: Diels-Alder reactions work best when the dienophile is substituted with elec-
tron-withdrawing groups (such as CN, NO2, COR) and the diene is substituted with electron-
donating groups (such as OR, NH2, NR2, alkyl). Remember: Any substituent attached to the
diene by an atom with a lone pair will be electron-donating.

Part III: Functional Groups and Their Reactions 
Q.
Give the product of the following Diels-Alder reaction. Identify the diene and the dienophile.
A.
The diene is in s-cis orientation, and both double bonds are pointing toward the dienophile,
so the orientation is fine. Number the diene and dienophile. I recommend that you number
the four diene carbons 1 through 4 and then number the two dienophile carbons 5 and 6. To
work the reaction, take a deep breath and push the arrows. One double bond on the diene
attacks the dienophile, which in turn attacks the other side of the diene. Bonds form
between carbons 4-5 and 1-6, and a new double bond forms between carbons 2-3. As a
result, you make a six-membered ring. Now check the stereochemistry. Because the sub-
stituents (NO2 groups) on the dienophile started cis in the starting material, they have to be
cis in the product.

Q.
Give the product of the following Diels-Alder reaction.
A.
Things get a bit hairy when the diene is incorporated into a ring because you get a bicyclic
product. But these problems aren’t too hard if you take them stepwise. In this case, the
diene is pointing away from the dienophile, so orient the diene so that its two double bonds
point out toward the dienophile. Then number the diene and the dienophile. Push the
arrows (three of them) so that bonds form between carbons 4-5 and 6-1 and a new double
bond forms between 2-3. Finally, make sure you have the correct stereochemistry. The prod-
uct is a bicyclic ring, so the cyano (CN) substituent prefers to orient down from the bridge,
giving you the endo product.

Reverse Engineering: Working Backward 
in the Diels-Alder Reaction
One challenge of working with Diels-Alder reactions is working backward, or using retrosyn-
thesis, to show how a Diels-Alder reaction can make a given product. The tough bit is seeing
where the two pieces connected together to give the product, a problem that I like to solve
by using a simple numbering scheme.
The one foothold that you have when working backward in the Diels-Alder reaction is the
double bond in the product. From there, you can back out what the starting materials must
have been because the double bond ends up between the 2 and 3 carbons of the diene. In
order to work backward in the Diels-Alder reaction, follow these steps:
1. Number the carbons.
Number the product carbons from 1 through 6, starting by giving the double bond the
2-3 position.
2. Break the bonds in the reverse Diels-Alder reaction.
Break the bonds between 4-5 and 1-6, the two bonds formed in the Diels-Alder reaction.
3. Add the double bonds to the diene and dienophile.
The diene’s double bonds go between carbons 1-2 and 3-4, and in the dienophile, they
go between 5-6.
4. Check the stereochemistry of the dienophile.
If the substituents are trans in the product, the starting dienophile must’ve likewise
been trans; if they’re cis, they must’ve been cis.

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The first step in both the 1,2- and 1,4-addition reactions is the same, and the intermediate car-
bocation formed is the same. The step that’s different is the final step. In the 1,2-addition, the
barrier for addition is lower (making it the kinetic product), but the 1,4-addition yields a more
stable product (the thermodynamic product). In the reaction coordinate diagram, this is
shown by making a lower barrier, leading to the 1,2-addition product but making the energy
of the 1,4-addition product lower.
b
The kinetic product is favored at low temperatures because at low temperatures, less energy is
available for the reactants to jump over large energy barriers; products that have low barriers
for formation are therefore preferred. At high temperatures, the thermodynamic product is
favored because there’s enough energy to go over those barriers, and achieving equilibrium is
easier for the system. After the system reaches equilibrium, the lowest-energy product is
favored.

c
In such a reaction, the barrier leading to 1,4-addition is lower, and it also gives you a product
that’s lower in energy.
d
The 1,4-addition product is favored at both low temperatures and high temperatures if it’s
both the thermodynamic and kinetic product.
e
Because the diene and dienophile are lined up correctly, you number them and draw the
arrows. New bonds form between carbons 4-5 and 1-6, and the double bond moves between
carbons 2-3. Because the cyano groups started cis on the dienophile, they end up cis in the
product (you can draw them as both sticking up or both sticking down).
f
The diene starts out in a ring, so you get a bicyclic product. Still, you can perform the same
steps to determine the product — numbering the diene and the dienophile and pushing the
arrows. The stereochemistry is also important. When forming a bicyclic product, the endo
product is preferred, in which the dienophile substituent sticks down relative to the bridge.
Admittedly, getting used to drawing these bicyclic structures correctly takes some practice.

The diene here is drawn in the s-trans form (the double bonds stick off opposite sides of the connect-
ing bond. Thus, you need to rotate around the single bond to put the diene in the s-cis conformation,
from which all Diels-Alder reactions occur. Numbering and arrow-pushing then leads to the product.
i
Substituents that have an adjacent lone pair are generally considered donating groups; thus, the
dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) and methoxy (OCH3) groups are donating. Alkyl groups such as CH3 are also
considered electron-donating. Conversely, groups such as CN, NO2, and carbonyl (C=O) compounds
are considered electron-withdrawing.
j
Diels-Alder reactions work best when the dienophile is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups.
The nitro group (NO2) is an electron-withdrawing group, so the dienophile with this group as two of
its substituents is the best. The methoxy (OCH3) group is an electron-donating group, so this
dienophile is the least reactive.

The first diene isn’t conjugated (with alternating double bonds), so it can’t react as a diene in
the Diels-Alder reaction. The second diene in the fused rings is locked in the s-trans conforma-
tion, so it can’t react, either (the Diels-Alder reaction requires the diene to be in the s-cis confor-
mation). The third one is in the s-trans conformation and can’t be rotated to the s-cis
conformation because the two methyl groups would be sticking in the same space (steric
strain). The final structure can react because it’s a conjugated diene locked in the preferred s-cis
conformation.
l
Dienes that are in rings are generally more reactive than their non-cyclic counterparts because
these dienes are locked into the s-cis conformation. Moreover, the most reactive dienes are sub-
stituted with electron-donating groups, such as the methoxy (OCH3) group. Thus, the most
reactive diene is the one locked in the ring that also contains the electron-donating group.
Dienes that can’t easily rotate into the s-cis conformation — such as the second diene, in which
two methyl groups suffer from steric strain (trying to share the same space) in the s-cis confor-
mation — are generally unreactive.
m
The first step is to number the carbons, making sure numbers 2-3 are the double-bond carbons.
Then make the breaks between carbons 1-6 and 4-5. In the starting material, the double bonds
start between carbons 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6. Additionally, because the substituents are trans in the
product, the starting dienophile must’ve likewise been trans.

Number the carbons, making sure carbons 2-3 are between the double bond. Then make the
disconnections at 1-6 and 4-5, putting the double bonds in the dienophile between carbons
1-2 and 3-4 and between 5-6 in the dieneophile. Because the cyano (CN) substituents are both
down in the product (cis), the starting material must’ve likewise been cis.

the appropriate starting materials.

The difficult part of this problem is simply seeing the product molecule drawn in a different ori-
entation. However, you can tackle this problem in normal fashion by giving the numbers 2-3 to
the double bond and making the disconnects at carbons 1-6 and 4-5. Placing the double bonds
in their original positions between carbons 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 gives the starting materials.

ne of the most unusual features of organic compounds is that they can form stable ring
systems, a feature that’s relatively uncommon with elements other than carbon.
Interestingly, experimental observation has shown that some rings with alternating double
bonds are exceptionally stable, whereas other rings are exceptionally unstable.
Those that are exceptionally stable are called aromatic compounds, the name referring to the
first isolated stable ring systems, which had a pungent odor. The aromatic compounds make
up the backbone of a lot of pharmaceuticals, perfumes, polymers, and plastics, to name just a
few practical applications. (In fact, organic chemistry research only really started in earnest
in the mid 19th century after William Perkin fortuitously discovered that he could make a for-
tune manufacturing the dye mauve, a brilliantly colored organic compound that contains an
aromatic ring.) Exceptionally unstable ring systems are called, naturally, anti-aromatic.
This chapter gives you practice working with ring systems. First, you see how to determine
whether ring systems are aromatic, anti-aromatic, or nonaromatic. You then see how making
molecular orbital (MO) diagrams of these ring compounds can be a helpful tool in explain-
ing the stability of aromatic ring systems and the instability of anti-aromatic ring systems.
Then you get to the meat and potatoes of aromatic chemistry — the reactions. After you
see the individual reactions, you string together everything you know about the reactivity
of aromatic compounds to perform multistep synthesis of polysubstituted aromatic
compounds.

Determining Aromaticity, Anti-aromaticity, or
Nonaromaticity of Rings
Being able to predict which ring systems will be stable (and aromatic) and which will be
unstable (and anti-aromatic) is an important part of orgo. For a molecule to be stable and
aromatic, it needs to adhere to these four rules:
 It has to be a ring.
 It has to be planar (flat).
 Each atom of the ring needs to have a p orbital that’s at a right angle to the plane of the
ring. In other words, no atom on the ring can be sp3 hybridized. (See Chapter 1 for
more on hybridization.)
 The ring needs a Hückel number of pi electrons, following the 4n + 2 rule (a pi electron is
an electron occupying an orbital made from the side-by-side overlap of p orbitals). That
is, if you set 4n + 2 equal to the number of pi electrons in the ring, n must be an integer.
If n isn’t, the ring system has a non-Hückel number of electrons.
If the ring has a heteroatom (such as O, S, or N), you have to determine which lone
pairs are part of the pi system. First draw in any of the lone pairs on the heteroatoms,
and then follow these guidelines:
• If the heteroatom is part of a double bond, it can’t contribute its lone pairs to the
pi system.
• If the heteroatom is connected to the ring with only single bonds, one of the lone
pairs (but only one) goes into the pi system.
Thus, no heteroatom can contribute more than two electrons to the pi system.
If the ring meets the first three criteria but has a non-Hückel number of pi electrons following
the equation 4n, then the ring is considered anti-aromatic. However, if the molecule doesn’t
meet the first three criteria, the ring is simply nonaromatic — it’s neither exceptionally stable
nor unstable.

Q.

system is aromatic, anti-aromatic, or
nonaromatic.
A.
Aromatic. The molecule is a ring, is
flat (you usually assume that any ring
system with no sp3 atoms is flat), has all
sp2-hybridized carbons, and has six pi
electrons (two from each double bond).
Six pi electrons is a Huckel number of
electrons following 4n + 2 (where n = 1),
so this molecule meets all four criteria
and is therefore aromatic.

Q.
Determine whether the following ring
system is aromatic, anti-aromatic, or
nonaromatic.
A.
Aromatic. Rings with heteroatoms are
somewhat trickier, but you can still
determine whether they’re aromatic in
the same fashion. The first thing I recom-
mend you do is draw in any of the lone-
pairs on the heteroatoms, nitrogen and
oxygen.
Now go through the four criteria: Must
be a ring? Check! Is the ring planar? You
may think the oxygen is sp3 hybridized
because this atom is attached to four dif-
ferent substituents (lone pairs count as
substituents). However, the oxygen is
actually sp2 hybridized. The rule for
counting substituents to determine atom
hybridization (Chapter 1) breaks down
N
O
N
O
when an atom with a lone pair is adjacent
to a double or triple bond. In these
cases, the atom rehybridizes from sp3 to
sp2 to place one of the lone pairs in a p
orbital. Doing so places the lone pair in
conjugation (resonance) with the adja-
cent double or triple bond, which is a sta-
bilizing interaction. Thus, all the atoms in
this ring are actually sp2 hybridized, so
you can assume that the ring is planar
(flat) and that each atom of the ring has a
p orbital that’s orthogonal to the plane of
the ring. Check off the next two criteria.
Does the molecule have a Hückel number
of pi electrons? This is the tricky part
because you have to determine which
lone pairs are in the pi system. In this
case, the nitrogen is part of a double
bond, so the lone pair on the nitrogen
isn’t a part of the pi system. The oxygen is
connected with single bonds, so one of its
lone pairs is in the pi system. Thus, the
total number of pi electrons in the mole-
cule is six — four pi electrons come from
the double bonds (two electrons from
each) and two come from the lone pair on
oxygen. Six pi electrons is a Hückel
number following the 4n + 2 rule (where
n = 1), so this molecule is aromatic.

Figuring Out a Ring System’s MO Diagram
Perhaps the easiest way to see why aromatic ring systems are so stable and why anti-aromatic
ring systems are so unstable is to look at their molecular orbital (MO) diagrams. An MO dia-
gram depicts the molecular orbitals of the pi electrons, their electron occupation, and the
relative energies of those orbitals.
To generate the MO diagram of a single ring system, follow these steps:
1. Place the ring point-down inside a circle.
Any place where the points of the ring touch the circle represents an MO at that energy
level; therefore, the point of the ring touching the bottom of the circle would be the
lowest-energy MO. This shortcut for quickly determining the number and energy levels
of the MOs in a ring is called a Frost circle. You can use Frost circles for all single-ring
systems with alternating double bonds around the ring.
2. Redraw those diagrams to the right of the circle to make viewing the MO diagram
clearer.
3. Fill the orbitals by placing the electrons in the lowest-energy MO and building up.
You do this just like you build the atomic electron configuration using the Aufbau prin-
ciple, making sure to follow Hund’s rule (see Chapter 1).

A.
Because benzene has six pi electrons

pletely filled with electrons — a very
stable electron configuration.
Q.
Generate the MO diagram of the pi
orbitals of 1,3-cyclobutadiene.
A.
Start making the Frost circle by placing
the four-membered ring point-down in
the circle. Wherever the points of the ring
touch the circle, you place an MO. Then
fill the MOs with electrons. 1,3-cyclobuta-
diene has four pi electrons, so you start
by filling the lowest-energy MO with two
electrons. The next two electrons split
up, with one going into each of the degen-
erate orbitals (following Hund’s rule), and
these electrons get the same spin. These
incompletely filled MOs are characteristic
of anti-aromatic rings. Because of these
incompletely filled orbitals, anti-aromatic
rings are quite unstable.

Dealing with Directors: Reactions 
of Aromatic Compounds
Here you practice some of the basic reactions of aromatic compounds. Perhaps the most
important reaction type, called electrophilic aromatic substitution, replaces a hydrogen on
benzene with an electrophile (a Lewis acid, which can accept a lone pair of electrons — see
Chapter 4). These reactions become more interesting when the benzene ring is already sub-
stituted because then you can make three different possible products by adding another
group. See Figure 13-1.

Chapter 13: The Power of the Ring: Aromatic Compounds

The nature of the substituent attached to the benzene ring determines where any incoming elec-
trophiles add, of which there are two types. Here’s a shortcut for remembering which is which:
 Ortho-para directors: These substituents direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho
and para positions of the ring, so you get a mixture of two products. Any substituent
whose first atom attached to the ring has a lone pair of electrons is an ortho-para
directing substituent. These substituents (in addition to alkyl groups and aromatic ring
substituents) make up the vast majority of ortho-para directors.
 Meta directors: These substituents direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position. If
the substituent doesn’t have a lone pair on the first atom and isn’t an alkyl group or an
aryl group, you may strongly suspect that the substituent is a meta director. Generally,
meta directors are considered to be electron-withdrawing substituents (such as CN, NO2,
and COR).
Figure 13-2 shows the generic electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. In this reaction, a
double bond from the benzene ring attacks the powerful electrophile (abbreviated E+) to give
you an intermediate carbocation. A base then pulls off the adjacent proton to produce the
substituted benzene. Because powerful electrophiles (E+) are unstable and can’t be stored in
a jar, they have to be made in the reaction mixture on the fly (in situ) by mixing together dif-
ferent reagents. For example, to brominate a ring, you mix bromine (Br2) and iron tribromide
(FeBr3) in benzene. These reagents generate the unstable Br+ electrophile in solution, which
then adds to the ring to give the substituted product. Memorize these reagents for preparing
the different electrophiles.

Order! Tackling Multistep Synthesis of
Polysubstituted Aromatic Compounds
Making complex aromatic compounds using a multistep synthesis is actually fun. Of crucial
importance is the order in which you add the substituents because these groups need to be
added in such a way that the first group added directs subsequent additions to the correct
location on the ring.
To solve these types of problems, keep these steps in mind:
1. Look at the product and determine whether each of the substituents is ortho-para
directing or meta directing.
See the preceding section for details.
2. Note the location of the substituents in the product.
Determine whether they’re ortho (on adjacent carbons), meta (separated by one
carbon), or para (separated by two carbons).
3. Add the substituents in logical order.
The first substituent should direct placement of the second substituent, and the first
and second together should direct placement of the third (if needed). Thus, if the prod-
uct is a para-disubstituted ring and one of the substituents is ortho-para directing and

Although this seems like a real boondog-
gle, it just means that at some point in
the synthesis, one of the groups had to
have been an ortho-para director to get
the second substituent in the right loca-
tion. Carboxylic acids on benzene rings
are made by oxidation of alkyl groups
attached to the aromatic ring. Because
alkyl groups are ortho-para directors, the
correct sequence is to first alkylate the
benzene ring and then use the ortho-para
directing ability of the alkyl group to put
nitrate in the para position. Finally, oxi-
dize the alkyl group to the carboxylic acid
using potassium permanganate (KMnO4).

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
Anti-aromatic. The molecule is a ring, and you can assume that it’s planar because all atoms in
the ring are sp2-hybridized. It has four pi electrons (two from each double bond). This number
isn’t a Hückel number of pi electrons following the 4n + 2 rule because n isn’t an integer (4n + 2 =
4; n = 0.5). Rather, it follows the 4n rule (where n = 1). Because the molecule obeys the first three
rules but has a non-Hückel number of electrons, you predict that it’s anti-aromatic.
b
Anti-aromatic. This molecule is cyclic and flat because all atoms are sp2-hybridized (the carbo-
cation carbon is sp2-hybridized because the carbon is attached to three other atoms). Because
every atom is sp2-hybridized, you can assume that the ring is planar. The ring has four pi elec-
trons, or two pi electrons per double bond. However, four isn’t a Hückel number of pi electrons
(4n + 2 = 4; n = 0.5). Instead, it follows the non-Hückel (4n) number of pi electrons, making this
molecule anti-aromatic.
c
Aromatic. Anytime you have heteroatom in a ring (such as nitrogen or oxygen), draw out all
the lone pairs so you can more easily figure out how many pi electrons are there.
All the atoms are sp2 hybridized. The nitrogen with the methyl substituent rehybridizes to sp2
because this atom has a lone pair adjacent to a double bond. Because all the atoms in the ring
are sp2-hybridized, you expect the molecule to be planar. Next, count the number of pi elec-
trons. Four pi electrons result from the two double bonds. The nitrogen included in the double
bond can’t put its lone pair into the pi system, but the nitrogen that isn’t included in a double
bond can. Thus, the molecule has six pi electrons. This is a Hückel number following the 4n + 2
rule (where n = 1), so expect the molecule to be aromatic.
d
Aromatic. The carbocation carbon is sp2 hybridized (because the carbon has only three attach-
ments). Thus, all the atoms in the ring are sp2 hybridized, and you can expect the ring to be
planar and fully conjugated. The molecule has only two pi electrons, but this is a Hückel
number of pi electrons (4n + 2 = 2, where n = 0). Thus, this molecule is likely aromatic.
e
Aromatic. All the carbons are sp2 (the cationic carbon has only three attachments), so you can
assume that the ring is flat. The molecule has six pi electrons, a Hückel number (where n = 1),
so predict the ring to be aromatic.

Nonaromatic. This ring has an sp3-hybridized carbon. Thus, the ring is a nonaromatic system.
g
Anti-aromatic. This molecule has every carbon sp2 hybridized, so you presume it’s flat. It has
eight pi electrons, a non-Hückel (4n) number. Thus, the molecule is likely anti-aromatic. (As an
aside, it turns out experimentally that this molecule puckers out of planarity into a tub-shaped
ring to avoid the instability of being anti-aromatic, but the prediction, at least, is that this mole-
cule would be anti-aromatic if it were planar.)
h
The [10]-annulene molecule has two trans double bonds in the ring. If you draw out the hydro-
gens, you see that in a planar geometry, they’re trying to occupy the same space. To avoid this
steric hindrance, the molecule twists and breaks the planarity. Because planarity is a require-
ment for aromaticity, the molecule is nonaromatic. On the other hand, naphthalene has a fused
ring junction that forces the rings to be flat and is therefore aromatic.
i
Anti-aromatic. Here, you have four pi electrons. Adding them to the MOs generated from the
Frost circle and following Hund’s rule gives you two unfilled orbitals. This electron configura-
tion indicates an anti-aromatic ring system.
j
Aromatic. Here, you have six pi electrons (four from the two double bonds and two from the
lone pair). Adding these to the MOs shows that all the low-energy orbitals are completely filled
with electrons, a configuration that indicates an aromatic ring system.

Aromatic. In this three-membered ring system, you have two pi electrons. Making the Frost circle and
filling the lowest-energy orbital with the two pi electrons results in an electron configuration that indi-
cates an aromatic ring system.
l
Anti-aromatic. The hardest part of this problem is drawing the eight-membered ring with the point
down in the Frost circle. After you do that, you get the MOs and can fill them with the eight pi elec-
trons, following Hund’s rule for placement of the last two electrons into the degenerate orbitals. The

The carbonyl (C=O) group attached to the benzene ring is a meta directing substituent. Therefore,
when you add the sulfonic acid (SO3H) group, it goes into the meta position.

The methyl group is ortho-para directing. Therefore, you get a mix of the ortho- and para-substituted
products.

Here, you have two possible benzene rings that can be nitrated. The one adjacent to the car-
bonyl (C=O) group is deactivated because carbonyls are electron-withdrawing, meta directing,
and deactivating. On the other hand, any atom that has a lone pair on the atom attached to
the aromatic ring is activating and is an ortho-para director (the one exception is the halides,
which are ortho-para directing but deactivating). Thus, the activated ring is the ring that gets
nitrated at the ortho and para positions.

The first part of the mechanism is formation of the electrophile, NO2
+. In the second step, the
ring attacks this powerful electrophile to generate an intermediate carbocation (called the
sigma adduct). Finally, a base such as water pulls off the ring proton to regenerate the aromatic
ring. I’ve shown para addition here, but a similar mechanism forms an ortho product.
r
The first step in the mechanism of the Friedel-Crafts acylation is formation of the carbocation
electrophile by reacting the acid chloride with the Lewis acid, AlCl3. In the next step, the ring
attacks the electrophile, forming the intermediate carbocation. Finally, the base plucks off the
proton to reform the aromatic ring.

The order of adding substituents is of primary importance. The substituents are located meta
to one another, so you want to add the meta director (COOH) first to direct the second sub-
stituent (Br) into the meta position. You can accomplish this by methylating the ring using
Friedel-Crafts alkylation and then oxidizing the methyl group to the carboxylic acid with potas-
sium permanganate (KMnO4). Finally, add the bromine with the bromine and FeBr3 catalyst.
u
The situation becomes more complex with three substituents because the first substituent you
add should direct the second to the correct place, but then both the first and second sub-
stituents influence where the third adds. Sometimes figuring out the correct order comes down
to trying different possibilities of adding substituents. Here, adding the bromine first and the
nitro group second sets up the last addition in the correct place. You get this result because the
nitro is meta directing and the bromine is ortho-para directing, both mutually directing where
you want the chlorine to go. Note: Other reasonable alternatives for ordering the addition of
the substituents may exist. Keep in mind that whenever you have a reaction that generates
both ortho and para products, it’s generally assumed that you can separate your desired ortho
or para product out from this mixture and continue with the synthesis.

This is a challenging problem because you have to get three substituents in the right spots on
the ring. If you add the alkyl group first (an ortho-para director), you can then add the sulfonic
acid group in the para position. After this, both substituents mutually direct the bromine into
the proper location (because the alkyl substituent is ortho-para directing and the sulfonic acid
group is meta directing).

n this part, you become a makeshift Sherlock Holmes
and see how to gather clues from the different spectro-
scopic analyses of organic compounds to deduce the
structure of organic molecules. Essentially, spectroscopy
measures molecules’ absorption of light, and the wave-
lengths of light that an unknown molecule absorbs give
you info about the molecule itself. In spectrometry, the
unknown molecule is smashed into wee little bits and then
weighed (sort of). The weights of the bits give you clues to
the nature of the substance.

 Identifying molecules and their fragments with mass spectrometry

M
ass spectrometry (or mass spec, as it’s called by the cool crowd) is a tool chemists
use to get clues about the identity of an unknown molecule. A mass spectrometer is an
instrument that essentially smashes up a molecule into little bits and then weighs each of
the bits. The plot of the weights of the fragments versus the abundance of those fragments
detected is called the mass spectrum. The way in which an unknown molecule fragments in
a mass spectrometer gives you clues about its structure.
This chapter covers the basics of working with mass spectrometry, from using mass spec for
distinguishing compounds to assigning peaks in the mass spectrum. In addition, you use
mass spectrometry to identify simple organic structures.
Identifying Fragments in the Mass Spectrum
One way of distinguishing one molecule from another is by seeing how the molecule falls
apart in a mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry ionizes molecules through collisions with
high-energy electrons to form radical cations. These radical cations usually fragment to give
you two pieces:
 A cation piece, which is observed in the mass spectrum
 A radical piece, which isn’t observed

The mass spectrum plots the mass-to-charge-ratio (m/z) of all the fragments versus their
intensity (abundance). However, because the fragments you talk about in an introductory
course have charges (z) of +1, most people speak of the m/z value as simply the mass (or
molecular weight [MW]) of the fragment.
Because the ionizing electrons are very high-energy electrons, the ionized molecules have
enough energy to break apart in many different ways, which is why you get so many peaks in
the mass spectrum. In general, though, fragmentations tend to occur in places that give the
most stable resulting carbocation, so the peaks with highest intensity usually correspond to
the weights (m/z) of cationic fragments that are the most stable. Thus, for mass spectrome-
try, being able to predict the relative stability of carbocations is important.
The M+ peak, or the molecular ion, is the peak that represents the molecular weight of the
molecule. To determine the structure of fragments that correspond to a given peak, find the
difference between the M+ weight and the weight of the peak under consideration; doing so
tells you the weight of the fragment that was lost. Here are the molecular weights of some
common fragments you should probably memorize:
Molecular Weight
Fragment
15 mass units
Methyl group (CH3)
29 mass units
Ethyl group (CH3CH2)
43 mass units
Propyl group (C3H7)
Suppose you have an M+ ion at m/z = 85 and the peak you’re interested in is at m/z = 70.
Subtract 70 from 85 to get 15 mass units. A methyl (CH3) group corresponds to 15 mass units,
so you’d expect that the structure of the fragment is the original structure minus a methyl
group. Note: Any fragment you draw representing a peak in the mass spectrum must be posi-
tively charged because mass specs don’t detect neutral fragments.
Aside from fragmentations of the cation radical that lead to a cation and radical fragment,
cation radicals can also undergo one rearrangement that you should know: the McLafferty
rearrangement (see Figure 14-2). This rearrangement occurs with carbonyl (C=O) com-
pounds that have a hydrogen on a gamma (γ) hydrogen, which is a hydrogen on the third
carbon away from the carbonyl group. In this rearrangement, the carbonyl abstracts the γ
hydrogen to yield an enol cation radical fragment that’s observed in the mass spec, plus a
neutral alkene that isn’t.

The base peak, the tallest peak in the spectrum, is at 43 m/z. The M+ peak is the 100 m/z
peak that represents the molecule’s molecular weight, representing a molecule that didn’t
fragment in the mass spec. A peak representing m/z = 85 corresponds to a fragment that has

lost 15 mass units — the weight of a methyl group (CH3) — from the original molecule
(100 – 15). The most likely place to lose a methyl group is in a location that gives you a
secondary carbocation because secondary cations are more stable than primary cations
(you can’t get a tertiary cation from loss of a methyl group on this molecule). The peak at
m/z = 57 indicates a loss of a unit with a mass of 43 (100 – 57), which corresponds to loss of
a propyl (three-carbon) group. A peak of m/z = 43 corresponds to a three-carbon (propyl)
fragment.
Note: You may provide structures of fragments other than the ones shown with identical
weights, which is fine so long as the mass is correct and the fragment is positively charged.
For example, you can lose a methyl off the right-most side of the molecule to get a fragment
of m/z = 85. In general, though, the fragment that contributes most to a peak is the most
stable fragment, so you’d anticipate that this fragment wouldn’t contribute as much to the
peak at m/z = 85 as the one drawn.
Q.
Show the McLafferty rearrangement of the following ketone.
A.
The McLafferty rearrangement occurs for ketones that have a γ hydrogen. There’s only one γ
hydrogen, so this is where the rearrangement occurs. First redraw the molecule so that it
almost forms a six-membered ring. Then draw the rearrangement by showing the oxygen
abstracting the γ proton; those C-H electrons are moved to form a double bond. The neigh-
boring C-C bond is then broken and those electrons are used to form another bond with the
C=O carbon. This rearrangement yields an enol radical cation, observed in the mass spec,
and a neutral alkene fragment that isn’t observed.

Predicting a Structure Given a Mass Spectrum
Determining structures from a mass spec by itself is usually possible only for the simplest of
molecules. Still, these problems offer a great way to really hone your critical thinking skills
and sharpen your understanding of mass spec.
To predict a structure given its mass spectrum, follow these steps:
1. Identify any atoms that have common isotopes.
For example, bromine has two nearly equally abundant isotopes with 79Br and 81Br,
giving rise to M+ and M+2 peaks of nearly equal intensity. Chlorine has two isotopes,
35Cl and 37Cl, in roughly a 3:1 ratio, giving rise to M+ and M+2 peaks in roughly a 3:1
ratio. Iodine has a peak at 129 corresponding to the I+ fragment.
2. If there are any halogens, subtract the weight of this atom from the M+ ion to obtain
the weight of the rest of the molecule.
Memorize the weights of simple hydrocarbon fragments such as CH3 (15), CH2CH3 (29),
and C3H7 (43). If you reach an unknown weight, a common trick for determining how
many carbons are in a given weight is to divide by 14, the mass of a methylene (CH2)
unit. For example, say you have a mass of 43. You take 43 ÷ 14, which is approximately
equal to 3. Three carbons weigh 36 mass units (3 × 12), so the remaining 7 mass units
would be hydrogens, and you’d expect the formula of this 43 weight to correspond to a
C3H7 unit.
3. Create a list of all possible structures.
4. Use the process of elimination to determine the correct structure by looking for the
fragmentation pattern you’d expect for each molecule.
Look for which of the possible structures most closely matches what you’d predict the
actual spectrum to look like.

equally abundant isotopes of 79Br and 81Br. Taking the M+2 peak at m/z = 110 and subtracting
the mass of bromine (81) leaves 29 mass units, which you may have craftily memorized as the
weight of an ethyl (CH3CH2) group. Therefore, this molecule is bromoethane (CH3CH2Br).

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
Both 2-methylpentane and 3-methylpentane are isomers of each other, so they have the same
molecular weight. Therefore, you can’t distinguish between these molecules by comparing the
M+ ions because they’re identical (m/z = 86). But these molecules would break apart in different
ways. The first question you want to ask yourself, then, is the following: At what m/z values
(weights) you would expect the largest peaks from each the two compounds? In general, the
largest peaks arise from fragmentations that lead to the most stable resulting cations. In 
3-methylpentane, you’d expect the molecule to lose an ethyl group (29 mass units) because this
is the only fragmentation that leads to a secondary carbocation (all others would yield a less
stable primary cation). You’d anticipate this loss to lead to a large peak at m/z = 57. (You could
also lose an ethyl group on the left-hand side of the molecule.)
For 2-methylpentane, you’d expect two different fragmentations that would lead to secondary
carbocations. Loss of a methyl group (two ways to do this) would yield a secondary cation with
a molecular weight of 71 (86 – 15 mass units). Alternatively, loss of a propyl group would yield a
fragment with molecular weight of 43 (86 – 43 mass units).
Comparing the two spectra, you see that the top spectrum has a largest peak at m/z = 57, and
the bottom spectrum has the two largest peaks at m/z = 71 and m/z = 43. Thus, you can tell
Daniel that the top spectrum corresponds to 3-methylpentane and the bottom corresponds to
2-methylpentane.

When performing the McLafferty rearrangement, I recommend you label the α, β, and γ carbons
first; then add the γ hydrogen and arrange the carbons into a ring-like arrangement. Finally,
push the arrows as shown to give the McLafferty product.
c
On this compound, you have two γ carbons. However, only one of the γ carbons has an
attached hydrogen that can undergo the McLafferty rearrangement. Drawing the rearrangement
for this hydrogen gives the McLafferty product.
d
In problems such as this, look for the most likely breaks in the molecule. Because the molecule
is a ketone, the most obvious break is α cleavage. Additionally, you have the possibility of get-
ting a McLafferty rearrangement.
e
This molecule likely contains chlorine. Chlorine has two abundant isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl, in
about a 3:1 ratio. Thus, roughly 1⁄4 of the chlorine-containing fragments that hit the detector in
the mass spec have the isotope of chlorine that’s 2 mass units heavier, giving rise to this heav-
ier isotope peak.
f
This molecule likely contains bromine. Bromine has two abundant isotopes, 79Br and 81Br, in
nearly equal abundance. Thus, half the fragments that hit the detector in the mass spec that
contain bromine have the heavier isotope.

g
Molecules tend to fragment to give the most stable cation. For molecules that contain aromatic
rings (see Chapter 13), cleavage tends to occur in the benzylic position so as to make a 
resonance-stabilized benzylic cation (C6H5-CH2
+). Thus, for propylbenzene, you’d expect a large
peak corresponding to loss of an ethyl group (29 mass units) to give a peak at 91 (120 – 29) for a
benzylic cation. For isopropyl benzene, you’d expect to lose a methyl group (15 mass units) to
give the stabilized benzyl cation, with a peak at 105 (120 – 15). The top spectrum thus corre-
sponds to propylbenzene, and the bottom spectrum, to isopropylbenzene.
h
To determine how many carbons are in the molecular formula, divide by 14, the mass of a CH2
unit. In this case, 100 ÷ 14 is about 7, so a first guess is a molecule that has 7 carbons. Seven
carbons have a mass of 84 (12 × 7), leaving 16 mass units remaining for hydrogens. Therefore, a
tentative formula is C7H16.
i
The first thing to notice is that this mass spec shows an M+2 peak that’s roughly 1⁄3 as large
as the M+ peak. This indicates a chlorine atom, which has two isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl, in a 3:1
ratio. Thus, you subtract the weight of chlorine (35) from the M+ peak (78) to get 43, the weight
of the remainder of the molecule. This, as you’ve likely memorized by now, is the weight of a
C3H7 unit. So draw out all possible structures, of which there are two — 2-chloropropane and 
1-chloropropane. How would you distinguish between the two? Both could lose a methyl group
(15 mass units) to give a peak at 63, but only 1-chloropropane would show a peak for an ethyl
fragment (CH3CH2
+) from loss of a CH2Cl group at 29 mass units. This spectrum has no such
peak, so you’d expect it to correspond to 2-chloropropane, which is indeed the case.
j
Both mass spectra show M+ ions at m/z = 58, suggesting that the two molecules are isomers
of each other. Estella provided one clue — that the two molecules contain a carbonyl (C=O)
group. If you subtract the weight of a C=O group (12 + 16 = 28) from the molecular weight of 58,
you get 30 remaining. A good rule of thumb to determine the number of carbons in a fragment
in the mass spec is to divide by 14, the weight of a methylene (CH2) unit. Doing so with 30 gives
you 2 and some change, suggesting two additional carbons in the molecule. The weight of two
carbons is 24, leaving 6 mass units that you assign to hydrogens. Thus, in addition to the C=O
group, both molecules also have an extra C2H6 as well. Conveniently, that gives you two possi-
bilities for the two structures.
Now, to determine which is which: You’d expect the ketone on the left (acetone) to have a large
peak corresponding to loss of a methyl group (15 mass units) from the α cleavage (to give
you a peak at m/z = 43). On the other hand, you’d expect the aldehyde on the right to have a
large peak corresponding to loss of an ethyl group (29 mass units) from α cleavage (to give
you a peak with m/z = 29). The top spectrum has a large peak at m/z = 43, which fits the bill
for the ketone on the left, and the bottom spectrum has a large peak at m/z = 29, which matches
the aldehyde on the right.

 Differentiating between molecules using IR spectroscopy
 Eyeing functional groups in an IR spectrum
I
nfrared (IR) spectroscopy is one of the most common tools organic chemists use to
deduce the structure of unknown compounds. This instrumental method is particularly
useful for determining which functional groups are present.
The quick ’n’ dirty version of how IR spectroscopy works is that infrared light is irradiated
onto a sample of an unknown compound. Different bond types (functional groups) in the
unknown molecule absorb different frequencies of the infrared light. For example, an O-H
bond absorbs infrared light of a different frequency than a C-H bond. The IR spectrometer
feeds this data into a computer that then plots the frequencies of the light that isn’t
absorbed by the sample (the transmittance of light) versus the amount of transmittance to
give the IR spectrum. It’s up to you, the chemist, to look at the spectrum and figure out which
functional groups are present in the unknown molecule.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on IR spectroscopy and helps you identify functional
groups in an IR spectrum.
Distinguishing between Molecules 
Using IR Spectroscopy
Before you can understand how to use IR spectroscopy to determine the functional groups in
an unknown molecule, you need to know a few strange conventions in IR spectroscopy. First,
the IR spectrum plots on its y axis the transmittance of light through a sample, not the
absorption of light by the molecule. Essentially, this has the effect of making the spectrum
look like it’s been turned upside down. In other words, the peaks look like stalactites hanging
down from the ceiling of the IR spectrum rather than your typical stalagmite variety of peaks
that you see in other self-respecting spectroscopies that plot absorbances. In spite of this
convention, peaks are referred to as absorbances, not transmittances! To add to the confu-
sion, the frequency of IR light is given in bizarre units, reciprocal centimeters (cm–1), often
referred to as wavenumbers.

One useful feature of IR spectroscopy is that it can distinguish between two molecules. For
example, in court cases involving drug possession, IR spectroscopy can distinguish between
a sample of cocaine and one of crack cocaine. On a more positive note, you can see whether
your reaction worked using IR spectroscopy. For instance, if you run a reaction that converts
an alcohol (OH) functional group into a ketone (C=O), IR spectroscopy shows the disappear-
ance of the O-H absorbance in the starting material and the growth of the C=O absorbance in
your product.
In order to distinguish between molecules using IR spectroscopy, you first need to know
where in the infrared spectrum different bond types absorb light. Table 15-1 lists the absorp-
tion locations of the common functional groups in organic molecules.

You may have glanced at an IR spectrum and thought, “Yikes, they want me to interpret
that?!” If you said that, here’s some good news: You can generally ignore two major regions in
the IR spectrum:
 The fingerprint region below 1,500 cm–1: This is generally a disgusting haystack of
peaks that are difficult to interpret and aren’t typically helpful for giving structural
information.
 From 2,800 cm–1 to 3,000 cm–1: This region is where saturated C-H absorptions show
up, and because virtually all organic molecules contain saturated C-H bonds, you
almost always see peaks in this region that aren’t particularly informative for figuring
out the structure of a molecule.
With those parts of the spectrum in the waste bin, you’re left looking for peaks between 1,500
cm–1 and 2,800 cm–1 and above 3,000 cm–1 on any IR spectrum. I recommend you draw a line
straight up from 3,000 cm–1 on your spectrum and note the following:
 Anything just to the left the line at higher wavenumbers is an unsaturated C-H bond;
this indicates a double bond or aromatic ring in your molecule.
 In alcohols, the hydroxyl (OH) group is easy to spot as a fat belly that hangs down to
the left of the saturated C-H stretches at around 3,400 cm–1.
 Carbonyl (C=O) peaks are also hard to miss as a large finger-like absorption that sticks
down around 1,700 cm–1.
Until you memorize the locations of the other functional group peaks, you can use Table 15-1
as a reference (you can find more-comprehensive tables in any good organic text).
The intensity of IR light absorption by a bond in a molecule depends on the dipole moment
of that bond (refer to Chapter 1). Bonds with large dipole moments (such as OH bonds) have
intense absorption. Without a dipole, the bond is IR inactive, and no peaks show up in the IR
spectrum for that bond.
279
Chapter 15: Cool Vibrations: IR Spectroscopy
Q.
How can you tell H-Cl apart from Cl-Cl
using IR spectroscopy?
A.
Although H-Cl has a bond dipole because
of the difference in the electronegativity
of the two atoms, you get no bond dipole
between two identical atoms, such as 
in Cl-Cl. Thus, H-Cl absorbs IR light, 
but Cl-Cl doesn’t, and this bond is IR
inactive (and shows no peaks in the IR
spectrum).

Q.
Match the two spectra to the shown alkynes.
A.
The top spectrum is 1-pentyne; the bottom is 2-pentyne. In this case, you’re comparing two
alkynes. The major difference between them is that one is a terminal alkyne (a triple bond is at
the end of the molecule) and one is an internal alkyne (an alkyne is in the middle of a mole-
cule). Thus, although they both have triple-bond alkyne stretches at about 2,200 cm–1, the ter-
minal alkyne should also have an alkyne C-H stretch to the left of the saturated C-H stretches
at around 3,300 cm–1. The top spectrum has this additional stretch, so it’s the terminal alkyne.

Identifying Functional Groups 
from an IR Spectrum
Being able to distinguish between two molecules using IR spectroscopy is important, but it’s
also important (if somewhat more difficult) to be able to look at a spectrum and determine
all the functional groups present in the unknown. This skill is important when you have no
idea of the molecule’s structure and want to determine it. IR spectroscopy allows you to
determine the functional groups present in an unknown molecule, and NMR spectroscopy
(Chapter 16) allows you to fill in the rest of the structure.
Draw a line at 3,000 cm–1. Peaks to the left of the line are considered significant.

A.
One alkene. Here, you’re on the hunt for all functional groups you can find (more than one
may be present). Draw a line at 3,000 cm–1. Doing this here gives one peak to the left of the
line at a wavenumber corresponding to an unsaturated C-H stretch (unsaturated means that
the hydrogen is attached to a double bond or aromatic ring carbon). Indeed, there’s a
double-bond stretch at ~1,640 cm–1.

Chapter 15: Cool Vibrations: IR Spectroscopy

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The difference between these two molecules is that one contains a C=O group and the other
contains just C-O single bonds. Carbonyls (C=O bonds) appear in the IR spectrum as large
distinct peaks that absorb at around 1,700 cm–1. Conversely, C-O single bonds absorb in the
fingerprint region at around 1,050 cm–1. Looking for the presence, or absence, of the C=O
signal allows you to distinguish between these compounds.
b
The top spectrum is propionic acid; the bottom spectrum is 2-propanol. Both of these com-
pounds contain an alcohol functional group, which have hydroxyl (O-H) groups. Hydroxyl groups
show up as broad bands above 3,000 cm–1 in the IR spectrum. For carboxylic acid (COOH)
hydroxyl groups, the OH peak is usually much broader still and overlaps with the saturated C-H
stretches. Additionally, the carboxylic acid spectrum contains a C=O stretch at around 1,700 cm–1.
Both the broad OH peak and the carbonyl peak of the top spectrum indicate a carboxylic acid,
but the bottom spectrum contains a peak only for an isolated OH group.
c
The top spectrum is propylamine; the bottom spectrum is diethylamine. Both compounds are
amines. Amine N-H protons absorb at 3,300–3,350 cm–1 in the IR spectrum. The difference
between these two amines is that propylamine is a primary amine (R-NH2, with the nitrogen
attached to only one R group), whereas diethylamine is a secondary amine (R2NH, where the
nitrogen is attached to two R groups). Primary amines give two peaks in the N-H region of the
spectrum (that together look like a cow udder), whereas secondary amines only give a single
absorption. The top spectrum has two NH peaks, and the bottom spectrum has just a single
absorption. Thus, the top spectrum is a primary amine, and the bottom is a secondary amine.
d
The top spectrum is butenone; the bottom spectrum is butanone. Here, both molecules have
carbonyl (C=O) groups. The difference is that butenone contains a C=C bond as well. This leads
to three differences in the spectrum of butenone. First, you should see a C=C stretch in the IR
spectrum at roughly 1,640 cm–1. Secondly, you should see unsaturated C-H bonds in the
butenone spectrum occurring at 3,000–3,200 cm–1. Lastly, conjugated C=O stretches (C=O
groups attached to double bonds or aromatic rings) are shifted to lower wavenumbers (often
just below 1,700 cm–1) than isolated C=O groups. All three of these features occur in the top
spectrum and not in the bottom one, so the top spectrum is butenone.
e
This molecule contains a carbonyl (C=O) group and is likely a ketone. The main standout
peak here is the carbonyl C=O stretch at about 1,715 cm–1. If you have a carbonyl, it could make
up four different functional groups — a carboxylic acid (COOH), a ketone (RCOR), an aldehyde
(RCHO), or an ester (RCOOR). So how do you distinguish among these? A carboxylic acid
would also have an OH stretch, which is absent here. An ester carbonyl stretch comes higher
than normal at 1,735–1,760 cm–1. So that leaves a ketone or aldehyde. Aldehydes have a hydro-
gen attached to the carbonyl, which absorbs at 2,800 cm–1. That stretch is absent here, so the
most likely alternative is a simple ketone (RCOR). Note that when you have a strong carbonyl
stretch, you often see “overtones” of that stretch at twice the wavenumber. Because carbonyl
groups have intense absorptions at about 1,700 cm–1, you often see small overtone bumps at
3,400 cm–1, as is the case here. Just ignore these artifact overtone peaks.
290
Part IV: Detective Work: Spectroscopy and Spectrometry 

f
This molecule contains a carboxylic acid (COOH) functional group. The two main peaks of
interest is the large OH absorption band from about 2,500–3,500 cm–1. When the OH band is
stretched out so far (often overlapping the C-H absorptions), this is a tip-off for a carboxylic
acid. Secondly, you see a large C=O band at 1,715 cm–1. These bands also tend to be fatter than
normal in a carboxylic acid.
g
This molecule contains an alcohol (OH) functional group. The main peak of interest is the
broad OH peak at 3,100–3,600 cm–1. Because this band doesn’t significantly overlap with the C-H
absorptions, it’s likely your run-of-the-mill OH absorption, not a carboxylic acid OH. No other
significant peaks are present in the spectrum.
h
This molecule contains an aromatic benzene ring. Drawing a line at 3,000 cm–1 shows unsatu-
rated C-H stretches just to the left. Additionally, the four peaks between 1,600–1,900 cm–1 are
indicative of an aromatic ring. Note: The number of peaks can change, depending on the substi-
tution of the aromatic ring.
i
This molecule is an alkane, with no significant functional groups. The only peaks in this mole-
cule are the absorptions in the fingerprint region (below 1,500 cm–1) and in the saturated C-H
region between 2,800–3,000 cm–1. Thus, this molecule is likely a saturated alkane with no func-
tional groups of interest.
j
This molecule contains an aromatic benzene ring and an alcohol (OH) functional group. This
spectrum contains three major peaks of interest. Most noticeable is the large OH stretch at
3,000–3,600 cm–1. Second is the series of four peaks between 1,700–2,000 cm–1, indicating an
aromatic benzene ring. Most subtle are the unsaturated C-H peaks at just about 3,000 cm–1,
belonging to the aromatic ring C-H absorptions.
k
This molecule contains a primary amide (RCONH2) functional group. You see two very large
peaks of interest here. The first is the enormous carbonyl C=O stretch at 1,690 cm–1. The second
is the two cow udder–like peaks at 3,100–3,400 cm–1, which represent an NH2 group. Although
these two peaks could represent separated carbonyl and primary amine functional groups, the
broadness of the C=O peak (just as in the case of a carboxylic acid) suggests that the two func-
tional groups are connected to each other to form a primary amide (CONH2).
l
Each of these molecules contains a C=O group, so each should have a stretch at around 1,700
cm–1. However, ester C=O stretches, such as the ester C=O in methyl acetate, absorb at slightly
higher wavenumbers than other carbonyls between 1,735–1,750 cm–1, distinguishing this func-
tional group from the others. Carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, can be distinguished
because of the additional OH stretch not present in the other molecules. You can distinguish
ketones and aldehydes from each other because aldehydes, such as acetaldehyde, have a 
C-H attached to the carbonyl that absorbs at about 2,800 cm–1, which ketones lack.

uclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool in the
chemist’s arsenal for determining the structure of unknown compounds. NMR can
help you figure out the precise molecular structure of whatever organic stuff you’re looking
at. You’ve probably already seen a few NMR spectra — lovely little haystacks of peaks and
squiggles and numbers that you’re supposed to able to convert into a chemical structure on
an exam. NMR is an instrumental method that collects information about the chemical envi-
ronments around each nucleus in a molecule. In carbon (13C) NMR, you look at the chemical
environments of the carbon nuclei; much more common, however, is proton ( 1H) NMR, in
which you look at the chemical environments of the hydrogen nuclei. Seeing the chemical
environments of each of the protons in your molecule allows you to piece together the
structure.
Because of the complexity of this instrumental method, this chapter takes a gradual approach
for getting you up to speed with solving chemical structures using NMR spectroscopy. First,
I include problems to help you see how each part of the spectrum works and how you can
extract all the information from that part of the spectrum. Next, you go over the meaning of
the chemical shift, integration, and coupling. After you see how to extract information about a
molecule from those pieces of data, you put it all together to decipher entire unknown struc-
tures given a spectrum (or multiple spectra).
Seeing Molecular Symmetry
NMR spectroscopy reports on the different chemical environments of the nuclei. You may
expect every nucleus in a molecule to give rise to a different signal in the NMR spectrum. In
this case, a molecule with five hydrogens would give rise to five signals in the 1H NMR spec-
trum, and a molecule with six hydrogens would give rise to six signals, and so forth. This is
sometimes the case, but as far as NMR is concerned, nuclei that are in identical chemical
environments are indistinguishable.

Identical chemical environments means two nuclei are attached to exactly the same types of
atoms in the same order. The simplest example is H2, in which both hydrogens are attached
to one H. A more common example is that, in general, two hydrogens attached to the same
carbon are in identical chemical environments. Two (or more) nuclei that exist in identical
chemical environments give rise to a single peak in the NMR spectrum, making these nuclei
chemically equivalent.
A lot of times, chemical equivalence arises because of molecular symmetry. In a molecule
that has a plane of symmetry, one side of the molecule is the mirror image of the other side,
and any atom on one side of the symmetry plane has a twin on the other side of the plane in
exactly the same chemical environment. These two chemically equivalent atoms show up as
a single peak in the NMR spectrum.
Spotting planes of symmetry in molecules is important so you can determine how many sig-
nals a molecule should show in the NMR spectrum. In many cases, symmetry can distinguish
two very similar molecules from each other simply because they give a different number of
signals.
To figure out how many signals should appear for molecules with molecular symmetry,
follow these steps:
1. Identify any mirror planes in the molecule.
Draw each plane of symmetry into the molecule to make the situation clearer.
2. Count the number of chemically unique atoms.
Each atom on one side of the plane has an identical twin on the other side, so only one
of these should be counted.

How many signals would you see in the

A.
Two signals in both the 13C and 1H NMR.
The dotted lines indicate two planes of
symmetry in the molecule. Therefore, the
top side of the molecule is chemically
equivalent to the bottom side, and the
right-hand side is chemically equivalent
to the left-hand side. Therefore, all the
methyl group hydrogens (CH3’s) are
chemically equivalent, and the two CH’s
are also chemically equivalent. Similar
reasoning shows that all the methyl car-
bons and the methine (CH) carbons are
also chemically equivalent. Therefore,
you see only two signals in the 13C NMR
spectrum, one from the methyl carbons
and one from the methine carbon, and
you likewise see two signals in the 1H
NMR spectrum from the methyl hydro-
gens and the methine hydrogens.

Working with Chemical Shifts,
Integration, and Coupling
In this section, you practice working with the individual parts of an NMR spectrum:
 Chemical shift: This is where the peaks show up on a spectrum. The higher the chemical
shift of a peak (larger ppm value), the more deshielded that nucleus is. In most cases,
deshielding is caused by adjacent electronegative atoms such as O, N, and halogens.
Benzene ring hydrogens are also deshielded by the magnetic field of the circulating elec-
trons in the aromatic ring, which is termed diamagnetic anisotropy for those of you who
like naming things (scary word, though, huh?).
 Integration: Integration is those little s-shaped curves over the peaks. The height of
these curves gives information about the relative number of hydrogens in that peak.
A peak that has an integration that’s twice as high as the integration of another peak
means that the first peak represents twice as many protons as the other peak.
 Coupling: This is the way some peaks split into a number of different lines. The
number of lines a peak splits into depends on the number of hydrogen neighbors the
peak has, following the n + 1 rule. Thus, a proton with one hydrogen neighbor splits
into two lines (a doublet), a proton with two hydrogen neighbors splits into three lines
(a triplet), and so forth.

When solving a structure, knowing the absolute number of hydrogens each peak represents is a
very important piece of information. You can typically assume that all the hydrogens in the mol-
ecule show up in the 1H NMR. Comparing the heights of the integration curves gives you the rel-
ative number of hydrogens in each peak. Unfortunately, it doesn’t tell you exactly how many
hydrogens each peak represents. Here’s how to get the actual number of hydrogens:
1. Determine the heights of the integration curves.
Sometimes you can eyeball it, but if that proves difficult, use a ruler. Measure the
height of each curve, from where the curve is flat up to where it goes flat again.
2. Divide each of the heights by the smallest height to get the relative ratio.
The ratio of heights, from left to right, represents the ratio of hydrogens in each peak.
3. Find the sum of the relative ratios.
4. Compare this sum to the total number of hydrogens in the molecule.
If the numbers match, the relative ratio equals the actual number of hydrogens in each
peak. If not, divide the total number of hydrogens by the sum of the ratio; then multiply
this answer by each number in the relative ratio to find the actual number of hydrogens.
For example, suppose you have two peaks in a proton NMR, and one has an integration
curve that’s twice as large as the other, in a 2:1 height ratio. From the formula, you
know there are six hydrogens in the molecule. So you take this number (6) divided by
the sum of the ratios (2 + 1 = 3), which gives you 2. Then multiply the relative ratio of
2:1 by 2 to get the absolute number of hydrogens in each peak, which is 4:2. The taller
peak represents the signal from four hydrogens, and the smaller peak represents the
signal from two hydrogens.

The following integration curves represent four signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of a molecule
with the formula C24H24O3. How many hydrogens does each peak represent?
Solve It
In this problem, the first thing you want to do is get the relative heights of the integration curves.
You can use a ruler. In this case, the heights are 12:24:24:36 mm, which, dividing by the smallest
height (12), gives you a relative ratio of 1:2:2:3. The sum of these relative ratios is 8 (1 + 2 + 2 + 3).
Because the formula includes eight hydrogens, the relative ratio is also the absolute number of
hydrogens in each peak. Thus, the left-most peak represents 1H; the second and third peaks, 2H;
and the last, 3H.
Q.
Rank the hydrogens in the shown mole-
cule from highest chemical shift (1) to
lowest chemical shift (3) in the 1H NMR
spectrum. Also, rank the carbons from
highest chemical shift to lowest.
A.
Hydrogens adjacent to electronegative
elements (such as chlorine) come at
higher chemical shift than hydrogens far-
ther away from electronegative atoms;
likewise for carbons, so the carbon
attached to the chlorine comes at highest
chemical shift and the carbon farthest
away comes at the lowest chemical shift.

Q.
Predict the coupling (number of lines)
each peak would split into for the pro-
tons a, b, and c using the n + 1 rule.
A.
A = doublet, b = septet, c = doublet.
Follow the n + 1 rule. The two methyl
(CH3) group protons, a, are in identical
chemical environments because both
methyls are attached to the same carbon.
These protons are adjacent to one hydro-
gen, so you’d expect the signal for these
protons to split into two lines, or a dou-
blet, following the n + 1 rule. For the
methine (CH) proton b, there are six

Putting It All Together: Solving for Unknown
Structures Using Spectroscopy
To solve unknown structures using NMR spectroscopy, I recommend a systematic strategy.
Follow these steps — at least at first while you’re still trying to get your bearings:
1. Determine the degrees of unsaturation in the molecule to see how many rings or
double bonds are present.
Use the following formula, where C is the number of carbons and H is the number of
hydrogens:
DOU = (2C + 2 – H) ÷ 2
Double bonds and rings count as one degree of unsaturation, and triple bonds count as
two degrees. Remember the following conversions: Add 1H to the formula for halogens,
subtract 1H from the formula for nitrogens, and ignore oxygens.
2. Look at the IR (if you’re given one) to see the major functional groups present in the
molecule.
Chapter 15 discusses IR spectroscopy.

3. Determine from the integration how many hydrogens each peak represents, and use
that information to determine the structure of all the fragments of the molecule.
Table 16-1 shows a list of the common fragments. (See the preceding section for info on
finding the number of hydrogens each peak represents.)

A.
Tackle the problem stepwise. First, determine the degrees of unsaturation. You have four carbons
and eight hydrogens, so plugging your numbers into the DOU formula gives you DOU = (2 × 4 + 2 –
8) ÷ 2 = (8 + 2 – 8) ÷ 2 = 1. There’s one degree of unsaturation, suggesting the molecule has either
one ring or one double bond.
Next, look at the IR spectrum to determine any major functional groups. The peak that should
stand out to you is the large peak at 1,740 cm–1, indicating a carbonyl (C=O) group. Furthermore,
1,740 cm–1 is quite high for a carbonyl group (aldehydes and ketone C=O stretches absorb
~1,700–1,715 cm–1). This high carbonyl frequency indicates an ester carbonyl stretch, which
absorbs at higher wavenumbers than aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids. Because an ester
contains the C=O double bond, this double bond accounts for the one degree of unsaturation in
the molecule; thus, the molecule can’t contain any other double bonds or rings.
Then determine the fragments of the molecule. Look at the integrations to determine the number
of hydrogens each peak represents. The relative integration ratio, from left to right, is 2:3:3. To get
the actual number of hydrogens that each peak represents, sum the relative ratios, which gives
you 8 (2 + 3 + 3). Because the molecular formula includes eight hydrogens, the relative ratio and
the absolute ratio of hydrogens are the same. Thus, from left to right, the peaks represent 2H, 3H,
and 3H, respectively. Next, find the fragments. The 2H peak most likely represents a CH2 fragment,
and the two 3H peaks most likely represent two CH3 fragments (see Table 16-1). You already know
the molecule contains the ester fragment. In this case, the sum of the atoms in the fragments
matches the molecular formula, so you’re good to go.
Now piece together the fragments in a way that makes sense with the chemical shifts and the peak
coupling. In this case, you have only two options (A and B) for piecing the fragments together so
that each carbon has four bonds. It comes down to distinguishing these two structures. If the
structure were A, you’d expect the CH2 fragment to have the highest chemical shift because it’s
directly bonded to the oxygen. If the structure were B, you’d expect one of the methyl (CH3)
groups to have the highest chemical shift as a result of being directly bonded to the oxygen. In
this case, the highest chemical shift is the CH2 fragment, so the structure is A.
Finally, double check your structure to make sure everything makes sense. The peak with the
highest chemical shift should be a quartet (because it’s adjacent to three other hydrogens), and it
should integrate for 2H. Check! You should see a peak at a lower chemical shift that integrates for
3H and is a triplet. Check! Finally, there should be another peak that integrates for 3H and is a sin-
glet (because it has no neighboring hydrogens). Check! Looks like this structure’s in the bag.

Answer Key
The following are the answers to the practice questions presented in this chapter.
a
The molecule has two planes of symmetry. As a result, there are two signals in the 1H NMR and
three signals in the 13C NMR.
b
This molecule has one plane of symmetry. Therefore, there are two signals in the 1H NMR spec-
trum and three signals in the 13C NMR spectrum.
c
This molecule has no planes of symmetry. Therefore, you see one signal for each carbon (five
of them) and each set of hydrogens (four of them).
d
Cyclohexane has three vertical planes of symmetry. Therefore, every carbon and hydrogen is
chemically equivalent. One peak appears in both the 13C NMR and 1H NMR spectra of this
molecule.
e
The relative ratio is 1:2:2:3, which adds up to 8. Because 24 hydrogens are in the molecule, you
multiply this relative ratio by 3. From left to right, the peaks thus represent 3H, 6H, 6H, and 9H.

Fluorine is a more electronegative atom than chlorine (electronegativity increases as you go up and
to the right on the periodic table). Thus, the proton on the carbon containing the fluorines has a
higher chemical shift than the proton attached to the carbon containing the chlorine atoms. Similarly,
in the 13C NMR, the carbon with the attached fluorines would have a higher chemical shift than the
carbon with the less electronegative chlorines attached.
h
Protons a are adjacent to two other protons, so the signal for these protons is split into three lines
following the n + 1 rule (called a triplet). Protons b are adjacent to five hydrogens, so these split into
approximately a six lines (called a sextet). Protons c are adjacent to two other protons, so these split
into three lines (another triplet).
i
Protons a are adjacent to no other protons, so they don’t split at all, following the n + 1 rule (where n
= 0). A peak that isn’t split is called a singlet. Protons b are adjacent to three proton neighbors, so the
peak for these protons splits into four lines (called a quartet). Protons c are adjacent to two other
protons, so this peak splits into three lines (a triplet).
j
Benzene rings are a special case. The pi electrons in benzene are induced to circulate around the ring
when placed in a magnetic field (like a big magnet used in an NMR experiment). Anytime you have a
moving charge (such as moving electrons), it creates a magnetic field of its own. In this case, the
small magnetic field created by the moving pi electrons in the benzene ring reinforces the external
magnetic field for protons attached to the benzene ring. The net result is that the protons attached to
the ring are deshielded and come at a higher chemical shift as a result (this effect is termed diamag-
netic anisotropy).

Insertion of the formula C4H9Cl into the formula for degrees of unsaturation shows that the
structure has zero degrees of unsaturation, indicating that there are no double bonds or rings.
Recall that with halides, you add hydrogen to the molecular formula, so you pretend the for-
mula is C4H10 when determining the degrees of unsaturation.
This problem is interesting because you see just a single peak at ~1.5 ppm. Thus, you can
assume that this peak represents all nine hydrogens in the formula. From Table 16-1, you see
that a peak with nine hydrogens generally indicates three chemically equivalent methyl groups
(CH3’s), and it often indicates a tertiary butyl group. Indeed, summing up the atoms in the three
CH3 fragments and the chlorine leaves one carbon remaining (which can’t have a proton on it
because there’s no signal for it in the 1H NMR). There’s only one way to combine these frag-
ments, which gives you tertiary butyl chloride.
l
Plugging the formula C10H14 into the DOU equation gives you four degrees of unsaturation. Thus,
there must be some combination of rings and double bonds that equals four. Typically, four or
more degrees of unsaturation is a big tipoff for a benzene ring in the molecule because benzene
rings have four degrees of unsaturation (three for the three double bonds and one for the ring).
You can confirm this by looking at the 1H NMR for peaks in the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm).
Indeed, you see a big haystack between 7–7.5 ppm, strongly suggesting a benzene ring.
Now use the NMR integration to find the fragments. After you whip out your ruler and get the
ratios (or eyeball it if you’re really, really good), you see that the ratio is 5:9 for the two peaks
(you may have been tempted to go with 1:2, but the sum of these, 3, is not a divisor of 14, the
number of hydrogens you have in the formula — a big clue that this can’t be right). The fact
that the aromatic protons integrate for five tells you that the benzene ring is substituted one
time. Finally, the peak that integrates for 9H is probably three symmetrical CH3 groups (and
very probably, a tertiary butyl group). Summing the ring atoms (C6H5) and the three methyl
groups (C3H9) leaves one carbon missing.

There’s only one way to combine the fragments that gives a structure with carbons that all
have four bonds:
Finally, double check the structure. You should see peaks for aromatic protons that integrate
for 5H, as well as a singlet that integrates for 9H. Check!
m
Plugging C4H10O into the DOU formula gives you zero degrees of unsaturation (you ignore
oxygen). Thus, this molecule can’t contain any rings or double bonds.
Now look at the IR spectrum to determine the functional groups. The most glaring peak in the
IR spectrum is the distinct OH peak at 3,400 cm–1. You see a couple of small peaks that look like
they may be double bond or aromatic protons — but of course, with no degrees of unsatura-
tion, the molecule can’t contain any rings or double bonds (part of the art of interpreting these
spectra is to extract the important information and ignore the red herrings).
Next, use the NMR integration to find the fragments. Breaking out your ruler if you need to, you
find the relative ratio of the integrations from left to right to be 1:1:2:3:3 for the five peaks. The
sum of this relative ratio is 10, which is the same as the number of hydrogens in the formula, so
the relative ratio of protons is also the absolute ratio (from left to right, 1H, 1H, 2H, 3H, and 3H).
Next, determine the fragments. You already know the OH fragment that you deduced from the
IR spectrum. Of course, you want to eliminate that proton from the NMR so you don’t assign it
to something else. Generally, OH protons don’t couple, so they give rise to peaks that are sin-
glets. You see only one singlet, which integrates for 1H, and that’s the peak at 2.5 ppm. The
other 1H peak is at 3.7 ppm, and it’s probably a CH fragment. The 2H peak is probably a CH2
fragment, and the two 3H peaks are probably two CH3 fragments. Summing up all the atoms in
the fragments adds up to the molecular formula, so you know you’re not missing any atoms.
You have two options for putting the fragments together so that all the carbons are bonded
four times. You can eliminate one of the possibilities (A) immediately because this structure
has two chemically equivalent CH3 groups, which should give rise to only one signal. You see
two CH3 peaks in the NMR spectrum, so that can’t be the right structure.

Chapter 16: Putting Molecules under the Magnet: NMR Spectroscopy
Some of the couplings are difficult to read from the spectra. This happens on exams, so get
used to having the coupling not always 100 percent clear (although in real life, you can zoom in
on the coupling using computer tools). From left to right, the left methyl group (of B) should
give a signal that’s a doublet that integrates for 3H. Next, you should get a peak (which would
give a multiplet) that integrates for 1H. Then the OH peak would give a singlet that integrates for
1H. The CH2 group should give a multiplet (pentet) that integrates for 2H. And finally, the right-
most CH3 should be a triplet that integrates for 3H. As best you can tell with the fuzzy coupling
data, everything checks out. And that’s a wrap!
n
The DOU formula indicates that you have five degrees of unsaturation in this molecule. This is a
big tip-off that you have an aromatic ring in the molecule, which would eat up four of those
degrees of unsaturation.
The IR spectrum contains a big fat carbonyl peak at ~1,700 cm–1. You possibly have some aro-
matic stretches (hard to tell because the spectrum’s so noisy), but you can easily confirm aro-
matics by looking at the NMR for stretches between 6.5–8.5 ppm. Sure enough, by Jove, you
have yourself an aromatic ring. The carbonyl (C=O) and the aromatic ring add up to five
degrees of unsaturation, which takes care of all the double bonds and rings in the molecule.
The relative integration is 2:2:3. The sum of this relative ratio (2 + 2 + 3 = 7) matches the
number of hydrogens in the molecular formula, so the peaks represent 2H, 2H, and 3H from left
to right on the NMR spectrum. You’ve already identified the peaks between 7–8 ppm as hydro-
gens on an aromatic ring. The presence of four aromatic hydrogens tells you that the ring is
substituted twice (because you’ve substituted two of the six benzene ring hydrogens with a
substituent). When an aromatic ring is substituted twice, the substituents can be ortho (adja-
cent to each other), meta (two carbons away), or para (on opposite sides of the ring). Only in
the para-substituted form would you get just two peaks as a result of the symmetry that bisects
the ring (it looks like a mini field goal in the aromatic region).
The 3H peak most likely represents a CH3 fragment. Adding up all the atoms in the fragments
shows that you’re missing a C, an O, and a Cl; the C and O are the C=O fragment that you identi-
fied earlier in the IR spectrum. Putting the fragments together leads to the following proposed
structure:
A quick check of the structure shows that everything is consistent with the spectral data. The
CH3 should be a singlet that’s downfield (higher chemical shift) as a result of being adjacent to
the C=O group, and it integrates for 3H. And there should be two peaks in the aromatic region
of the spectrum, each of which should integrate for 2H. Check!

The formula C9H10O has five degrees of unsaturation.
The IR shows a carbonyl stretch and aromatic stretches (little bumps at 1,800–2,000 cm–1). The
aromatics are confirmed by inspecting the NMR and observing peaks between 7–8 ppm.
The integration is 2:3:2:3, which adds up to the number of hydrogens in the molecular formula;
thus, from left to right, the peaks represent 2H:3H:2H:3H. Assigning the fragments, there are five
aromatic protons, indicating a monosubstituted benzene ring. The 2H peak probably represents
a CH2 fragment, and the 3H peak probably represents a CH3 fragment.
Putting the fragments together leads to the following two possible structures, labeled A and B.
So how do you determine which is the right structure? In the left-most structure, you’d expect
the CH2 group and the CH3 group to give singlets in the NMR (because they have no hydrogen
neighbors). However, the spectrum clearly shows that the peaks are coupled. Therefore, you
can eliminate A as a possibility.
Now double check the proposed structure. The proposed structure B should give peaks for aro-
matic protons that integrate for 5H. Check! The CH2 peak should be downfield because it’s adja-
cent to the C=O group, should integrate for 2H, and should be split into a quartet (because it
has three hydrogen neighbors). Check! And the CH3 group should be further upfield (lower
chemical shift) because it’s farther from the C=O group, should integrate for 3H, and should
split into a triplet (it has hydrogen neighbors). Check!
p
This is an interesting (that is, tricky) problem because you don’t get a molecular formula. You
do get a mass spec, though. The big clue in the mass spec is the two peaks of equal intensity
two mass units apart. This is a big giveaway for a bromine in the molecule (see Chapter 15)
because bromine has two equally abundant isotopes, 79Br and 81Br. Subtracting 81 mass units
(the weight of the larger Br isotope) from the higher mass isotope peak (124) gives you 43.
This is how much mass is left on the molecule after you lose the bromine. A good way to get an
approximate number of carbons from a mass spec is to divide by 14, the weight of a CH2 unit.
This gives you ~3, so if you have three carbons (12 × 3 = 36), you need 7 hydrogens to make the
weight 43. Therefore, the tentative formula is C3H7Br, which has two possible structures.
The left-most possibility has no symmetry, so you should see three signals in the 13C NMR. In
contrast, the right-most structure has a plane of symmetry, so you should see only two signals
in the 13C NMR. In fact, the spectrum shows only two signals, so the right-hand structure is the
correct one.

The spectrum of this molecule should show three peaks. The peak with the highest chemical
shift is the one closest to the electronegative chlorine atom, followed by the second-closest CH2
unit, with the CH3 group at the lowest chemical shift.
Next, determine the coupling. The peak with the highest chemical shift integrates for 2H and
splits into a triplet. The peak at a lower chemical shift (the adjacent CH2) integrates for 2H and
splits into a multiplet (approximately a sextet). Finally, the peak at lowest chemical shift is a
triplet that integrates for 3H.

In this molecule, you should see five peaks because a symmetry plane bisects the ring, making
the two sides of the ring chemically equivalent. Carboxylic acid protons (COOH) absorb around
12 ppm, are always singlets, and integrate for 1H. The two aromatic proton signals would
absorb between 7–8 ppm and would both be doublets (because they’re each adjacent to one
hydrogen), and each would integrate for 2H. Next, the CH2 attached to the ring would absorb
around 3 ppm, be a quartet, and integrate for 2H. Lastly, the CH3 signal would be farthest
upfield (around 1ppm), split into a triplet, and integrate for 3H.

you made the mistakes and correct those mistakes, the ideas become engrained into your
bones.
Reading the material is a good idea, but after a while, your brain reservoir fills and all the
info that follows starts pouring over the dam. You soon forget any material you haven’t prac-
ticed. That’s a problem, because organic chemistry builds on itself, using information that’s
taught at the beginning of the course as a foundation for the new material. It’s not like a his-
tory class, where if you didn’t understand the culture of Australopithecus, you can still figure
out the ancient Romans.
In organic chemistry, if you don’t understand the basics of bonding, for example, then you’re
really sandbagged when you get to reactions, because the text and practice problems assume
that you understand bonding. Of course, you can prevent all this trouble by working the
problems.

Unfortunately, one of the most common ways that students “practice problems” is by read-
ing the solutions manual. Similarly, I tried to “practice piano” by listening to concertos. That
didn’t work out for me, I’m afraid, and for those of you who work problems by reading the
solutions guide — well, let me just suggest that it won’t work out too well for you, either.
Regrettably, there’s no substitute for a few hours spent with the pencil, taking the time to
honestly work the problems. In this class, lazy students lose, and the students who work
hard (like you) win.
Thou Shalt Memorize Only What Thou Must
The rumors are true — organic chemistry involves some memorization, particularly at the
beginning. For example, you have to commit rules of nomenclature and functional groups to
memory. The problem comes when you try to memorize everything. This task is fruitless,
impossible, and a waste of time. You can’t memorize your way through organic chemistry.
You have to understand the concepts and be able to apply those concepts to really succeed.
A professor can write any of millions of structures on an exam, and you can’t possibly hope
to memorize them all. You really need to understand the concepts to be able to apply what
you know to structures you’ve never seen before. The concepts presented in the first couple
chapters are particularly important because they lay the groundwork for the rest of organic
chemistry. By working problems (honestly), you can see how to apply the concepts in
organic chemistry to new systems and problem types.
Thou Shalt Understand Thy Mechanisms
This commandment is a specific extension of the preceding one. Memorizing what products
come out of a reaction only gives you a limited understanding of that reaction. If you can
draw the mechanism of that reaction, however, you can really understand how that reaction
works and know exactly how the starting material is converted into product. I recommend
two levels of knowledge for each reaction:
 Be able to quickly give the products of the reaction.
 Know the mechanism for each reaction so you understand how that reaction happens.
Thou Shalt Sleep at Night and Not in Class
Many students exercise their freedom as college students to sleep in class. This isn’t your
typical sleeping in class, though (although of course some students do physically fall asleep).
Many students seem to sleep with their eyes open, like horses, sitting in a sort of trance-like
hypnosis.
In truth, after a couple of weeks, many students in the classes I attend turn into a group of
brain-dead zombies, mere scribes who occasionally scribble down notes off the board with-
out giving the ideas in them a second thought. Their brains are powered off, they aren’t
learning, and they’re wasting their time. Don’t let this happen to you! (Following the next
commandment may help with this.)

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Thou Shalt Read Ahead Before Class
One of the secrets to success in organic chemistry is to read the material before you go to
class. Admittedly, keeping up with even a very good professor in class is difficult, simply
because the material comes so quickly. But if you’ve read the material beforehand, you may
find that you understand much more in class than you ever did before (even if you didn’t
understand it all when you read). In doing so, you used your time efficiently because you
didn’t squander precious class time brainlessly copying down notes off the board without
understanding a bit.
Working the problems after class and reading the material before class are the two single
most important pieces of advice I can give you for doing well in organic chemistry.
Thou Shalt Not Fall Behind
Aside from not working problems in organic chemistry, the biggest source of trouble for stu-
dents is falling behind. Winemaking has a term called the Angel’s Share, the portion of wine
that’s mysteriously lost from the barrel each year the wine ages. In organic chemistry, there’s
a similar Angel’s Share after each exam, as more and more students magically disappear from
the classroom, never to be seen or heard from again (by their professors).
The biggest culprit is students’ falling behind. Catching up is nearly impossible. The course is
so fast-paced and the textbook is so large that after you fall behind, you have to devote twice
the time studying to get back to speed. New material assumes you understand what was
already covered. In other words, if you’re behind, you won’t be able to figure out what your
professor is talking about in class today until you’ve gone back and relearned the old material.
When a student asks how much he or she should be studying, I make the following recom-
mendation: Read the material that’s going to be covered in the next class period the day
before. After your professor finishes covering a chapter, start to work on the problems from
that chapter. That means that every day, you should work problems from the previous chap-
ter and begin reading the next chapter. If that seems like a lot of work, well, it is! The success-
ful organic student studies, on average, every day for an hour. To make that commitment,
you have to take charge of your own education.
Thou Shalt Know How Thou Learnest Best
People master concepts in different ways. Some people are visual learners, finding that they
understand best by making diagrams and charts that connect the material. Others are audi-
tory learners, gathering information best by listening quietly to a lecture. Some people study
well in groups, whereas others are more productive working alone.
To make your studying as productive as possible, know how you learn the best. If you know
that it’s in groups, make it a priority at the beginning of the semester to organize a group
studying session. Work best alone? Forget the groups and take a stroll to the bottom floor of
the library. If you know that chemistry is just not your thing, find a tutor as early as possible
in the semester so you don’t commit the unforgivable sin of falling behind.

Chapter 17: The Ten Commandments of Organic Chemistry

Thou Shalt Not Skip Class
This commandment of not skipping class is kind of like the Biblical commandment of not
killing people — kind of a no-brainer, right? But apparently it’s not for some students,
because a good percentage of the class doesn’t attend class after the first couple weeks.
I know dragging yourself out of bed is difficult some days, but a good professor can explain
the material better than a book ever can. You can ask questions in class, and some profes-
sors even slip hints about what’ll be on exams. Even if they don’t slip hints overtly, what 
they choose to cover in class is the biggest hint of all. But if you don’t attend, you’ll miss
those hints.
Thou Shalt Ask Questions
Please, please, do ask questions. You may find that many students in the class have your
exact question but were too afraid to pipe up about it for fear they’d look foolish. Keep in
mind that some teachers have been giving lectures for many years (or decades), and occa-
sionally they lose perspective on what students comprehend at that point.
Thou Shalt Keep a Positive Outlook
Keeping a positive outlook on the class can benefit you. It makes studying a lot easier, for one
thing. Secondly, organic chemistry really does change the way you look at the world. After
the class, you can see why carrots are orange and what plastics, polymers, and drugs look
like on the molecular level. You’ll have the tools to make compounds the world has never
seen before, and you’ll also have the foundation for understanding how biology really works,
because biochemistry is essentially the organic chemistry that occurs in living systems. With
the right attitude, organic chemistry can actually be quite fun. And you can brag to your
friends that you mastered a difficult subject, which has to be at least as impressive as climb-
ing a tall mountain (and less dangerous, too).

Ten Tips for Acing Orgo Exams
In This Chapter
 Seeing the keys to smoking your next orgo exam
 Maximizing your studying success
F
or some people, taking exams isn’t that big of a deal. However, for others, the thought of
taking an exam makes their hands clammy and their brows sweat. And some individuals
may even start to have a minor panic attack. Regardless of whether you worry about exams,
this chapter gives some concrete tips on how you can improve your chances of success on
organic chemistry exams.
Scan and Answer the Easy Questions First
To make the best use of your time during the exam when you first get your test, scan the
exam quickly. You don’t need to answer the exam in order, and by scanning, you can deter-
mine which problems are easiest. You can then tackle them first. Why?
 By answering all the easy questions first, you make sure you at least earn all the easy
points. If you run out of time, you want to leave only really hard questions unanswered,
the ones you may not have earned full credit on anyway, not some cakewalk problems
you could’ve answered in your sleep.
 By starting on something you can do easily, you break the so-called exam block, the
quite-frequent occurrence when students look at a tough first question on the exam
and their minds freeze so they can’t solve any of the problems. Getting in the flow of
working problems, even if they’re easy, lets your mind warm up so you can return to
the state of mind that you were in when you worked problems before.
A common sight at the end of an organic exam is to see students scribbling answers furiously
and the professor hollering for everyone to turn them in. That’s because a lot of students don’t
finish their exams in the allotted time. Can there be any worse feeling than not doing as well as
you liked, not because you didn’t know the material but because you didn’t finish quickly?
Read All of Every Question
As you work your way through the exam, make sure you take your time and read every ques-
tion, all the way through. Doing so only takes a couple extra seconds. This tip may seem like

a no-brainer, but there’s always at least one exam during the course where a large percentage
of the students lose points simply because they didn’t read the whole question.
For example, a question may state, “Determine the products of the following reactions. Then
label the nucleophile and electrophile.” Half the class, seeing the reaction, may write the
products and go on their merry way, never indicating what the nucleophile or the elec-
trophile was because they failed to read the whole question. They then lose half the credit,
even though they probably knew the answer. Don’t let this happen to you.
Set Aside Time Each Day to Study
Each student is different and each class is different, but 45 minutes to an hour is probably
the amount of time you should expect to study organic chemistry each night if you plan on
getting an A or a B. That’s the bad news. The good news is that anyone who’s smart enough
to pass a class in general chemistry is smart enough to get an A or at worst a B in organic
chemistry, as long as they’re willing to put in the work.
My favorite motto for the class is “it’s not so much hard as it is hard work.” In this class, the
lazy students (no matter how smart) get blown away by those students who work really hard.
Form a Study Group
To improve how you do on your next exam, ask some classmates to form a study group. A lot
of people work better in groups. Study groups are good for a couple reasons:
 A study group allows you and other students to discuss concepts, which can help
clarify them. Sometimes a fellow student can explain a concept to you much better
than a textbook (or even your professor) can. Or you can explain a concept to the
others in your study group, and there’s no better way of reinforcing your own knowl-
edge than by teaching what you know to someone else.
 A study group is a good way to force you to study. If you make a commitment to meet-
ing with a group every day, you’re less likely to blow it off than if you were studying by
yourself. It’s kind of like getting an exercise partner.
You can make a study group from lab partners or studious students sitting next to you in class.
In rare cases, a professor can help arrange study sections with sign-up sheets. To ensure 
everyone can contribute, I suggest keeping the study group on the small side, in the range of
three to six people.
Get Old Exams
One of the easiest ways to study comes from practicing with old exams your professor has
given (if they’re available). You can get insight into the sort of questions that your professor
likes to ask, and you can also get a feel for the depth of knowledge and level of detail that
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

you’re expected to know. Some professors like to ask a lot of straightforward problems;
others prefer to give fewer, more challenging problems. The best way to find out is to check
out what they’ve asked before.
Make Your Answers Clear by Using Structures
The words of the organic chemist are structures. Don’t forget this mantra on your exams, and
don’t write long-winded explanations when a simple structure suffices. When solving the
problems on the exam, follow the motto “show, don’t tell.” Keep your answers clear and con-
cise by using structures.
For example, if you’re asked to explain why one molecule is more stable than another, you
can show how one compound has more resonance structures than another much more
clearly than you can with a paragraph of text. Not only that, but using structures saves time —
drawing a structure is a lot faster than writing a paragraph.
Don’t Try to Memorize Your Way Through
Although organic chemistry does have some memorization involved, such as the rules for
naming molecules and the steps in determining R and S stereochemistry, don’t make the
common mistake of trying to memorize your way through the course, which is a futile and
impossible venture. If you’ve memorized a reaction, for example, but don’t really understand
it, it’s very easy to get tripped up on an exam if a question is asked in a different way or on a
different structure than the one you committed to memory. Also, concepts that you master
at the beginning of the course are built on as the course goes on, so you start digging a hole
quite quickly if you’ve memorized but don’t really understand the material.
Work a Lot of Problems
There’s an old saying that the best way to master organic chemistry is with a pencil. You’re
most likely to remember concepts when you’ve practiced problems that apply those con-
cepts. Also, the more problems you practice, the faster you get at solving problems, making
it less likely that you’ll run out of time on an exam. This advice may be the most important
that I can give you. Practice as many problems as you can get your hands on. (Working the
problems in this book is a good start.)
Get Some Sleep the Night Before
In order to do well on your next orgo exam, you need to make sure you’re fresh and not
fatigued, stressed, and strung out on caffeine. Go to bed at a decent time the night before.
Pulling all-nighters before orgo exams seems to be very popular, but I strongly advise against
this practice.
327
Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Acing Orgo Exams

A lot of times, information that’s “learned” in cram sessions is soon forgotten. Even if you’re
fortunate enough not to forget it before you take the exam, you’ll have to relearn the material
again for the final. It’s better to study a little every day and work the concepts into your
bones so you never forget it.
Recognize Red Herrings
Many professors don’t put red herrings into exams, but I’ve met enough who do, so you need
to be able to identify them when you see them. Red herrings are problems that have many
details that are unimportant to determining the answer. These questions are often designed
simply to test your confidence. A lot of times, this distracter gives you a straightforward
reaction on a complicated-looking structure. You can often identify these problems because
they usually contain large paragraphs of text in the question.
For example, a question may ask the following:
Question 3 (15 pts). Angosterolongmoleculename is a fascinating and novel steroid that
was recently isolated from the udder of a rare breed of cow. Ten thousand pounds of
the bovine udder was ground up and extracted with chloroform to obtain just a few mil-
ligrams of the material (what an udder waste!). Samuel J. Snodgrass characterized the
molecule by NMR and IR spectroscopy. He converted the molecule into a derivative by
reacting the molecule with BH3 in THF, followed by the addition of peroxides. Give the
structure of the derivative.
A lot of the information in the problem is irrelevant, but it makes the problem look intimidat-
ing. If you get right down to it, though, this problem is just a simple reaction of an alkene,
provided you focus on the part of the molecule that’s going to change in the reaction.
